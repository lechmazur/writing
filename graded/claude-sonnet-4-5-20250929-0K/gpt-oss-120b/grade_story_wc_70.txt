<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Mara's trait of involuntary truthfulness is labeled but never constrains or enables a choice with visible cost on the page. Her motivation to preserve wonder is told rather than tested through contradictory impulses; she simply enacts it without friction. The drone and matchbox function as plot devices that Mara observes and activates, but no internal conflict forces her to choose between competing desires. The confessional quality attributed to her bell-ringing never dramatizes a moment where truth-telling forecloses an option or charges the ending.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The orientation test fails: who, where, and when are submerged in atmosphere for the first ~200 words, forcing the reader to infer that Mara is at the tower after a blackout, but the spatial and temporal anchors remain vague ("tonight," "small office," "tower's core" appear without prior grounding). The closure—the echo returning—is asserted rather than earned; the matchbox riddle solves itself via glyphs with no prior causal linkage or cost. The lens reads as accumulative/atmospheric, but the ending delivers expository realization ("an echo...was the city's own voice") without a decisive change or felt price. The drone's emergence and the glyphs' answer appear convenient rather than caused by Mara's prior choices.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The lightning collection tower and its amber veins provide vivid sensory anchors, and the matchbox physically constrains the final beat by requiring Mara to turn the key. Spatial choreography is loose—"inside the keeper's small office," "tower's core," "hidden compartment"—but functional. The "nectar dusk" atmosphere saturates description yet remains external; it does not shift under pressure or reflect Mara's urgency. The micro-setting (matchbox, lacquer box, key) charges the closure image, lifting the score above mid-band despite the delayed spatial grounding.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving wonder—is signaled early but never tested by a choice that narrows options or imposes cost. The matchbox riddle and key appear as gifts that Mara accepts without friction; no reversal forces her to trade one value for another. The drone's return and the echo's "answer" arrive through passive receipt rather than protagonist agency. Coincidence resolves the hive failure without dramatized struggle, and the ending's ceremony is described rather than earned through tactical sacrifice or endurance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The theme of wonder versus routine emerges through specifics (bells, drones, amber light) rather than abstraction, and the echo concept offers a fresh angle on collective memory. However, the final paragraph moralizes directly: "wonder would never again be dimmed by routine" and "kept the toll honest, each ring a promise" are explicit thesis statements that replace scene pressure. The matchbox's riddle ("Echo") is clever but arrives as a solved puzzle without Mara wrestling with its implications, resulting in told rather than dramatized resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>POV remains stable in third-person limited, and Mara's perceptual signature emphasizes atmosphere and visual detail. However, diction drifts into elevated register ("candid toll keeper," "nectar dusk," "taste the silence") that reads more poetic than character-specific under pressure. The prose at the climax—"the glyphs rearranged themselves, spelling the answer"—externalizes discovery rather than filtering it through Mara's mind. No dialogue appears; interiority is sparse and declarative rather than embodied.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Overwriting saturates the text: nearly every sentence in the opening and closure beats layers figurative language ("lightning collection tower hummed with dormant energy," "nectar dusk," "honey from the sky") without pattern-teaching or payoff, triggering −0.6. Paraphrase loops appear: "Mara understood...the echo to be heard" restates prior material without added pressure. Template cadence runs in the final third: "The reveal...allowed her to fulfill..."; "The citizens...began to gather..."; "In the gentle hush...the city found..." (−0.5). Stock metaphors ("wound on the city's heart," "hidden fireworks") and synonym churn ("wonder," "spectacle," "miracle") reduce density. These artifacts touch the closure beat, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The combination of lightning-collection infrastructure, mechanical bee-hives, and a riddle-key setup is specific and non-obvious. However, the emotional arc—loss of wonder, quest to restore it—follows a familiar template without transformation through lived cost or moral calculus. The matchbox riddle and its glyphic answer feel imported for cleverness rather than integrated causally; the echo concept is fresh but arrives through convenience rather than Mara's choices. The "nectar dusk" tone and imagery offer texture but do not heighten stakes or risk.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Mara is present throughout and her motivation is stated, but her choices are passive: she reads the riddle aloud, turns the key, and tells the story afterward. No decision alters tactics or forecloses a path with cost. She observes the drone and glyphs rather than wrestling with a dilemma.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The lacquer box appears in the opening third, contains the matchbox at midpoint, and is sealed again in the final image, satisfying setup, development, and closure gates. It constrains the reveal by requiring Mara to open it and return the matchbox, and the final reprise reweights meaning ("knowing its secret would bloom when needed again"). However, the box itself is descriptive ("faint, oily sheen") rather than mechanically essential; the matchbox does the causal work.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The drone beehive failure is backstory that shapes the premise (months ago, buzzing silence) and the lone drone's return signals resolution, but the failure itself does not constrain Mara's on-page choices or force a tactical trade-off. It exists as theme and context rather than a live problem she must address through cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Involuntary truthfulness is labeled twice ("involuntarily truthful," "compelled to speak only the truth") but never constrains or enables an on-page action. Mara tells the story to passersby at the end, but no cost or friction arises from her inability to lie; the trait remains ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The reveal—opening the matchbox, reading the riddle, turning the key, and seeing the glyphs—drives the climactic beat and enables the tower's revival and the drone's return. It appears in the second third and shapes the closure image, satisfying development and payoff gates. However, the reveal is enacted passively (glyphs rearrange themselves) rather than through Mara's risk or cost, and the riddle's answer arrives conveniently.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The matchbox containing the cryptic riddle is introduced in the second third, its riddle read aloud triggers the glyphs, and it returns in the final beat when sealed again. It constrains the reveal by requiring interpretation and provides the key, satisfying development and payoff. However, the riddle solves itself via glyphs without Mara's struggle, and the matchbox could be replaced by any locked container without altering the logic.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The lightning collection tower frames the entire piece, houses the hidden compartment, and its revival (amber veins, glass rods) charges the closure image. It supplies the resource (the key compartment) that alters the outcome and shapes the final ceremony. Spatial details remain loose, but the tower's presence constrains Mara's action and reweights prior material at the end.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the city-wide blackout" anchors the opening and the phrase "when the city-wide blackout finally receded" signals the present moment, but elapsed time is vague ("months ago" for the hive failure, "tonight" for the tower's purpose). No live clock tightens decisions; the blackout is context rather than a pressure that alters tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to preserve wonder in routine is stated early ("sworn to preserve wonder in routine") and the ending asserts fulfillment ("allowed her to fulfill her motivation"), but no on-page choice dramatizes friction between this desire and a competing cost. The motivation is told rather than tested through contradictory impulses or sacrifice.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The "nectar dusk" tone saturates description throughout ("honeyed light," "amber veins," "electric nectar," "honey from the sky") and charges the final image with consistent atmosphere. However, the tone remains static rather than modulating with pressure; it does not shift between urgency and calm or reflect Mara's internal state under stress. The effect is decorative coherence without escalation.</comment>
