<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Mara is defined entirely through abstract labels ("precise," "ethically diligent") and meditative action without contradiction or visible internal friction. The story tells us she seeks "incremental absolution" and feels "quiet triumph," but no micro-choice reveals competing impulses or cost—she ascends, places the handle, whispers a promise, all in smooth succession. Embodied emotion is absent; we're told she "felt the weight of centuries lift" rather than shown bodily reaction under pressure. No meaningful change or renunciation forecloses a path with cost; the ending declares success without dramatized struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed: who Mara is and what she seeks emerge gradually through abstract phrasing rather than concrete early anchor (−0.4). The drive lens appears Accumulative/Textural (ritual layering, lyric repetition), but no meaningful tightening or deepening occurs—each paragraph restates the same ritual without escalation or reversal. Closure requires a Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with cost; here the pendulum resumes and Mara pledges to continue, a static affirmation without visible cost or foreclosed path. The final image ("next cracked gear") repeats the opening premise rather than reweighting it.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The obsidian ridge, bronze tower, and pendulum bob are vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (molten rose hue, salt-etched wood, metallic skin). However, setting remains postcard description; the ridge does not constrain Mara's choices or supply resources that alter outcome. The micro-setting (tower interior, pendulum cradle) is static backdrop rather than tactical pressure. Spatial choreography is clean and the tone supports the lyric frame, lifting the score to functional mid-band despite lack of choice constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—restoring "shared balance"—is abstract and never tested by on-page opposition or narrowing options. Mara faces no reversal, complication, or cost; the inscriptions work, the pendulum resumes, she pledges to continue. No tightening or deepening alters tactics or knowledge; each beat is a paraphrase of ritual success. Agency is assertion without renunciation or trade-off. Under any lens, pressure flatlines from opening to close.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Theme (incremental repair, human–tide harmony) is stated directly rather than emerging from conflict: "incremental absolution," "shared balance," "redemption." The final paragraph moralizes overtly: "the chorus of countless souls who dared to mend the world" (−0.6). The inscribed rake handle recurs but serves as symbolic ornament without constraining choice or charging closure with non-literal cost. No earned epiphany or resonant reweighting occurs; the ending restates the premise as thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Narrative distance is stable third-limited, and diction maintains elevated register throughout. However, perceptual signature is generic: Mara notices in catalogue fashion (ridge, tower, pendulum, inscriptions) without character-specific bias. Psychic distance never modulates with pressure; the same lyric cadence persists in ascent, ritual, and resolution. No POV leakage, but voice lacks specificity—any meditatively inclined protagonist could inhabit this register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: "incremental absolution" appears four times, "shared balance" thrice, "tiny inscriptions" / "inscriptions" nine times across adjacent beats without added meaning (−0.8). Template cadence runs: "She [verb]… She [verb]… She [verb]" in paragraphs 2, 11, 14 (−0.5). Register is elevated but repetitive; "searing reverie" and "ethically diligent" feel prompt-imported. Figurative language (obsidian "like ink," pendulum "like a bronze sentinel") is functional but stock. Momentum stalls in synonym churn ("fragment," "carving," "etching," "inscription") without propulsion. Artifacts touch multiple beats but not decisively the closure image, so baseline deductions apply in Q7 only.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The core premise—ritual repair of a metaphysical clock via inscribed tool—is imaginative in surface detail but executed as static meditation without transformation. The inscriptions succeed without friction, the pendulum resumes, the cycle continues; no turn reweights prior material in hindsight. Emotional template (solitary artisan seeks cosmic harmony) is familiar; specific details (obsidian, rake handle, tidal rhythm) dress the frame but do not synthesize a non-obvious stakes calculus. No bold risk heightens pressure or charges the final image with fresh implication.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>Mara is present throughout and performs the ritual, but her decisions do not create key turns—she ascends, places, whispers, watches, pledges in unbroken success. Observation and declaration dominate; no choice narrows options or alters tactics with cost. Present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The pendulum bob is handled in multiple beats (pause, cradle, trembling, resumed swing, future pauses) and returns with lyric charge in the final third. However, its function is static: it pauses, Mara acts, it resumes. No evolving constraint or reweighted meaning; the bob's state at closure mirrors its state at opening. Two-gate participation (setup, payoff reprise) lifts it to mid-band, but swappability and lack of causal pressure limit further.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Incremental absolution" is named four times and described as Mara's motive, but it operates as thematic label rather than on-page tactic that shapes choices under pressure. The concept does not constrain attempts or impose cost; Mara's ritual succeeds without setback. Present and consistent, but never tested or deepened through friction.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Ethically diligent" is asserted in paragraph 4 and echoed in paragraph 14 and 21 as a label. No on-page action demonstrates the trait constraining or enabling a choice with visible cost; Mara's care is meticulous but uncontested. Ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Emerge" / "emerging" appears in paragraphs 10, 17, and 19 tied to Mara exiting the tower's shadow and becoming a "conduit of redemption." The action is lyric metaphor rather than physical turn; easily swappable with "step out" or "descend" without structural loss. Present in payoff image but does not redefine options or drive a major turn.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The "tiny inscriptions carved along a broken rake handle" are introduced early (paragraph 2), handled physically (paragraph 6: placed against cradle, alignments), and return glowing in paragraphs 9, 10, 15, 16. The method matters: inscriptions resonate through metal, become conduits, guide her hands. Three-gate presence (setup, development, payoff) and causal role in the ritual's success. However, the mechanics are assertion without friction—inscriptions simply work—and the handle could be replaced by any inscribed tool. Strong mid-band for beat involvement and closure linkage, but swappability and lack of cost cap higher.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The tidal obsidian ridge anchors location from the opening and recurs (paragraphs 1, 12, 17, 18, 19) with vivid texture (black tide, molten rose hue). However, the ridge supplies atmosphere, not constraint; Mara's ascent and ritual proceed unimpeded by environment. The setting does not alter tactics or pressure choices. Present across beats and in closure image, but postcard function limits to lower mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"During the pause in a pendulum's swing" is signaled early (paragraph 4) and structures two key beats: the ritual placement (paragraph 6) and the future work (paragraph 16, 19). The pause creates a window for action, and paragraph 11 notes "the pendulum continued," implying elapsed time. However, the timeframe is loose—no ticking clock tightens decisions or imposes cost for delay. Two-gate involvement (setup, development) and light causal role lift it to mid-band, but lack of urgency pressure caps further.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"To restore shared balance" is Mara's stated goal (paragraph 5) and echoed in paragraphs 9 and 12. The desire is told but never dramatized through conflicted choice or friction between cost and want. Mara achieves balance without trade-off or renunciation. Present and coherent, but functional rather than pressured.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Searing reverie" appears explicitly in paragraphs 8 and 18, and the elevated, meditative register persists throughout (molten hue, fire and salt, glowing constellations). Tone is coherent and charges descriptive passages. However, it remains static—no modulation under pressure or tonal deepening at closure. The final image maintains the same lyric warmth as the opening without intensification or break. Consistent, atmospheric, but one-note.</comment>
