<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Mira is given only label-level traits ("spirited," "perpetually learning") without contradictory impulses or embodied struggle. Her decisions—placing the slide, carving—feel illustrative rather than pressured by competing wants. The final realization ("the child is herself") arrives as epiphany without prior dramatized cost or micro-choices that narrow options. Interiority defaults to abstract poetics ("turbine-hum reverie," "timewoven alliances") instead of character-particular perception under stress.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Drive lens reads accumulative/textural but wavers: the opening orients with mythic atmosphere, the middle threads together carving actions and lantern visions, yet no single moment reconfigures stakes with legible cost. The ending offers a retrospective summary ("reimagined not just a structure but an entire way of seeing") rather than an on-page decisive change or charged image that forecloses a path. Orientation is present early enough; causality is loose but not broken; closure lacks the felt price required for Resonant Reconfiguration or Conceptual Repricing.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The archway anchors setting and recurs throughout, but it functions as backdrop rather than constraint—Mira's choices do not hinge on stone texture, storm timing, or spatial access. Sensory details ("salt and pine," "turbines," "mist") are vivid but decorative, filtered through poetic register rather than the sculptor's professional priorities. The final line places the lantern "ready to shine again," a motif echo that does not charge the closure with tactical consequence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—transforming driftwood into story—is declared but never tested by on-page opposition or a trade-off that narrows options. No reversal or deepening occurs; Mira gathers wood, carves, and succeeds without friction. The crowd's "unseen pull" is told in summary, not dramatized as a choice-altering consequence. Agency is present as action but not as decision under pressure with visible cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Theme of art bridging time emerges through images (lantern slide, carved compass, timewoven alliances) but defaults to abstract declaration rather than specific on-page tension. The final paragraph moralizes overtly: "reimagined not just a structure but an entire way of seeing," "learning rise anew." No counter-reading or ambiguity remains; the "child holding a tiny carved boat" epiphany resolves into tidy self-discovery without friction. Motifs recur but do not constrain choice or accumulate pressure toward the ending.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Mira, but perceptual signature is generic lyric rather than sculptor-specific. Diction elevates uniformly ("storm-tossed archway," "turbine-hum reverie," "timewoven alliances") regardless of pressure, creating register drift from a working artist's likely lexicon. Psychic distance stays constant; no modulation under stress. Filter verbs ("She feels," "She realizes") anchor reflection but do not sharpen immediacy. No dialogue to test voice distinction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout without pattern-teaching or payoff: "weathered throat breathing wind," "arch becomes a metaphor," "turbine-hum reverie," "chorus of time." Mixed metaphors appear ("threads of glowing rope," "sea maps dissolve into myth") without coherent vehicle logic. Paraphrase loops recur: "reimagine" appears twice in adjacent beats with identical function; "layered meanings" is restated three times. Template cadence: "She decides… She lifts… She gathers… She returns." Line-level opacity in peak beats ("timewoven alliances echo," "scaffold complexity with simplicity") obscures agency and flattens momentum. Artifacts pervade the closure paragraph, disqualifying 9+ globally and applying cumulative deductions here.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The sculptor-lantern-archive synthesis is functional but defaults to familiar art-as-healing and learning-from-the-past templates without a non-obvious angle. "Timewoven alliances," "perpetually learning," and "scaffold complexity with simplicity" read as prompt keywords rather than lived specifics. The emotional arc (gathering scars, realizing the child is herself) follows a stock epiphany path without transformation through unique world logic or moral calculus. No bold structural risk; lyricism substitutes for ingenuity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Mira is present throughout and acts (places the slide, carves, observes the crowd), satisfying setup and development gates. However, her sculptor identity does not drive a key turn—her choices could belong to any artist without altering structure. She closes by returning to the workshop with resolve but no on-page cost or tactical shift tied to her specific craft. Swappable with "painter" or "weaver" with minor edits; no irreplaceable causal pressure. Late limiter: closure participation is passive observation. Band guidance: functional but replaceable, one beat involvement, no closure linkage that depends on sculptor specificity. Score: 3.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The magic lantern slide appears early (setup gate), is used twice on-page (placement against arch, dim at closure; development gate), and frames the ending ("waits, ready to shine again"; payoff gate, though passive). It enables the vision sequence that informs Mira's design, contributing causal pressure in one beat. However, it does not constrain a choice under stress or carry visible cost—removal would weaken atmosphere but not break story logic. Lyric reprise (first third → final line) reweights meaning modestly. Positives: early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure presence +0.4, specificity (swirling glass, brass case) +0.3. Frictions: ornamental in middle use −0.4, no direct cost linkage −0.2. Net: 5.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>Timewoven alliances is mentioned four times but functions as thematic label rather than on-page mechanic. It does not shape Mira's choices, alter tactics, or constrain resources; the rope imagery in the vision is decorative. Missing development and payoff gates. Ornamental use −0.8, swappable with "connections across time" −0.6, label-only −0.3. Score: 2.1.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Perpetually learning" is declared early ("each scar… a lesson") but never constrains an on-page action or forces a trade-off. Mira's carving proceeds without visible struggle or mistake born from incomplete knowledge. The child-boat realization retrospectively claims learning but does not alter present tactics or cost. Setup present, development and payoff missing. Label-only −0.3, summary-only −0.5. Score: 2.8.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Reimagine" appears twice as decision verb (archway as portal, sculpture as tableau) and shapes two middle beats, satisfying setup and development gates. However, the action is easily swappable with "envision" or "reinterpret" without structural change; no unique property matters. Payoff gate weak: the final paragraph tells us she "reimagined" but does not dramatize a culminating act. Positives: early +0.4, two beats +0.9. Frictions: swappable −0.6, told in closure rather than shown −0.5. Cap for missing payoff gate: 4.6. Score: 4.6.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Through layered meanings" is named twice but never dramatized as a method with visible mechanics. The sculpture "will echo a story," the arch becomes "a metaphor"—both are declarations of intent, not on-page process that constrains carving choices or alters outcome. Missing all three gates (no setup action, no middle mechanic, no closure payoff). Label-only −0.3, ornamental −0.7. Score: 2.4.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The storm-tossed archway anchors setting throughout (setup gate), is reimagined as portal and studio (development gate), and closes with "a memory etched into the grain of her tools" (payoff gate, though passive). It provides spatial continuity but does not constrain a choice—Mira could carve anywhere without altering stakes. Positives: early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure mention +0.3. Frictions: postcard-level pressure −0.5, swappable with "ruins" or "gateway" −0.4. Score: 4.9.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>1.6</grade><comment>"After the GPS fails" is mentioned once in the opening sentence and never referenced again. No clock, no navigation choice, no time pressure on carving or exhibition. Missing development and payoff gates entirely. Setup barely qualifies as orienting phrase rather than functional constraint. Ornamental −0.8, no beat involvement −0.6. Score: 1.6.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"Scaffold complexity with simplicity" is declared twice as Mira's intent but never dramatized as conflicted desire or visible friction. Her carving proceeds smoothly; no on-page moment where simplicity costs her nuance or complexity risks obscurity. Setup present (early declaration), development and payoff missing (told rather than tested). Label-only −0.3, summary-only −0.5, no cost linkage −0.4. Score: 3.4.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Turbine-hum reverie" is named three times and sustained through ambient description (generators, humming, syncing with carving). Tone remains static—meditative, lyric, unhurried—without modulation under pressure or crescendo at closure. Setup and development gates present; payoff gate weak (turbines "carry away" at end without reweighting stakes). Positives: early +0.4, coherent across beats +0.6, closure mention +0.2. Frictions: static mood −0.6, does not charge final image −0.5. Score: 4.1.</comment>
