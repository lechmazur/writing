<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The protagonist is defined almost entirely by abstractions—"creeping normality noticer," "heuristically gentle," "tenuous absolution"—rather than concrete wants or contradictory impulses under pressure. No embodied emotion or micro-choices appear; the character observes and meditates but never faces a decision that forecloses a path with visible cost. The empty-chair gesture and whispered thanks are performed rituals, not choices that reveal hierarchy of values. Interiority consists of label-heavy reflection without the texture of a distinct mind under stress.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation remains vague past 120 words: "the palace" and "palace courtyard" offer no who-where-when anchor, and "after the birds fly south" functions as atmosphere rather than a legible time marker (−0.4). No causal linkage drives the sequence; discovering the bread, carrying it to the tea house, slicing it, and offering it to an empty chair are sequential gestures without because/therefore pressure. The ending dissolves into atmospheric summary ("whenever a passerby stumbles") rather than landing a decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing with on-page cost. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, but no pattern break or cadence shift reweights the stake—only thematic assertion replaces scene pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Sensory detail is vivid and layered—cracked marble, jasmine mingling with oolong, vines curling around stone—but remains postcard description that does not constrain choice or alter tactics. The tea house setting appears in the second half and supplies atmosphere rather than pressure; the bread's warmth and the tea's steam are poetic texture without spatial or material consequence. The loaf functions as a symbolic object rather than a constraint that shapes the protagonist's options at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>No dominant stake is signaled early or tested under pressure. The protagonist's meditation on "tenuous absolution" is asserted thematically but never dramatized as a want in conflict with a cost or obstacle. The sequence—find bread, carry it, slice it, offer it to an empty chair—lacks escalation; each gesture is performed without resistance, trade-off, or narrowing of options. The ending invites future passersby rather than delivering an on-page reversal or tightening that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Tenuous absolution," "the sacred in the ordinary," and "uncloak" are repeated as prompt labels rather than earned through concrete particulars that shift meaning across the arc. The final paragraph ("whenever a passerby stumbles") moralizes the theme explicitly instead of letting the image resonate. The bread-as-altar and empty-chair offering are symbolic gestures whose meaning is told rather than discovered through friction or cost. No central question is posed or reweighted by the ending; instead, the story asserts its thesis in the closing lines.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The prose carries a single lyric register—elevated, abstract, rhythmically consistent—that does not modulate with urgency or interiority. No perceptual signature distinguishes the protagonist's way of noticing; diction like "heuristically gentle," "tenuous absolution," and "uncloak itself like a shy guest" reads as authorial ornamentation rather than character-bound thought. Psychic distance remains fixed at summary-reflective throughout, with no shift into embodied immediacy during pivotal gestures. The voice is coherent but generic, lacking the idiosyncratic syntax or lexicon that would anchor it to a singular mind.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade: "creeping normality noticer" appears three times, "tenuous absolution" four times, "heuristically gentle" twice, "uncloak" three times, and "after the birds fly south" twice, all without reweighting (−0.8). Template cadence: multiple sentences open with participial phrases ("feeling," "carrying," "whispering") or "The + noun" constructions across the final third (−0.5). Stock metaphors—"time seemed to uncloak itself like a shy guest," "vines curled tighter," "the world tilt toward the ordinary"—blur rather than sharpen sense (−0.4). High information density is absent; many lines restate atmosphere without advancing situation or choice. These artifacts touch the closure beat, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8 per the Patterned-artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The premise—finding the sacred in ruins through ritual gestures—follows a familiar template without transformation through specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus (−0.8 Derivative Premise Guardrail). "Creeping normality noticer," "guerrilla gardening," and "tenuous absolution" read as quirky labels rather than organic synthesis. The bread, tea house, and empty chair could be replaced by near-synonyms (candle, shrine, absent friend) without altering the emotional or thematic arc. No bold structural risk-taking or perspectival choice elevates the material; the lyric frame remains static and explanatory rather than discovering meaning through pressure.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>The "creeping normality noticer" is named and described but makes no on-page decision that alters tactics or forecloses a path. Observation and meditation dominate; the character performs gestures (pruning, carrying, slicing, offering) without conflict or cost. Late first appearance of the role label in the opening line; no causal work at closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The bread appears in the middle third (after ~200 words), is carried to the tea house, sliced, and offered to an empty chair—three beats. However, its presence does not constrain choice or narrow options; it functions as a symbolic prop for thematic meditation. The loaf's "crust still warm in memory" and "crumbs fell onto the tea leaves" are descriptive rather than causal. Present in the closure beat ("reduced to crumbs") but only as lingering atmosphere, not as a reweighted element with visible cost. Swappable with another relic (candle, scroll) without structural impact.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Tenuous absolution" is asserted four times as a thematic label but never dramatized as a stake that shapes on-page choices or costs. The protagonist "felt the tenuous absolution," "carried with him the quiet resolve"—summary claims rather than friction between want and obstacle. No moment where the concept narrows options or forces a trade-off. Present in the ending as echoed theme, but without causal pressure or conceptual cost made legible.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Heuristically gentle" appears twice as a descriptive label ("a habit that was heuristically gentle," "his own heuristically gentle yearning") but does not constrain or enable any on-page action with visible cost. No moment where gentleness forecloses a harsher tactic or where the heuristic method alters the protagonist's approach under pressure. Label-only use without dramatized trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"Uncloak" appears three times (tea house "uncloak itself," "ready to uncloak their own hidden yearning," and implicit in "guerrilla gardening" that "unmasked the palace's forgotten glory") but does not drive a major turn or redefine options. The action is thematic metaphor rather than a concrete choice that alters tactics. Easily replaceable with "reveal" or "discover" without structural impact. Present in the ending but only as echoed vocabulary, not as a causal pivot.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>1.9</grade><comment>"Guerrilla gardening" is mentioned once in the opening ("a guerrilla garden hidden behind collapsed columns") and echoed obliquely in the final third ("their growth a quiet protest that unmasked the palace's forgotten glory through guerrilla gardening"). The method is described but never shown in action; no on-page scene of planting, tending, or reclaiming that shapes a choice or supplies a resource. Ornamental setting detail without causal role.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The "secret tea house in an overgrown palace courtyard" is introduced in the middle third and houses the bread-slicing ritual. It provides atmosphere—mismatched cushions, cracked porcelain, jasmine scent—but does not pressure choices or supply constraints that alter outcome. The setting is where the meditation occurs rather than a factor that shapes tactics. Present in the closure beat as the site of the ending image, earning development and payoff gates, but the exact location is swappable (shrine, garden alcove) without narrative loss.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"After the birds fly south" appears twice (opening and final third) as poetic atmosphere but is never operationalized as a temporal constraint that tightens decisions. No urgency, deadline, or seasonal pressure; the timeframe is vague and untracked. The phrase functions as tone-setting rather than a live clock that alters moves. Ornamental use without causal role.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>"To find the sacred in the ordinary" is stated explicitly ("His motivation to find the sacred in the ordinary guided every secret step") and echoed in the ending ("the world's ordinary moments could be rescued, cherished, and shared"). The desire is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choices or visible cost. No friction between the want and an opposing stake; the protagonist enacts the motivation without obstacle or trade-off. Present across beats but as thematic summary rather than a decision under pressure.</comment>
