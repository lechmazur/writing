<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara's interiority relies heavily on abstract concepts ("lattice of archives," "perforated destiny") rather than embodied contradiction. Her motivation ("to weigh a dream against an empire") is declared but never tested through conflicting impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final choice to "propagate the vines' dissent" arrives without visible internal cost or foreclosed path—the empire simply agrees, and she records provenance afterward with labeled "mulberry ache" rather than dramatized grief. Embodiment is largely absent; emotions are named ("heavy," "lightened") rather than shown through involuntary physical response.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The orientation test fails: by ~120 words we have "velvet observatory," "amber lamps," and "Elara" but no temporal or spatial grounding beyond "midsummer" abstraction. The closure unit presents a decisive change (floating city rises autonomously), but the causal chain is broken: the envoy lowers his sword because "his eyes filled with the same mulberry ache," a motivational leap with no prior setup. The "because/therefore" linkage collapses when the empire "humbled, agreed to share"—coincidental resolution that undercuts earned causality. Cost is asserted ("heart heavy") but not legible in lost options or tactics.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The observatory is described lavishly ("velvet," "brass," "vaulted ceiling") but remains a postcard rather than a constraint on choice. Spatial choreography is unclear: Elara adjusts a telescope, lifts a violin, places it on a desk, and the envoy appears on a balcony with no prior spatial setup. The ice violin's "chill seep[ing] into her bones" offers one embodied moment, but the object does not constrain a tactic. The orientation penalty in Q2 caps this category at 7.0, but execution would not reach that ceiling regardless.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake ("weigh a dream against an empire") is declared early but never tightens into a forced trade-off. Elara discovers telepathy with vines, reads coffee stains, aligns the violin, and the problem resolves without visible cost or narrow options. The envoy's sword-lowering is not driven by protagonist agency but by transferred emotion. No on-page reversal or deepening that forecloses a path; the floating city rises, the empire agrees, and the promise's glow returns brighter—symmetric satisfaction without sacrifice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The theme ("a dream could outweigh an empire") is stated in the penultimate sentence rather than earned through particulars. The ice violin, coffee stains, and vines recur but function as ornamental motifs rather than accretive meaning-makers. The final image ("even a single note could propagate change") offers a resonant close, but the moral is explicit rather than implied. Subtext is absent; all stakes and insights are declared. The piece attempts lyric accumulation but defaults to thematic summary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited, but the register drifts into elevated abstraction ("perforated destiny," "autonomous skyward garden") that exceeds Elara's plausible lexicon under pressure. The narrative voice is ornamental rather than character-particular; syntax and diction do not modulate with stakes. Psychic distance is inconsistent: we access Elara's "mulberry ache" but the envoy's eyes "filled with the same mulberry ache" without access to his interiority. No dialogue to evaluate. Perceptual signature is generic rather than selective.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Figurative density overwhelms clarity: nearly every sentence carries stacked metaphors ("lattice of archives," "cold resonance that opened a perforated destiny," "map of choices broken into tiny holes like frost on glass"). Template cadence runs appear ("She had only weeks," "She lifted," "She placed," "She chose"). Paraphrase loops abound: the violin "sing[s] the sighs of a forgotten winter" and later "sang its final frost-laden chord." Register drift into pseudo-poetic abstraction ("propagate hope," "gilded annex") clashes with concrete action. Information density is low; many lines restate concepts without advancing situation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>The core synthesis—provenance researcher uses telepathic plants and coffee-stain divination to arbitrate between empire and floating city—reads as a prompt checklist rather than an organic premise. The ice-crystal violin, transparent and singing cold resonance, echoes familiar fantasy tropes without transformation. The resolution (empire humbled, floating garden rises) offers no friction or non-obvious moral calculus. Specificity is ornamental (velvet, mulberry, brass) rather than functionally particular. No risk-taking that heightens stakes; the piece retreats into safe lyricism.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Elara's role as provenance researcher is mentioned in the opening and closing but does not shape any turn. She "verif[ies] the origin" and later "record[s] the provenance," but these actions frame rather than drive the conflict. Her key choices—reading coffee stains, interpreting vines, choosing to propagate dissent—are not tied to her professional expertise. The character could be replaced with "scholar" or "observer" with no structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The transparent violin appears in four beats: initial description, lifting to project melody, aligning with coffee rings, and final chord. Setup is early; development includes the melody projection and coffee-ring reading; closure includes the final chord that "struck the empire's envoy." However, the object's transparency and ice-crystal material do not constrain tactics or impose cost. The violin functions as a divination tool whose specific properties (transparent, ice) are ornamental. Swappable with "crystal harp" or similar.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Perforated destiny" is introduced early ("a map of choices broken into tiny holes like frost on glass") and recurs in the luminous cracks on the ceiling ("each perforation a choice yet to be taken"), but it remains a metaphor rather than a mechanical constraint. It does not shape tactics or narrow options; Elara reads the future and acts without visible cost imposed by the concept itself. Theme-level recurrence without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Elara's telepathy with plants is discovered "by accident" and enables her to "hear the quiet thoughts of the creeping vines." The vines "whispered warnings and possibilities" and later protest the empire's offer, guiding her final choice. The trait appears in setup and payoff but lacks middle development or visible cost. No tradeoff is shown (e.g., sensory overload, distraction). The telepathy could be replaced with "intuition" or "vision" with minor edits. Functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Propagate" appears in three contexts: "propagate hope by reading the future in coffee stains," "propagate the vines' dissent," and the closing "propagate change through the roots of all things." Setup is early; the action drives the climactic choice (weaving dissent into the violin's song); closure recurs thematically. However, the mechanics are vague—how does propagating dissent translate to the envoy's emotional shift? The action is present across beats but its causal role is asserted rather than demonstrated.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Coffee-stain reading is introduced early ("coffee readings revealed a looming pact") and used in the middle beat ("the future in the coffee stains showed that the empire would offer the floating city a place"). The violin later reads "the stains as a second eye," linking method to closure. However, the mechanics are never signaled—how do stains encode futures? The method is present in setup and middle but not causally constrained; Elara gains knowledge without cost or ambiguity. Functional but opaque.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The "velvet observatory at midsummer" is established early with sensory detail (amber lamps, brass telescope, stone arches, vaulted ceiling), but it does not constrain choice or pressure tactics. The observatory is a backdrop for action rather than a spatial constraint. The dome's vines participate (brightening leaves, whispering), but the velvet/midsummer descriptors are ornamental. No choice turns on the observatory's properties; the envoy appears on an unanchored balcony. Postcard description without tactical weight.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Before the promise loses its glow" is introduced midway ("She had only weeks, before the promise loses its glow") and recurs at the climax ("Time ran thin, the promise's glow dimming like a dying ember"). The timeframe creates stated urgency but does not visibly tighten tactics—Elara's actions unfold in narrated summary without clock pressure altering her moves. At closure, "the promise's glow returned, brighter than before," reversing the deadline without cost. Present in setup and closure but not causally binding.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The motivation "to weigh a dream against an empire" is declared early ("Her motivation was simple yet heavy") and frames the central conflict. Elara's final choice to "propagate the vines' dissent" aligns with this desire, enabling the floating city's autonomy. However, the weighing process is told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants or visible sacrifice. The motivation is present in setup, guides the climax, and is summarized at closure, but friction between desire and cost is absent. Functional but not dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>"Mulberry ache" is introduced early ("The mulberry ache that settled in her chest was a reminder of personal loss, a color of grief") and recurs at the climax (the envoy's eyes "filled with the same mulberry ache") and closing ("her heart heavy with mulberry ache yet lightened"). The tone is coherent but static—a labeled emotion rather than a modulating affective texture. The color metaphor ("a color of grief that flavored every decision") is asserted but not embodied in perception or syntax. Present across beats but does not charge the final image with new weight.</comment>
