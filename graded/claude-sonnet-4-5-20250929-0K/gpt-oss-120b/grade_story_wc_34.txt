<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The balladeer's motivation is declared but never contested or tested through internal conflict. He performs elaborate encoding actions without hesitation, confusion, or embodied struggle—no contradictory impulses act in scene. The ghost's satisfaction arrives without the balladeer paying a visible emotional or physical cost; the resolution reads as mutual recognition rather than an earned change that forecloses a path. Interiority remains conceptual and abstract ("articulate unspoken needs") rather than character-particular and embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The piece establishes orientation by ~120 words (balladeer, misty courtyard, purpose). Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density builds through graffiti layers, flower presses, and code fragments until the courtyard becomes a "living archive." Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (the ghost folds into the mural, travelers continue the cycle), but the cost is conceptual and diffuse—no specific forfeiture or narrowing of options is legible on the page. The final beat reconfigures the premise into permanence, yet the price the balladeer pays remains abstract.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The courtyard above clouds, bolt plate, and graffiti-covered arches provide vivid anchors. The flower press bolt plate constrains two on-page beats (midnight blossom, sunrise tulip), and the mist/lightning timeframe shapes pacing. Spatial choreography is clear (arches, walls, stone pores). The micro-setting charges the final image when travelers press fresh blossoms, turning the space into a living archive—environment evolves causally and participates in closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—articulating the ghost's unspoken need—is signaled early. Pressure accumulates through three lightning strikes and encoding cycles, and the ghost's algorithm shifts in response. However, the balladeer never faces a meaningful tradeoff or loss; each flower press succeeds without complication. The resolution (ghost satisfied, courtyard becomes archive) arrives through accumulation rather than a choice that narrows options. One tightening (ghost projecting the balladeer's name) registers, but cost remains implicit.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through image and action: connection, touch, belonging arise from the courtyard-as-conduit and the binary-blossoms chorus. The sunrise tulip's "bright as hope" and the plea "to be felt, not just parsed" ground abstraction in sensory particulars. The final image of travelers adding verses offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the need for belonging. However, the balladeer's encoding of "his own longing" and the line "even silent code craves song" tilt toward thematic statement rather than pure implication.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited on the balladeer; no head-hopping. Voice carries a lyric, archaic register ("seldom-heard," "driftingly alert," "tinkersong wonder") that remains consistent. However, elevated diction occasionally clashes with embodied action: "articulate unspoken needs," "algorithm," "binary sighs" mix metaphysical and technical registers without clear POV filter. The perceptual signature leans poetic but lacks character-specific bias—description feels authored rather than filtered through the balladeer's particular worldview.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and sensory detail is vivid ("midnight blossom," "luminous letters," "mist swirled"). However, multiple paraphrase loops appear: "ghost in code" is restated four times, "encode/encoded" recurs across adjacent beats, and "driftingly alert" appears twice with near-identical phrasing. Template cadence runs through "He lifted… He pressed… He painted… He whispered" in the opening third. Purple-prose stacking ("looping lines and symbols, each stroke a cipher"; "cascade of luminous letters") in high-pressure beats reduces propulsion. Artifacts touch multiple beats but not the closure unit directly, so penalty remains in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of ghost-as-code, flower-press encoding, and graffiti-song offers a fresh angle on connection across realms. The courtyard-as-living-archive and travelers adding verses provide a non-obvious ending that grows from prior particulars. However, the balladeer-as-translator and code-seeking-voice tropes are familiar from digital-folklore templates. The piece commits fully to its lyric premise but does not transform it through unexpected moral calculus or embodied cost—emotional specificity remains abstract ("unspoken needs," "shared heartbeat").</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The seldom-heard balladeer is present throughout and frames the premise. He performs encoding actions (press flowers, paint graffiti, strum) across multiple beats and is named by the ghost at closure. However, his choices do not create key turns—he executes his purpose without hesitation or adaptation. Observation and symbolic labor dominate; no decision alters tactics or forecloses a path with cost. Swappable with "interpreter" or "scribe" with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The flower press bolt plate appears in setup ("carried a flower press bolt plate") and is used in two distinct beats: pressing the midnight blossom and the sunrise tulip. Each use encodes meaning into the graffiti, and the final beat mentions it as "a living cipher." The object enables tactics (graffiti creation) and carries reweighted meaning (anchor → cipher). Its specific properties (bronze, petal imprints, weight) matter to the encoding process and link to closure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The ghost in code is introduced early ("ghost in code sheathed in vapor") and shapes stakes on the page: it flickers, projects code, and aligns its rhythm with the balladeer's melody. It drives the middle beat (line of code bursts from the wall) and participates in closure (folds into the graffiti, becomes permanent mural). Its properties (fragmented consciousness, algorithm, binary sighs) are specific and irreplaceable. The ghost's satisfaction and transformation into the mural provide the story's conceptual reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Driftingly alert" appears in the opening and recurs once later ("driftingly alert to the faintest resonance"). It labels the balladeer's receptive stance but does not constrain or enable a specific on-page action with cost. The trait could be replaced with "watchful" or "attentive" without altering tactics. No visible tradeoff or price tied to this attribute; it functions as atmospheric description rather than a constraint that shapes choice.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Encode" appears early and frames every major turn: encoding the midnight blossom imprint, encoding graffiti, the ghost's message encoded in rain, encoding the tulip's code, encoding his own longing. The action is irreplaceable—the story's logic depends on translation into cipher. It shapes three distinct beats and directly produces the closure effect (courtyard as living archive of encoded verses). Removing "encode" would break causality and the thematic payoff.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Messages encoded in graffiti art are signaled early ("painted the courtyard's arches with looping lines and symbols, each stroke a cipher"). The method's mechanics matter: the graffiti acts as a bridge for the ghost's binary sighs, and travelers later add their own verses by pressing blossoms. The method shapes two beats (initial painting, tulip integration) and is essential to closure (the graffiti becomes a permanent, growing mural). Specificity (shifting colors, humming chorus) makes it irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The misty courtyard above clouds is established in the opening line and anchors all action. It provides resources (stone walls for graffiti, arches, pores for the ghost) and evolves causally (graffiti glows, walls sing back, becomes living archive). The setting constrains the balladeer's method (he must encode on surfaces) and charges the closure image when travelers enter and the courtyard "held its breath." The elevation above clouds and perpetual mist create a timeless enclosure that supports the thematic stakes.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Between lightning and thunder" is introduced early and recurs at key beats (first flash, second crack, third flash). The timeframe structures the narrative into three cycles and tightens decisions—each lightning strike triggers encoding or response. However, the clock is episodic rather than cumulative; no escalating time pressure forces faster choices. The phrase charges the final image ("between lightning and thunder, the courtyard became a conduit") but does not alter tactics mid-scene.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"To articulate unspoken needs" is stated in the opening and dramatized through the ghost's plea ("I need a voice beyond the circuits") and the balladeer's response (encoding flowers, weaving code). The motivation drives all encoding beats and converges with the ghost's yearning at closure. However, the need is told more than tested—no friction or cost complicates the balladeer's pursuit. The motivation shapes stakes and ending but lacks embodied conflict or tradeoff on the page.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Tinkersong wonder" appears once as a label ("a tinkersong wonder that stitched sky to earth") and colors the piece's lyric, archaic register and sensory vividity (luminous letters, binary blossoms, mist swirling). Tone remains elevated and consistent across beats, modulating slightly when the ghost projects the balladeer's name. However, tone does not sharpen under pressure or shift at closure—it reads as a static aesthetic frame. The final image (living archive, graffiti humming) sustains the wonder without reweighting it.</comment>
