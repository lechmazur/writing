<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The ghost's motivation—"desperate for one final encore"—is declared but never dramatized through contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. Interiority relies heavily on abstraction ("yearning to intertwine past applause with present longing") and label-speak ("synesthetically blessed") rather than embodied emotion. The shopkeeper's late arrival introduces a second character whose agency resolves the conflict without prior stake, undermining the ghost's arc. No meaningful change or renunciation is earned; the ghost simply "felt his essence expand" and achieves peace through passive observation of the shopkeeper's wish.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first ~100 words, establishing the ghost and theater backdrop. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: events layer sensory detail and symbolic recursion rather than causal linkage. However, closure fails the cost test—the ghost's "peace" and the shopkeeper's miracle are asserted without visible forfeiture or friction; the tarot coin's mechanics ("align scattered seconds") are declared but never shown constraining a choice. The fractured timeline never tightens options on the page; it remains ornamental. The Drive Lens Rule holds but closure lands without felt cost, capping the category mid-band.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The mystic orchard supplies vivid sensory texture—glowing apples, cinnamon scent, luminous notes—and the hedge maze provides spatial staging for the ghost's performance. The orchard actively responds to the ghost's song, creating a micro-setting that charges the final image. However, the setting does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; it functions as backdrop and amplifier rather than crucible. The gate for 9+ (environment constrains choice or charges final image) is partially met through the responsive orchard at closure, lifting the score into mid-6s.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—restoring the fractured timeline to deliver an encore—is signaled early but never tightens options or forces a trade-off. The ghost's singing generates echoes without friction or cost; the orchard amplifies passively, and the shopkeeper's arrival resolves the conflict through coincidence rather than protagonist agency. No meaningful deepening or escalation occurs; the ghost simply performs and the universe complies. The absence of visible price or tactical constraint under the Accumulative lens leaves pressure abstract and momentum flat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Theme—possibility rescued from despair, hope summoned through art—emerges through recurring imagery (apples, echoes, nostalgia) but is undermined by the explain-everything final paragraphs that state the moral explicitly: "every closed business could bloom anew," "hope can always be summoned." The tarot coin's shift from Tower to sunrise delivers the theme literally rather than through resonant particulars. The orchard's sensory density and the ghost's performance invite reflection, but the ending summarizes rather than reweights, dropping the score to mid-5s.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-person limited to the ghost until the shopkeeper's late arrival, which introduces a brief focalization shift ("She felt the ghost's longing"). Diction is elevated and consistent—"synesthetically blessed," "liquid violet," "luminous chime"—but verges on ornamental register during high-pressure beats without voice-specific grounding. The ghost's perceptual signature (colors that hum, scent-guided drift) is present but decorative; it does not constrain perception or choice. No dialogue appears. Psychic distance remains steady but the prose reads generic-lyric rather than character-particular.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Overwriting saturates peak beats: "his voice a chorus of rusted brass and liquid violet, each note intertwining with the orchard's natural rhythm" stacks metaphors without advancing pressure. Paraphrase loops recur—"echoes rose," "echoes cascade," "final echo drift"—across adjacent lines without new information. Template cadence runs appear: "The ghost [verb], [result]" structures repeat. Stock metaphor strings ("haunted by a stage ghost," "curtain call of night itself") and filter-verb stacks ("felt," "seemed," "felt") dull immediacy in the final third, triggering −0.9 baseline plus −0.5 for filter clusters, totaling −1.4 and disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The core premise—ghost seeks encore via fractured-timeline magic—closely follows the "artist's unfinished business" and "magical realism quest" templates without fresh transformation. Synesthesia and the tarot coin are ornamental rather than irreplaceable; a tuning fork or amulet could substitute with minor edits. The mystic orchard and hedge maze supply vivid texture but no narrative surprise. The shopkeeper's late arrival and wish-granting resolution are stock moves. Derivative Premise Guardrail applies: −1.0 for template adherence without transformation through lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The stage ghost is present throughout and frames the quest, satisfying setup. Development is weak: the ghost observes, drifts, sings, but makes no decisions that narrow options or create cost. At closure the ghost "let the final echo drift away" passively; the shopkeeper's wish resolves the timeline. The ghost's choices do not create key turns—observation dominates—capping the score below 4.0. Band guidance: functional but replaceable, no causal pressure at closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The hand-painted tarot coin appears early (setup) wedged in a floorboard, is placed on a stone (beat 1), and shifts symbols at closure from Fool/Tower to sunrise (beat 2, payoff). However, the coin is handled passively—the ghost places it, it "pulsed," it "projected," it "glimmered"—without constraining a choice or enabling a tactic under pressure. The shopkeeper's wish triggers the shift, not the ghost's action. Two-beat involvement with closure participation qualifies for mid-band, but swappability (any magical object could serve) and lack of causal pressure cap the score at 4.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>The fractured timeline is named early as the problem to solve but remains abstract throughout. No on-page beat demonstrates how it constrains options or alters tactics; the ghost simply sings and the timeline "quivered, slowly aligning like puzzle pieces." The concept is ornamental—mentioned, not dramatized—and swappable (any magical repair quest would function identically). Missing middle development and closure participation as active force; cameo mention at the end does not count. Cap at 2.8 for missing closure, then subtract −0.7 for ornamental use: 2.1.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>Synesthesia is introduced early ("synesthetically blessed with colors that hummed") but functions as label-only trait. One beat shows it in action—"his voice a chorus of rusted brass and liquid violet"—but this is description without cost or tactical constraint. No on-page moment shows synesthesia enabling or foreclosing a choice. Missing middle development and closure participation. Ornamental use and swappability (the ghost could perceive normally without altering the plot) drop the score to 1.8.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The action "intertwine" appears explicitly in the ghost's yearning ("to intertwine past applause with present longing") and is enacted when echoes wrap around apple trees and the timeline aligns. Setup and middle development are present; payoff occurs when "the fractured timeline into a single, brighter thread" is woven. However, the intertwining is passive (the orchard responds, the shopkeeper wishes) rather than driven by protagonist choice. Two-beat involvement and closure participation qualify for 5.7, but lack of causal pressure and swappability (the ghost could "restore" or "merge" with identical effect) prevent higher score.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The method "producing echoes" is introduced early ("by producing echoes of his own lost performance") and shapes the ghost's tactic: he sings, generating echoes that wrap the trees and align the timeline. Setup, middle development (singing in the orchard), and payoff (final echo drifts away, leaving a promise) all present. The method is specific and irreplaceable—echoes are the ghost's medium as a performer. Two-beat involvement with closure linkage and causal pressure (the ghost must sing to activate the coin) lift the score to 6.4.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The mystic orchard garden appears after ~200 words (setup borderline, within first third), supplies the stage for the ghost's performance (middle development), and responds actively at closure ("orchard's lights dimmed gently, as if bowing"). The setting enables the ghost's tactic (singing beneath the canopy) and charges the final image (apples fall "like soft applause"). Three gates met; setting meaningfully shapes the performance and closure. Causal pressure and closure linkage present; irreplaceability strong (no other setting would supply the responsive apples and hedge maze acoustics). Score 7.1.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Timeframe "after the business closes" is named early and sets atmospheric context ("when the streetlights flicker"), but the time constraint never tightens decisions or alters tactics. No clock pressure; the ghost drifts and performs without deadline. Setup present, middle and closure absent as active force. The timeframe is swappable (midnight, dusk, any quiet hour would function identically). Cap at 4.6 for missing middle development; subtract −0.5 for ornamental use and −0.5 for swappability: 3.6.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Motivation "to lure possibility from the brink of despair" is stated explicitly midway ("The ghost realized his purpose") and enacted when the shopkeeper's "hopeful tomorrow" is connected to the ghost's echoes. However, the desire is told rather than dramatized through conflicting choices or visible cost. The ghost never confronts friction between want (encore) and cost (what he must give up). Setup present, middle development weak (no on-page choice tests the desire), payoff present but summarized. Told-only motivation caps the score at 4.6; subtract −0.5 for lack of friction: 4.1.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Tone "rising nostalgia" is established early (twilight, velvet curtains, "haunted by a stage ghost") and modulates through the orchard's sensory crescendo ("warm brushstroke," "nostalgic tide") to the final image of soft applause and sunrise. The tone is coherent across beats and charges the ending ("sweet, synesthetic reminder that hope can always be summoned"). However, the tone remains static—nostalgia does not deepen or complicate under pressure; it simply rises. Setup, middle development, and payoff all present; tone shapes the final image but does not reconfigure under conflict. Score 5.9.</comment>
