<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The queen's motivation to "unravel the mystery of recurring dreams" is stated but never embodied in micro-choices under pressure; she simply follows a linear path to a basin that conveniently reveals everything. Internal conflict is absent—no contradictory impulses act simultaneously. The orb-drinking moment and final vow feel unearned, arriving without prior causality that would make renunciation or acceptance costly. Interiority relies on stock phrasing ("bleeding starlight," "lacy menace") rather than character-particular perception.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed—who, where, and when are not anchored by ~120 words; "disenchanted queen," "palace balcony," and "after the final warning" appear early but remain abstract without concrete grounding (−0.4 in Q2; Q3 capped at 7.0 per Orientation Test). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural, but no meaningful tightening or cadence shift occurs; the queen ascends, finds a basin, drinks an orb, and the dreams dissolve—pure outline sequencing without pressure. Closure lacks visible cost: the orb "bursts," dreams "dissolved," and she returns "tempered by starlight" with no on-page forfeiture or tactical reweighting. The Cost Proof Test fails—no exact sentence makes the price legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Sensory detail is vivid and selective ("air tasted of iron and old rain," "walls exhaled a thin mist"), and the ember grotto's pulsing rhythm charges the atmosphere. However, the environment does not constrain a single choice—the queen's path is frictionless, and the grotto supplies only discovery, not obstacle. Spatial choreography is coherent across the ascent and alcove, but the setting functions as backdrop rather than crucible. The "cobalt grotto above clouds" is introduced late (mid-story) and remains ornamental.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"unravel the mystery of recurring dreams"—is declared but never tested. No reversal or tightening narrows options; the queen climbs, finds a basin, and the orb reveals everything without resistance. Agency is absent: the orb "poured into her veins" passively, and the retinue obeys without friction. Coincidence resolves: the crystal basin conveniently holds the exact images needed, and the orb bursts on contact. No on-page cost alters later tactics; the final vow ("watch over the ridge") is asserted, not earned by prior pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges around the burden of leadership and recurring nightmares, but it arrives through assertion rather than earned particulars. The final image—"tempered by starlight"—offers a vague thematic claim without a non-literal answer to the central question. The orb's "bleeding starlight" and "recurring dream" motifs recur but do not reweight prior material; they simply confirm the premise. No counter-reading is possible; the queen's arc resolves into tidy restoration ("the kingdom woke to a sky clearer than ever") without ambiguity or cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited, but narrative distance fluctuates without purpose—"disenchanted queen" and "lacy menace of the night" read as external editorial tags rather than the queen's perception. Diction drifts into elevated register ("bleeding starlight across her mind," "cobalt grotto above clouds") that feels imposed rather than character-specific. Dialogue is minimal and functional ("Follow"), carrying no subtext. The retinue remains voiceless ciphers. Perceptual signature is generic; the queen notices in catalog fashion (iron, rain, fireflies) without bias or selective attention shaped by her stated goal.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade: "bleeding starlight" appears four times with no reweighting; "ember grotto on the ridge" is repeated verbatim three times as a label rather than evolving object. Template cadence runs in the mid-section: "She stepped forward… She reached out… She approached… She whispered…" (−0.6). Figurative language is dense without payoff—"walls exhaled," "ceiling opened like a wound," "lacy menace"—mixed metaphors that blur rather than sharpen (−0.4). Stock metaphors ("dissolved like mist," "bleeding starlight") in peak beats reduce immediacy (−0.3). Filter-verb stacks appear ("felt the pull," "felt the ground pulse," "felt the weight") without voice motivation. Total artifact penalty: −1.3 in Q7; disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band entries at 8.8 per artifact rule.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The core premise—"disenchanted queen seeks dream secret in grotto"—follows a familiar quest template without transformation. The orb of starlight and crystal basin are genre-standard discovery objects; no fresh angle emerges. The ending resolves into restoration fantasy: "the kingdom woke to a sky clearer than ever," a tidy moral without complexity. Emotional arc and plot could transfer unchanged to another setting (e.g., astronaut, shipwreck survivor) with surface edits, failing the transformation test. No bold risk or specific detail grounds the universals.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The disenchanted queen is present throughout and makes surface decisions (gather retinue, climb, drink orb), but these choices do not create key turns—each action is a passive step in a linear discovery sequence without cost or tactical alteration. She is more observer than agent; the orb and basin do the work.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The ember grotto appears in setup (title phrase), mid-story arrival, and closure scene (three beats), shaping the destination and housing the orb. However, it remains a static container; its "pulsing rhythm" is described but never constrains a choice or alters tactics. The ending states it is "empty, its secrets spent," a thematic claim rather than a visible reweighting.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Bleeding starlight" appears in setup (dream description), the mist moment, the orb's surface, and the absorption scene—four mentions across beats. It provides visual continuity but does not change options; the queen never chooses between starlight and another path. The concept is ornamental, illustrating the dream rather than shaping stakes.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Softly commanding" is mentioned twice as a label ("the queen's voice rose softly commanding," "soft command turned into a whisper") but never constrains or enables an action with visible cost. The retinue obeys without friction, so the attribute has no tactical consequence.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Climb" is the central action, present in setup (path "climbed steeply"), middle ascent, and the alcove entry—three beats. It structures the quest and delivers the queen to the orb. However, the climb is frictionless; no turn traces to the act of climbing itself (e.g., exhaustion forcing a choice, altitude sickness, a collapse). Swappable with "descend into cavern" or "sail to island" with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"A shared exhale spotting the first fireflies of summer" appears twice verbatim—once during ascent, once when the queen breathes near the orb. The method is not signaled as a technique or ritual, and its mechanics do not matter; it reads as poetic filler rather than a means that shapes attempts.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Cobalt grotto above clouds" is introduced mid-story (setup missing; −0.5 per late-arrival guidance) and described vividly, but it supplies no resource or obstacle that affects outcome. The setting is postcard backdrop; the queen's path is unaltered by the grotto's properties. It appears in the final legend reference, a thematic echo without causal payoff.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"After the final warning" anchors the opening (setup present), but the timeframe is never tracked or tightened. No clock pressures decisions; the ascent, discovery, and return occur in vague sequence without urgency or temporal constraint that alters tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"To unravel the mystery of recurring dreams" is stated in setup and drives the quest destination (two beats). However, the motivation is told, not dramatized in conflicted choices—no friction between the desire and a competing cost (e.g., abandoning the kingdom, risking the retinue). The basin conveniently reveals the answer without the queen having to choose or sacrifice.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Lacy menace" appears once as a phrase ("lacy menace of the night wrapped around the retinue") and as mood coloring in a few beats (shadows, obsidian cradle). Tone is atmospheric but static; it does not modulate with pressure or charge the final image, which resolves into peaceful restoration ("sky clearer than ever") that contradicts menace.</comment>
