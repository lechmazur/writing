<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Lira remains an abstraction—"esoteric realist" is asserted but never dramatized through contradictory impulses or embodied choice under pressure. Her actions (collecting, knotting) unfold without internal friction or visible cost; the "trembling hands" and whispered promise read as performed emotion rather than contradictory desire. No micro-choice forecloses a path or reveals hierarchy of values. The final "guardian" pose summarizes rather than earns transformation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation Test: Who, where, and when are named early, so no penalty there. However, no on-page closure unit exists—Lira performs a ritual that never tightens options or imposes felt cost. The structures "would dissolve with the next sunrise" is told, not shown, and carries no dramatized trade-off. The "interrupted cadence" and "blushing stillness" recur as motifs but never constrain a choice or reconfigure stakes. Accumulative lens is suggested but the ending offers only thematic echo, not a decisive change, resonant reconfiguration with cost, or conceptual repricing that reweights prior material.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Vivid sensory language (bioluminescent moss, amber light, rosy hush) establishes atmosphere, but the grotto itself never constrains a choice or alters tactics. The "clouds below" and "verdant" setting remain postcard description; spatial choreography is vague (Lira kneels, ties knots, but proximity and access are never tested). The moth wing and reeds function as props without physical resistance. Micro-setting potential is present but untapped.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"to honor overlooked histories"—is declared but never tested. No antagonist, obstacle, or internal friction opposes Lira's goal; she collects, knots, and places without reversal or tightening. The "interrupted cadence" and "temporary structures" are conceptual, not pressure points. No choice forecloses a path or imposes visible cost. The ritual completes exactly as intended, offering thematic resonance without escalation or agency-driven turn.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Blushing stillness" and "interrupted cadence" recur as thematic phrases, and the piece attempts to honor forgotten travelers through image and gesture. However, the theme is stated rather than earned—Lira's final smile and "guardian" pose articulate the moral directly. No fresh insight emerges from specific struggle; the "quiet anthem" and "ripple forward" tell rather than show consequence. The lyric mode coheres but lacks cost-driven specificity to charge the ending.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Third-person narration maintains stable distance and no head-hopping. However, diction drifts into elevated, abstract register ("esoteric realist," "transiently rooted," "blushing stillness") that clashes with concrete action; the voice feels ornamental rather than character-particular. Perceptual signature is generic—Lira notices beauty but her way of noticing lacks bias or selectivity. No dialogue is present. Psychic distance is consistent but the prose reads as committee voice rather than singular perspective.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Overwriting pervades: nearly every sentence in the opening and closing paragraphs stacks figurative language ("orange whispers," "breath that lingered," "fingers that embraced," "knot of light") without pattern-teaching or payoff. Paraphrase loops are frequent ("blushing stillness" appears five times; "interrupted cadence" three times without reweighting). Template cadence: "She [verb], [state]" runs across multiple beats. Stock metaphors ("soft incense," "quiet hymn," "dewy poetry") cluster in high-pressure moments. Mixed vehicle: "transiently rooted" contradicts itself. Register drift into abstract diction ("esoteric realist," "conceptual Repricing") clashes with concrete action. Artifacts touch the closure beat ("blushing curve that mirrored the stillness"), triggering the −1.7 baseline and disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The premise—honoring forgotten insect migrations through temporary art in a sky grotto—offers a fresh angle. However, execution relies on stock nature-mysticism tropes: the solitary artist, fleeting monuments, "quiet hymns" in the wind. The "esoteric realist" label and "blushing stillness" read as prompt-echo rather than lived specificity. Emotional arc is generic (reverence → completion → smile). No bold structural risk or non-obvious synthesis; the story could swap Lira for any nature-guardian archetype with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>Lira is named and present throughout but makes no choices that create turns. She collects, knots, and places without friction or decision under pressure. "Esoteric realist" is asserted but never dramatized. Observation and ritual dominate; no agency-driven reversal.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The moth wing appears in three beats: collection (~15%), placement atop the knot (~60%), and final reference (~90%). It is handled on the page and returns with reweighted meaning ("silver sheen," "delicate veins catch the amber light"). However, it does not constrain a choice or impose cost; it remains symbolic decoration rather than causal agent.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Interrupted cadence" is named three times as thematic echo ("interrupted cadence in the wind," "interrupted cadence of the world slow," "interrupted cadence of the world's forgotten lullabies") but never shapes stakes or alters tactics. It remains abstract motif without on-page pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Transiently rooted" appears twice: "transiently rooted in her palm" (~10%) and "transiently rooted in the place" (~85%). Both are metaphoric descriptions without constraining or enabling action. No cost tied to the trait; it functions as label-only.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Knotting reeds structures multiple beats: Lira begins (~25%), ties spirals (~35%), places the moth wing atop the highest knot (~50%), and ties a final knot infused with the wing's sheen (~65%). The action is central and specific, though it could be swapped for weaving or carving with minor edits. No major turn traces exclusively to knotting, but it anchors the ritual and returns at closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Temporary structures as signals are named and described across multiple beats: introduced (~20%), glowing with moss (~40%), acting as signals for future wanderers (~70%), and dissolving at sunrise (~95%). However, the method's mechanics never matter—no challenge in building, no constraint on materials, no test of the signal's function. It shapes the ritual but not tactics under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The grotto is named in the opening line and present throughout. It provides atmosphere (bioluminescent moss, clouds below, mist) but never constrains a choice or supplies resources that affect outcome. Spatial choreography is vague; the setting remains postcard description rather than tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The monarch migration frames the story (opening, midpoint "last monarch passed," and closing "last butterfly vanished"). Time is tracked loosely ("next sunrise") but does not tighten decisions. The migration's end is announced, not dramatized as a deadline that alters tactics. Functional framing but no live clock.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"To honor overlooked histories" is stated in the opening paragraph and reflected in every beat (collecting the wing, knotting reeds, whispering a promise, staying as guardian). However, the desire is never dramatized as conflicted or tested; Lira completes the ritual without friction between want and cost. Told motivation without embodied struggle.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Blushing stillness" is named five times and modulates with the ritual's progression ("thrummed," "retained," "mirrored"). The tone coheres and charges the final image ("blushing curve that mirrored the stillness"). However, it remains a single static mood—lyric and atmospheric—without pressure-driven transformation. Purposeful but not dynamic.</comment>
