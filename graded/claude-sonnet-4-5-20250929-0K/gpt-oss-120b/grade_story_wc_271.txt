<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The protagonist exhibits clear motivation (anchor optimism in realism) and embodied grief through the photograph, but interiority leans heavily on diagnostic label-speak ("somatic markers," "freeze her panic") and therapeutic framing that flattens crisis particularity. The climactic moment—kneeling by the sapling and making a promise—lacks contradictory impulses; the choice reads smoothly resolved rather than fraught. Emotional progression is tidy rather than credibly irrational, and the "quietly talented gait" remains a label without demonstrable constraint or enabling action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes who, where, and when promptly (arboretum survivor, post-wedding bombing) and holds a coherent Accumulative/Textural lens: the pearl-of-stillness motif recurs, the photograph is handled twice, and the ending crystallizes her resolve through image and spoken vow. However, the closure unit—"I will remember... I will honor... I will let stillness guide"—articulates stance without visible cost; the choice to plant hope does not foreclose a live option or impose a felt price. The before/after remains more declarative than earned, capping the band despite structural coherence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The arboretum perched on a seaside cliff supplies vivid sensory anchors (pine, rosemary, sea lavender, wind chimes, gulls) and the cliff edge recurs to frame her choice. The setting charges the final image—she walks "toward the cliff's edge, ready to plant her own beacon"—and the storm-scarred oak sapling serves as a micro-setting that constrains her kneeling gesture. Spatial choreography is clean throughout, earning higher credit despite some ornamental catalog moments early on.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>One dominant stake—anchoring optimism in realism—is signaled early and tightens through the photograph handling and the sapling encounter. The piece deepens rather than reverses: she moves from passive observation to active vow. However, the vow itself ("I will remember... I will honor...") does not narrow options or impose visible trade-off; the sapling is already scarred, and her promise to it incurs no on-page cost. Under an Accumulative lens, the tightening is modest and the cost implied rather than felt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars—survival, memory, stillness—and the final image (walking toward the cliff with the photograph as a "beacon") offers a non-literal answer to grief and hope. Yet the protagonist's kneeling promise verges on thematic summary ("I will remember... I will honor..."), and the metaphor of the pearl, while recurring, is explained rather than dramatized. The piece resists overt moralizing but does not fully transcend its therapeutic idiom, preventing higher resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable in close third, and perceptual signature is consistent (survivor's lens filtering wind, gulls, scent). Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("orb of calm," "cadence," "tangible echo") that reads polished but not always character-particular under grief. The spoken promise at the sapling is grammatically smooth and thematically aligned, yet lacks the compression or ellipsis one might expect mid-crisis. No head-hopping; voice is controlled but not charged under peak pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear and rhythmically varied, with strong sensory anchors (salt wind, pine needle, crumpled photograph). However, several lines loop conceptually: "freeze her panic" / "freeze the grief" / "freeze alongside her"; "pearl of stillness" is defined, then re-explained, then invoked again. Template cadence appears in "she paused... she pulled... she pressed... she breathed... she knelt... she stood... she smiled... she walked"—a run of identical subject-verb openings across the final third. These artifacts accumulate to −0.8 in Q7 and disallow 9+ globally per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The core premise—wedding-bombing survivor finding stillness in an arboretum—follows a recognizable recovery-narrative template without transforming it through unexpected particulars. The "pearl of stillness" metaphor and the lighthouse/beacon closure image read as familiar rather than fresh. Emotional specificity is present (crumpled photograph, scarred sapling) but does not synthesize into a non-obvious angle; the final vow articulates the premise rather than reweighting it.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The drone-strike wedding survivor is present throughout and her past shapes motivation, but her agency is limited: she observes, smooths the photograph, kneels, and makes a spoken vow. The kneeling and vow are decisions, but they do not alter tactics or narrow options with on-page cost. The element is functional but does not create a key turn.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The crumpled photograph appears in three beats: carried in her pocket (setup), pulled and smoothed at the bench (middle), and tucked away at the end. Each handling advances pressure slightly—memory to confrontation to integration—and the final line ("with the crumpled photograph safely tucked away") ties closure. The element is essential across beats but does not impose a visible cost or constraint that would push it into the 8+ band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"A pearl of stillness" is named, defined as "a feeling she cultivated," and invoked three times, but it does not constrain choice or alter tactics. It remains a metaphor for her emotional state rather than a mechanism that shapes on-page action. Present and thematically consistent, yet ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Quietly talented gait" appears once as a label without demonstrable constraint or enabling action. The trait does not recur or affect any choice. Ornamental mention only.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Freeze" recurs in three forms: freeze panic, freeze grief, and the world freezing alongside her. The verb is present and thematic, but it does not define a pivotal action or turn; the protagonist's stillness is cultivated passively rather than enacted as a decisive choice. Swappable with "hold" or "suspend" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Somatic markers" is named twice—wind on cheek, thumb on photograph corner—but the method's mechanics do not shape attempts or constrain her approach. The markers are described rather than used to alter tactics. Functional label, replaceable with "physical cues" without narrative loss.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The arboretum perched on a seaside cliff supplies sensory anchors throughout, the cliff edge frames the opening and closing, and the scarred oak sapling provides a micro-setting for the kneeling vow. The setting participates in closure ("walked toward the cliff's edge, ready to plant her own beacon") and constrains her movement and metaphor. Essential across beats and ending.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"After the last lighthouse keeper" appears in the opening line and once more as backstory, but it does not tighten decisions or impose a temporal constraint. The timeframe is atmospheric rather than causal. Ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"To anchor optimism in realism" is stated explicitly midway and shapes her final vow, but the friction between hope and grief is told more than dramatized through conflicted choices. The motivation is present and drives the ending, but cost and tradeoff remain implied rather than visible on the page.</comment>
