<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is stated but never genuinely tested by an on-page choice that carries visible cost. Her "brazen calm" remains a label throughout; we never see contradictory impulses act simultaneously under pressure. The ending claims vigor transferred from the orchard without dramatizing struggle or credible endurance. Internal conflict is absent, replaced by serene execution of a plan that meets no friction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration (council lifts the decree), but the reversal arrives via external fiat without Mara making a final choice or paying a visible cost. The six-month countdown never tightens tactics on the page; no beat shows her racing against time or sacrificing an option. Orientation is prompt (caretaker, orchard, six months), but causality is thin: copper-wrapped oaks "glow," council is "moved," decree lifted—each step asserted rather than earned. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural (ritual observations, copper ritual), but the ending does not reweight prior material through cadence shift or pattern break; it simply declares success.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The temple orchard and living stone pillars are vivid and specific, sensory detail is selective (mica veins shimmer, chlorophyll clouds), and the copper wire functions as a tangible tool. However, the environment never constrains a choice—Mara moves freely, and the orchard passively responds. Spatial choreography is clear, but the setting remains postcard backdrop rather than pressure source, capping the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake (foster interspecies respect before death) is signaled early but never tested. No reversal occurs; Mara wraps copper, the orchard hums, visitors pause, children sketch—a sequence of affirmations without friction. The six-month limit never narrows options or forces a trade-off. Escalation is absent; pressure remains flat. The council's decree-lifting is external gift, not earned by protagonist agency.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Theme (interspecies connection, reverence for nature) emerges through repeated images (copper veins, stone pillars, botanical diary) and avoids overt moralizing until the final beat ("willingness of all beings to bind together"). The council's decision and Mara's vigor restoration edge toward tidy resolution, but the core concept of architectural secrets revealed by compassion is traceable. No epiphany is earned through struggle; the insight is declared rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, distance is consistent, and the prose carries a distinct lyric texture (e.g., "bruised amber," "gently systematic," "copper veins pulsing"). Perceptual signature is present: Mara notices growth cycles, bark textures, resonance frequencies. However, filter verbs ("noted," "recorded," "aware") stack in expository passages, and diction occasionally drifts into essay register ("testament to interspecies dialogue"). No dialogue appears.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies, figurative language is controlled, and information density is generally high. However, paraphrase loops appear: "gently systematic" recurs four times with minimal variation, "brazen calm" appears three times, and template cadence runs through the copper-wrapping sequence ("Each coil...a measured twist...a gently systematic ritual"). Stock phrasing ("testament to," "living library," "bridges the gap") clusters in the final third. These artifacts dull momentum and trigger the patterned-artifact penalty (−0.6 in Q7, disallow 9+ globally).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The premise (terminal caretaker uses ancient ritual to unite nature and community) leans on familiar eco-mysticism without transformation through specific conflict or moral calculus. Copper-wrapped oaks and living stone pillars are vivid images, but the plot arc—wise elder completes harmonious project, community is moved, elder is healed—follows template without fresh inflection. No bold risk or non-obvious synthesis; the ending's decree-lifting feels convenient rather than earned.</comment>
