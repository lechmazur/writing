<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara exists as a label ("vigilant horizon mapper") rather than a person making contradictory choices under pressure. Her internal experience is almost entirely abstract—"sculpt patience from impatience," "unyoke the rush"—without embodied emotion or lived contradiction. The final "unyoke" moment declares release rather than dramatizing a foreclosed path with visible cost. No meaningful internal conflict acts simultaneously in scene; the piece summarizes her transformation rather than showing her struggle through micro-choices.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first 120 words, so no penalty applies. The piece establishes an Accumulative/Textural lens through repeated moon-path imagery and magnetic-pulse motifs, but no meaningful tightening or deepening occurs—Elara waits, records, feels release, with no causal pressure narrowing her options. The closure image ("unyoke the rush, honor the still" / "the frozen world itself had granted her a small freedom") offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis), but the cost is asserted rather than shown; no on-page choice forecloses a path. The Cost proof test fails: I cannot point to a specific sentence where Elara pays a visible price at the ending beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The basalt sanctuary, frozen lake, and magnetic viaduct are vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (ice singing "a thin, glassy hymn," viaduct's "low, resonant hum"). Spatial choreography is clean, and the compass placement atop the viaduct constrains one on-page action. The micro-setting (viaduct, ice, basalt pillars) charges the final image when the ice "breathes" and the "crack sounded… of release," meeting the 9+ gate requirement. However, occupational detail (horizon mapping, magnetic tracking) remains ornamental; the mechanics never pressure a choice, capping the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—sculpting patience from impatience—is signaled early but remains abstract throughout. No meaningful tightening or deepening occurs under the Accumulative lens; Elara observes, records, and waits, but the magnetic pulse and moon paths do not narrow her options or force a trade-off. The ending declares release ("unyoke," "small freedom") without showing what she renounced or what live option was foreclosed. Agency is absent; coincidence (the magnetic surge, the ice crack) delivers the resolution. The piece fails the 8.0+ guardrail: no on-page choice forecloses a path with visible cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The theme of patient revolution emerges through recurring images (ice, viaduct, moon paths, "unyoke") rather than direct statement, and the final mantra ("unyoke the rush, honor the still") attempts a resonant answer. However, the conceptual payoff is asserted rather than earned through specific struggle; Elara's transformation occurs off-stage, summarized in abstract reflection. The piece avoids overt moralizing but drifts into pseudo-profundity ("a gentle untying of the knots that impatience had tied around the soul") without anchoring insight in concrete particulars. The 9+ test fails: the ending restates the premise rather than reweighting it with cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. However, the narrative voice is generic and elevated throughout, lacking a distinct perceptual signature or character-specific texture. Diction remains uniformly lyric ("restrained wildness," "softly purposeful," "patient sentinels") even under the supposed pressure of the ending beat, with no modulation for urgency. Filter verbs ("felt," "seemed," "realized") cluster in high-pressure moments, dulling immediacy. The prose reads as averaged consensus rather than Elara's singular perspective, and no dialogue appears to test voice distinction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade the text: "patient revolution," "slow uprising of patience," "softly purposeful," "restrained wildness" recur without adding pressure or detail. Template cadence dominates ("She moved… She recorded… She realized… She turned… She paused… She felt…"), with adjacent sentences restating the same content (e.g., "a patient revolution" / "a slow uprising of patience" / "sculpt patience from impatience"). Stock metaphors ("quiet promise," "silver veins," "dark as obsidian") and filter-verb stacks in peak beats trigger −0.9. Artifacts touch the closure beat ("unyoke the rush, honor the still"), disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8 per the Patterned-artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The premise—a mapper tracking magnetic patterns to cultivate patience—offers a surface novelty but resolves into a generic template: character seeks inner peace through observation of natural phenomenon, declares transformation without struggle. The core emotional arc (impatient → patient) could function unchanged with different names and places, failing the Transformation test. Tropes (lone seeker, mystical landscape, wisdom through waiting) are executed without fresh inflection or non-obvious moral calculus. The mantra "unyoke the rush, honor the still" echoes self-help phrasing rather than a lived, particular insight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Elara ("vigilant horizon mapper") is named and present throughout but makes no key decisions that alter tactics or outcomes. She observes, records, and waits; the magnetic surge and ice crack happen to her. Her choices (placing the compass, whispering gratitude, turning toward the sanctuary) are ornamental gestures without causal pressure. The element is functional but passive, failing the setup → development → payoff gates for decision-driven turns.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The magnetic viaduct appears in multiple beats: Elara approaches it (setup), places a compass atop it (middle), and descends it at dawn (ending). Its magnetic pulse and glow are handled on the page and the final "cold metal pulse" reprises its presence. However, the viaduct does not constrain a choice or narrow options; it is backdrop. The object passes all three gates (setup, development, payoff) but lacks causal pressure or irreplaceability—a similar mystical structure could replace it. Cap at 6.3 per the lyric-resonance allowance for purposeful reprise without mid-scene constraint.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"A patient revolution" is named repeatedly ("whispered of a patient revolution," "the patient revolution was not a battle," "quiet revolution of waiting") but functions as thematic echo rather than shaping stakes or tactics on the page. Elara does not enact a revolution; she waits and observes. The concept could be swapped for "inner transformation" or "spiritual awakening" with minor edits. It is functional but ornamental, meeting only the setup gate (named early) without development or payoff that alters options.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Softly purposeful" appears twice as a descriptor ("moved softly purposeful," "softly purposeful journey") but does not constrain or enable any on-page action with cost. It is label-only, functioning as tone or mood rather than a trait that creates visible tradeoffs. The attribute could be removed without altering tactics or outcomes. Ornamental use; no gates met beyond label mention.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Unyoke" appears in the final third as a mantra and conceptual goal ("unyoke the restless heart," "the unyoke of her own restless yearning," "unyoke the rush, honor the still"). The action is named but not dramatized—no on-page moment shows Elara releasing a specific tether or foreclosing a path. It shapes the ending image (the ice crack as "release") but arrives late (−0.6 to −1.0 per late-first-appearance guidance) and resolves a problem it did not help create earlier. Late arrival and summary-only use cap the score; lyric reprise lifts it slightly within band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Tracking moon paths" is signaled early ("believed that by tracking moon paths… she could decode"), used in the middle ("recorded these glimmers in a leather journal"), and present at the ending ("the moon's path faded into a steady, silver line"). The method frames her process across the arc, meeting all three gates. However, the mechanics remain ornamental—the journal entries and moon observations do not narrow options or shape a key choice with cost. The method is functional but swappable (she could "track star patterns" or "record magnetic readings" instead). Functional with weak causal pressure, mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The basalt sanctuary and frozen lake are established early, present across beats (Elara approaches, records data, turns toward the sanctuary, pauses at the ice edge), and charged at the ending ("the frozen world itself had granted her a small freedom"). The ice crack and viaduct hum supply tactile detail, and spatial choreography is clear. The setting constrains one micro-choice (placing the compass atop the viaduct) and the final image ("the water below, dark as obsidian, reflected the moon's lingering curve") reweights the opening tone. All three gates met with purposeful reprise; causal pressure is light but present, placing the score in the mid-6s per the gate model and lyric-resonance allowance.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"After the lake freezes over" anchors the timeframe in the opening line and is reprised at the ending ("when dawn finally crept over the horizon"). However, time does not tighten decisions or tactics—Elara's nightly observations span an unspecified duration ("each night the moon traced a slow arc") without urgency or deadline. The timeframe is present but vague and untracked, failing to create a live clock that alters moves. Functional but replaceable, meeting setup and payoff gates without middle development; cap at 3.4 per the gate model when middle development is absent.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"To sculpt patience from impatience" is stated as Elara's goal early ("her goal was to sculpt patience from impatience") and reprised at the ending ("the impatient fire inside her cooling to a steady ember"). The motivation frames the arc but is never dramatized through conflicting choices or visible costs—she waits, feels release, declares transformation. No friction between wants and costs appears on the page; the desire is told rather than shown under pressure. Functional with setup and payoff gates met but no middle development that tests the motivation with cost; cap at 4.6 per the missing-middle-development guidance.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Restrained wildness" is named in the opening ("Her spirit moved with restrained wildness") and reprised at the ending ("the world itself had learned a new, restrained wildness"). The tone modulates slightly—lyric and elevated throughout, softening at the end with the "quiet certainty" and "silver smile"—but remains uniformly abstract without sharp contrast or pressure-driven shifts. The tone is coherent and purposeful, charging the final image with its paradoxical quality. It passes setup and payoff gates with light middle development (the tone persists across beats); lyric reprise that reweights the stake lifts the score into the mid-5s per the gate model and lyric-resonance allowance.</comment>
