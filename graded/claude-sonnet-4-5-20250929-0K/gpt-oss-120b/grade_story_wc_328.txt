<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The protagonist exhibits no meaningful internal conflict or embodied emotion; interiority consists entirely of abstract mission-speak ("turn bitterness into a cosmic joke") without contradiction or cost. The "bitterness inside me loosen" moment arrives unearned, a declared epiphany rather than a dramatized shift. The cryptid researcher cover remains ornamental—no on-page choice tests the undercover stance or creates friction between researcher identity and herbalist fascination. Actions are observational rather than pressured; the placement of the arrowhead and subsequent events feel like staged choreography without agency-driven risk.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed and vague: "the herbalist's underground garden" offers no spatial grounding, and "after the missing return changed years ago" provides no actionable timeframe (−0.4 for orientation debt). The closure unit—arrowhead shattering, moss turning silver, bitterness "loosening"—lands as a sequence of effects without visible cost or a choice that forecloses a path; the protagonist observes a transformation rather than enacting one. Drive lens reads as attempted Accumulative/Textural, but the pattern never coheres: the phone's "static-laden confessions," the arrowhead's hum, and the moss's glow remain discrete ornaments rather than a tightening motif. No meaningful deepening or cadence shift reweights the stake; the ending declares redemption ("frostbitten hope that turned the dark into a joke") without demonstrating the price paid or options lost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The underground garden supplies vivid sensory fragments—phosphorescent moss, frost on stone benches, iron grated chute—but spatial choreography is unclear (how large is the space? where does the phone rest relative to the chute?). The arrowhead's "gravitationally playful pull" and the vines forming a scaffold read as magical set-dressing rather than environment constraining choice. Micro-setting potential exists (the arrowhead on moss, frost as frozen hope) but these details are described rather than dramatized as obstacles or resources that alter the protagonist's tactics. The garden seals "like a promise" at the end, charging the final image, which lifts the score modestly despite the lack of mid-scene spatial pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"locating the echoing beast that fed on forgotten myths"—is declared but never tested; the creature manifests as a disembodied phone voice offering metamorphosis, and the protagonist's only action is placing the arrowhead down and listening. The mission "to turn bitterness into a cosmic joke" arrives as an order rather than a want in conflict with a need, and no on-page reversal narrows options or raises cost. The arrowhead shattering and the moss responding occur as automatic effects, not choices that trade one path for another. Escalation is absent; pressure remains static from the phone's first crackle to the garden's closure, and coincidence (the arrowhead's spontaneous burst) resolves the conflict without protagonist agency.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Theme is declared rather than emergent: "turn bitterness into a cosmic joke," "frostbitten hope," and "the joke was that the universe itself had been waiting for someone to laugh at its own darkness" read as thesis statements rather than insights earned through concrete experience. The arrowhead, moss, phone, and frost recur but remain symbolic tokens without accumulating pressure or constraining choice. The final-paragraph moralizing ("a story of redemption, a frostbitten hope that turned the dark into a joke shared across dimensions") replaces scene pressure with abstract summary (−0.6). Subtext is absent; every thematic beat is articulated by the narrator, and the creature's "fragment of forgotten song" is explained rather than enacted.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>POV distance is stable first-person, but perceptual signature is generic: "breath fogging," "the weight of years of dead ends," "the laughter of the beast ripple through me" could belong to any narrator. Diction drifts into elevated register ("metamorphose any who listened into a vessel of its own laughter," "gravitationally playful echo") that clashes with moment-to-moment urgency. No dialogue appears. Psychic distance remains static; peak moments (arrowhead shattering, garden sealing) receive the same remote, catalog-like treatment as transit beats. The prose texture is consistent but lacks rhythmic modulation under pressure; sentence structures and opening patterns ("I realized," "I felt," "I walked") repeat without variation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Template cadence pervades: "I slipped... I was... I lifted... I placed... I felt... I realized... I walked..." runs through the entire piece without syntactic variation (−0.6). Paraphrase loops appear in adjacent lines: "the garden's underground walls seemed to pulse" followed by "their stone veins glowing" restates the same image (−0.2). Stock metaphor strings ("frostbitten hope," "harmony untamed," "gravitationally playful") recur as ungrounded labels rather than concrete images (−0.4). Figurative density is high without pattern-teaching or payoff: nearly every sentence carries metaphor ("a ribbon of stars," "frost can melt into laughter," "chorus of leaves"), obscuring rather than sharpening the closure beat (−0.3). Information density is low; multiple sentences rephrase mission objectives and thematic claims without advancing situation or choice.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The core premise—cryptid researcher encounters a sorrow-creature via enchanted phone in phosphorescent garden—assembles familiar quest and redemption tropes without transformation. The arrowhead, phone, moss, and frost appear as checklist elements rather than an organic synthesis. Emotional specificity is absent; "bitterness," "laughter," and "hope" remain abstract. The "turn bitterness into a cosmic joke" directive reads as writing-prompt language rather than character voice or lived detail. No bold structural or perspectival choice heightens stakes; the piece follows a linear observe-place-watch-resolve arc with no risk or surprise. Proximity to template quest structures (hero enters otherworld, receives magical call, completes task, returns transformed) without fresh inflection lowers the band (−0.8 derivative adjustment).</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>The cryptid researcher identity is mentioned in the opening and closing but never pressures a choice; the cover story (fascination with ancient weapons) is declared but not dramatized, and no decision on the page tests the undercover stance. Observation dominates; the protagonist listens, places an object, and watches effects unfold without agency-driven turns. Late ornamental: the researcher frame does not shape the middle beats or the closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The flint arrowhead appears early (pocket, setup gate clear), is handled in two beats (placed on moss, shatters), and its destruction triggers the light-burst that shifts the moss to silver (causal pressure +0.5, beat involvement +0.9, closure linkage +0.7). However, the arrowhead's "gravitationally playful pull" remains a described trait rather than a constraint that alters protagonist tactics, and the shattering occurs spontaneously without a choice or visible cost tied to its loss. Swappability moderate: a different enchanted object could fulfill the same role with minor edits (−0.5). Total adjusted: 5.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"A harmony untamed" is mentioned as a property of the moss's hum, recurs in the final image ("chorus of leaves that sang of a harmony untamed"), and is thematically restated multiple times. It does not shape stakes or constrain tactics; the protagonist never chooses between taming or preserving the harmony, nor does the concept alter options on the page. Lyric reprise present but ornamental (setup + closure participation gates met, middle development absent). Cap 4.6 for missing middle gate; ornamental use −0.5; label-only theme claim −0.3. Total: 3.2 (meets two-gate floor, decorative treatment limits upside).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Gravitationally playful" is a repeated descriptor for the arrowhead's pull and the final echo but never enables or constrains an on-page action with cost. The moss sways and the phone ripples, yet these are effects the protagonist observes rather than navigates. Label-only attribute without tactical tradeoff (−0.5), late reprise in final third without middle involvement (−0.4), swappable with "magnetic" or "enchanted" (−0.5). Total: 2.1.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Metamorphosis occurs when the static-laden voice shifts "from mournful to mischievous," the arrowhead shatters releasing light, and the moss turns silver. The action is signaled early as the creature's offer and appears across multiple beats (beast's voice, moss transformation). However, the protagonist does not choose to metamorphose anything; events unfold automatically once the arrowhead is placed. One distinct beat with causal involvement +0.4, closure linkage +0.7, early signal +0.3. Swappability moderate (could be "transform" or "transmute," −0.4); resolves without creating prior friction (−0.7). Total: 4.9.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The old cordless phone is present early (setup gate), the protagonist lifts the receiver and listens to the static-laden confessions, and the phone's voice shift triggers the metamorphosis (method shapes one key turn, middle gate met). The phone appears in the closure paragraph ("the phone fell silent") but is not causally active there (no closure participation gate). Two gates met, cap ~6.0. One beat involvement +0.4, causal pressure +0.5, early signal +0.3. Ornamental final mention (no closure participation, −0.3), swappable with "radio" or "recording device" (−0.5). Total: 4.3.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The herbalist's underground garden is established early with vivid sensory detail (phosphorescent moss, stone benches, iron chute) and houses all action. The garden supplies the moss (resource that responds to the arrowhead) and the phone pedestal, shaping one key turn when the vines lift the phone higher (middle gate met). The garden seals at the end, charging the final image with "untamed harmony" and "gravitationally playful" echo (closure participation gate met). All three gates met, eligible for ≥6.1. Beat involvement (moss, vines, sealing) +0.9, closure linkage +0.7, early signal +0.8. Spatial choreography unclear (−0.4), no constraint that alters protagonist tactics mid-scene (−0.5). Total: 5.6.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"After the missing return changed years ago" appears once in the phone monologue and is never clarified or used to tighten decisions. Time passes ("Night had settled," "pre dawn chill," "first light of sunrise") but the narrative clock does not pressure tactics or create urgency. No setup, no middle development, ornamental closure mention. Missing all three gates; cap 2.8. Vague and untracked (−0.5), summary-only (−0.3). Total: 1.8.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The motivation "to turn bitterness into a cosmic joke" is stated early as mission orders and recurs in the protagonist's reflection and final summary. It frames the task but is not dramatized through conflicted choices; the protagonist follows instructions without friction between want and cost. The ending declares success ("the mission to turn bitterness into a cosmic joke had succeeded") but the desire is told rather than enacted through on-page struggle. Setup gate clear, middle mention present (ordering the creature's sorrow), closure restatement present (all three gates met). Early signal +0.3, closure linkage (restated theme) +0.4, three mentions across beats +0.9. Told-only without friction (−0.8), resolves declaratively (−0.4). Total: 5.2.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Frostbitten hope" appears as a descriptor for the garden's frost, recurs in the protagonist's coat frost at the end, and is thematically restated in the closing lines ("frostbitten hope that turned the dark into a joke"). Tone is consistent—melancholic yet optimistic—but does not modulate with pressure; emotional intensity remains static from opening to closure. Setup + closure gates met (no middle modulation, missing gate cap 4.6). Early signal +0.3, closure linkage +0.7. Static mood without pressure shift (−0.5), label-only tonal claim (−0.3). Total: 4.7.</comment>
