<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Lira's motivation ("to teach silence how to comfort") is stated rather than demonstrated through contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. Her actions—monitoring noise, whispering counter-tones, adjusting speed—read as competent execution of a fixed method without internal conflict or credible struggle. The passengers remain abstract "dreamers wrapped in wool" without distinct pressure or relationship dynamics. Embodied emotion is thin; phrases like "felt the universe pause" and "the mission fulfilled" lean on abstraction rather than contradictory felt states.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (gondola operator, misty river, prism terrace) arrive early. The piece accumulates sensory images and repeats motifs (storm glass, whisper, silence) but no decisive change, renunciation, or conceptual repricing occurs on the page with visible cost. The ending ("the mission fulfilled") declares completion rather than demonstrating a before/after state with felt consequences. The sequence reads as transit-to-arrival rather than a meaningful tightening or deepening that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The prism terrace, storm glass vial, and brass ear are vivid and specific. Sensory detail is plentiful—"violet bands," "amber bloom," "silver droplets"—but remains decorative; the environment does not constrain a choice or alter tactics. Spatial choreography is coherent (gondola on river, terrace above water, far bank arrival). The setting charges atmosphere but does not pressure the protagonist's final action, keeping it below the 9-band gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The dominant stake—teaching silence to comfort wandering minds—is signaled early but never tested by reversal or tightening. Lira executes her method without resistance, error, or adaptation; no credible opposition or internal friction appears. The storm glass vial "burst into a cascade of silver" without causal trigger or cost, reading as ambient event rather than earned escalation. Agency is absent; Lira observes and facilitates but does not make a choice that forecloses a path with visible price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Theme (silence as comfort, transit as meditation) emerges from images but is over-stated in lines like "to teach silence how to comfort" and "let quiet become your guide." The final paragraph's "mission fulfilled" and "Dreams lingered" drift into soft moralizing rather than a resonant non-literal answer. Motifs (storm glass, silence, train whistle echo) recur but do not shift meaning; they accumulate texture without conceptual repricing. Subtext is thin; dialogue is absent and gesture minimal.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Single POV, stable third-limited distance. Perceptual signature is consistent—calm, observant, attuned to sound and light—but lacks idiosyncratic texture or pressure modulation. Diction occasionally drifts elevated ("vaulting hush," "fluidly logical") in ways that feel authorial rather than character-particular. No dialogue to test voice distinction. Free indirect style is clean, though some filter verbs ("felt," "watched") dilute immediacy without voice motivation. Purposeful compression in lyric mode is present but does not impose cost.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Figurative density is high without pattern payoff: "sunrise caught in glass," "fractured lullabies," "ship of glass over thought" pile ornament without advancing pressure. Paraphrase loops: "Each whisper was meant to teach silence" / "teach silence how to comfort" / "the silence was ready to teach." Template cadence: "She [verb]" openers recur across beats. Information density is low; many lines restate mood rather than advance situation. Rhythm does not modulate with urgency. Apply −0.8 for loops and figurative muddle in non-closure beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The gondola-as-meditation frame is familiar; the piece does not transform it through non-obvious synthesis or risky choice. Motifs (storm glass, silence, transit) are named rather than made inevitable through specific constraint. Emotional specificity is absent—passengers remain generic, Lira's arc reads as competent execution rather than discovery. The ending lands on soft epiphany without friction. No bold structural risk or conceptual leap; the premise reads as prompt-derived rather than author-driven vision.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Lira appears throughout but makes no decision that alters tactics or forecloses a path. She executes a fixed method (monitor, whisper, adjust speed) without adaptation or cost. Observation dominates; agency is absent.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Storm glass vial appears in multiple beats: carried, pulsing amber, bursting silver, opened again at night. Its color changes signal mood but do not constrain choice or shift tactics. The "cascade of silver" onto water is visually charged but does not reweight prior stakes or impose visible cost. Setup and development present; closure linkage weak.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"In transit" frames the journey from one bank to another and recurs as theme ("in transit across the river"). It shapes the setting (gondola, river crossing) but does not alter options or constrain tactics on the page. Logically present, thematically reinforced, but swappable with "journey" or "passage."</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Fluidly logical" appears once as label ("fluidly logical mixture of minerals") and again in dialogue echo ("fluidly logical in their simplicity"). It does not enable or constrain an action with cost. Label-only mention without tradeoff or visible consequence.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"Catalyze" is claimed ("the vial could catalyze calm") but not dramatized as action that narrows options. Lira's whispers and adjustments are gradual facilitation, not a distinct catalytic turn. The element is stated rather than used to redefine stakes or impose cost.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Monitoring noise levels is signaled early ("monitored noise levels with a small brass ear, noting each creak") and shapes Lira's method (whisper counter-tones when clanks rise). It informs her actions across beats but does not constrain a peak choice or participate in the closure. Functional middle development; weak closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Drifting prism terrace is vivid and present throughout: "perched," "beneath them swayed gently," "gliding like a ship of glass." It provides atmosphere and spatial anchor but does not pressure a choice or alter tactics. The terrace's sway and light-catching facets are decorative. Setup and development present; no closure constraint.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"In the quiet that follows a train whistle's echo" bookends the story (early and near end). It establishes tone and temporal frame but does not tighten decisions or track a live clock. Time passage is vague (journey, night falls) without urgency or deadline. Lyric reprise without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"To teach silence how to comfort" is stated as motivation ("Lira's motivation was clear") and guides her actions (monitor, whisper, adjust). The desire is told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants or visible cost. No friction between this goal and another impulse; competence without struggle. Functional but not conflicted.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Vaulting hush" recurs as descriptor ("vaulting hush of the world settled," "vaulting hush that settled on each heart," "carrying a piece of the vaulting hush"). Tone is coherent and modulates slightly (from active monitoring to night stillness) but remains a static, elevated mood. The final image ("the world exhaled") charges tone without decisive shift. Present across beats and at closure; mid-strong integration.</comment>
