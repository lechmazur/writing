<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The bell ringer remains a purely ornamental figure executing a single descriptive act without on-page choice, contradiction, or cost. Interiority consists entirely of abstract declarations ("certify wonder as essential") rather than embodied thought under pressure. The synesthetic trait is label-only; no micro-choice arises from hearing colors as notes. No relationship crucible, no mistake, noflawed stance—only a tourist performing a ritual.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>No identifiable closure unit: the bell ringer enters, sings, leaves, and imagines future travelers in an undifferentiated sequence. The orientation test is waived (setting anchors early), but no decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing occurs on the page. The final paragraph offers abstract moralizing ("beauty could be both still and moving") rather than a reweighted image with cost. Lens remains ambiguous (neither causal linkage nor accumulative pattern with break is taught); applying Hybrid by default, but even so, no meaningful tightening or deepening alters options or knowledge.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The ice cavern is vividly described with aurora-veined frost and breathing ice, and the amber sheet glows concretely. However, the setting does not constrain a single choice or alter tactics; it remains a painted backdrop. The micro-setting option (body, tool, object) is not leveraged to charge the closure, which itself is absent. Spatial choreography is clear, but the environment never pressures the protagonist.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The declared stake ("certify wonder as essential") is abstract and never tested by on-page opposition or cost. No tightening, reversal, or deepening occurs; the bell ringer executes her ritual without friction, failure, or tradeoff. Coincidence does not complicate because nothing complicates. No escalation under any lens; the final act is indistinguishable in pressure from the opening.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Theme is declared rather than emergent: "certify wonder as essential" appears verbatim, and the final paragraph moralizes ("beauty could be both still and moving, like a chisel's first strike frozen in time"). No earned wisdom from struggle; the bell ringer's ritual proceeds frictionlessly. The aurora and amber sheet recur but do not shift meaning or constrain choice. The ending explains rather than resonates.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>A consistent third-person limited voice with elevated diction ("oscillating repose," "unfettered itself") establishes a lyric register. However, the lexicon drifts into abstraction ("continuum," "riot of sky") that feels authorial rather than character-specific. No dialogue to assess. Perceptual signature is generic; the synesthetic filter is asserted but not rendered in concrete, idiosyncratic detail. Distance remains stable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Pervasive paraphrase loops and synonym churn: "sculpted hush" appears four times with near-identical phrasing; "oscillating repose" is repeated without evolving function; "through the colors of the aurora" recurs as scaffolding. Template cadence in the final third ("She imagined… She turned… her bells still ringing") flattens momentum. Mixed metaphors: sound "painted the frozen walls" and "split into rainbow chords" without coherent vehicle. Register drift into essay-like abstraction ("continuum," "vessel for the aurora's hues") during peak beats. Applying −1.4 for spread artifacts and −0.3 for final-third template cadence; cap disallows 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The core premise (synesthetic musician performing in ice cavern to "certify wonder") reads as a prompt assembly rather than a lived particular. No transformation of familiar material; the bell ringer's ritual could occur in any mystical setting with swapped nouns. The "sculpted hush" and "oscillating repose" are decorative coinages without stakes. No bold risk or non-obvious synthesis; the piece hedges into safe abstraction.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>The prism-song bell ringer is named and described but makes no on-page choice that alters tactics or stakes. She enters, performs, reflects, and leaves—a sequence of ornamental actions without decision or cost. Missing middle development and closure participation (no choice in the ending). Late penalty does not apply (present early), but swappability and ornamental use lower the score. Applying setup +0.3, one beat (performance) +0.4, minus ornamental −0.8, minus swappability −0.5, minus summary-only −0.4 (imagined future is recounted, not dramatized). Base 3.0 −1.3 net friction = 1.7; round down to 1.7. However, the character is focal throughout, so minor upward adjustment for continuous presence yields 2.3.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The amber music sheet is unwrapped, sings, and is placed back with "faint warmth," then pulses in the final paragraph. Two distinct beats (unwrap/sing, place back/pulse). Setup present, middle touch present, closure cameo present (all three gates). However, no choice is constrained by the sheet's properties; it functions as a passive prop. Applying setup +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure cameo +0.3 (not causally active), minus ornamental −0.7, minus swappability −0.4 (any glowing score would work). Base 3.0 +0.6 net = 3.6, round down 3.6. Adjusting slightly upward for the warmth detail and reprise structure yields 4.1.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Sculpted hush" is mentioned four times but never shapes a choice or alters tactics. It remains a thematic label rather than a stake-driving concept. Present in setup, middle, and ending (three gates), but purely ornamental. Applying setup +0.3, three mentions across beats +0.6 (but same function), closure cameo +0.2, minus ornamental −1.0, minus label-only −0.3. Base 3.0 −0.2 net = 2.8.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Synesthetically blessed" is declared in one sentence ("hearing colors as notes and seeing sounds as shifting ribbons of hue") but never enables or constrains an on-page action with cost. No visible tradeoff or tactical choice arises from this trait. Setup present, no middle development, no closure participation. Applying setup +0.3, one beat (label mention) +0.4, minus ornamental −0.8, minus label-only −0.3. Base 3.0 −0.4 net = 2.6; round down 2.6. Slight downward adjustment for zero causal work yields 2.1.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"Unfetter" appears three times: the music "unfettered itself," beauty "could be unfettered," and the sheet "ready to unfetter its melody again." None of these mentions drives a turn or redefines options; the word functions as decorative repetition. Setup present (first use early), middle and ending mentions present (three gates), but no causal pressure. Applying setup +0.5, three beats +1.0 (but redundant), minus ornamental −0.9, minus swappability −0.6 (could be "release," "spread," etc.). Base 3.0 +0.0 net = 3.0. Small upward adjustment for triple reprise structure yields 3.4.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"Through the colors of the aurora" is repeated three times as a descriptive phrase but never explains a method or shapes an attempt. The aurora is backdrop, not mechanism. Setup present, middle and ending mentions present (three gates), but no causal work. Applying setup +0.3, three beats +0.8 (but static), minus ornamental −0.9, minus swappability −0.5. Base 3.0 −0.3 net = 2.7, round down 2.7. Minor upward adjustment for visual coherence yields 2.9.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The ice cavern is vividly rendered (frost-veined walls, breathing ice, aurora light) and frames the entire action. Setup strong, middle use sustained, ending reprise present (three gates). The cavern "answered with a sigh" and the walls open "fissures of blue and green," suggesting minor interaction, but no choice is pressured by spatial constraint or resource. Applying setup +0.7, sustained presence across all beats +1.4, closure linkage (cavern remains in final image) +0.5, minus no causal constraint −0.6, minus postcard description −0.4. Base 3.0 +1.6 net = 4.6, round down 4.6. Upward adjustment for vivid sustained presence and lyric reprise yields 5.8.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>1.2</grade><comment>"At the moment a sculptor's chisel first strikes marble" appears once in the opening and once in the ending ("like a chisel's first strike frozen in time") but never functions as a timeframe or clock. No decision is tightened by temporal pressure. Setup cameo, no middle development, closure cameo. Applying setup +0.2 (mentioned but not functional), closure cameo +0.2, minus ornamental −0.9, minus swappability −0.6. Base 3.0 −1.1 net = 1.9; round down 1.9. Downward adjustment for zero temporal function yields 1.2.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>2.5</grade><comment>"To certify wonder as essential" is declared twice but never dramatized through conflicting wants or costs. The bell ringer feels her purpose and knows it "was not a single act but a continuum," but no on-page friction tests this desire. Setup present (early declaration), no middle choice shaped by this motive, closure echo present (three gates). Applying setup +0.4, closure echo +0.3, minus told-only −0.9, minus no friction −0.7. Base 3.0 −0.9 net = 2.1, round down 2.1. Small upward adjustment for thematic coherence yields 2.5.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Oscillating repose" appears three times as a tonal label but does not modulate with pressure (there is no pressure). The tone remains uniformly elevated and abstract throughout. Setup present, middle and ending mentions present (three gates), but static mood. Applying setup +0.4, three beats +0.8, minus static mood −0.7, minus label-only −0.4. Base 3.0 +0.1 net = 3.1, round down 3.1. Small upward adjustment for lyric consistency yields 3.6.</comment>
