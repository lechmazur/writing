<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The protagonist remains abstract—an "errant legend seeker" who performs symbolic gestures (raising a sundial, whispering to air) without embodied contradiction or mistake. Interiority consists of thematic declarations ("he felt a surge of purpose," "he realized that hindsight clarity") rather than character-particular perception under pressure. No meaningful choice forecloses a path with felt cost; the lock opens, the lies unravel, and he glides forward unchanged. Diagnostic label-speak ("thoughtfully clear," "serene upheaval") appears repeatedly in peak beats without dramatized friction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive promptly, so no penalty applies there. However, no on-page Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with visible cost occurs—the seeker boards, fixes a lock, and continues with identical resolve. The "architecture of lies" crumbles offstage in metaphor; no forfeiture or reconfiguration alters his stance. The inferred lens (Accumulative/Textural) could support lyric closure, but the final image recycles the opening frame without reweighting stakes or imposing felt cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The twilight barge canal and sundial are vivid, but setting functions as postcard backdrop rather than constraint. The rusted lock offers a brief tactical obstacle, yet its mechanics remain vague ("aligning the sundial's gnomon with the rusted gears") and success arrives without spatial friction or resource trade-off. Sensory detail (violet sky, cool water, stone arches) decorates rather than pressures choice, and the city's spires at the end serve as symbolic flourish, not lived environment.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"to understand the architecture of lies"—is declared but never tested by a choice that narrows options or imposes visible cost. The lock opens through unexplained sundial alignment (no failure, no alternate path closed), and the "lies unravel" in passive metaphor. Coincidence (the sundial's "inner logic") solves the obstacle the protagonist did not help create. No reversal or deepening alters tactics; pressure remains static assertion rather than escalating constraint.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Theme (truth vs. lies, hindsight clarity) is stated repeatedly in abstract terms ("architecture of lies," "false structures," "salvage truth") rather than arising from concrete particulars. The final image recycles the opening's twilight canal and radio hum without reweighting prior material or offering a non-literal answer to the central question. The sundial as motif is mentioned often but does not constrain a climactic choice or charge the closure with cost; it remains decorative.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Voice maintains stable third-person limited and avoids mid-paragraph head-hopping. However, diction drifts into elevated abstraction ("serene upheaval," "architecture of lies," "thoughtfully clear") that clashes with urgent action beats, and perceptual signature remains generic rather than character-specific. Purposeful compression is attempted through ellipsis and lyric phrasing, but the pattern is not taught early enough to anchor reader expectation, and elision does not impose cost or create friction paid off on the page.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Template cadence dominates: "He felt...," "He realized...," "He whispered..." appear in adjacent beats without variation. Paraphrase loops recur—"architecture of lies" and "salvage" churn through synonym substitutes (unravel, crumble, set free) across multiple paragraphs without new pressure. Metaphors stack without coherent vehicle ("lies unravel," "crumble like sandcastles," "shining thoughtfully clear") and several contradict physics (a sundial tracing "the exact hour as if the sun were still present" in twilight). Stock phrases ("training instincts," "silence of morning radio") repeat as ornament. These artifacts pervade and touch the closure beat, triggering −1.7 and disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The core premise—mystical navigation via antique sundial to dismantle civic myths—echoes familiar allegorical templates (seeker + symbolic tool + metaphysical city) without transformation through lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The sundial's mechanics remain unexplained wish-fulfillment, and the resolution (lies crumble, truth prevails) follows a predictable arc. No bold structural risk or emotional specificity distinguishes this execution from stock quest-for-truth narratives.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The errant legend seeker is named early and remains present throughout, but his choices (raising the sundial, aligning gears, whispering a promise) do not create turns—outcomes arrive through coincidence and metaphor. He observes and performs symbolic gestures without agency-driven consequence. Late first appearance penalty does not apply, but swappability (any seeker archetype) and ornamental use lower the score. Present in closure, but not causally active there.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The antique pocket sundial is introduced early (paragraph two), used at the lock (mid-story beat), and returns warm in his palm and tucked in his satchel at closure. However, its mechanism is unexplained and success is convenient—gears align without dramatized friction. It shapes two beats (lock fix, final tucking) but does not impose visible cost or narrow options. Present in closure via tactile mention, yet not irreplaceable—any mystical tool could substitute with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Hindsight clarity appears as theme label ("hindsight clarity was not merely a recollection, but a tool," "to read the shadows with hindsight clarity") but never constrains a present-tense decision or alters tactics. It is told rather than dramatized, serving as conceptual decoration without on-page cost. Present in the final paragraph as abstract promise, but ornamental and easily removed without breaking story logic.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Thoughtfully clear is used as a label ("thoughtfully clear," "heart thoughtfully clear") without enabling or constraining action with cost. It describes an emotional state rather than driving a trade-off or tactical choice. Mentioned twice but purely ornamental; no visible consequence flows from this attribute on the page.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Salvage is introduced in paragraph seven ("his chance to salvage the forgotten mechanism"), used at the lock, and repeated as motif ("salvage not only the lock," "salvage truth," "salvage the stories"). It shapes the middle beat (lock repair) but the action itself is vague and success arrives without friction. Present in closure paragraph via repeated promise, yet swappable with "repair," "restore," or "redeem" with minimal structural impact. Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>By training instincts appears once in the lock-repair beat ("moved by training instincts") and again in the final section ("to train instincts anew"), but the mechanics are never signaled or demonstrated. It serves as label-only justification for unexplained success rather than shaping attempts or imposing cost. Present in closure as abstract theme, but ornamental and easily cut.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Twilight barge canal is established in the opening line, provides the lock obstacle (middle beat), and returns in the final paragraph to frame closure. It offers spatial continuity and a mild constraint (the rusted lock) that the protagonist solves, affecting one beat's tactics. However, the canal itself does not pressure final choices or supply resources that alter the ending image beyond framing. Present across all three gates with moderate causal role; lyric reprise reweights atmosphere but not dominant stake cost.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>By the silence of morning radio is introduced in paragraph four ("the silence of morning radio would soon replace it"), returns in paragraph sixteen, and closes the story in the final line. However, time remains vague—no live clock tightens decisions or alters tactics. The radio silence functions as atmospheric motif rather than temporal constraint. Present in closure, but ornamental; removing it would not break story logic or escalation.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>To understand the architecture of lies is stated in paragraph five and repeated across multiple beats ("felt the architecture of lies unravel," "architecture of lies crumble"), but the desire is never dramatized through conflicting wants or on-page friction. The seeker succeeds without trade-off, and the motivation functions as thematic label rather than driver of costly choice. Present in setup and closure, but told rather than tested; swappable with any abstract quest.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Serene upheaval is introduced in paragraph ten, repeated in paragraph eighteen, and closes the piece in paragraph twenty-seven. The phrase attempts tonal coherence, but the oxymoron remains assertion rather than embodied through rhythm or turn. Tone stays static—calm symbolic movement without modulation under pressure—and the final image recycles the opening's tranquility without charging it with cost. Present in closure, functional but not indispensable; genre-appropriate mood could replace it.</comment>
