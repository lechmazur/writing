<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to plant luminous vines is signaled early and her actions are consistent, but her interior life remains abstract—"protected vulnerability" and "wistfully pragmatic" are labels rather than embodied contradictions acting in scene. The choice to plant vines feels preordained rather than earned through on-page pressure; no competing impulse or cost visibly forecloses a path. The lockmaster's tooth adjusts a latch, but this micro-choice carries no felt stakes or visible trade-off that would elevate characterization into the high band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: luminous vines unfurl, spreading light into alleys, and the "quivering hush" settles into "steady breath." Closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the harbor accepts her offering; darkness recoils; vines still glow at dawn), but the cost remains implied rather than undeniable on the page—Mara whispers a promise to return, yet no visible price (time, stamina, social credit, forfeited alternative) is dramatized. Orientation anchors clearly by the opening lines (who, where, when). One meaningful deepening occurs (vines catch moonlight and spread), satisfying length expectations, but the absence of legible cost at closure prevents entry into the 7+ band.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The harbor, fire escape, and rosebush anchor space and atmosphere early; sensory details (silver ribbons on tide, rusted metal, sputtering lanterns) are vivid and filtered through Mara's purposeful gaze. The vines and their glow constrain her method (she adjusts a latch, plants along the ledge) and charge the final image (still glowing at dawn), satisfying the 9+ gate test for environment shaping choice. However, spatial choreography blurs—her position on "the narrow ledge" versus "the dock's edge" is not clearly tracked, and the alleys' relationship to the fire escape remains vague, capping the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: Mara wants to "instill a gentle light into the harbor's darkest corners" to keep "night's secrets from turning to dread." The vines unfurl and spread light, darkness recoils—one meaningful tightening under the Accumulative lens. Yet no reversal or live cost appears: planting proceeds without obstacle, the harbor "accepts" without resistance, and the resolution feels granted rather than earned through protagonist agency under pressure. No visible price (stamina drain, social exposure, tool failure) alters tactics or forecloses an option on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the image pattern (light versus darkness, nurturing forgotten spaces, "protected vulnerability") rather than overt statement, and the vines' glow at dawn offers a non-literal answer to the question of care. However, the final paragraph's explicit thematic gloss—"to reflect light into dark corners was the truest form of care"—borders on moralizing and undercuts resonance. The lockmaster's tooth and rosebush recur but function as atmospheric tokens rather than motifs that constrain choice or accumulate pressure toward closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping; perceptual signature (moonbeams, feeble glow, quivering hush) reads as Mara's selective attention. However, diction drifts into elevated register ("luminous harbor by moonlight, silver ribbons dancing," "wistfully pragmatic," "photon reflected") that feels imposed rather than voice-motivated, and filter verbs cluster in key beats ("She felt a protected vulnerability," "she felt the quivering hush settle"). Syntactic patterns repeat (many sentences open with "She [verb]" or "The [noun]"), flattening rhythm under pressure and reducing immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Figurative language saturates nearly every sentence without pattern-teaching or payoff ("silver ribbons dancing," "quivering hush lingered like a breath held," "darkness recoiled," "harbor hummed a lullaby"), triggering the overwriting density penalty (−0.5). Paraphrase loops appear: "protected vulnerability" recurs as label, "quivering hush" is restated four times without added pressure, and the phrase "rhythm of oars in water" appears twice in identical form. Template cadence runs through multiple "She [verb]" stems and "The [noun]" openers, further reducing propulsion (−0.6). Combined artifacts touch the closure paragraph ("the harbor's moonlit waters reflected...the resilient glow"), disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8 per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The fire-escape gardener premise is specific, and planting luminous vines in a harbor setting offers a fresh angle. However, the emotional arc (solitary caretaker nurtures beauty in forgotten spaces, finds peace) fits a familiar template without transformation through concrete cost or moral friction. The lockmaster's tooth and rosebush feel like ornamental quirks rather than irreplaceable particulars that drive turns. No bold risk heightens stakes; the story stays in the safety middle, avoiding both failure and daring synthesis.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Mara is present throughout and her decision to plant vines is the story's central action. She adjusts the latch (beat 1), plants and tends vines (beat 2), and whispers a promise at closure (beat 3), hitting all three gates (setup, development, payoff). However, her choices feel preordained rather than forged under pressure; no live option is narrowed or cost paid. The role is essential to plot but swappable in emotional texture—another solitary nurturer could inhabit the arc with minor edits. Functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The lockmaster's bitting gauge tooth appears in the satchel early (setup) and is used once to "adjust a tiny latch that guarded the seed pod's release" (middle beat), then returned to the satchel at closure (payoff). Two-gate participation (setup, middle) with a cameo reprise. However, the object's unique properties (a bitting gauge tooth) do not matter—any small tool could unlock the latch with identical effect. Swappable without structural change, capping the score per the swappability limiter.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Quivering hush" is signaled early ("a quivering hush lingered like a breath held"), recurs in the middle ("the hush that trembled like a shiver"), and returns at closure ("the quivering hush now a settled chorus"). Hits all three gates (setup, development, payoff). The concept anchors tone and modulates (unsettled → steady), but it does not constrain a choice or alter tactics—Mara plants regardless of the hush's state. The phrase functions as atmospheric motif rather than stake-shaping pressure, earning mid-band credit for coherent recurrence without causal force.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Wistfully pragmatic" is named once in exposition ("Each vine was tended with a wistfully pragmatic care") and echoed at the end ("wistfully pragmatic devotion"). The trait is told, not dramatized—no visible trade-off between wistfulness and pragmatism shapes a beat. Label-only use without on-page cost, hitting setup and payoff gates but missing middle development. Ornamental integration, trending low per the scoring guidance.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Instill" is signaled in the inciting decision ("she decided to instill a gentle light") and executed through planting vines (middle beats) that spread luminescence and "keep the night's secrets from turning to dread" (closure linkage). The action drives all three gates and shapes the dominant stake. However, the verb itself is generic—"plant," "spread," or "create" would serve equally well with no structural loss. Strong beat involvement and closure linkage elevate the score, but swappability with near-synonyms prevents high-band entry.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"With the rhythm of oars in water" appears twice: once when Mara's hands move "in circles, mimicking the slow pull of oars" (middle beat) and again as a simile for the harbor's lullaby (closure atmosphere). Hits development and payoff gates. The method is signaled and its rhythm matters to the vine's unfurling, but the mechanics are vague—how does circular motion mimic oars, and why does that rhythm enable growth? Functional presence without irreplaceability; a different rhythmic metaphor could replace it with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The "luminous harbor by moonlight" anchors the opening line (setup), provides the stage for planting (middle), and charges the final image ("the harbor's moonlit waters reflected...the resilient glow"). All three gates met. The setting supplies resources (fire escape ledges, moon for reflection) and the harbor "accepts" Mara's offering, participating in closure. However, the harbor does not constrain her tactics—no spatial pressure or environmental obstacle alters her method. Strong atmospheric integration with closure linkage, but lacks the micro-setting constraint that would push into the 7+ band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the final petal drops from the old rosebush" is named as "a ritual marking the night's true beginning" (setup) and Mara acts after this marker. The petal-drop signals readiness but does not create urgency or tighten tactics—no clock forces faster planting or alters her method. The element hits setup but lacks middle development (no second reference to time pressure) and does not shape closure. Present but ornamental, fitting the 3.0–4.9 band for functional-but-replaceable use.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"To reflect light into dark corners" is articulated mid-story as Mara's purpose ("each photon reflected into the forgotten corners would keep the night's secrets from turning to dread") and echoed at closure ("to reflect light into dark corners was the truest form of care"). The motivation drives her planting decision and shapes the dominant stake across all three gates. However, the desire is told rather than dramatized through friction—no competing want or fear tests her commitment, and no visible cost attaches to the choice. Solid beat involvement and closure linkage without on-page conflict or price.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Protected vulnerability" is named early ("She felt a protected vulnerability, aware that each step exposed her heart yet shielded it with purpose") and echoed at closure ("In that protected vulnerability, Mara felt a rare peace"). The tone is coherent and modulates from tentative exposure to settled acceptance, hitting setup and payoff. However, the phrase is told as a label rather than embodied through contradictory action or sensory detail, and it does not charge the final image with undeniable pressure. Lyric reprise without causal force or felt cost, landing mid-band per the resonance allowance.</comment>
