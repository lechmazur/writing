<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The fisher remains passive throughout, observing and following garden cues rather than making choices under pressure. Interiority consists largely of abstract poetic labels ("vessel that transliterates emotions") without embodied contradiction or micro-decisions. The character's "cool-headed" trait is asserted but never tested; no internal conflict forces a difficult trade-off. The ending describes him casting a net but no visible cost forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive promptly. The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens with sound-wave imagery building toward the final casting moment. However, no decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing with felt cost occurs on the page—the fisher simply steps back into water with his line glinting, a static tableau. The closure lacks visible or conceptual price; the echo "settles" without altering options or foreclosing a path.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The sound wave garden is vividly rendered with sensory specificity (swaying reeds, mossy stones, midnight flowers). The rail spike and garden environment recur across beats and charge the final image. However, setting functions primarily as atmospheric backdrop rather than constraining choices or supplying resources that alter tactics. The micro-setting (spike, water's edge) participates in closure but does not force a trade-off.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—catching the goddess's echo—is signaled early but never tested by opposition or cost. The fisher follows garden cues in a passive sequence without reversals or tightening choices. The spike's use and the final casting are described as smooth successes with no friction, failed attempt, or visible price. Agency is absent; coincidence (garden responding, spike humming) drives every turn.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Theme of longing and connection emerges through sustained imagery (sound waves, constellations, feral lullaby). The final image—casting a net for notes rather than fish—offers a non-literal answer without overt moralizing. However, the resolution is stated rather than enacted with cost: "to catch the echo…was not to trap it, but to set it free" reads as summary wisdom rather than earned insight from specific struggle.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The prose maintains a consistent lyric register with distinct perceptual signature (sound as tactile, emotions as currents). No dialogue present. POV remains stable in third-person limited. However, elevated diction ("transliterates," "voicing silence") occasionally drifts from a fisher's plausible lexicon without voice-motivated justification. Psychic distance is controlled, and the narrative stance fits the lyric mode.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and sensory texture is dense, but figurative language appears in nearly every sentence without escalation or pattern payoff (decorative "sleepwalking constellations," "feral lullaby," "voicing silence"). Template cadence in mid-section: multiple "He [verb]" and "The garden [verb]" stems across adjacent sentences. Paraphrase loop between "transliterates emotions into currents" (early) and "translates his quiet longing into a bright thread" (late). These artifacts cluster but do not obscure closure, so caps remain moderate.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of sound-as-physicality and constellation mythology is atmospheric but does not transform familiar mystical-quest templates. The fisher's passive journey—following supernatural cues to a pre-ordained revelation—echoes stock quest structures without fresh moral calculus or character-driven turns. The "feral lullaby" and "voicing silence" phrases offer poetic texture but no structural ingenuity. Swapping names and setting would leave the emotional arc unchanged.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>The cool-headed fisher is present throughout but makes no key decisions; he observes, follows garden cues, and responds to environmental prompts. His "cool-headed" trait is mentioned once in the opening and never tested by pressure or contradiction. No choice alters tactics or stakes.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The rail spike appears early (setup), is lowered into earth and raised skyward (middle beats), and rests warm beside water at closure (payoff). It enables the climactic shout and merges with constellations, shaping two beats. However, its unique properties (rustedness, ability to "pierce the veil") are asserted rather than demonstrated through cost or constraint, and a generic magical tool could substitute with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Sleepwalking constellations are described vividly and recur across the story, seeding atmosphere. They tangle at the climactic moment and "learn a new dance" at closure. However, they do not constrain the fisher's choices or alter available tactics; they respond passively to his actions rather than shaping stakes. The concept enriches theme but remains ornamental to plot.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"Transliterates emotions" is mentioned twice as a label (fisher's mind, garden's action, spike's symbols) but never enacted as a visible mechanism with cost. No scene shows the fisher choosing to translate an emotion or paying a price for the trait. The attribute functions as metaphorical description rather than a plot-active ability.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Zigzag" appears once in mid-story as a description of the hymn's trail. The fisher's actual movement is "left, then right, then forward" but this choreography does not create a turn or redefine options. The action is easily swappable with "winding" or "spiraling" without structural impact.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Voicing silence" is introduced at the climactic beat when the fisher shouts "a wordless chant that breathed the silence of the void." The method appears late (beyond the 40% mark) and is used once, preventing higher integration. It enables the spike's echo but does not shape prior attempts or constrain tactics. Cap applies: 4.6 for late introduction.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The sound wave garden is present from the opening, its pathways and reeds guide the fisher's steps across three beats, and the garden's "sound waves settled" frames the closure. The setting provides cues (pulses coax direction, reeds sing) that alter the fisher's movement and enable the final casting. Spatial elements (mossy stones, water's edge) are handled on the page and constrain positioning.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"When patterns break themselves" is introduced early as the timeframe condition. The moment arrives mid-story when constellations tangle and "the world holds its breath for a single note," prompting the fisher to lift the spike. The timeframe triggers one key beat but does not create a ticking clock that alters multiple tactics. It functions as a signal more than a pressure mechanism.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The motivation to catch the goddess's echo is stated early and recurs across beats, guiding the fisher's actions (setting line, following hymn, shouting chant). However, the desire is never dramatized through conflicting wants or visible cost; the fisher pursues it smoothly without friction, loss, or trade-off. The motivation drives continuity but lacks internal conflict.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Feral lullaby" is introduced early, recurs three times (goddess's laughter, final echo, universe's spirit), and charges the closure image. The tone blends wildness and tenderness coherently across turns. However, the tone is consistent rather than modulating with pressure; it does not shift cadence or texture under the climactic beat, remaining a static atmospheric layer.</comment>
