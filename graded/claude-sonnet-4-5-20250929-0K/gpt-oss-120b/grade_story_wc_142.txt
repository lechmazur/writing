<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Mira remains a label construct throughout—"culture shock absorber" with an "orderly intuitive mind" never translates into embodied contradictions or micro-choices under pressure. Her dual allegiance is declared but never dramatized as competing impulses in a single beat; we're told she feels torn but see only smooth execution. The council, investors, dock workers, illustrators, elders, and children populate the margins without applying relational pressure or forcing visible trade-offs. Internal life is summarized ("her chest expanding with hopeful desperation") rather than enacted through sensory degradation or contradictory wants colliding on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation debt: who/where/when anchor by ~120 words is met, but the "when" remains vague (pre-privatization feels like setting rather than a ticking clock). The drive lens wavers—causal setup (foundation chip → graffiti → layout shift) competes with accumulative/textural carnival texture, and the ending opts for a summary resolution ("council postponed privatization") that occurs off-page, robbing closure of on-page cost. The phoenix mural and glass-cased chip are asserted to carry weight but arrive as decoration rather than a dramatized turn that forecloses a path. No visible price is paid in the final image; Mira "breathes out" in relief without renouncing an option or suffering a felt loss.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The raft city's perpetual carnival supplies vivid sensory anchors (flickering lights, creaking hulls, river mist, graffiti walls) filtered through a collective rather than Mira's occupational or emotional lens. Spatial choreography is loose—illustrators "spray coded silhouettes" and stalls "shift" without showing Mira navigating distances, handling tools, or choosing which artisan quarter alley to prioritize. The foundation chip's glass case at river's edge and the phoenix mural charge the ending image, lifting the score, but the carnival itself remains a postcard backdrop rather than a constraint that narrows Mira's tactical options during the reorganization beats.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>One dominant stake—prevent privatization by reorganizing the carnival—is signaled early, but escalation is weak: Mira discovers the chip, instructs illustrators, and shifts stalls in a smooth sequence with no on-page resistance, miscalculation, or tactical cost. The investors "prepare legal briefs" off-stage and arrive only to witness the fait accompli; no confrontation or reversal tests Mira's commitment. The council's postponement is told rather than shown, and no prior choice is foreclosed—Mira retains loyalty to both dock workers and carnival soul without visible sacrifice. Agency reads as coordination rather than decision under pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Theme—community resilience against commodification—emerges through the graffiti network and the foundation chip as symbols of collective memory, which is purposeful. However, the final paragraph moralizes overtly ("even the smallest piece can anchor an entire community") and the phoenix mural functions as an on-the-nose rebirth icon rather than a non-literal answer. Mira's role as "culture shock absorber" who "learned to balance chaos with order" restates the premise without dramatizing a cost or contradiction that reweights it. Subtext operates in the encoded graffiti conceit but flattens when the ending explains rather than enacts the victory.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV holds cleanly with no head-hopping, and the prose carries a lyric, manifesto-tinged voice ("perpetual carnival," "anarchic joy," "hopeful desperation") that distinguishes the narrator's stance. However, psychic distance drifts: Mira's perceptual signature is generic ("she realized," "she discovered") rather than idiosyncratic, and elevated diction ("reclaimed streets," "clandestine network") clashes with the immediate sensory texture of carnival life. No dialogue appears, so character distinction through speech is not tested. Filter verbs ("seeing," "knowing") appear frequently but do not obscure immediacy enough to trigger heavy penalty.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade: "reorganize the community" / "reorganization of stalls" / "reorganize the layout" / "reorganize again"; "hopeful desperation" appears three times with identical phrasing. Template cadence: "She discovered… She gathered… She sent…" structures multiple beats identically. The final third stacks these artifacts ("The council, seeing… Mira breathed out… The foundation stone chip… Children played… She watched…"), flattening propulsion. Figurative language is vivid ("floating circus," "kaleidoscope of music") but mixed ("phoenix looping around the foundation stone chip" conflates image and object incoherently). Information density is high in the graffiti-decoding passage but diluted by summary in the ending's recap mode.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The raft city carnival and encoded-graffiti resistance network offer a fresh synthesis, and the foundation chip as communal blueprint is a specific anchor. However, the "culture shock absorber prevents gentrification via hidden art" premise closely follows workshop templates (guardian figure, symbolic object, community vs. capital), and the execution does not transform it—Mira succeeds without setback, the investors are faceless, and the phoenix mural arrives as a convenient symbol rather than an earned inevitability. The dual-allegiance conceit and "orderly intuitive" trait remain labels without forcing a non-obvious choice that grows from prior particulars.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Mira is present throughout and her role as culture shock absorber frames the mission, but her decisions (gather illustrators, send phoenix message) are coordinative rather than turning points that narrow options. No on-page beat shows her choosing between dock workers and carnival soul with visible cost; the dual allegiance is declared but not dramatized. She observes and orchestrates but does not face a choice that alters tactics or forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The foundation stone chip appears early (discovery beat), returns in the graffiti-encoding middle sequence (map blueprint), and sits in the glass case at closure, reweighted as a communal anchor. However, its mechanics remain vague—"viewed under lantern light" is mentioned once without showing Mira or others using it on the page in a second distinct beat. The chip enables the graffiti network but is not handled or constrained by in a way that alters tactics; its closure presence is symbolic rather than causally active.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Dual allegiance is announced ("her loyalty to the carnival's anarchic joy and her secret promise to the old dock workers") and invoked again at the ending, shaping the thematic stakes. However, it never forces an on-page choice where one loyalty must be sacrificed or prioritized—Mira satisfies both without friction. The concept functions as theme backdrop rather than a decision constraint that changes tactics or imposes cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"Orderly intuitive mind" is a label that appears twice (opening exposition, final line) but never constrains or enables a specific action. We are told it lets her "see patterns" and "chart new routes," yet no beat dramatizes a tradeoff between order and intuition, or shows the trait causing a miscalculation or enabling a tactical breakthrough. The attribute is ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Reorganization is the central action: Mira reorganizes the carnival layout by shifting stalls away from the artisan quarter to the riverbank, a change that the council and community recognize at closure. The action is signaled early, developed in the middle (graffiti-directed layout shift), and cited in the ending ("the carnival's layout had already shifted"). However, the reorganization itself occurs off-page in summary—we do not see Mira moving a single stall or negotiating with a stallholder—so the action's causal texture is thin.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The graffiti method is introduced early (foundation chip map → graffiti symbols), developed across multiple beats (illustrators painting, residents decoding, meeting points revealed), and directly shapes the ending (phoenix mural draws every eye, council postpones). The mechanics are explained rather than dramatized—no beat shows Mira or a resident decoding a specific symbol on the page—but the method is causally active and returns with charged meaning at closure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The perpetual carnival on raft city is vividly described and present throughout, providing sensory texture (lights, hulls, banners, river). However, the setting functions as backdrop rather than pressure: the raft's mobility, the river's current, or the carnival's layout do not constrain Mira's choices or supply a resource that alters tactics. The artisan quarter and riverbank stalls are mentioned but not shown as spatial problems Mira must navigate. The setting's role is atmospheric, not tactical.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Before privatization" is signaled early and invoked at closure ("postponed privatization"), framing the timeframe as urgent. However, no on-page clock tightens Mira's decisions—we do not know how soon the investors will arrive or what deadline she faces. The investors' legal briefs are prepared "meanwhile" off-stage, and their arrival "the next day" is told rather than tracked. The timeframe is present but does not function as a live ticking constraint that alters tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The motivation to navigate gentrification (via preventing privatization and protecting the community) is Mira's explicit goal, stated early and pursued across beats (chip discovery, graffiti network, layout reorganization). The council's postponement at closure validates the motivation's success. However, the motivation is never dramatized as conflicted—Mira does not face a choice where protecting the carnival might harm the dock workers or vice versa—so the friction between wants and costs remains abstract.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Hopeful desperation" is named three times with identical phrasing and tonally colors the opening and ending (Mira "breathed out, her chest expanding with hopeful desperation"). The tone is coherent but static—no modulation across pressure beats, and the final image opts for relief rather than sharpening the desperation or hope into a charged contradiction. The tone is asserted rather than enacted through rhythm or image that crystallizes both hope and cost in the final lines.</comment>
