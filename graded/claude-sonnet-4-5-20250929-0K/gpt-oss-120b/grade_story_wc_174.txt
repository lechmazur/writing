<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Selene is defined primarily through abstract labels ("urbane calligrapher," "uncommonly serene") rather than embodied action under pressure. The reflective mode dominates—her memories of puppet shows, the tavern argument, and ethical storytelling philosophies—but no concrete choice or renunciation occurs on the page with visible cost. The final "promise" and rehearsed reversals are told intentions, not dramatized decisions that foreclose a path. Interior texture reads generic: "half-lit epiphany settle like ash" and "quiet promise" are placeholder feelings without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>No on-page closure effect. Selene enters the dome seeking epiphanies, arranges dishes, watches the ember wane, leaves with a "promise" to reverse narratives in future puppet shows—but no decisive change, renunciation with felt cost, or conceptual repricing occurs within the text. The piece is purely setup and reflection; the stated ethical project remains a told intention rather than a dramatized stake that tightens or reweights. Orientation is established early (dome, night, calligrapher), but the drive lens remains ambiguous: neither causal linkage, accumulative density increase, nor situational crystallization produces a legible before/after on the page. The ending recaps the premise without closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The dome setting is described with atmospheric detail ("rusted cathedral," parabolic dishes "turned inward"), and the campfire stick is handled across multiple beats. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; it functions as a symbolic backdrop for Selene's reflections. Spatial choreography is clear but static—she arranges dishes, places the stick, lifts it, lets the fire die—without the setting supplying resources or pressure that affects outcome. The micro-setting (body, tool) is present but ornamental, never driving a decision or charging the final image with cost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—exploring ethical storytelling—is signaled early but never tested on the page. Selene faces no opposition, makes no trade-off, and encounters no reversal; the dome visit is a contemplative interlude in which her convictions are restated rather than pressured. The "heated argument" in the tavern is backstory, not dramatized conflict. No meaningful escalation under any lens: no causal tightening (no decision narrows options), no accumulative deepening (no pattern break reweights cost), no situational crystallization (no stance forced by coherent pressure). Agency is absent; she rehearses future intentions without on-page cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Theme—ethical storytelling that reverses exploitation—is stated repeatedly but emerges from authorial assertion rather than dramatized particulars. The puppet shows, strings as "lifelines," and reversal metaphor are told concepts, not shown through concrete action or earned insight. The final image ("strings of conscience unspooling...like ribbons of starlight") is abstract and decorative, offering no non-literal answer or resonant reconfiguration. The piece leans heavily on prompt labels ("half-lit epiphany," "meteor hush," "subversive puppet shows") as thematic shorthand without grounding them in specific events or moral calculus.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Single-POV third limited is stable, and diction attempts an elevated register ("urbane," "uncommonly serene," "conscience unspooling"). However, the prose lacks a distinct perceptual signature: Selene's way of noticing is generic rather than character-specific, and interiority is told in abstract phrasing ("half-lit revelation," "quiet promise") rather than filtered through her calligrapher's craft or idiosyncratic bias. No dialogue appears. Distance is consistent but the voice reads like committee consensus—lyrical but not anchored to this character's particular mind under pressure. Purposeful elision is minimal; the reflection mode is transparent but uniform.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Heavy overwriting and pattern artifacts pervade. Metaphor density is high without pattern-teaching: "rusted cathedral," "quiet comet," "meteor hush," "ribbons of starlight" cluster in adjacent lines, often mixed or contradictory. Paraphrase loops abound: "half-lit epiphanies" appears four times; "uncommonly serene" twice; "meteor hush" three times; "campfire story stick" seven times with synonym churn ("ember-kissed tip," "beacon," "lantern"). Template cadence: runs of "She [verb]" sentence openers across the middle third. Register drift into elevated abstraction ("conscience unspooling," "ethical wonder") clashes with the concrete dome setting. No loops in the closure beat, but artifacts touch it ("soft, half-lit chorus of truth").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The premise—calligrapher practicing ethical storytelling in a decommissioned radar dome—combines required elements but reads as checklist assembly rather than organic synthesis. The puppet shows, meteor hush, half-lit epiphanies, and reversal motif are prompt labels invoked without transformation through lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The emotional arc (contemplation → promise) is generic; swap the occupation and setting, and the structure holds unchanged. No bold risk or fresh inflection emerges; the piece hedges in lyrical abstraction without committing to a dramatized choice or earned paradox.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>Selene is present throughout but makes no on-page decision that alters tactics or outcome. She arranges dishes, observes, reflects, and leaves with a rehearsed intention. No choice creates a key turn; she is observer, not agent. Setup gate met (first line), development gate absent (no middle choice constrained by this character trait), payoff gate absent (no decision in the ending). Ornamental presence without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The campfire story stick appears in multiple beats: salvaged from distant woods, flickering tip, placed at the dome's heart, lifted to brighten the ember, tucked under her arm as she leaves. Setup gate met (paragraph one), development gate met (she arranges it and lifts it in the dome), payoff gate met (she carries it away as a memory). However, the stick does not constrain a choice or enable a tactic under stress; it functions as atmospheric prop. Reweighted meaning is asserted ("lantern of ethical wonder") but not dramatized with cost. Functional presence across beats without irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Half-lit epiphanies" is invoked four times as thematic label but never shapes stakes or alters tactics. Selene seeks them (told want), experiences one as the ember pulses (told revelation), and expects "more to come" (told future). Setup gate met (first paragraph), development gate weak (the "epiphany" in the dome is described, not dramatized as a decision), payoff gate weak (the ending recaps the concept without cost). The concept is ornamental, a prompt echo without on-page friction or consequence.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"Uncommonly serene" appears twice as a label ("movements uncommonly serene," "revelation was uncommonly serene") but never constrains or enables action with cost. Setup gate met (first paragraph), development gate absent (the trait does not shape a choice), payoff gate absent (not mentioned or visible in the ending). Told attribute without embodied tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Reverse" appears six times in various forms: radar dishes "in reverse," "reverse the usual exploitation," "reverse the old hierarchy," "reversal of narratives," puppet strings "reversed." Setup gate met (dishes positioned early), development gate weak (reversal is a thematic claim, not a dramatized action), payoff gate met (she rehearses "the reversal of narratives" in the ending). The action is metaphorical and told; no major turn on the page depends on a concrete reversal with cost. Swappable with other ethical-framework verbs. Present but not causal.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Subversive puppet shows in seedy bars" is described in backstory (paragraphs 9–11) and invoked in the ending ("the seedy bars waited"). Setup gate met (mid-story flashback), development gate weak (the shows are past events, not on-page method), payoff gate met (she walks toward future shows). The method is told rather than dramatized; its mechanics do not shape an attempt or choice in the present scene. Summary-only use without causal pressure. Late first appearance (after 40% mark) triggers cap at 4.6.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The decommissioned radar dome is the sole setting, described across the opening and middle (parabolic dishes, cracked concrete, echo). Setup gate met (first line), development gate met (she arranges dishes, the dome's acoustics carry the argument's echo), payoff gate weak (she leaves the dome). The setting provides atmosphere but does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome; spatial choreography is clear but static. One distinct beat involvement (arranging dishes) without causal pressure or closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>The "hush left behind by a heated argument" is mentioned in paragraph 6 as backstory and echoed in paragraph 18 ("sudden echo of the earlier argument"). Setup gate met (first third), development gate weak (the hush is a metaphor, not a live clock), payoff gate weak (echo mentioned but does not shape the ending action). Time does not tighten decisions or tactics; the dome visit is contemplative with no urgency. Ornamental timeframe without pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"To explore ethical storytelling" is declared early and restated throughout but never dramatized as conflicted choice. Setup gate met (paragraph 8), development gate absent (no friction between this want and a cost on the page), payoff gate met (she walks toward future shows with this intention). The motivation is told-only; Selene's commitment is not tested, and no trade-off reveals hierarchy of values. Functional but replaceable label without on-page pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Meteor hush" appears three times: "meteor hush" (paragraph 7), "meteor hush" (paragraph 18), "meteor hush that followed her steps" (paragraph 20). Setup gate met (first third), development gate weak (tone is described but does not modulate with pressure), payoff gate met (invoked in final paragraph). The tone is coherent and static—quiet, contemplative—but does not shift under stress or charge the final image with cost. Told mood without dynamic use.</comment>
