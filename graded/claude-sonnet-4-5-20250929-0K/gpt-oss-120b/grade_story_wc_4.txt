<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Mara is labeled "perceptively calm" and assigned a mission but never faces a single on-page choice that costs her anything or forces contradictory impulses. Her interiority consists of generic assertions ("She whispered to the air, 'We will transmute pain into a masterpiece'") rather than embodied emotion or micro-decisions under pressure. The villagers arrive as a static chorus with no distinct voices or resistance; no relationship on the page applies pressure. The work reads as a tableau of archival activity, not a character making choices that narrow options.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The piece violates the Orientation Test: past ~120 words, the reader still cannot anchor who the villagers are, when they arrive relative to Mara's setup, or how the dove gray case relates causally to the photographs. No on-page reversal or tightening occurs; Mara arranges images, villagers appear, tears and smiles happen, feather is lifted—each step is additive description, not causal linkage. The ending ("collective healing felt complete, yet also the beginning") offers Charged Poise language but no felt or conceptual cost is legible on the page; the outcome was assured from the premise. Orientation penalty (−0.4) and no closure cost apply; additional cap per Orientation Test: Q3 capped at 7.0, all categories capped at 8.3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The lavender field and rusted factory ruins are described lyrically but function only as backdrop; no environmental constraint shapes Mara's choices or the villagers' arrival. The dove gray map case is handled twice (opened, then closed at the end), meeting minimal micro-setting presence, but its mechanics do not alter tactics. Spatial choreography is vague: villagers "gathered around the board" without legible distances or movement. Sensory detail (purple perfume, amber glow) is vivid but ornamental, not purposeful. The setting does not constrain a choice or charge the final image beyond atmosphere, capping the score in mid-band despite description density.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—collective healing—is declared but never tested on the page. No reversal or tightening narrows options; Mara's setup proceeds without obstacle, villagers arrive on cue, and the resolution is additive (tears fall, smiles blossom) with no dramatized cost or trade-off. Coincidence drives the villagers' arrival ("drawn by the scent"), and the feather's symbolic glow replaces agency. No visible price is paid; the ending reiterates the mission statement rather than forecloses a path. Under any lens (Causal, Accumulative, or Situational), pressure remains flat and escalation is absent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The theme of transmuting pain into beauty is stated explicitly multiple times ("We will transmute pain into a masterpiece," "collective healing," "to reshape sorrow into beauty") rather than emerging from dramatized events. The feather's glow and the arcs' luminosity are symbolic conveniences introduced late without prior causal grounding. The final image repeats the setup's claim without reweighting it through on-page cost or irony. No complexity or ambiguity complicates the mission; the townspeople's pain is asserted, not shown, and their healing is summarized rather than earned through specific, conflicted choices.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains a consistent lyric register ("earnest whimsy") and a stable third-person limited POV focused on Mara. However, perceptual signature is generic: Mara's way of noticing (scanning walls, arranging images, feeling the collective pulse) could belong to any earnest archivist. Dialogue is minimal (one whispered line, one answer to a child) and serviceable. The prose carries texture through word choice ("whispered secrets," "dove gray," "violet stems") but does not modulate under pressure; the same elevated diction persists from setup to ending without rhythm shift. No POV leakage occurs, but the voice lacks the specificity and pressure-responsive variation required for higher bands.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and template cadence pervade: "She decided to linger… to linger in this fragrant cradle"; "collective healing… collective pulse… collective heartbeat"; "the archivist's purpose… the archivist promised… the subtle puzzle archivist's steady hands." Multiple sentences restate the same concept without added pressure. Register drifts into abstract therapy-speak ("emotional terrain," "shared recollection was already mending wounded spirits") inconsistent with Mara's grounded voice. Mixed metaphors (vines "feeding the story with fresh memory," light "dusting" faces) reduce clarity. High density of stacked modifiers and stock imagery ("tears fell like dew, yet smiles blossomed") flattens propulsion. Apply patterned-artifact penalty (−0.8) and template-cadence deduction (−0.5); cap disallows 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The core premise—archivist reconstructs collective memory via photographs to heal a community—is a recognizable template from creative writing workshops and literary magazines. The story does not transform it through specific lived detail, non-obvious moral calculus, or grounded conflict; instead, it layers generic symbols (lavender, ruins, feather, arcs) without earned causality. The ending's promise to "linger in this lavender sanctuary" and "continue" signals episodic repetition rather than a singular, irreversible turn. No fresh inflection or risky structural choice elevates the familiar premise. Apply derivative-premise adjustment (−1.0 within Q8).</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Mara is present throughout but her choices are observational and procedural (setup tent, arrange photographs, lift feather) with no on-page cost or conflicted decision. The archivist's role is label-only; her perceptive calm is asserted, not dramatized through a constrained choice. She does not create a key turn; the villagers' arrival and healing happen to her. Early presence and closure mention prevent a lower score, but swappability and lack of agency keep it ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The dove gray map case appears in three beats: setup (inside her, containing the clue), mid-story (opened to reveal the feather), and ending (closed as a promise kept). However, its mechanics are vague (what clue? how does it relate to the photographs?) and its presence does not constrain Mara's actions. The case is handled but does not shape tactics or alter outcomes; it functions as a symbolic container. Early signal and closure reprise meet two gates, but lack of causal pressure and high swappability (any elegant container could serve) cap the score in low-mid band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Collective healing is the story's stated purpose and thematic through-line, but it is told rather than dramatized. No on-page conflict tests the concept; the healing occurs as an outcome (villagers cry and smile) without process, cost, or resistance. The concept does not shape tactics or narrow options—it is the goal, not a constraint. Late development (healing materializes only when villagers arrive in the final third) and summary-only treatment prevent higher scoring.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>1.9</grade><comment>Perceptively calm is a label applied to Mara in the opening but never constrains or enables a choice with visible cost. She remains calm throughout, scanning and arranging without internal conflict or pressure that would test the trait. No tradeoff is shown; the attribute is ornamental. Its early mention prevents a zero, but lack of causal work or closure linkage keeps it in the lowest functional band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Linger appears twice as a stated intention: Mara "decided to linger beside the wild blossoms" early and promises to "linger in this lavender sanctuary" at the end. The action is static—resting, settling thoughts—and does not create a turn or alter tactics. Easily swappable with "remain," "stay," or "settle," and no cost is tied to the decision. Early signal and closure reprise meet two gates, but the action's lack of causal pressure or specificity caps it in mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>The photographs and their arcs are introduced in the second paragraph, handled in the middle (arranged on the board, overlapping to form silhouettes), and mentioned at closure ("arcs in black-and-white photographs"). The method is described but its mechanics remain vague: how do the arcs reveal hidden routes, and why does overlapping matter? The method does not shape Mara's tactics or encounter resistance. Presence across all three gates and multiple beats elevate it above ornamental, but lack of specificity and causal pressure prevent higher scoring.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The lavender field and rusted factory ruins are signaled early, described in sensory detail throughout, and referenced at closure ("the field... kept its quiet vigil"). The setting provides atmosphere and symbolic resonance (nature reclaiming industry) but does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome. Micro-setting (the board, the tent) is mentioned but not leveraged under pressure. Early signal, beat involvement, and closure presence meet all three gates, and the setting's symbolic charge at the ending lifts it into mid-band, but lack of tactical constraint caps further elevation.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.2</grade><comment>The timeframe "as vines climb" appears once as a simile mid-story and is referenced obliquely at the end ("as vines climb the ancient steel, new stories will sprout"). Time does not tighten decisions or create a clock; the phrase is metaphorical, not a narrative constraint. No urgency or temporal pressure shapes Mara's actions. Late and ornamental use, with no middle development or closure participation as an active element, keeps the score low.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.3</grade><comment>The motivation to "transmute pain into a masterpiece" is declared early (Mara's whispered promise) and restated at closure ("to reshape sorrow into beauty"). However, it is told rather than dramatized: no on-page friction tests the desire, and no cost or competing want complicates the mission. The motivation functions as a thematic label, not a driver of conflicted choice. Early signal and closure mention meet two gates, but lack of dramatized conflict or visible cost caps the score in low-mid band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>Earnest whimsy is maintained through lyric diction ("whispered secrets," "quiet magic," "earnest whimsy" explicitly named mid-story) and a gentle, hopeful tone that persists from setup to ending. The tone does not modulate under pressure or charge the final image with irony or cost; it remains static. Coherence across beats and stable presence meet basic requirements, and the tone's integration with theme (healing as whimsical masterpiece) prevents a lower score, but lack of dynamic range or closure-specific intensification caps elevation into upper bands.</comment>
