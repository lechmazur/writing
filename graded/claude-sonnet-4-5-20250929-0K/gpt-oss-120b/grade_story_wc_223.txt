<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Mira's core motivation—to record small gestures erased by history—is established early, but her interior life remains abstract and label-driven. The "crisis actor who could feign terror and still feel its teeth" promises interesting contradiction but never generates on-page friction or competing impulses; she moves through the gallery without hesitation, ambivalence, or cost. The scroll discovery and walking patterns feel like puzzle-solving rather than choices shaped by flawed perception or genuine struggle. Her final peace arrives without any visible price or renunciation that would foreclose another path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The piece establishes orientation (whispering gallery, interregnum, Mira) within the opening paragraph. A loose Accumulative lens is inferable—Mira walks patterns, discovers scroll, walks again, achieves peace—but the middle beats (clicking compartment, scroll reveal) rely on convenient discovery rather than motivated ellipsis or pressure-driven escalation. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (she finds peace and becomes the historian), yet no visible cost or foreclosed path appears on the page; the scroll simply vindicates her intent, and she smiles. The inferred lens wobbles between Accumulative and Situational without decisive commitment at the ending.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The whispering gallery is vividly rendered with "thin ribbons" of light, echoing arches, and marble hall; spatial choreography (chessboard center, hidden compartment, walking patterns) remains coherent throughout. The missing pawns and polished squares constrain Mira's method—her walking pattern triggers the compartment—so the setting does participate in choice. However, the interregnum city outside remains generic and never supplies pressure or resources that alter tactics; the gallery itself becomes a decorative frame rather than an active constraint after the first third.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>One dominant stake is signaled: to unbind memory and record small gestures. The walking pattern → scroll discovery → second pattern offers a sequence, but no reversal or tightening; each step succeeds without friction, and the "nomadic penumbra" curls protectively rather than opposing. The hidden compartment click and scroll content are coincidental discoveries that solve the problem they did not help create. No trade-off or visible price is enacted; Mira's final peace arrives as reward rather than consequence of a choice that foreclosed another path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The theme of preserving "small gestures" emerges concretely through the missing pawns and scroll detailing acts of bravery during the flood. The "luminous absence" motif recurs and charges the final image with some resonance. However, the ending ("she had become the historian of small gestures") states the theme rather than dramatizing it through a non-literal image, and Mira's smile arrives as declaration instead of earned complexity. The conceptual cost of this role—what she renounced or risked—remains unshown.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. The prose carries a distinct lyric texture—"benevolently ruthless," "nomadic penumbra," "luminous absence"—that reads as consistent voice rather than ornament. Mira's perceptual signature (seeing history in missing pawns, spelling words in dust) is selective and character-specific. However, elevated diction ("interregnum," "vaulted whispering gallery," "tentative interregnum") occasionally drifts above the urgency of the moment, and no dialogue appears to test voice against another character.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Line-level clarity is generally clean with varied sentence openings and purposeful paragraph breaks. However, the piece exhibits multiple text-artifact patterns: "benevolently ruthless" appears twice as descriptor without embodied cost; "interregnum" recurs three times in summary mode; "nomadic penumbra" is introduced, repeated, and looped across beats with synonym churn ("wandering shadow," "protective cloak," "reminder") but never clarified as concrete phenomenon. The phrase "luminous absence" functions as a stock metaphor string without precision. These artifacts accumulate across the text (−0.9 baseline in Q7) and dilute propulsion in the middle third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The combination—crisis actor, missing chess pawns, walking patterns that spell words, interregnum setting—offers surface novelty but assembles as checklist rather than organic synthesis. The core emotional arc (survivor seeks to record loss) is familiar, and the walking-pattern method plus hidden-scroll reveal feel like puzzle mechanics imported to satisfy prompt elements rather than transformed through character or cost. The "nomadic penumbra" remains an unexplained decorative entity, and the ending's peace and smile offer no fresh inflection or risk. Derivative premise adjustment (−0.6) applies; the template reads as "symbolic quest during power vacuum" without lived specificity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Mira, the crisis actor and flood survivor, is present throughout and her dual experience is mentioned early. However, her choices (walking patterns, lifting scroll, stepping out) are unopposed and do not turn on the contradiction between performed and real trauma. The crisis-actor attribute could be swapped for "archivist" or "memory keeper" with minimal structural change. She observes and enacts ritual but does not face a decision where her history of feigning versus feeling creates friction or cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The chessboard with missing pawns is introduced in the first third, triggers the hidden compartment via Mira's walking pattern (middle beat), and she returns to place the scroll on it near the end. Its specific property—polished squares reflecting light, absence of pawns—anchors the theme and enables the discovery. Removing it would require restructuring both the discovery mechanism and the symbolic close. However, the board itself is static; Mira does not handle pieces or encounter resistance, so causal pressure is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>The "nomadic penumbra" appears in the second third as a "wandering shadow" that follows Mira and later curls around the scroll. It is described as "benevolently ruthless" but never constrains a choice, opposes an action, or shifts options. Its nature remains undefined—unclear whether metaphor, atmospheric effect, or entity—and it could be removed with negligible impact on plot or stakes. The phrase recurs but only as ornamental reprise, not causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Benevolently ruthless" is applied twice: once to Mira's resolve and once to the penumbra, both as labels without on-page demonstration. Mira faces no trade-off where kindness and severity conflict; she acts gently throughout (walking patterns, lifting scroll) with no harsh pruning or cost imposed. The attribute does not enable or constrain a beat; it merely colors description. Swapping it for "determined" or "focused" would leave the action unchanged.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Unbind" appears in both the opening ("unbind the silent pact") and near the end ("unbind the story from the board"), framing Mira's goal. It names her intent but does not describe a specific physical or social action that generates a turn. The walking-pattern method and scroll discovery are the mechanics that move the plot; "unbind" functions as thematic label rather than irreplaceable action. Replacing it with "reveal" or "release" would not alter structure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The method—walking patterns that spell words—is introduced in the first third, demonstrated twice ("remember what fell," "heal"), and triggers the compartment mechanism. It is Mira's unique tactic and could not be easily replaced; the specificity (dust, marble, echoing walls) ties to setting. However, the second pattern ("heal") does not escalate or complicate; it simply repeats the first success. The method shapes one key beat (discovery) but lacks friction or evolving cost in its use.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The whispering gallery is established early and provides the marble floor for dust-walking, the echoing arches that respond, and the chessboard's hidden compartment. These features constrain Mira's method and participate in the discovery beat. The setting's acoustics ("soft click," "chorus of soft voices") amplify her actions and charge the atmosphere. Removing the gallery would require redesigning the discovery mechanism. However, after the first third it becomes backdrop; no spatial pressure (locked doors, observers, time limits) alters her choices.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>The interregnum is mentioned in the opening, middle, and closing paragraphs as context: absent rulers, councils reforming, city in suspended breath. It names the political situation but does not impose a live clock or complicate Mira's task. She works uninterrupted in the gallery; no countdown, rival claimants, or reform deadline pressures her choices. The timeframe could be replaced with "after a disaster" or "during rebuilding" without altering tactics or closure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Mira's desire "to become the historian of small gestures" is stated in the opening third and restated at the end when she achieves it. The scroll's content (recording pawns' acts) aligns with her goal, and her walking patterns enact micro-recording. However, no friction or competing want appears; she never hesitates, doubts the value of small gestures, or sacrifices another goal to pursue this one. The motivation is told and enacted but not dramatized through conflicted choice or visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The phrase "luminous absence" appears early and in the final third, applied to the missing pawns and Mira's peace. It establishes a lyric, contemplative tone that remains consistent—no jarring shifts—and modulates slightly when the gallery "vibrates" and Mira feels "first true peace." However, the tone is stable rather than dynamic; it does not tighten under pressure or charge the ending with new intensity. The final image (Mira stepping out, penumbra following) sustains mood but does not reconfigure prior material with undeniable pressure.</comment>
