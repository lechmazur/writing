<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mara's shift from chasing supernovas to studying butterfly dust in a ruined greenhouse is legible, and the final whisper to the vines offers mild embodiment. However, the interior voice leans heavily on abstract reflection ("lesson in humility," "kindled humility") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously under pressure. The change feels thematically declared more than earned through on-page micro-choices that foreclose paths with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors arrive promptly (greenhouse, Mara, post-flood). The piece accumulates textural pressure through weeks of observation, and the final whisper to the vines offers a mild Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis via acceptance of gradual change). Cost is implied rather than sharp: Mara releases her need for dramatic answers, but the narrative tells us this shift more than it dramatizes a foreclosed option or a felt sacrifice in the closure beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The storm-damaged greenhouse is vividly rendered with cracked glass, fractured beams, and evolving humidity gradients that shape Mara's observations. The dust vial is placed deliberately in sunlight, and the widening cracks provide fresh air—concrete environmental details that constrain choices. The setting functions as a microcosm that charges the final image of Mara stepping back, feeling "the tiny pulse of change beneath her boots."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake (understanding how butterfly dust preprocesses reality through gradual change) is signaled early. Weeks of controlled observation offer a single meaningful deepening, but escalation remains low-key: humidity shifts and crack widening are narrated without tension or a moment when Mara's hypothesis faces genuine threat. Agency is present in her choice to trust the unseen influence, yet the cost remains abstract and the tightening mild.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Theme (humility, gradual change, the power of small disturbances) emerges organically from the greenhouse's transformation and Mara's shift from supernova scale to dust scale. The final whisper—"We are all dust, rearranged, learning, decaying, and still growing"—borders on explicit moralizing but is grounded in the weeks of observation. The dust and greenhouse decay serve as concrete particulars that support the theme without becoming purely symbolic tokens.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, and Mara's perceptual filter (neutron-star researcher attending to decay) is consistent. Diction remains character-specific without head-hopping. However, the prose occasionally elevates into abstract register ("preprocess reality," "chorus of disturbances") that feels slightly academic rather than embodied under greenhouse-tending pressure. No dialogue appears; the voice modulates with observation but lacks rhythmic tightening at peak moments.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Sentences are grammatically clean and information-dense, advancing Mara's hypothesis and the greenhouse's transformation without obvious loops. However, repeated stems ("She realized," "She wrote," "She whispered") and stock phrases ("kindled humility," "quiet power of stripped drama") create mild template cadence in the final third. The final paragraph's explicit thematic summary ("an experiment in humility, gradual change, and the quiet power of stripped drama") reads as scaffold that could be cut without loss.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The premise—neutron-star researcher applies astrophysical patience to butterfly dust in a post-flood greenhouse—offers a fresh juxtaposition. However, the narrative arc (scientist finds humility through small-scale observation) follows a familiar template, and the hypothesis that dust "preprocesses reality" is more asserted than dramatized with non-obvious consequences. The specificity of the greenhouse microcosm and the dust catalyst provide texture, but the emotional resolution leans on familiar wisdom about gradual change.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's choice to collect the dust, conduct weeks of controlled observation, and trust the unseen influence drives the narrative arc. Her presence in the greenhouse and her shift from supernova scale to dust scale create two distinct beats and shape the closure. However, the final whisper is more acceptance than a decision that forecloses a live path with sharp cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The butterfly wing dust is collected early, placed in a vial aligned with sunlight, observed altering humidity gradients, and tucked into a drawer at the end—present in setup, middle observation, and closure. Its iridescent particles arranging along cracks and binding nutrients constitute specific use across beats. The dust is causally active in transforming the greenhouse, though the mechanics remain somewhat abstract.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Gradual change is the dominant concept: Mara's observation spans weeks, droplets contribute to slow decay, cracks widen "just enough," and the greenhouse transforms from tomb to sanctuary through accumulation. The concept shapes her tactics (controlled observations, noting minute shifts) and charges the final image of "tiny pulse of change beneath her boots." It is integral to stakes and closure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The hypothesis that dust "preprocesses reality" is stated early and frames Mara's research, but the attribute remains abstract. On-page evidence (altered humidity, cracks widening, nutrients binding) suggests preprocessing, yet the mechanism is told more than shown with visible tradeoffs. The concept influences her stance but does not constrain a choice with clear cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Decay is pervasive: the greenhouse decays, wooden beams release nutrients, droplets contribute to gradual change, and Mara herself moves from supernova pursuit to "tending garden ghosts." Decay is not merely loss but "a conduit," redefining the greenhouse's function and charging the closure. The action is causally central and shapes multiple beats and the final image of cycling transformation.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Accumulated dust patterns are signaled early as Mara's hypothesis and observed across weeks: dust settles "like snowfall," particles arrange along cracks, and presence alters humidity gradients. The method shapes her controlled observations and is present in the middle development and closure. However, the mechanics remain somewhat abstract; specificity of how patterns "rewrite rules" is more asserted than dramatized with visible consequences.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The storm-damaged greenhouse with cracked glass, torn panes, fractured beams, and evolving humidity is introduced immediately and shapes every beat. It provides the microcosm for Mara's experiment, constrains her observations, and transforms from "wounded beast" to "breathing sanctuary." The setting is causally essential to the closure image of "tiny pulse of change" and would be irreplaceable; removing it would collapse the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"After the flood receded" anchors the timeframe early, and "over weeks" signals duration. The post-flood context justifies the greenhouse's decay and Mara's presence, and the passage of weeks allows gradual change to register. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions or create urgency; it functions as backdrop rather than active pressure that alters tactics or raises cost.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The motivation "to strip needless drama" is stated early ("her pursuit of stripped drama had yielded tangible calm") and contrasts with her prior supernova-chasing. It shapes her choice of quiet observation over grand theory, appearing in the closure via "stripped drama" language. However, the motivation is told more than dramatized through conflicted choices; friction between her wants and the cost of humility is asserted rather than enacted with visible struggle.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Tone of "kindled humility" is coherent: Mara's soft laughter, relief, and whisper to the vines all carry a tone of quiet acceptance and wonder. The prose modulates from initial caution to relief and gratitude, and the final paragraph explicitly names "humility." The tone charges the ending image, though the explicit labeling ("kindled humility") in the final beat reads slightly prescriptive rather than fully embodied through rhythm and diction alone.</comment>
