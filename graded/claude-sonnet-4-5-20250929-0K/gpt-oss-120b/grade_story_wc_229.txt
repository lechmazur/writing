<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is stated early but her agency remains observational rather than consequential—she places objects, whispers promises, and watches outcomes arrive via the fisherman's response rather than through her own risk or contradiction. The "screaming tenderness" label and "fierce love that shouted silently" exemplify therapy-speak that abstracts emotion instead of embodying it through micro-choices under pressure. Internal conflict is absent; no competing impulse complicates her intention or forces a visible trade-off. The fisherman's arrival functions as external validation rather than a choice-driven turn, leaving Mara's arc as passive witness to her own premise.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers garden scent, vibration metaphor, and lighthouse imagery toward a final reconfiguration. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration via the cracked vial and "whispers truly travel farther than shouts" declaration, but cost remains asserted rather than dramatized—no prior option is foreclosed, no tactic altered, no visible price paid on the page. Orientation anchors (Mara, balcony, dawn, post-heat-wave) arrive cleanly within the first 120 words. The fisherman's approach offers a micro-turn but his agency, not Mara's choice, drives it; the ending recapitulates the premise without reweighting prior material through embodied consequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The cobalt lighthouse, stone balcony, brass lantern, and garden scent are rendered with vivid specificity and sensory density. The vial cork's "cracked surface catching the first light" charges the final image, satisfying the micro-setting constraint test. However, the setting does not materially narrow Mara's options or alter her tactics; the balcony functions as stage rather than crucible. Spatial choreography remains clear; the fisherman's boat, reef, and cliffs anchor distance and approach.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—proving whispers travel farther than shouts—is signaled early but remains abstract throughout. No on-page reversal or tightening choice narrows Mara's options; she executes her plan unopposed, and the fisherman's arrival serves as external confirmation rather than a consequence of her risk. The piece declares escalation ("vibrations rose," "resonant sigh," "invisible bridge") without dramatizing a moment where Mara must trade one good for another or foreclose a path. Cost is told ("devotion," "gratitude") but never shown as a visible forfeiture or tactical shift on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Theme—the paradoxical power of softness over force—emerges through recurring images (whisper/shout, vibration, scent, tenderness) and the lighthouse as metaphor. The final paragraph states the theme overtly: "proof that whispers truly travel farther than shouts" and "tenderness shouted louder when it was felt in the softest of breaths," which undercuts resonance by moralizing. The thematic echo penalty (−0.6) applies for articulating the thesis in prompt-like language in the final lines. No counter-reading complicates the claim; the piece presents the premise as validated truth rather than as a question dramatized with ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable, filtering perception through Mara's lens. Diction rises into elevated register ("luminous thread," "screaming tenderness," "fierce love that shouted silently") that reads as authorial rather than character-particular, creating mild register drift under pressure. Perceptual signature is present but generic—Mara notices in lyric cadence without idiosyncratic bias. Psychic distance stays consistent; no filter-verb stacks or head-hopping. The fisherman's interiority ("felt an unexpected tug," "his gratitude a soft murmur") briefly claims access outside Mara's knowledge but reads as modest inference rather than full breach.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Figurative density pervades most sentences without pattern-teaching or payoff: "pulse with unseen light," "vibrations of intent," "trembling like a thin string," "quiet chord," "luminous thread," "screaming tenderness," "lover's arms," "bridges that spanned continents." Mixed metaphor: "tenderness shouted louder when it was felt in the softest of breaths" contradicts the shout/whisper binary the piece establishes. Template cadence runs: "She would beckon... She whispered... She placed... She lifted... She realized... She turned... She placed..." Paraphrase loops: paragraph 8–9 restate the vibration/hum/pulse concept without advancing pressure. Overwriting penalty (−0.7) and template-cadence penalty (−0.6) apply; artifacts touch the closure beat, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8 per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The core premise—using intention, scent, and vibration to attract a distant boat—reads as magical-realism metaphor but lacks grounding in world logic or character history that would make the mechanics credible or surprising. "Vibrations of intent" and "purifies intentions" remain abstract labels without specificity. The lighthouse-as-heart and whisper-over-shout conceit echo familiar writing-prompt templates without transformation through lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. Derivative Premise Guardrail applies (−0.8) for close template match. The fisherman's arrival via "invisible bridge" and compass tug feels convenient rather than earned through Mara's specific risk or ingenuity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Mara is present throughout and her ritual frames the narrative. She makes two small actions (placing the cork, cracking its seal) but neither constrains her options or imposes visible cost. The fisherman's approach validates her premise but his agency, not hers, drives the turn. Setup and payoff gates are met; development gate (middle choice under constraint) is weak. Her role is observer and conduit rather than decision-maker under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The vial cork appears in four beats: initial mention (paragraph 1), placement on the balcony (paragraph 7), seal-cracking cascade (paragraph 14), and final rest on the rail (paragraph 20). It recurs with evolving function—pulsing light, purifying air, spilling bright cascade, catching sunrise—and its cracked surface charges the final image. Setup, development, and payoff gates are met. However, its properties (purifies intentions, releases light) are declared rather than demonstrated through constraint or cost; removing it would weaken texture but not break causality. Scores in the essential-across-beats band but short of indispensable due to lack of tactical consequence.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Vibrations of intent" is mentioned throughout (paragraphs 3, 8, 9, 15) but remains abstract metaphor rather than a mechanic that constrains Mara's tactics or narrows her options. The concept is thematically present but does not shape on-page stakes or force a choice with cost. Functional but replaceable; "power of intention" or "will made manifest" could substitute with minor edits. Setup gate met; development and payoff gates weak.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Purifies intentions" is attributed to the vial cork (paragraph 5: "property of the vial cork that purifies intentions when its seal is broken") and echoed in paragraph 8 ("each pulse gently purifying the air"). Label-only mention without on-page demonstration of constraint, enablement, or cost. The trait does not alter Mara's tactics or create friction. Present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Beckon" appears in paragraph 4 ("beckon the dormant currents"), drives the fisherman's approach (paragraphs 10–11: "tug," "pull," "guided"), and is reprised in the final vial image (paragraph 20: "forever beckon the world"). Setup, development, and payoff gates met. The action shapes the central turn (fisherman's arrival) but its execution is unopposed and the mechanics remain vague; Mara's beckoning succeeds without cost or adjustment. Causal role in one major beat, placing it in the 5.0–6.9 band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Scent of a garden at night" (jasmine and rosemary, paragraph 5) is released in paragraph 7 and mentioned again in paragraphs 8, 13, and 17 as part of the beckoning mechanism. Setup and payoff gates met; development gate present but weak—the scent enables the vibration but does not constrain Mara's choices or impose cost. The method is signaled early and recurs across beats, but its specific properties (cool, amplifying) do not create friction or force tactical adjustment. Functional and purposeful but not irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The cobalt lighthouse is anchored immediately and recurs in nearly every paragraph, framing the narrative spatially and symbolically. It provides the balcony platform, brass lantern, and the beam that flickers in sync (paragraph 9), and the final image ("cobalt tower... heart beating in rhythm," paragraphs 15, 22) charges closure. Setup, development, and payoff gates strongly met. The lighthouse constrains Mara's vantage and supplies the beam as a responsive signal (paragraph 9), contributing to escalation. The specific color and material (cobalt, stone) are purposeful and irreplaceable, and the setting participates causally in two beats (balcony placement, beam sync) and the final image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"After the heat wave broke" appears in paragraph 1 with "lingering warmth." The timeframe is mentioned once more in paragraph 21 ("heat wave's memory faded") but does not tighten decisions, create urgency, or shape Mara's tactics. Dawn progression is tracked (first gold, first light, sunrise, brightening horizon) but functions as backdrop rather than pressure. Present and consistent but functionally inert; swappable with "after the storm" or "at daybreak" without narrative impact.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The motivation "to prove that whispers travel farther than shouts" is stated in paragraph 6 and reprised explicitly in paragraphs 13, 21, and 22. It frames Mara's ritual and the fisherman's arrival serves as proof (paragraph 13: "proof she sought... had arrived"). Setup, development, and payoff gates met. However, the desire is told rather than dramatized through friction—no competing want or fear complicates her commitment, and the proof arrives without visible cost or sacrifice on Mara's part. The motivation shapes the premise but does not constrain choice or force a trade-off under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Screaming tenderness" appears in paragraph 12 and is echoed in the final paragraph ("scream of love softened into a gentle hum"). The oxymoron aims to hold the whisper/shout paradox in tension, but the tone reads more as elevated lyricism than as a coherent modulation under pressure. Setup and payoff gates met; development gate weak—the tone does not shift or deepen as stakes rise; it remains static throughout. The label feels imposed rather than emergent from syntax, rhythm, or embodied perception.</comment>
