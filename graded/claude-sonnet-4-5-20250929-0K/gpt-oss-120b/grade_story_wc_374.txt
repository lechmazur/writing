<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Arin's motivation is stated early but never tested by a concrete choice under pressure. His "luminous skeptic" nature and "faint awe" are labels without embodied contradiction or cost—he observes the weather carriers and records data, but no decision forecloses a path or reveals competing values. The interiority consists largely of atmospheric perception ("tasting the air," "metallic tang") without internal conflict driving action. No meaningful change or credible endurance with visible cost emerges by the ending.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The piece opens with orientation anchors (Arin, lavender bluff, aurora) by the first paragraph, satisfying the Orientation Test. However, no causal escalation or meaningful tightening occurs—events are presented in additive sequence (he tastes, the ring flickers, carriers gather, forest votes, aurora fades) without because/therefore linkage or a decision that narrows options. The ending offers Conceptual Repricing ("taste of the planet's secret heart") but the cost is asserted rather than dramatized on the page; no prior choice or renunciation makes the closure legible as a before/after with felt price. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural, but without a pattern break or cadence shift that reweights the dominant stake with visible cost, closure remains thematic claim rather than earned pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The lavender bluff, aurora, and tin compass ring are vividly rendered with sensory specificity ("pastel glow," "metallic tang," "soft binary code"). However, the environment does not constrain a choice or alter tactics—Arin moves freely through tasting and observation without spatial or resource limitation. The micro-setting (ring, wind, spores) charges the final image poetically but does not pressure a decision, keeping this in mid-band despite strong descriptive texture.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"to learn why some people carry weather"—is signaled early but never escalates through a meaningful tightening or choice that narrows options. Arin's actions (calibrating the ring, tasting wind, watching carriers) are observational; no reversal or deepening forces a trade-off or alters his stance. The "convergence" and resulting "faint awe" are told outcomes without on-page cost or agency-driven pressure. No credible loss or renunciation forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>A coherent theme—emergent systems bridging ancient rites and neon circuitry—arises from the imagery (forest elections, compass circuits, aurora pulse). However, the ending asserts thematic insight ("taste of the planet's secret heart," "emergent compass of wonder") without a non-literal answer earned by prior particulars; instead, exposition explains the concept. The final lines moralize ("daring enough to taste the world would forever find direction") rather than letting the image resonate, lowering thematic subtlety.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Voice carries a distinct lyric-textural idiom ("luminous skeptic," "terrestrially cosmic," "soft binary code") that matches the futuristic-nostalgic tone. However, perceptual signature is generic—elevated diction ("emergent compass," "planetary mood") feels uniform across the narrative rather than character-specific. Filter verbs ("felt a faint awe," "realized") are acceptable but not voice-driven, and the final paragraph's explanatory clarity ("he realized...") shifts toward helpful narrator mode, slightly flattening the ending's immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Prose is clear and vivid with strong rhythm variation, but several artifact clusters lower the score: paraphrase loops appear ("The ring was not a map but an emergent compass, learning the lay of paths" restated as "emergent compass flickered, its circuits humming as if recognizing a pattern"), synonym churn for "emergent compass" and "terrestrially cosmic" without pressure payoff, and template cadence in the middle stretch ("He pressed...letting...The emergent compass flickered...As more participants tasted...The ring began to map"). Figurative density is high throughout ("whispered of forgotten futures," "scent curled like soft binary code," "holo-journal halos") without pattern-teaching or a payoff that constrains choice, crossing into overwriting per the Density check (−0.5 in Q7). These artifacts do not obscure causality but dull momentum and trigger the patterned-artifact penalty pack baseline (−0.8). No filter-verb stacks or closure-beat contamination, so the 9+ global disallow does not apply, but high-band entry is foreclosed.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of "emergent compass," "forest elections," and "weather carriers" offers a non-obvious conceptual frame, and the futuristic-nostalgic tone is sustained without tonal drift. However, the core emotional arc—observer learns about planetary attunement—follows a familiar learning-quest template without transformation through specific lived cost or moral calculus. Specificity lies in world-building detail (tin compass circuits, spore humidity shifts) rather than character choice or stake consequence, keeping originality in mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Arin is named early and present in most beats, but his "luminous skeptic" trait shapes observation, not decision. He tastes, watches, and records without a choice that narrows options or alters the outcome. No middle development beat turns on his agency; closure recounts his realization without a prior struggle that this character trait enabled or constrained. Present but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The tin compass ring appears early (first paragraph), is handled in at least three beats (calibrating by taste, pressing to tongue, glowing brighter at convergence), and is present in the ending image ("emergent compass hummed a lullaby"). Its "emergent" and "terrestrially cosmic" properties enable the mapping of invisible currents, shaping the middle beat when participants taste together. However, no on-page choice hinges on the ring's mechanics—it responds to conditions rather than constraining Arin's decisions—keeping it essential to atmosphere but not indispensable to closure logic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The "emergent compass" concept is labeled early and repeated frequently ("learning the lay of paths," "drawing lines," "hummed a lullaby"). It frames the thematic question but does not drive on-page stakes—the ring's emergence is observed, not wielded to alter tactics. Middle beat involvement (ring flickers when participants taste) shows causal pressure, but closure treats it as thematic echo rather than a choice-pivot. Functional but somewhat replaceable with "adaptive device" or similar.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"Terrestrially cosmic" is defined early ("rooting...in soil's mineral memory while echoing the sky's pulse") and mentioned again at the ending beat ("each line anchored to the mineral heart...pointing toward distant stars"). However, this attribute is descriptive flavor—no action or choice turns on the dual grounding. It colors the compass's operation but does not constrain or enable a decision with visible cost. Present, thematically consistent, but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Converge" is signaled early ("all sensing devices...would converge") and enacted in the middle when participants gather and taste together, triggering the ring's mapping response. The convergence enables the closure insight (Arin feels kinship, records data), but it is a collaborative event rather than Arin's decision—swapping "converge" for "gather" or "synchronize" would leave structure intact. Shapes one key turn but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Sensing through taste changes" is signaled early ("calibrated the ring by tasting the air") and used in two distinct beats: Arin tastes wind mid-scene, and participants' collective tasting causes "air sweetened then soured," prompting the ring to map currents. The method enables the convergence and shapes the middle turn. However, the mechanics are more atmospheric than constraining—no choice hinges on what Arin tastes versus sees. Present across beats and in closure, but not indispensable to the decision structure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The "lavender bluff under aurora" is established in the opening line and returns in the final paragraph ("lavender bluff stood silent, its scent a lingering code"). Aurora and lavender are woven through perception ("cobalt and magenta," "scent curled like soft binary code") and affect the compass (aurora pulse syncs with ring glow). The setting provides sensory anchors and charges the final image, but does not constrain choice or supply resources that alter Arin's options—postcard description elevated by reprise, not tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"While forests hold elections" is announced early and resolved mid-scene ("When the forest's election concluded, the winning tree released spores"). The election's outcome (spores alter humidity) nudges the compass, creating a causal link. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions or create urgency—events unfold in observational sequence without a live clock. The phrase is vivid world-building but functionally replaceable with "during seasonal shift." Present in two beats, but no tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The motivation "to learn why some people carry weather" is stated in the opening third and drives Arin's presence at the convergence. It frames his observation and final realization ("quest...had given him a taste of the planet's secret heart"). However, the desire is enacted through passive watching rather than conflicted choice—no friction between cost and want appears on the page. The motivation explains why he is present but does not force a decision or renunciation. Functional but told-dominant.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Futuristic nostalgia" is coherent throughout: "forgotten futures," "technology hummed ancient lullabies," "neon circuitry" paired with "old forest rites," and the ending's "nostalgic promise." Tone modulates subtly with the convergence beat (sweetening/souring air, pulsing glow) and charges the final image ("emergent compass hummed a lullaby of stars and soil"). However, the tone remains largely static—no tonal shift under pressure that reweights stakes. Strong atmospheric consistency elevates this into upper-mid band, but not indispensable to closure logic.</comment>
