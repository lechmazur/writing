<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Arlen remains a flat archetype—"whispering advisor" with "quiet charisma"—whose interiority consists entirely of abstract motivation ("translate silence into music") without embodied contradiction or cost. The final paragraph lists "joyful sorrow" as a label rather than dramatizing conflicting impulses in scene. Lira's arrival introduces a second POV with no distinct perceptual signature; her instant mimicry of sign language and feeling the harbor "respond" reads as convenience rather than earned character knowledge. No micro-choice under pressure reveals hierarchy of values; actions flow from premise rather than flawed human complexity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural (pattern of silence-to-music gestures), but the piece never teaches a coherent progression or cost. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly in the opening lines; no penalty. The closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration via Lira's vow to "map silence again," but this is a summary promise rather than an on-page decisive change or felt cost—she simply walks away carrying an unearned emotional state. The story structure is mosaic (Arlen's night, then Lira's arrival months later), yet the two shards do not converge on a shared stake or tighten pressure; instead, the second shard duplicates the first without deepening or reweighting it. No meaningful escalation or narrowing of options occurs across the sequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The harbor setting is lushly described with selective sensory detail (moonlight, ripples, kelp scent), and the rusted pier and dock wood anchor spatial choreography. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; it serves as atmospheric backdrop rather than active pressure. The camera's "empty eye" and the "imprint of a camera lens etched into the dock's wood" attempt micro-setting work, but the mechanics of how silence is mapped onto these objects remain vague, so the objects do not shape the resolution. The setting changes (pier to cliffs) without causal consequence, and the "luminous harbor" recurs as motif without reweighting stakes.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake ("translate silence into music that could soothe souls") is signaled early but never tested by opposition or resource scarcity. Arlen's gesture-performance succeeds without friction; no reversal or tightening narrows his options. Lira's arrival promises escalation but instead offers a redundant echo: she mimics the same gestures and feels the same harbor response with no dramatized cost or trade-off. The "joyful sorrow" label in Arlen's chest is asserted rather than earned through a choice that forecloses a path. No visible price paid on the page alters later tactics or charges the final image.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The core concept (silence as music, creation from absence) is coherent and the harbor-as-canvas metaphor threads through both shards. However, thematic weight rests on direct statements rather than earned particulars: "even forgotten souls can craft beauty from void" is a tidy moral delivered in exposition. The camera and sign language recur but do not accrue new meaning; the final image of Lira vowing to "map silence wherever she roamed" repeats the premise without reweighting it. The piece avoids overt moralizing in dialogue but summarizes its theme in the penultimate paragraph, flattening resonance. No plausible counter-reading or ambiguity lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV with stable psychic distance through Arlen's sequence; Lira's arrival shifts focalization cleanly at a section break (Track C allowance applies). However, both characters share identical elevated diction ("luminous," "trembling chords," "bittersweet reminder") and perceptual metaphors, erasing voice distinction. Register remains consistently poetic buttonally uniform across emotional peaks and narrative beats; no modulation under pressure. No dialogue on the page to evaluate. The prose texture is controlled but formulaic: "She lifted her hands... and felt the harbor respond" mirrors Arlen's sequence without syntactic variation, suggesting template cadence rather than character-specific perception.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Persistent paraphrase loops and synonym churn: "joyful sorrow filled Arlen's chest" / "the joyful sorrow lingered in Lira's heart"; "mapping silence" recurs five times without added pressure; "luminous harbor" appears in opening, midpoint, and close as motif without functional variation. Stock metaphors dominate peak beats: "invisible gestures," "living stave," "trembling chords," "frozen memories." Template cadence runs through both shards with identical stems: "He began by positioning... He then lifted... She lifted... She pressed..." (−0.6 for template cadence, −0.4 for paraphrase loops, totaling −1.0 in Q7). Figurative density in most sentences (e.g., "silver sigh," "mute grammar," "hidden score") without pattern-teaching flattens clarity. The piece reads as two drafts of the same scene rather than escalating or reweighting material.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The premise (silence translated into music via sign language and a camera without film) offers a fresh synthesis, but execution defaults to lyric abstraction rather than grounded mechanics. The transformation test fails: swap "sign language" for "dance" or "painting" and the emotional arc remains unchanged. Lira's arrival duplicates Arlen's performance with no fresh inflection or risk; the second shard serves as thematic echo rather than deepening. The "secret technique" reveal in the final sentence ("mapping silence onto light") arrives too late and too vaguely to reweight prior material. No bold structural risk heightens stakes; the piece opts for safe poetic parallelism over earned complexity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Arlen is introduced early and his motivation frames the premise, but his "whispering advisor" role is label-only; no decision under pressure alters tactics. His performance sequence (positioning camera, lifting hands, whispering gratitude) is summarized action without a turn or cost. He vanishes after the first shard with no causal link to Lira's arrival, so his choices do not shape the closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The vintage camera appears in three beats (Arlen cradles it, clicks the shutter, Lira finds its imprint and presses it to her chest), satisfying the two-beat minimum. However, its "no film" property is described but never constrains a choice; the camera could hold film without altering the plot. The final beat ("pressed the empty camera against her chest") offers a charged reprise, but the camera's mechanics remain ornamental. Early signal and spaced use lift the score into mid-band, but lack of causal pressure and swappability (any object could serve as relic) cap it below 6.0.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Sign language is named and visualized ("shaping the silent alphabet," "invisible symbols," "mimicking the sign language") in both shards, providing setup and reprise. However, it functions as thematic decoration rather than a constraint: the mechanics of how gestures map to sound remain unexplained, and no choice depends on sign language knowledge. Lira's instant competence ("instinctively mimicking") bypasses any learning or friction. Present across beats but replaceable with any symbolic gesture system.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Quietly charismatic" is asserted twice ("his presence quietly charismatic," "his charisma quiet yet undeniable") but never dramatized through action or trade-off. No on-page moment shows Arlen attracting, persuading, or influencing another character. The trait exists as label only, with no cost or enablement visible in choices. Ornamental mention without functional integration.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Disrupt" appears in the phrase "disrupt the harbor's natural rhythm" and is enacted when Arlen's gestures alter the water's rippling and the listeners feel soothed. This action drives the first shard's turn (natural silence becomes orchestrated music) and seeds Lira's replication in the second. However, the disruption succeeds without opposition or cost, and swapping "disrupt" for "transform" or "shape" would not change the plot. Present in setup and closure participation, but causal pressure is soft; mid-band ceiling applies.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Mapping silence" is seeded early ("mapping silence into patterns") and recurs four times across both shards, including Lira's vow to "keep mapping silence wherever she roamed." The method shapes Arlen's approach (using the camera frame as canvas, gestures as notation) and provides thematic continuity. However, the mechanics are never clarified—how silence is translated into visual or sonic output remains abstract—so the method does not constrain tactics or create friction. Present in setup, middle action, and closure, but its vagueness and swappability (any metaphor for translation would serve) limit the score.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The "luminous harbor by moonlight" is introduced in the opening line, anchors both shards spatially, and recurs in the closure ("the harbor's moonlit glow dimmed"). The setting enables Arlen's performance (moonbeams reflect in the camera, water ripples in sync) and responds to Lira's gestures (currents shift, gust carries scent). This qualifies as micro-setting work: the harbor's reactive properties alter what the characters perceive and feel, though not their tactical choices. Setup, development (harbor as living instrument), and payoff (dimming glow as Lira departs) are all present. Specificity (moon-phase light, kelp scent) and irreplaceability (the harbor's acoustic and visual properties matter) push the score above 6.0, but lack of hard constraint on a pivotal choice caps it in mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"When no one remembers you" is introduced as the trigger moment for Arlen's action ("the hour when past identities dissolve") but functions as poetic atmosphere rather than a tracked constraint. No clock tightens decisions; the timeframe does not recur or shape Lira's sequence. The phrase appears in setup but is absent from middle beats and closure, failing the development and payoff gates. Ornamental use with no tactical pressure; cap at 4.6 for missing middle and closure, then reduce for vagueness.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"To translate silence into music that could soothe the souls of those who remembered nothing" is Arlen's stated motivation in paragraph six and drives his gesture-performance in the first shard. Lira inherits the same motivation implicitly ("promised to keep mapping silence"), providing thematic continuity. However, the desire is never conflicted—Arlen succeeds without friction, and Lira adopts the goal without cost or hesitation. Setup and closure participation are present, but lack of dramatized want-versus-cost friction and the motivation's abstractness (swappable with any artistic mission) limit the score to mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Joyful sorrow" is named twice ("Joyful sorrow filled Arlen's chest," "the joyful sorrow lingered in Lira's heart") and attempts to unify the bittersweet quality of creation from absence. The tone is coherent across both shards and charges the final image (Lira's "bittersweet reminder"). However, the phrase is asserted as a label rather than embodied through contradictory action or perception; the prose does not modulate between joy and sorrow but holds a single elegiac register throughout. Setup and payoff are present, but lack of tonal variation under pressure and reliance on direct statement rather than dramatization cap the score below 6.0.</comment>
