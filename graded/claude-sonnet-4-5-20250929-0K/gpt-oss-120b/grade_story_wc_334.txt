<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The folklorist remains a label-only construct: "chronically curious" is told, not shown through contradictory impulses or micro-choices that reveal competing values. Interiority defaults to stock phrasing ("the truth settled like freshly turned soil") and generic wonder without embodied cost. The memory-recovery mission proceeds without genuine friction—no moment where curiosity conflicts with safety, fatigue, or doubt. The ending grants success without a visible tradeoff that would have foreclosed an alternative path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation Test: Who/where/when anchors arrive within range. Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (pattern of constellation-mapping → mushroom-arranging → memory-return), but the closure lacks felt cost—the water recedes, saplings appear, songs return, all without on-page sacrifice or foreclosed option. The final paragraph summarizes decades of legacy rather than landing a decisive image with pressure. Because the ending delivers complete restoration with no visible price paid in the moment, the RR does not meet the cost requirement.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The greenhouse-and-shipwrecks setting supplies vivid anchor details (rusted hulls, kelp-tangled sextant, brine-laden air) and the fairy ring's spatial pattern does enable the final ritual. However, the environment never constrains a choice—no moment where tidal timing, wreck instability, or fungal toxicity forces a tactical tradeoff. The setting decorates rather than pressures, capping the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake (recover stolen memories) is signaled early, but escalation is absent: the protagonist moves hull to hull in a smooth catalog without setback, adaptation, or cost. The sextant discovery and mushroom-rearrangement succeed on first attempt with no resistance. Water receding and saplings appearing read as automatic rewards rather than earned through agency or renunciation. One meaningful tightening or deepening that narrows options is missing.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The theme of memory-as-archive and ritual-recovery emerges through recurring constellation/fungus imagery, but the final image summarizes rather than reweights: "stolen memories were no longer hidden, but now rooted" is a direct thematic claim. The mushroom glow pulsing with verses offers a symbolic beat, yet the ending explains rather than allowing the particulars to resonate. No counter-reading or ambiguity remains—satisfaction is symmetric and complete.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Single-POV distance remains stable, and sensory filtering (brine, amber light through hulls, salt on tongue) reads consistent with the folklorist's attention. However, the voice drifts toward elevated register ("a feeling she had chased since childhood," "the power of a chronically curious soul") that feels more narrator-summary than embodied perception under pressure. Diction at peak beats (the memory-surge, the ritual completion) stays in explanatory mode rather than tightening to immediate sensation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops appear: "stolen memories were not lost but hidden" and "stolen memories were no longer hidden, but now rooted" restate the same claim across paragraphs. Template cadence runs cluster in the hull-cataloging sequence ("She moved… she reached… she lifted… she realized"). Figurative density ("secrets began to whisper," "stories are alive," "truth settle like freshly turned soil") crowds several beats without pattern-teaching or payoff. Clarity remains intact, but momentum sags under ornamental rephrasing.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The fairy-ring-as-memory-key and constellation-mapping method combine familiar fantasy-archive tropes without transformation: the protagonist encounters no false lead, misreading, or tactical failure that would make the synthesis feel earned. The ending's complete restoration (water recedes, orchard returns, songs resume) defaults to median wish-fulfillment without a non-obvious cost or moral calculus. Risk-averse satisfaction without a fresh inflection on the memory-recovery premise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The folklorist appears throughout (setup ✓) and performs actions (studying hulls, lifting sextant, arranging caps), but her choices do not create turns—the narrative proceeds as smooth catalog rather than decision-under-pressure. Middle beats show observation and ritual execution without friction (development weak). She is present in the ending but passive: the water recedes and songs emerge without her making a final choice that forecloses an option (payoff present but not causal). Swappable with "archaeologist" or "historian" with minor edits. Late-penalty waived (present early). Band: functional but replaceable; causal pressure absent. 5.0–0.8 (swappability).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The mushroom is pinned to her coat (setup ✓, early signal +0.5), glows and reflects the sextant constellation (beat 1 +0.4), and is rearranged into a new pattern to trigger the water's recession (beat 2 +0.4, causal pressure +0.8, closure linkage +1.0). Its glow pulses with the final verses, charging the ending image (+0.3). Specificity moderate: the constellation-matching property matters, but "enchanted token" could substitute with edits (−0.4). Total rough build: 3.0 base +3.4 positives −0.4 swap friction = ~6.0; strong closure participation lifts to 6.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>The "decades later" frame appears in the opening sentence (setup ✓) and closing reflection, but it does not shape on-page stakes or tactics—the mission and ritual occur in present action, unaffected by the temporal distance. The frame adds thematic nostalgic coloring (tone support) but remains ornamental to causality (development ✗, payoff ✗). Two-gate miss (no middle or closure participation beyond summary) caps at ~3.4. Lyric-resonance allowance: the return reweights mood slightly but not the dominant stake. Score: 3.1.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"Chronically curious" is declared early (setup ✓, label +0.3) but never constrains a choice—no moment where curiosity drives her into risk against caution or fatigue. It summarizes character rather than enabling a visible tradeoff (development ✗, payoff ✗). Present but label-only (−0.3), swappable with "determined" or "dedicated" (−0.4). Two-gate miss caps at 3.4; label penalty and swappability hold it there.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Detect" is signaled early (she learned to detect mythic energy, setup ✓ +0.5) and used in beat 1 (tracing constellations on hulls +0.4) and beat 2 (sextant shards confirm the fairy ring as key, +0.4). It enables the ritual completion (causal pressure +0.8, closure linkage +0.9). However, "observe" or "sense" could replace it with minimal structural change (−0.6 swappability). Three gates met; strong positives lift to mid-6s, swap friction lowers to 5.9.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The method is established early (she studied broken constellations on hulls, setup ✓ +0.6), employed actively in beat 1 (tracing hulls to map memory currents +0.4) and beat 2 (sextant constellation confirms the fairy ring pattern +0.4), and directly shapes the ending ritual (arranging mushroom caps into a new constellation, closure linkage +1.0, causal pressure +0.9). Specificity strong: the constellation-matching mechanic is unique (+0.5). Three gates; strong causal and closure involvement. Total build: 3.0 +3.8 = ~6.8, minor swap possibility (runes/symbols) −0.5 = 6.3.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The setting is anchored early (setup ✓ +0.6) with vivid sensory detail (amber light, kelp, rusted masts). The wrecks form a ring mirroring the fungus, supplying the constellation clues (beat 1 +0.4), and the central wreck holds the sextant (beat 2 +0.4). The greenhouse frames the ending image (payoff ✓ +0.4). However, the environment never constrains a choice—no tidal clock, unstable footing, or toxic spore risk alters tactics (causal pressure low +0.2). Three gates met; moderate involvement; lack of constraint friction −0.6. Build: 3.0 +2.0 −0.6 ≈ 4.4, strong atmosphere and closure framing lift within band to 5.7.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"When habits break" appears as a reflective aside mid-story (setup late, second third −0.3) but does not tighten decisions or create a clock—the ritual proceeds at narrative convenience without temporal pressure (development ✗, payoff ✗). It echoes thematically in the penultimate paragraph but remains abstract (label-only −0.3). Two-gate miss caps at 3.4; late intro and ornamental use lower to 2.6.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The motivation is declared early ("to recover stolen memories," setup ✓ +0.6) and drives the hull-mapping and ritual sequences (beat 1 +0.4, beat 2 +0.4, causal pressure +0.7). The ending delivers complete success (closure linkage +0.8). However, no on-page friction tests the desire—no moment where recovery conflicts with another want or imposes visible cost (cost connection absent). Three gates; solid involvement; lack of conflicted choice −0.5. Build: 3.0 +2.9 −0.5 = 5.4, closure participation lifts to 5.8.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The tone blends lyric sensory detail (amber light, salt and sugar air) with gentle retrospection ("decades later," "freshly turned soil"), coherent throughout (setup ✓ +0.5). It modulates slightly at the memory-surge beat (urgency) and the song-gathering ending (warmth), supporting the RR attempt (payoff ✓ +0.5, closure linkage +0.6). However, "wistful melancholy" or "bittersweet longing" could replace "crisp nostalgia" with minimal tonal shift (−0.5 swappability). Two gates (setup, payoff); lyric-resonance allowance applies. Build: 3.0 +1.6 −0.5 = 4.1, strong atmospheric consistency lifts within band to 5.1.</comment>
