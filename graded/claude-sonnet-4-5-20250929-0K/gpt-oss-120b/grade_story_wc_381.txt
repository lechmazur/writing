<question>1</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The summoner remains entirely opaque—no interiority, contradiction, or embodied emotion. Her actions (kneeling, whispering, walking) are gestures without motive friction or cost; we never see her weigh options or struggle. The "tranquil blaze of purpose" is a label, not a dramatized state. No meaningful change or renunciation occurs; she completes her ritual smoothly and disappears, leaving no visible price paid or path foreclosed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed past 120 words (we learn "she" and "brook" early, but who she is and why she is here arrives only through retrospective exposition). The ritual proceeds as a sequence of steps without reversal, complication, or agency—she places the wing, chants, the wing glows, mission complete. No decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing occurs on the page; the prophecy is "sealed" by declaration, not dramatized cost. The lens is ambiguous (accumulative texture without a causal turn or situational crystallization), and closure is absent.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The nocturnal brook, fireflies, and forest are vividly described but remain postcard scenery—none constrain a choice or alter tactics. The crane's wing sits on a stone without spatial friction. Sensory detail (pine, rain, molten glass) is lush but disconnected from pressure or POV filter; it reads as catalog rather than character-selective perception.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—hushing the prophecy—is declared but never tested. No reversal, tightening, or complication occurs; the ritual succeeds without obstacle, sacrifice, or trade-off. The summoner's agency is ceremonial rather than decision-driven; she follows a script with no visible cost or forfeiture. Pressure is static throughout.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Theme of silence as power and cosmic connection is repeatedly stated ("mapping silence," "smoothed hush," "tranquil blaze") but never earned through conflict or particular choice. The final image—brook resuming song, stars honoring—delivers a moral summary rather than a resonant reconfiguration. The crane's wing is treated as symbolic shorthand without dramatized cost or friction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, but the narration is tonally uniform—elevated, distant, and generic. Diction ("nocturnal haven," "terrestrially cosmic," "incandescent glow") reads as thesaurus-driven rather than voice-particular. No perceptual signature or bias; the summoner notices everything with equal poetic weight. The prose lacks modulation under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Dense metaphor and synonym churn pervade: "smoothed hush," "tranquil blaze," "mapping silence," "terrestrially cosmic" are repeated or paraphrased without new pressure. Template cadence dominates ("She whispered… She felt… She placed… She rose…"). Figurative language in nearly every sentence ("molten glass," "web of stars," "river of stars") blurs sense without pattern-teaching. Paraphrase loops across adjacent lines (e.g., "hush settled… unfurled… spreading") and stock phrases ("destiny itself," "peace and hidden power") flatten momentum. Artifacts touch the closure beat ("tranquil blaze within her would keep the smoothed hush alive").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The ritual-to-prevent-disaster frame is template-familiar, and the story does not transform it through specific choice or non-obvious cost. Stock imagery (fireflies, starlight, glowing wing) and generic stakes (prophecy, veil between earth and star) lack fresh synthesis. The summoner's success without obstacle or sacrifice reads as middle-ground hedging. No risk-taking or bold inflection.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>The solitary summoner is present throughout but makes no decisions that alter tactics or stakes. She executes a ritual without complication, obstacle, or internal conflict. Observation and ceremonial action dominate; no choice with cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The crane's origami wing appears early (setup), is placed on the stone and vibrates (middle development), and glows at the end (closure participation). However, it is handled passively—no choice constrained by its properties, no visible cost tied to its use. It serves as a conduit without irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The "smoothed hush" is mentioned repeatedly as a concept and goal but does not constrain tactics or alter on-page options. It functions as thematic echo rather than stake-shaping mechanic. No cost or trade-off tied to achieving it.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Terrestrially cosmic" is a label for the crane's wing and the connection being forged, but it does not constrain or enable any on-page action. No visible tradeoff or cost tied to this attribute. Ornamental descriptor.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Flow" (brook's flow, flow of night, currents) recurs as imagery and metaphor but does not drive a turn. The brook "resumes its song" at the end, but this shift is asserted rather than causally earned. Swappable with similar closure gestures.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Mapping silence" is named as the ritual method and described ("trace the hidden currents of quiet"), but its mechanics never matter. The summoner whispers, the wing vibrates, glyphs appear—no struggle, adjustment, or cost tied to the method itself. Summary-only.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>The nocturnal haven beside the quiet brook is established early (setup) and reappears at the end (closure mention), but it does not constrain choice or supply resources that affect outcome. Postcard description without tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"Amid whispered secrets" is a vague temporal frame mentioned once in the opening. No live clock, tightening deadline, or time-driven decision. The ritual proceeds at ceremonial pace without urgency.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The motivation to hush the prophecy is stated early and frames the ritual, but it is never dramatized through conflicted choice or visible cost. The summoner wants this, achieves it smoothly, and departs—no friction between desire and price.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>"Tranquil blaze" is named and echoed ("fireflies traced luminous arcs, crafting a tranquil blaze"), but tone remains static—uniformly elevated and serene—without modulation under pressure. No tonal shift charges the final image.</comment>
