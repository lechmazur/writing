<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The whisperer remains an abstract agent who observes and records but never faces a genuine internal contradiction or makes a choice with visible tradeoff. Her "purpose" is declared singular yet she never struggles against competing impulses or temptations that would test commitment. Interiority consists of stock mystical phrasing—"weave truth carefully," "threading each revelation like ice filaments"—that sounds like a prompt echo rather than embodied thought under pressure. The final choice to "guide those shards back" arrives without prior resistance or cost, reading as wish-fulfillment rather than earned agency.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation Test: Who, where, and when anchor by ~120 words (shrine, glacier, whisperer established early), so no penalty applied here. Drive lens is ambiguous—partly accumulative (dream cataloging), partly causal (whisper → vapor window), yet the piece never commits; by closure the mechanism remains decorative rather than pressure-driven, triggering −0.4 for lens drift and capping Q2 at 7.2. Closure form: the "melted snow globe pulsed brighter" and "fragment had already begun its journey home" is told reassurance, not a dramatized reversal with on-page cost; Cost Proof Test fails—no exact sentence shows a visible price paid or option foreclosed at the ending beat. The story summarizes a process (recording dreams, embedding a cameo) but never dramatizes a pivotal on-page turn where the whisperer's action narrows her own options or generates new friction. Applying Non-closure Accumulation Cap for two distinct issues (lens ambiguity, cost absence): −1.5 within Q2.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The glacier shrine is vivid in opening lines—"candle-lit shrine carved into glacier ice," "borrowed starlight…painting the walls with trembling silver"—but remains postcard description; it never constrains a tactical choice or supplies a resource that alters outcome. The melted snow globe sits at the altar yet is handled only once (palm on liquid surface) with no spatial consequence. The 9+ gate (environment/tool/object must constrain choice or charge final image) is not met; the globe "pulsed brighter" is summary glow, not a charged spatial moment. Micro-setting allowance: the globe could function as object-as-setting, but its presence does not alter the whisperer's moves or generate friction, keeping the score mid-band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—"salvage something pure from the wreckage"—is signaled early but remains abstract; no on-page tightening forces the whisperer to trade one good for another or foreclose a path. The piece catalogs dream fragments (compass, gull, shard) without reversal; each new image confirms the pattern rather than complicating it. Agency is observation plus a whispered invitation, not a decision under competing pressure. The Cost Proof Test fails: no sentence shows a visible price—no stamina spent, resource lost, or social credit burned—that charges the final image. One meaningful tightening is absent; applying −0.8 for escalation gap and −0.5 for cost opacity yields 4.6.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Theme—purity within wreckage, collective dreams as bridge—emerges from repeated images (melted globe, borrowed starlight, dream shards) but arrives pre-packaged rather than earned through character friction. The final line, "the pure thing she salvaged would illuminate countless other shattered dreams," is a thematic assertion that replaces scene pressure with prompt echo. No competing moral calculus or ambiguity; the whisperer's conviction is unopposed, so the theme lacks tension. The piece invites reflection through atmosphere, lifting it above pure ornament, but the closure restates rather than reweights the premise.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited, no head-hopping. Diction carries a consistent lyric register—"borrowed starlight," "weave truth carefully," "moon-lit water"—that maintains atmospheric coherence. However, the voice leans toward elevated generic mysticism rather than character-particular perception; phrases like "a choir of quiet light" and "the veil thicken" read interchangeable across fantasy narrators. Under peak pressure (whispering into the crystal, entering the dream) the syntax does not compress or shift rhythm, missing an opportunity to embody urgency. Filter verbs ("felt the veil," "felt the cold melt") are acceptable when voice-motivated, but here they dull immediacy in key beats without serving a distinct perceptual signature.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and synonym churn are pervasive: "expose the hidden purity" / "release the pure essence" / "seed of purity yearning for light" / "the pure thing she salvaged" recycle the same concept across four beats without added pressure. Template cadence appears in parallel "she + [verb]" stems: "She had learned," "She achieved," "She mapped," "She whispered," "She traced," "She stepped," "She whispered," "She realized," "She rose"—nine instances creating monotonous rhythm. Metaphor muddle: "window of connection" is introduced as portal, then lattice, then translucent vapor window, mixing vehicles without coherent physical logic (−0.5). Stock mystical phrases—"borrowed starlight," "dream-tide," "moon-lit water"—appear in most sentences of high-pressure beats without pattern-teaching or payoff (density penalty −0.4). Applying Patterned-artifact penalty pack: baseline −1.2 for loops and template cadence; artifacts touch the closure beat ("pulsed brighter," "illuminate countless other shattered dreams"), escalating to −1.7 and disallowing 9+ globally, capping high-band entries at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Core premise—ghost whisperer salvages purity by mapping strangers' dreams—is a synthesis of familiar elements (psychic investigator, collective unconscious, mystical puzzle-solving) without a non-obvious inflection. The wreck-diver credential and glacier shrine add atmospheric detail but do not transform the emotional arc or moral calculus; swapping "wreck-diver" for "scholar" or "shrine" for "chapel" would leave the plot and stakes unchanged (transformation test failure). Cameo appearances and dream-mapping mechanics echo widely used fantasy templates without lived specificity or unexpected consequence. The ending's promise—"illuminate countless other shattered dreams"—is aspirational reassurance rather than a specific, hard-won insight. Applying Derivative Premise Guardrail: −0.8 for template reliance without transformation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The wreck-diver ghost whisperer is present throughout but makes no on-page decision that alters tactics or forecloses a path. She descends, observes, records, whispers, and sleeps—observation beats without conflict. The "wreck-diver" credential is ornamental (never used; no diving occurs) and "ghost whisperer" label does not constrain her method or generate friction. Setup present, no middle choice that tests the trait, closure is told reassurance ("she knew the pure thing she salvaged…"). Two gates met; eligible to ~6.0 per guidance, but swappability (could be "dream scholar" or "seer") and ornamental use lower the score. Deductions: late development (no middle choice) −0.5, swappability −0.5, ornamental wreck-diver mention −0.3. Starting anchor 3.0 + early signal +0.5 + closure cameo (told, not causal) +0.2 = 3.7 − 1.3 = 2.4, round down 2.4 but label-only trait artifacts push to 3.2 after applying dominant limiter.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Melted snow globe appears in opening beat (altar), is touched once mid-story (palm on liquid surface), reappears as pulsing beacon at closure. Three gates met; eligible for ≥6.1. Beat involvement: opening description, touch beat, closure pulse = three touches but only two functionally distinct beats (setup + closure reprise; the touch does not narrow options). Causal pressure minimal—globe is observed, not used to solve a problem. Closure linkage present but told ("pulsed brighter") rather than charged through action. Specificity moderate (melted crystal, liquid mirror, warped skin). Starting anchor 3.0 + early signal +0.6 + two beats +0.9 + closure linkage +0.8 + specificity +0.4 = 5.7. Deductions: swappability (could be "broken mirror" or "enchanted lens") −0.4, summary-only closure use −0.3 = 5.0, but the lyric reprise reweights slightly, lifting to 5.9.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Windows of connection is introduced early ("portal once sealed by the sea's own grief"), described as lattice mid-story, manifests as translucent vapor window at closure. Setup present by first third. Development: the lattice "formed a window" linking globe to dreamers—described, not dramatized as a choice-altering constraint. Payoff: vapor window appears at closure but does not require protagonist agency; it simply forms after the whisper. Two gates met (setup + payoff); eligible to ~6.0. However, the concept remains thematic decoration rather than a mechanic that narrows options. Starting anchor 3.0 + early signal +0.5 + closure appearance +0.7 = 4.2. Deductions: no middle development (lattice is summary) −0.4, ornamental (concept echoed, not used) −0.6 = 3.2. Partial credit for closure presence lifts to 4.3.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Weaves truth carefully appears in opening paragraph ("learned to weave truth carefully, threading each revelation like ice filaments") and is echoed once at closure ("whispered the truth she had woven"). Setup present. Development absent—no middle beat where careful weaving constrains her method or generates tradeoff (she could speak plainly with no on-page consequence). Payoff is label repetition without cost. Two gates borderline (setup yes, payoff is echo only). Starting anchor 3.0 + early signal +0.4 + closure echo +0.2 = 3.6. Deductions: label-only trait (no on-page action testing carefulness) −0.3, no middle development −0.4, swappability (could be "speaks gently" or "reveals slowly") −0.4 = 2.5. Dominant limiter (label-only) caps near 3.8.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Expose appears in opening ("her purpose was singular: to expose the hidden purity") and at closure ("expose the hidden beauty even in the deepest wreck"). Setup present as stated goal. Development: the whisperer's cataloging and whispering are methods to expose, but no middle turn hinges on the act of exposing versus concealing. Payoff: final line restates the goal without dramatizing a moment where exposure creates consequence. Two gates met (setup + thematic payoff). Starting anchor 3.0 + early signal +0.6 + closure echo +0.4 = 4.0. Deductions: no causal middle turn tied to expose/conceal choice −0.5, swappability (could be "reveal" or "uncover") −0.4, summary-only payoff −0.3 = 2.8. Partial credit for thematic coherence lifts to 4.7.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Analyzing cameo appearances in strangers' dreams is signaled early ("by analyzing cameo appearances in strangers' dreams that drifted like smoke"), executed mid-story (recording sailor dreams, mapping images), and referenced at closure ("embed a final cameo in each sleeper's dream"). All three gates met; eligible for ≥6.1. Beat involvement: description beat, mapping beat, embedding invitation beat = three touches. Causal pressure moderate—the method shapes her tactics (she records, maps, embeds). Closure linkage present but the final cameo is planned, not dramatized. Starting anchor 3.0 + early signal +0.7 + three beats +1.4 + causal pressure +0.8 + closure linkage +0.7 = 6.6. Deductions: summary-only execution (dreams recounted, not dramatized) −0.8, swappability (could be "reading visions" or "interpreting omens") −0.6 = 5.2.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Candle-lit shrine carved into glacier ice anchors the opening and closing beats. Setup strong (location, sensory detail). Development: shrine supplies the altar where the globe rests, candles flicker during the whisper beat, but the environment never constrains a choice (she could perform the ritual anywhere). Payoff: she "rose from the shrine" at closure. Two gates met (setup + payoff). Starting anchor 3.0 + early signal +0.8 + closure presence +0.5 = 4.3. The 9+ gate (setting must constrain choice or charge final image) is not met—shrine is postcard, not tactical. Deductions: postcard description without choice-pressure −0.7, swappability (could be "cave temple" or "frozen chapel") −0.5 = 3.1. Lyric reprise (opening shrine → closing departure) adds +0.4, lifting to 3.5. Specificity (glacier, candles, starlight) adds +0.5 = 4.0. Coherent atmospheric role adds +0.8 = 4.8.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>N/A</grade><comment>Required element is "None."</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>To salvage something pure from the wreckage is stated early ("her purpose was singular: to expose the hidden purity"), reiterated mid-story ("the wreck's sorrow could be mended," "seed of purity yearning for light"), and restated at closure ("the pure thing she salvaged would illuminate…"). All three gates met. Beat involvement: opening goal, middle whisper to release pure essence, closing promise = three touches. Causal pressure minimal—the desire is told, not tested by competing wants or costs. Closure linkage present but summary. Starting anchor 3.0 + early signal +0.7 + three beats +1.4 + closure linkage +0.7 = 5.8. Deductions: told-only desire with no friction (no moment where she must choose between purity and another value) −0.8, label repetition ("pure," "purity," "pure thing") −0.3 = 4.7. Thematic coherence across all beats lifts to 5.6.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Borrowed starlight appears in opening ("air shimmered with borrowed starlight"), mid-story ("each flame catching a sliver of the borrowed starlight"), and closure ("borrowed starlight now solidified in her veins"). All three gates met. Beat involvement: opening atmosphere, candle beat, closing image = three distinct touches. Tone is consistently ethereal and elegiac, modulating subtly (opening shimmer → mid-story choir of light → closing solidification suggests accumulation). Closure linkage strong—starlight "solidified in her veins" charges the final image with a sense of transformation. Starting anchor 3.0 + early signal +0.8 + three beats +1.4 + closure linkage +1.2 + tone modulation +0.5 = 6.9. Deductions: the phrase is slightly generic (could be "moonlight" or "distant glow") −0.4, and the final metaphor ("solidified in her veins") is told rather than enacted through action −0.4 = 6.1.</comment>
