<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Mara functions primarily as a vessel for the plot machinery rather than a character with contradictory impulses. Her "searing reverie" is asserted repeatedly but never embodied through specific micro-choices under pressure—she moves through the quest without visible internal conflict or cost that forecloses options. The sand-carvers and Qadir appear only as convenient plot facilitators. No meaningful change or renunciation is earned; the ending declares triumph without dramatizing what Mara sacrificed or how the journey altered her.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The piece reads as a linear quest checklist (summons → letters → diary → parley → descent → crystal → broadcast) without causal pressure or meaningful reversal. Orientation is delayed: by line ~120 words we know Mara's role and the zeppelin setting, but the obsidian lagoon premise and retrocognitive trap are introduced as told backstory rather than dramatized complications. The "retrocognitive trap" that "only released secrets when the reader remembered the future" is asserted but never constrains a choice on the page—Mara simply "realized" it, then proceeds. The closure—broadcasting testimonies that make dunes tremble—is a declared outcome with no visible cost or trade-off; we are told the weight lifted but see no price paid. Drive lens is ambiguous: the piece gestures toward Causal (quest steps) but escalation is absent, and the ending reads more like thematic summary than a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The zeppelin library, dunes, and obsidian lagoon are vividly described ("brass hull humming like a distant prayer," "violet reflections on black water") but remain postcard backdrops. The beach-debris messages are told rather than shown in use; we learn Mara "arranged them in spirals, arrows, and fractal patterns" but never see her hands working or a single pattern tested under pressure. Spatial choreography inside the zeppelin and during the descent is vague. The lagoon's crystal "pulsed with data" but its physical properties (size, weight, temperature) are absent, and it does not constrain Mara's final choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—uncovering suppressed histories—is declared early but never tested by a live trade-off or obstacle that forces Mara to choose between competing goods. The parley with Qadir is resolved off-page ("agreed only if"), the retrocognitive cipher is decoded via a chronometer with no dramatized attempt or failure, and the final broadcast encounters no resistance. No reversal or tightening narrows options; the plot advances by assertion. The ending claims "countless suppressed voices lift" but no on-page cost (time, safety, alliance, resource) is visible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The theme of recovered memory versus erasure is stated overtly ("reclaimed memory," "suppressed voices") rather than emerging from particulars. The obsidian lagoon and violet-glowing brass panels gesture toward symbolic resonance but feel ornamental—neither object constrains a choice or reweights prior material at closure. The final image ("parley of sand and sky had forged a new covenant") is abstract moralizing, not a concrete scene moment. "Searing reverie" is repeated as a label without embodied cost or contradiction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent but elevated and homogeneous throughout, with no modulation under pressure ("her heart burned with a searing reverie, a relentless heat that turned memory into flame"). Psychic distance remains distant-omniscient; we are told Mara's feelings but rarely shown her perception filtering the world in a character-particular way. No dialogue appears, so voice distinction is not testable. Register occasionally drifts into pseudo-poetic abstraction ("temporal snare," "spectrum that Mara could translate") that feels more thematic than rooted in Mara's interiority.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Template cadence dominates: "The [noun] [verbed]" and "She [verbed], [gerund phrase]" structures repeat across the text. Paraphrase loops are frequent—"searing reverie" appears three times, "suppressed voices" twice, and the diary's encryption is restated in adjacent lines ("encrypted," "retrocognitively trapped," "demanded a code of compassion"). Key beats are summarized rather than dramatized: "She convened a final parley…promising to share" and "Mara broadcasted the decoded entries" tell outcomes without showing the acts. Figurative density is high but often mixed or inert: "heart burned with a searing reverie, a relentless heat that turned memory into flame" stacks fire metaphors without fresh vehicle. These artifacts pervade the closure third, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8 per the artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The core premise—floating library, encrypted diary, suppressed histories—combines familiar quest and recovery tropes without a specific transformation. The retrocognitive trap and beach-debris cipher are conceptually intriguing but remain ornamental; neither alters tactics or reveals character under pressure. The emotional arc (archivist recovers truth, broadcasts it, feels relief) is generic and could transplant to any recovery narrative with minor name changes. No risk-taking or non-obvious synthesis elevates the material.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>Mara is present throughout but makes no on-page decisions that narrow options or create turns. She is summoned, realizes, negotiates (off-page), descends, and broadcasts—all presented as sequential completions rather than choices under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The obsidian lagoon is introduced early (setup), visited at mid-story (development), and its crystal shapes the broadcast (payoff). However, its properties are told rather than tested: the "cool resistance of history" and pulsing crystal are described but do not constrain Mara's hand or decode attempt. Two-gate presence (setup + payoff) is clear, but the lagoon remains more symbol than active constraint.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The encrypted diary is mentioned early and decoded via the chronometer, but the decryption is summarized ("the code unfolded") without dramatized attempts, failures, or trade-offs. It frames the quest but does not shape on-page tactics or force a choice with cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>1.2</grade><comment>"Retrocognitively trapped" is a label asserted once ("only released its secrets when the reader remembered the future") but never constrains an action or imposes a visible cost. Mara "realized" the trait and then proceeds; it does not alter her method or timeline on the page.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Two parleys are mentioned: one with Qadir (resolved off-page by agreeing to the beach-debris condition) and a final parley promising story-sharing. Neither is dramatized as a negotiation with competing offers or visible concessions. The element is functionally present but does not create a turn or redefine options.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Beach-debris messages are described in one passage ("kelp remnants, shattered shells, sea-glass shards…arranged in spirals, arrows, and fractal patterns") but never shown in construction or tested under pressure. The method unlocks the passage off-page ("the sand-carvers traced…the dunes emitted a low hum") without dramatized trial or failure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>The zeppelin library is vivid in description ("brass hull," "observation deck," "gondola rocking gently") and provides a launch point and return frame, but does not constrain Mara's choices or supply resources that alter tactics. It functions as backdrop rather than active pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"After the letters are found" anchors the inciting moment, but elapsed time during the quest (nights arranging debris, descent, decoding, broadcast) is vague and does not tighten decisions. No clock or deadline pressures Mara's moves.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"To uncover truth in tension" is asserted via "searing reverie" labels but not dramatized as conflicting wants or costs. Mara's desire is single-track and uncomplicated; no friction between personal risk, alliance cost, or competing goods appears on the page.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Searing reverie" is invoked three times and the prose sustains an elevated, quasi-mystical register throughout. The tone is coherent but static—no modulation occurs as pressure (theoretically) rises or at closure. The final image ("zeppelin drifted onward…Mara smiled") shifts to soft triumph without tonal cost or friction.</comment>
