<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Mara's core motivation—refracting truth through art—is clear, but her interior remains abstract and label-driven ("defiant spirit," "innocently mischievous") rather than embodied through contradictory impulses acting in scene. The townsfolk function as backdrop; no relationship pressure forces trade-offs. The final "calm" resolution feels asserted rather than earned through visible cost that forecloses a path. Emotional progression flattens into a single arc of collective uplift without struggle or self-deception complicating the journey.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The piece assembles an accumulative/textural lens with recurring image beats (pale spire, refracted echoes, bone towers), but causality remains opaque: Mara's actions (chalk sketches, mural, poetry sessions) do not narrow options or change knowledge in traceable steps. The "ritual" frame promises a tightening deadline but never constrains tactics on the page. The ending offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (collective forgiveness crystallized), yet the cost—"acceptance of loss"—is declared rather than demonstrated through a concrete forfeiture or choice that forecloses a live path. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within the first 120 words, waiving that penalty.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The canyon, bone towers, and pale spire create vivid atmosphere and recur throughout, but remain largely descriptive. The mural "glows faintly" and the spire "flickers," yet neither object constrains a choice or alters tactics in a pivotal beat. Spatial choreography is coherent (platform, pillar, mist), and sensory detail is selective, but the setting functions as stage rather than crucible. The micro-setting allowance is not met; no tool or body-constrained choice charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—earning forgiveness through art—is signaled early, but pressure remains static. Mara gathers townsfolk, paints, and speaks; each beat repeats the same tactic (refraction via poetry/art) without escalation, reversal, or a trade-off that narrows options. The "price" is named repeatedly but never tested: no on-page choice forces Mara to forfeit a competing good or accept a visible loss. The ritual arrives as backdrop, not as a tightening clock that alters her tactics. Coincidence does not resolve, but agency also does not drive a meaningful turn.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The theme of forgiveness-through-refracted-truth emerges from images (spire, echoes, mural) and recurs across beats, avoiding direct statement. However, the townsfolk's collective "weight lift" and Mara's final calm resolution feel abstract; the story does not interrogate competing costs or invite ambiguity. The ending line "We are the echo" gestures toward resonance, but it arrives as assertion rather than a non-literal answer earned from prior particulars. Subtext operates in imagery but not in conflicted choices or ironic gaps between knowledge states.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping, and perceptual filter is consistent (Mara's artist lens). Diction carries some specificity ("wounded beast," "forged hush"), but elevated register ("Let this echo carry us beyond the mist") drifts from the innocent-mischievous trait and reads as authorial rather than character-particular. Dialogue is minimal (one whispered line to Lio); when present, it advances plot but lacks subtext or character distinction. Psychic distance stays mid-range without purposeful modulation under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The prose is grammatically clean and rhythmically varied, but pervasive template cadence ("She [verb]… The [noun] [verb]…") and paraphrase loops dull momentum: "refract," "price," "pale spire," and "forged hush" recur without reweighting, often restating the same content across adjacent sentences. Figurative density is high ("wounded beast," "frozen finger," "shards of cold silver") without pattern-teaching or payoff, creating overwriting in non-peak beats. Information density is low; many sentences describe rather than advance. No filter-verb stacks or register-drift errors, but the line-level artifacts (paraphrase loops, template stems) cluster throughout and touch the closure paragraph ("We are the echo" restates the core concept rather than dramatizing cost).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The canyon-of-bone setting and refraction-through-poetry frame offer surface novelty, but the emotional arc—collective catharsis via shared art—follows a familiar template without transformation. The "price of forgiveness" concept is not interrogated through competing goods or moral calculus; instead, it resolves into tidy uplift. Mara's defiance softens predictably, and the townsfolk's identical response ("eyes shining with reflected truth") lacks individual friction. No bold structural risk; the piece progresses as a series of descriptive tableaux. One fresh inflection—the mural as spoken confession—gestures toward synthesis but does not earn the closure turn.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Mara is present throughout and paints/speaks across multiple beats, but her choices do not create key turns: she repeats the same tactic (refraction via art/poetry) without a reversal or trade-off. The final step-back moment observes rather than decides. She is causally active but does not alter options through her decisions.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The pale spire appears in at least four beats (opening, poetry session echo, mural glow, ritual glow), returning with slight reweighting (from static to "flickering" to "glowing beacon"). However, it remains descriptive; no character handles or uses it to alter tactics. The final glow reconfigures meaning slightly, but the spire is backdrop rather than tool or constraint.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The concept "price of forgiveness" frames the dominant stake and appears in at least three beats (early framing, mural sunrise, final collective lift). It shapes Mara's goal—offering art as payment—but does not constrain or alter tactics on the page; the "price" is declared ("acceptance of loss") rather than tested through a choice that forecloses a path. Present in the final image (forgiveness "earned"), earning closure linkage, but swappable with "cost of redemption" or similar.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Innocently mischievous" is labeled in the opening ("scattering chalk sketches… as if the walls might giggle") but does not constrain or enable a later choice with cost. The trait colors description but remains ornamental; removing it would not alter any beat's outcome or pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Refract" is signaled early and recurs across at least four beats: chalk sketches, poetry echoes off the spire, mural sunrise, final line splitting into verses. It structures Mara's tactics (scattering one truth into many) and charges the ending image (the painted line refracted through mist). The action could be swapped for "scatter" or "echo" with minor edits, limiting irreplaceability, but it drives the thematic through-line and shapes the closure unit.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Impromptu poetry sessions appear in at least two beats (gathering townsfolk, Lio's chant) and the method matters—Mara uses spoken verse to generate echoes. The mechanics are signaled (verses "tumble," echoes return "transformed"), and the sessions enable the collective lift at the end. However, the method is interchangeable with any communal ritual; it does not impose a unique constraint or cost that alters tactics under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The canyon and bone towers are established early, recur across beats (platform, pillars, resonating drums), and supply resources (the mural surface, echo acoustics). They shape the final image (towers "trembling gently"). However, they do not constrain a choice or alter tactics; Mara's actions would work in any echo-chamber setting. Micro-setting option not met; no body or tool constraint charges the closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>The timeframe "before the ritual" is named in the opening and closing, creating a mild deadline frame. However, the ritual never arrives on the page to force a choice; it remains backdrop. No live clock tightens tactics or narrows Mara's options in any beat.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The motivation "to refract a single truth into many" is stated early and drives Mara's actions across beats (chalk, mural, poetry sessions). It shapes her goal but is not dramatized through conflicted choice or friction between want and cost; Mara pursues it without obstacle or internal contradiction. The motivation is present in the ending (line splitting into verses) but told-only rather than tested.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Forged hush" is named twice (opening gathering tone, pre-ritual deepening) and the tone remains coherent—quiet, ceremonial, charged—through turns. However, it does not modulate purposefully under pressure; the hush is static atmosphere rather than a dynamic element that charges the final image. Present but decorative.</comment>
