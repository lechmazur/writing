<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lira's interiority is present but relies heavily on abstraction ("to transform scars into stories," "pressure of the moment") rather than embodied contradiction. The scars function as symbolic wounds rather than genuine flaws that complicate choices. The tea ceremony sequence shows no micro-choices under pressure—she executes a ritual without conflict or hesitation. No meaningful internal contradiction acts in scene; the resolution ("each line of pain now a luminous rune of purpose") is declared rather than earned through on-page struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Orientation Test: who and where anchor by the opening, but *when* remains vague (no temporal marker beyond "between storms"). Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers images (crow quill, tea, scars, jasmine) without causal linkage. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration (scars transform into luminous runes), but no visible cost is legible—the transformation is asserted, not enacted through forfeiture or foreclosed option. The platform's descent is a spatial move, not a stake-altering consequence. Cost proof test fails: cannot point to a sentence where Lira pays a price or loses an option at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The floating platform, moonstone tea set, and crow quill are vividly rendered with purposeful sensory detail (jasmine scent, crystal shards singing). Spatial choreography is coherent throughout. However, the setting does not constrain a choice or charge the final image—Lira's actions would proceed identically on solid ground. The quill's crystallizing attribute is described but never limits her tactics. Misses the 9+ gate: environment present but ornamental to closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("transform scars into stories") is signaled early but never tested. No reversal, tightening, or foreclosed option appears—Lira performs a ritual without complication, and the scars simply lift. The piece offers atmosphere but no escalation under the Accumulative lens: density does not increase, no pattern breaks, no cadence shift reweights cost. Agency is absent; the transformation occurs to her rather than through a decision with visible price. No on-page cost that alters tactics or forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Theme (healing through story, release of past failure) emerges from the scars-as-runes conceit and the grandmother's chant. Subtext operates in the ritual gestures and the quill's crystallization. However, the ending states the theme overtly ("not as wounds but as luminous verses ready to be read") rather than letting the final image answer non-literally. The phrase "smiled softly brightly" is a syntactic stumble that undermines the quiet closure. Epiphany is asserted, not earned through specific struggle.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Diction carries a lyric, elevated register consistent with the rune-scholar frame ("saturated hush," "luminous rune of purpose"). Perceptual signature is present (Lira notices glyphs, resonance, crystallization). However, syntactic patterns recur (many sentences open with "She [verb]" or "The [noun]"), and figurative density is high without always clarifying action. The phrase "smiled softly brightly" is an adverbial muddle. Filter verbs ("feeling," "watching") cluster in peak beats, dulling immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "a breath between storms" recurs three times with minimal reweighting; "held breath" and "breath between storms" overlap; "saturated hush" appears twice in identical phrasing. Template cadence: multiple "She [verb]" openers and "The [noun]" sentence stems. Figurative language is dense ("cloak humming with resonance," "liquid ripple like a nervous heartbeat," "crystal shards…sang with the wind") but coherence slips—crystal "shards" that "sang" and then "dissolved into mist" lack physical logic. "Smiled softly brightly" is ungrammatical. Line-level artifacts touch the closure paragraph, triggering the artifact cap and disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The rune-scholar-transforms-scars premise is a recognizable template (magical ritual heals metaphorical wounds). Specific details (crow quill crystallization, floating tea platform, moonstone) add texture but do not transform the arc—substitute any ritual tool and the emotional journey remains unchanged. No fresh inflection at closure; the scars-to-light transformation is linearly executed without complication or non-obvious turn. The piece commits to its lyric premise but does not take structural or moral risk that would elevate originality.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Lira is present throughout and the ritual is hers, but she makes no choices that create turns—she executes a pre-planned ceremony without complication or adaptation. Observation dominates over decision. Functional but replaceable: any practitioner could perform this sequence.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The crow quill appears in multiple beats: cradled at opening, tip placed in tea, feather falls at closure. Its crystallizing attribute is described but does not constrain action—the shards "flare" and "dissolve" without altering Lira's tactics. Present in closure (feather dissolves on basin) but the return is decorative rather than causally reweighted. Two-gate (setup, payoff) with weak middle development caps eligibility around 6.0; swappability and ornamental use lower further.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"A breath between storms" recurs as phrase and metaphor but does not shape stakes or tactics on the page. Lira holds her breath, but no clock or consequence tightens from this act. The concept is thematic dressing rather than a constraint that alters options. Present in setup and payoff, absent from middle development; label-only treatment trends low.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The quill's crystallization under stress is described twice ("crystallizes when stressed," "pressure of the moment made the shards crystallize") but never constrains or enables an action with cost. The shards "sang," "flared," and "dissolved" without altering Lira's choices. Label-only trait; no visible tradeoff. Present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Shed" appears in the opening goal ("to shed the weight of those unfinished symbols") and at closure ("shed its weight"). The feather "shed" is a late-arriving enactment of the earlier wish. The action is swappable with "release" or "let go" with minimal structural impact. Present in setup and payoff, but no middle beat where shedding creates a turn or cost. Two-gate, replaceable; mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Revisiting youthful superstitions" is signaled early ("burning a feather under a full moon," "old rhyme," "grandmother's chant") and returns at closure ("Remembering the youthful superstition, she whispered a final line"). The method is named and its mechanics (chant, feather, rhyme) are shown. However, it does not shape middle attempts or create friction—Lira executes it once without complication. Two-gate (setup, payoff), functional but not pressured.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>The floating platform is vividly rendered and frames the entire sequence, but it does not pressure choices or supply resources that affect outcome. The ritual could occur identically on solid ground. The platform's descent at closure is a spatial move, not a tactical consequence. Postcard description dominates; no constraint that alters Lira's moves. Present across beats but ornamental to stakes.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"During a held breath" appears as a phrase ("She held that breath during a held breath," "holding the breath between storms," "still holding the breath between storms," "released the held breath") but no ticking clock tightens decisions. The breath is held and released without time pressure or cost. Vague, untracked time; no live clock that alters tactics. Label-only timeframe.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"To transform scars into stories" is stated early and governs the sequence. The motivation is told and reinforced ("Each scar…a rune she had failed to decipher," "to release them," "transform scars into stories that could heal"), but no friction arises between desire and cost—Lira wants transformation, performs ritual, achieves it. No conflicted choice. Functional stake, but told-only with no dramatized obstacle. Two-gate (setup, payoff), lacks middle friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Saturated hush" is named twice identically and the tone (quiet, lyric, suspended) is consistent across the piece. Sensory descriptions (jasmine, mist, soft chime) support the mood. However, tone does not modulate with pressure—no escalation or cadence shift as Lira nears closure. Static mood dominates; the final image ("smiled softly brightly") weakens rather than charges tone. Present and coherent but does not tighten at closure.</comment>
