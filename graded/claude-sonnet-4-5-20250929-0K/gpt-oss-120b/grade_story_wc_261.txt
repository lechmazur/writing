<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The "closure seeker" motivation is stated but not dramatized through contradictory impulses or genuine struggle—the protagonist moves through beats without interior friction or visible cost to choices. Interiority leans heavily on elevated, abstract phrasing ("my mind, still fogged, clung to the lingering taste of chlorinated air") that reads more like atmospheric narration than character-particular thought. The moss interaction and hourglass ritual proceed without on-page resistance or trade-offs that would reveal hierarchy of values. The final "closure I had sought for years" is declared rather than earned through prior causality that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the opening but the causal chain is weak: the protagonist descends, the moss speaks, a root "asks" via the coffee rings, the protagonist aligns the hourglass, and the miracle "unfolds" without motivated linkage or visible cost at each turn. The closure image (frosted surface clears, light pours in, melody hums) offers atmospheric resonance but no legible Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost, or Conceptual Repricing—what option was foreclosed or what price paid remains unclear on the page. The moss-root-hourglass sequence reads as a ritual checklist rather than because/therefore escalation. Drive lens appears Accumulative/Textural but the final cadence does not reweight prior material with undeniable pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The tower, tunnel, moss, and hourglass are vividly rendered with purposeful sensory selection (damp moss scent, stone breathing, frosted glass). The hourglass placement on the root and alignment with coffee rings shows the environment constraining a ritual choice, meeting the micro-setting criterion. However, spatial choreography between tower attic and subterranean tunnel lacks clarity—"back in the tower's attic" implies prior departure not shown, and the final balcony appearance adds a third location without warning. Sensory details are consistent and filtered through the POV's scar-reading lens, though the "meteor hush" recurring phrase borders on ornamental.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake (learning to read scar stories) is signaled early but never tested by on-page opposition or trade-off—the moss cooperates, the ritual succeeds, and closure arrives without a choice that narrows options or imposes visible cost. No reversal or tightening occurs; the sequence is additive (descend, listen, align, succeed) rather than escalating. The "displaced miracle" revelation and hourglass clearing feel convenient rather than earned by protagonist agency. Under any lens, pressure remains static and the resolution lacks the felt or conceptual cost required at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The scar-as-narrative motif and displaced miracle concept create thematic coherence around wounds holding hope, but the final understanding is stated rather than earned through concrete particulars that reweight prior beats. The coffee-ring-to-scar mapping offers a specific image, yet the link to the child's regenerated arm feels imported rather than arising from the protagonist's own tension. The closing line "time itself was a wound we could read" tips into overt philosophizing that replaces dramatized resonance. Subtext operates in the moss and root exchanges but the ending sacrifices ambiguity for a tidy moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Narration is first-person singular with stable distance and no head-hopping. Diction is consistent but frequently elevated and abstract ("meteor hush," "stalwart root," "molten glass"), creating a homogenous lyric register that does not modulate under pressure—descending into the tunnel carries the same cadence as receiving revelation. The moss dialogue ("You seek the scar stories, too") and root's "question in images" are told rather than shown in distinct perceptual textures. Perceptual signature is present (scar-reader lens) but the prose does not reflect urgency or degradation at peak moments. Filter-free direct perception appears sporadically but is often buried under elevated phrasing.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Heavy reliance on stock metaphor strings ("meteor hush," "soft snow," "molten glass") and elevated diction that repeats across beats without variation or payoff (e.g., "meteor" appears in lines 2, 11, 17, 24 without evolving function). Paraphrase loops are evident: "the tunnel seemed to breathe" / "the tunnel walls glowed faintly" restate atmospheric presence without adding pressure. Template-stem runs appear in the ritual sequence ("I descended," "I paused," "I examined," "I realized," "I returned," "I placed"). Sentence openings cluster on subject-verb without rhythmic variation. The closure paragraph stacks comma-spliced clauses that blur momentum rather than propel. Apply −1.2 for patterned artifacts (stock metaphor strings, template cadence) and disallow 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The scar-reading premise and telepathic-plant attribute offer fresh specifics, yet the execution leans on familiar quest-ritual structure (descent, guide, puzzle, revelation) without transformation. The coffee-ring divination is a concrete, unusual detail but arrives late and functions as a solve-key rather than a choice-driver. The "displaced miracle" concept remains abstract and is not grounded in verifiable world logic or character-specific discovery. Emotional arc (seeking closure → finding harmony) follows a predictable template without risk or counter-pressure. The piece commits to its lyric voice but does not subvert or deepen its components beyond surface synthesis.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The "closure seeker" trait is present throughout (opening motivation, examining coffee rings, seeking scar stories, final closure found) but drives no on-page decision with visible cost—the protagonist observes, aligns, and receives rather than choosing under pressure. Functional but replaceable; a generic seeker role would work with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The frosted hourglass appears early (paragraph 5), returns in the ritual (paragraph 18–19), and clears at closure (paragraph 22). It enables the alignment ritual and charges the final sunrise image, meeting setup-development-payoff gates. However, its mechanics (sand fall aligned with coffee rings) are told rather than shown constraining a choice with cost, and the clearing feels automatic rather than earned. Two-beat involvement with closure linkage but mid-range causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The "displaced miracle" concept is named (paragraphs 15–16) and explained (child's regenerated arm) but never dramatically enacted or used to narrow protagonist options on the page. It functions as thematic backdrop rather than a stake that shapes tactics. Present and explained but ornamental to the plot's pressure system.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Telepathy with plants is introduced early (paragraph 9), enables two distinct beats (moss whisper, root "asks"), and provides information that directs the ritual. The trait constrains method (must interpret plant communication) but imposes no visible cost or trade-off—the link works frictionlessly. Setup and development gates met; closure participation is indirect (moss nods approval). Functional with some causal role but no felt price.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The tunnel descent (paragraph 7) is the spatial hinge that triggers the moss encounter, locates the root interaction, and houses the ritual climax (paragraph 19–21). Major turns trace to this location and removing it would collapse the structure. The tunnel "breathing" and glowing walls evolve with the ritual, giving the space causal weight. Present across beats with strong structural necessity.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Examining coffee rings is mentioned (paragraph 12–13) as the method the root instructs, but the actual examination is summary ("noting how each cratered edge mirrored") and the mechanics do not constrain a choice—alignment happens in one sentence without shown process or cost. Setup and brief development but no closure participation beyond mention. Swappable with another divination device.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The "quiet tower at dawn" frames the opening (paragraph 1), houses the coffee mug (paragraph 12), and provides the final balcony sunrise (paragraph 24). Dawn light charges the closure image ("light poured in like molten glass"). The tower supplies spatial structure and the narrow window constrains the reveal, meeting setup and payoff gates. Causal role is moderate—removal would require only minor setting adjustments.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"After the anesthesia wears off" is stated in the opening line but never referenced again or used to shape choices, perception, or stakes. No ticking clock or recovery constraint appears. Ornamental mention without beat involvement or closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The motivation "to learn to read the stories in scars" is declared early (paragraph 3) and recurs at closure ("stories in my scars resolve into a single melody"). It directs the protagonist's actions (examining rings, accepting the ritual) but is never dramatized as conflicted desire with on-page cost—want proceeds smoothly to satisfaction. Setup and thematic payoff present but no friction between wants and prices.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Meteor hush" appears in paragraphs 1, 11, 17, and 24, establishing a recurring tonal marker. Tone remains uniformly lyric and contemplative without modulation under pressure—ritual climax carries the same hushed cadence as opening reflection. The phrase charges the final image but functions as static mood rather than dynamic pressure that shifts with stakes. Present across beats with purposeful recurrence but lacks tonal escalation.</comment>
