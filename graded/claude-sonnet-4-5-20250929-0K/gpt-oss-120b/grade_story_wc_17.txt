<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lira's motivation to map wall dreams is clear but remains abstract; her interiority relies heavily on poetic metaphor ("echo cartographer," "legacy's burden") without grounding in contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. The film-negative moment offers sensory specificity, yet her sensory perceptions and decisions feel interchangeable with any sensitive archivist. The final acceptance of the "legacy's burden" as "shared communion" reads as an epiphany asserted rather than earned through visible cost or internal conflict.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph. The piece accumulates density through recurring imagery (ivy, film negative, walls' dreams) and the closure reconfigures Lira's solitary burden into collective imagination—a valid Resonant Reconfiguration. However, the cost is largely told ("felt the legacy's burden lift") rather than shown through forfeited options or dramatized renunciation. The two-shard structure (initial discovery; months-later continuation) remains within one contiguous thematic window, but the second shard's time jump adds material without tightening prior pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The ivy-veiled passage, stone hearth, and film negative supply tactile anchors early and recur with purpose. Sensory selection—firelight on emulsion, cold stone, low hum—filters through Lira's role and charges the ending image of "stone whisper." The film negative functions as micro-setting, constraining her method and enabling the dream hum at closure. Scale and detail remain proportionate; no orientation debt applied.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: discovering and honoring the walls' dreams. One meaningful deepening occurs when the walls "exhale a low hum," signaling resonance. Yet the escalation is largely textural; no reversal or trade-off narrows Lira's options. The final "shared communion" resolves the stake without visible cost—scholars arrive, tokens accumulate, burden lifts—undercutting the pressure. Agency is present but never foreclosed; no price paid on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme—memory as living, shared architecture—emerges from the film-negative method and the wall-dream conceit. The ending's "collective imagination that lives in every stone whisper" shifts from solitary archive to communal ritual, a valid thematic deepening. However, the final paragraph edges toward explicit statement ("the true map was not of corridors, but...") where a charged image would have resonated more. Subtext operates in the film-as-lantern motif but doesn't fully escape the prompt's allegorical frame.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Single-POV distance is stable; perceptual signature (sound-as-vision, echo-as-syllable) remains consistent and voice-specific. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("year-after-year," "living tapestry," "symphony of stone") that reads more narrator than character, especially under peak moments. No head-hopping; filter verbs ("she sensed," "she understood") cluster but remain voice-motivated. Purposeful compression in the opening and closing sustains lyric coherence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and sensory anchors are vivid. Template cadence appears in mid-section beats: "She discovered that… Each new dream added… Word spread, and scholars began…" creates a summary-chain that flattens propulsion. Paraphrase loops: "walls dream" / "walls… carry stories" / "walls, like people" recycle core metaphor without added pressure. The closure beat remains clear, so line-debt is capped at −0.6. No major scaffold or filter-verb stacks in peak moments.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The echo-cartographer premise and film-negative method offer specific detail, yet the core—archiving collective memory in architecture—closely follows familiar "walls remember" templates without transformation through unexpected cost or moral calculus. The "shared communion" resolution is tidy and affirming, avoiding risk. Lira's journey from solitary burden to communal ritual feels inevitable from the outset, reducing hind-sight surprise. Derivative Premise Guardrail applies: −0.8 within Q8.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Present early and defines the role. Lira's choices (lighting fire, tracing film lines, pressing negative to stone) are observational and methodical rather than turn-creating. The final choice to "add the final stroke" and accept the burden is told, not dramatized with alternatives. Functional but swappable with "archivist" or "memory keeper."</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Film negative strip: introduced in first third, handled in firelight beat (visual translation to soundmap), pressed to stone (hum payoff), and returns as lantern in second shard. Three distinct beats with causal linkage (enables translation, triggers hum, guides future walks). Closure participation is indirect—scholars leave tokens, not film. Strong mid-band integration but not indispensable to final image.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Legacy's burden frames Lira's motivation early and recurs in three beats: initial task, mid-scene realization ("not a weight to bear alone"), and ending transformation ("burden lift"). The concept shapes her stance but does not narrow options or impose a visible cost—she completes the map and the burden becomes lighter. Lyric reprise with thematic reweighting but minimal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Sensitively perceptive: labeled in opening ("sensitively perceptive archivist") and shown once when "her sensitively perceptive ears… translate visual darkness into audible resonance." No other on-page tradeoff or constraint (e.g., vulnerability to noise, exclusion of less perceptive peers). Descriptor rather than trait that alters tactics. Swappable with "intuitive."</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Glimpse occurs in first third (film negative bearing "faint outlines") and triggers the soundmap tracing. Does not create a turn; the discovery unfolds smoothly without complication or reversal. Middle development is present but minimal—she sees, she traces. Functional setup but not irreplaceable; "study" or "examine" could substitute with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Half-burned diaries: introduced early, reveal the mapping technique and original cartographers' beliefs. Two beats: uncovering at hearth and reading the belief that walls dream of people. The method matters to setup but does not constrain later attempts or shape the ending—scholars leave tokens, not diaries. Mid-band; present and purposeful but replaceable with "ancient texts" or "old journals."</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Ivy-veiled passage: present in opening, anchors all action, and recurs in ending ("ivy-veiled passage"). The corridor's acoustics enable echo mapping and the stone surface accepts the film press. Three beats with spatial function; the setting enables the method and provides the closure hum. Essential to logic but not uniquely charged—another resonant space could substitute with minor rewrites.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>After the climate shifts: mentioned in opening sentence ("perpetual mist and relentless rain") and once in mid-scene ("before the climate shifts settled the world into quiet"). No causal pressure on Lira's timeline or tactics; the shift is atmospheric backdrop. Ornamental; could be removed without breaking story logic.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>To discover what walls dream about: stated in first paragraph ("single, haunting motivation") and echoed in diaries, wall hum, and ending realization. Drives the setup and frames the ending's thematic answer. However, the desire is never conflicted—Lira pursues it smoothly without trade-off or competing want. One-dimensional motivation; present and functional but lacks friction.</comment>
