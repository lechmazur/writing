<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The canyon echo singer remains label-only throughout; her "richly perceptive" trait is asserted rather than shown through micro-choices under pressure. Her motivation to learn why people echo is declared but never tested by competing desires or genuine obstacle—she simply walks, sings, places the shell, and receives answers without internal conflict or visible cost. The final "promise to carry this knowledge outward" reads as an add-on rather than a choice that forecloses another path. Interiority consists of stock phrasing ("quiet ache," "peace as gentle as a reed's sigh") without embodied contradiction or character-particular perception.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation is absent: by line 120 the reader has starlight, canyon, and "serpentine nexus" but no concrete spatial anchor or character name—apply −0.4 per the Orientation Test. The narrative unfolds as a walking catalog of revelations granted without causal linkage: the cavern "responded by projecting a lattice" and "the hymn swelled, carrying the answers she sought" with no protagonist agency driving the discoveries. Closure is delivered by coincidence (finding the whole shell waiting) rather than earned through prior choices, and the final image lacks visible cost—she emerges with a now-whole shell and walks toward the horizon with no path foreclosed or price paid.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The serpentine nexus, cavern, and stone altar supply vivid backdrop but function as postcard landmarks rather than constraints on choice—the protagonist moves freely without spatial friction. The whispering seashell half does constrain the final beat (pressing it to the whole shell triggers the hymn), lifting the score above pure ornament. Sensory detail is heavily visual and atmospheric ("petrichor," "quartz light") but rarely filtered through the protagonist's professional or personal priorities; the world feels like a museum tour rather than a lived-in pressure chamber.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—learning why people echo—is signaled early but never meaningfully tightened or tested. The protagonist encounters no reversal, trade-off, or escalating cost: each step yields a new revelation without resistance, and the cavern grants the answer outright when she places the shell. Agency is absent at closure; luck and setting machinery solve the question she did not help create. The final "promise to carry this knowledge outward" involves no visible sacrifice or foreclosed alternative, rendering the resolution inert under any lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges clearly—echoes as untold stories, voices yearning to be remembered—but arrives via direct statement in the climax ("people echo when their stories remain untold") rather than through dramatized particulars. The whispering seashell and canyon echoes recur, yet their reweighting at closure is mechanical rather than resonant, as the protagonist simply receives the answer without internal friction or conceptual cost. The final image (whole shell humming, promise that every voice will be heard) offers tidy comfort rather than the ambiguity or complexity the rubric rewards.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Voice is consistent but generic, relying on stock lyric formulas: "quiet ache," "gentle as a reed's sigh," "tender, reed-blown melancholy" recur without character-specific texture. The narrator has stable access (single POV, no head-hopping) but perceptual signature is absent—the protagonist's "richly perceptive" trait does not shape what she notices or omits. Diction drifts into elevated register ("petrichor," "lattice of luminous threads") that feels writerly rather than grounded in the focalizer's idiom. No dialogue appears; interiority is told in abstract emotional labels rather than embodied perception under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade: "wistful sigh" / "melancholy," "echo" / "reverberations" / "lingering," "webs of intrigue" mentioned three times without functional variation. Template cadence dominates mid-story with identical "She [verb]" stems across adjacent sentences. Stock metaphors abound—"lone reed," "threads drawing her," "dormant fireflies"—without fresh synthesis, and figurative density in the cavern sequence (lattice, threads, void, hymn) blurs rather than sharpens the image. The final paragraph stacks summary statements ("promised," "descended," "emerged," "walked") that rehearse rather than advance closure, violating the paragraph-cut test. Apply −1.2 for spread artifacts and cap at mid-4s.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The core premise—canyon singer seeks why echoes linger—follows a well-worn template: mystical quest, mentor-like cave, artifact that completes itself and grants wisdom. The shell-joining-to-whole and lattice-of-lives images are familiar fantasy furniture without transformation. No moment surprises in hindsight; the protagonist's walk from question to gift-answer is linear and predictable. The "webs of intrigue" and "universe hums its secret song" labels gesture at complexity but remain ornamental. No risk-taking or unconventional angle elevates the material above median genre execution.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Present throughout but passive: she drifts, listens, sings back what the canyon reveals, and places the shell when the cavern prompts her. No on-page decision alters tactics or forecloses a path; the canyon and cavern machinery drive all turns.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The whispering seashell half appears early, hums guidance mid-story, glows in the cavern, and is pressed to the whole shell at closure—present in all three gates. However, its use is largely passive (it "urged," "glowed," "weaved") rather than an active tool the protagonist handles with cost. The final union triggers the hymn but does not demonstrate irreplaceability; a similar magical object could substitute with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"Webs of intrigue" is mentioned three times as atmospheric metaphor ("hidden constellations that stitched the night," "tighten," "loosened") but never shapes on-page stakes or tactics. The protagonist does not navigate competing loyalties, secrets, or social pressures; the phrase remains ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Richly perceptive" is asserted in the opening but never constrains or enables a choice with visible cost. The protagonist hears "subtlest vibrations" and canyon memories, yet these perceptions do not force a trade-off or tactical adjustment—she simply absorbs revelations without friction.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Ensure" appears in the first paragraph (shell urges her "to ensure that every question she sang was answered") and in the late promise ("to ensure that future singers would honor the echoes"), but the action does not drive major turns. The shell grants answers; the protagonist's ensuring is more thematic echo than plot engine. Swappable with "discover" or "remember" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>"Through progressive disclosure" is signaled ("the canyon revealed layers of memory: first… then…") and the cavern projects the lattice in stages, but the method does not constrain the protagonist's attempts or impose cost. Revelations arrive on schedule without the protagonist earning access through tactical choices, rendering the method functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The serpentine nexus under starlight frames the opening and closing, and the protagonist walks its path releasing "soft chime" with each step. The setting supplies vivid backdrop and the cavern within provides the altar and lattice, yet spatial features do not pressure choices—she moves freely without friction. The nexus is present in setup and payoff but does not constrain tactics, landing in mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"While the universe hums its secret song" recurs as atmospheric phrase but does not function as a clock or deadline. No sense of urgency, ticking pressure, or time-constrained decision appears; the protagonist's journey unfolds at contemplative pace without temporal stakes.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The motivation "to learn why some people echo" is stated early, guides the journey, and receives an answer at closure—present in all three gates. However, the desire is never tested by competing wants or costs; the protagonist pursues it without friction, and the cavern grants the knowledge freely. The motivation shapes structure but not conflicted choice, placing it in mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Reed-blown melancholy" is named explicitly and echoed in "wistful sigh," "sorrow," "lament," "ancient grief" throughout, modulating slightly as revelations accumulate ("quiet ache," then "peace as gentle as a reed's sigh"). The tone is coherent and charges the final image (the shell's echo as "promise"), but the single static register and label-reliance prevent higher scoring. Present across beats and ending but not elevated by pressure or ironic counterpoint.</comment>
