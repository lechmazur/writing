<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Lira exists as an assemblage of traits rather than a person making choices under pressure. Her "motivation…to navigate…interior seas" is declared but never dramatized through conflicted decisions; she simply follows the notes without obstacle or renunciation. The ending announces "map of her soul finally complete" in therapy-speak without embodied cost, and the character never faces a choice that forecloses a path. Interior contradiction is absent; she moves smoothly through the forest without genuine struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Who, where, and when anchor adequately by ~120 words, avoiding the orientation penalty. The piece follows a single continuous thread—Lira walks, the melody guides, she touches bark, enters the stillpoint—but no causal because/therefore linkage tightens options; each beat unfolds by authorial decree. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration via "map of her soul finally complete," yet the stillpoint is told rather than shown with felt cost: we are informed "a nexus where all absorbed languages converged" without on-page pressure or sacrifice. The lens reads accumulative/textural (dense imagery, musical motifs), but the final moment lacks a cadence shift or visible price that reweights the dominant stake.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The ultrasonic forest is vivid and distinct: "trees emitted constant hums…carving invisible pathways" anchors sensory detail early and consistently. The platinum ring and "knot of ancient bark" provide concrete touchstones. However, setting remains largely atmospheric; the forest does not constrain Lira's choice or supply a resource that alters outcome—she follows the notes without navigating obstacles or making tradeoffs based on environment. Spatial choreography is stable, and the "quiet blaze of lingering light" paints mood, but the micro-setting does not pressure the ending.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"navigate uncharted emotional depths"—is declared early but never tested on the page. Lira encounters no reversal, no competing pull, no cost that narrows options; the forest "responded with a trail of musical notes" and she follows without error or sacrifice. The stillpoint arrival feels granted rather than earned, and the ending announces convergence ("all absorbed languages converged into one harmonious chord") without showing a price paid or path foreclosed. Agency is absent; coincidence (the melody, the ring's glow) delivers resolution.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The theme—interior mapping via empathy and feeling—emerges from the premise and recurs in imagery (skin absorbing languages, platinum compass, musical trail). Yet the final paragraph collapses into overt thesis: "navigating uncharted emotional depths required more than sight; it demanded a map drawn in feeling…" is direct statement rather than dramatized insight. The stillpoint's "pulse of emotion…love, loss, and hope" reads as abstract claim without specific event to earn it. The quiet ending would qualify if the image were particular, but "map of her soul finally complete" is generic resolution without friction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. The prose carries a consistent lyric register—elevated diction, long periodic sentences—that suits the premise. However, the voice lacks perceptual signature: Lira's blindness does not meaningfully shape what is noticed or how; the narration offers visual imagery ("silver," "glowed brighter," "quiet blaze") without reflecting her sensory constraints. Sentence stems vary adequately, but the rhythm stays uniform across beats, missing modulation under pressure. No dialogue appears.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Clarity is maintained; no pronouns drift and sequencing is legible. However, density is low: many sentences restate the premise in new metaphors without advancing pressure—"absorbed languages like a sponge," then "layering itself beneath her nerves as if ink on parchment" is paraphrase churn. The piece stacks modifiers ("quiet blaze of lingering light," "locus where time folded upon itself") and template cadence runs appear: "She placed her hand…feeling…and…glowing…aligning…" in the climax beat. Filter verbs ("she could dowse," "she understood") dull immediacy. Figurative language is dense but often generic ("river of sound," "veil of sound," "harmonious chord"). These artifacts touch the closure paragraph, triggering the disallow-9+ rule and applying −0.8 in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The blind mapmaker navigating interior realms via synesthetic abilities is a fresh synthesis on the surface, but the execution relies on stock metaphor ("interior seas," "map of her soul") and a template plot: hero follows mystical guide to transformative destination without cost. The stillpoint, platinum ring, and language-absorbing skin are intriguing elements, yet they function as ornament rather than irreplaceability—swap "languages" for "emotions" or "memories" and the arc is unchanged. The ending's "gentle fire…map…finally complete" is tidy closure without risk or counter-reading. No bold structural choice or specific lived detail transforms the template.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Present throughout and foregrounded, but Lira makes no decision that alters tactics or cost. She follows the melody; no choice-point or renunciation appears. Observation without agency.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The ring appears early ("glowed faintly," "forged from meteor iron"), recurs in the climax ("glowed brighter, aligning"), and helps locate the stillpoint. It touches setup, middle, and payoff. However, its use is passive—it glows on cue without Lira adjusting tactics or paying a cost tied to the ring. Swappable with any magical compass.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The stillpoint is named early and becomes the destination. It constrains Lira's goal but not her method; she arrives because the melody leads her there. The concept defines the endpoint but does not shape on-page choices or tactics with cost. Present and goal-defining, but not causal.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Mentioned twice: "skin that absorbs languages like a sponge" and "the many tongues she carried in her skin dissolve." No on-page beat shows the trait constraining or enabling an action with cost; it remains decorative backstory. Label-only.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Dowsing appears in two beats: "dowse the subtle magnetic whispers" and "dowse…emotional currents." It enables Lira to follow the ring and notes, but the mechanics are vague and the action is easily replaceable with "sense" or "follow." Functional but not irreplaceable; no visible cost tied to dowsing.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The musical trail is seeded early ("trail of musical notes"), guides the middle journey, and crescendos at the bark-touch. It touches all three gates and drives progression. However, Lira never misreads or struggles with the melody; it simply leads her without error. The method matters structurally but lacks friction or cost.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The ultrasonic forest is introduced early, provides sensory texture throughout ("trees emitted constant hums," "rustling leaves"), and the "knot of ancient bark" anchors the climax. Setting participation is clear across beats. Yet the forest does not constrain choice—Lira walks without obstacle, the environment responds cooperatively. It frames the journey but does not pressure tactics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Named in the opening: "across the pause of shifting constellations…stars slipped slowly." Returns at the end: "constellations resumed their slow dance." Lyric reprise reweights the frame slightly, but time does not tighten decisions or alter Lira's path. The timeframe is poetic backdrop, not a pressure mechanism.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>Declared early ("navigate…interior seas…no map had ever recorded") and restated at closure ("navigating uncharted emotional depths required…"). The motivation frames the quest but is never dramatized in a choice with competing cost. Told and thematic, not tested on the page.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Quiet blaze" appears twice: "quiet blaze of lingering light" (opening) and "quiet blaze of revelation" (ending). The phrase charges both setup and closure, creating a lyric bracket. Tone remains elevated and mystical throughout, coherent but static—no modulation with pressure. The reprise reweights the opener slightly, lifting the score into mid-band, but the tone does not intensify or shift to heighten the ending.</comment>
