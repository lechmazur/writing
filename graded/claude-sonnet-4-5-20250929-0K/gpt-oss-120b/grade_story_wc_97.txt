<question>1</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The protagonist is label-only: "wistful," "strategically creative," "steely longing" are asserted without embodied emotion or contradictory impulses acting in scene. No micro-choices under pressure; he moves through metaphorical space without genuine friction or visible cost. The "unplanned encore" motivation is declared but never tested by a concrete on-page dilemma. Interior life is generic poetic summary rather than character-particular perception.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Orientation Test fails: who/where/when remain metaphorical past 120 words with no anchoring details (−0.5). No legible causality—pianist floats through surreal tableaux without because/therefore linkage. The "encore" and fate-surprise are asserted outcomes, not dramatized closure with visible cost. Drive lens cannot be inferred; the piece toggles between lyric accumulation and vague causal gestures without teaching a pattern or landing a Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with felt cost on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Vivid metaphorical images (tidal arbor, cloud staircase, silver film doorway) but all are abstract set-dressing without spatial grounding or constraint on choice. No clarity on whether the pianist is physically above clouds or in reverie. The broken clock and piano are mentioned repeatedly but never constrain a tactic or alter the final image with concrete pressure. Sensory detail is visual-only and generic (gleaming, shimmering, frost).</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("surprise fate with an unplanned encore") is declared but never tested. No on-page reversal, tightening, or choice that narrows options; the pianist ascends unopposed and plays without obstacle. Coincidence (horizon accepts night, compasses align) drives the resolution. No visible cost or trade-off at closure—"fate, caught off guard" is assertion, not dramatized consequence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Theme of defying time/fate is stated rather than emergent from concrete conflict. The broken clock and encore are symbolic gestures without earned wisdom or non-literal answer. Final image ("time itself had been serenaded") is a neat metaphor but lacks thematic friction or ambiguity. Subtext is absent; every image announces its own meaning (flickering compasses = guidance, arbor = refuge).</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Elevated, poeticized register is consistent but uniform across all beats—no modulation under pressure. Perceptual signature is generic lyric ("taste of steel and longing") rather than character-specific. No dialogue. Filter verbs ("feeling its weight like a heart") and abstract summaries ("reshaping the tide") pad the text. Psychic distance is stable but lacks immediacy or embodied interiority.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervasive: "silence/silent" repeated five times, "steely longing" three times, "flickering compasses" three times without evolving meaning. Template cadence in final third: "He [verb]" six consecutive times. Mixed metaphors: "taste of steel and longing," "tide-woven branches," "horizon invites night" lack physical coherence. Stock poetic diction ("silver rain," "velvet shadows") replaces concrete action. Information density very low; many sentences restate mood without advancing situation (−1.2 cumulative in Q7).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Premise (musician defies fate through metaphorical performance) is familiar without fresh angle. All tropes—broken clock, secret plan, surprising destiny—are executed at surface level without transformation. Specificity is absent: "station pianist" has no lived-in detail, "anniversary clock" is generic symbol, "unplanned encore" is abstract. Transformation test fails; swap any proper noun and the arc is unchanged.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Pianist present throughout but makes no key choices; he floats and performs without on-page decision that alters tactics. "Wistful" is label-only; agency is narrated summary ("he had learned to splice") not dramatized under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Clock appears in three beats (platform, floating beside him, final tick). Setup early, reprise at end, but static—its broken state never constrains a choice or evolves. Final tick is micro-turn, not causal. Swappable with any symbolic timepiece.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Compasses appear early, recur at climax ("aligned, pointing outward"), and again at ending ("dimmed, surrendering"). Pattern is taught but their guidance never narrows an on-page option; they are passive markers, not active constraints.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"Strategically creative" is asserted once ("he had learned to splice those reels") without on-page demonstration, cost, or tactical consequence. Label-only trait with no visible tradeoff or enabling action under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Refuge" mentioned twice (arbor as refuge, silent auditorium as refuge) but the action itself—seeking/finding refuge—never creates a turn or cost. He arrives without obstacle, leaves without sacrifice. Swappable with "escape" or "sanctuary."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Hidden film-reel sections appear early (compasses point to them), he splices them mid-story, and steps through a silver doorway at climax. Three-beat involvement, but mechanics are vague and the method does not constrain tactics—he accesses sections whenever plot requires. Late resolution use lowers score.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Tidal arbor seeds early, returns as hovering archway at climax, and dissolves at resolution. Three beats with clear reprise that reweights closure image. Does not constrain choice but charges the final movement with recurring symbol; lyric resonance lifts score into mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Timeframe stated early ("hold his ascent until the horizon invites night") and paid off at ending ("horizon finally accepted night"). Two-gate involvement (setup, closure) but the wait is passive—no ticking clock that forces a tactical choice or risk. Time is atmospheric, not a live constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Motivation declared mid-story ("to surprise fate with an unplanned encore") and echoed at climax, but never dramatized through conflicting wants or visible cost. Told-only desire without friction; achieving it meets no resistance or trade-off on the page.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Steely longing" appears three times across the text, anchoring tone consistently. Coherent mood but static—no modulation under pressure. Final image carries the tone forward but does not deepen or transform it. Functional atmospheric layer without charge or cost.</comment>
