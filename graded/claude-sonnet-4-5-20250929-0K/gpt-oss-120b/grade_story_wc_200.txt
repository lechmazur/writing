<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to pursue spectral confessions is declared but never tested by internal conflict; the "modestly fearless" label remains ornamental. Her decision to tell the joke feels arbitrary rather than emerging from established character traits under pressure. The transformation from pursuing grief to offering laughter lacks visible cost or foreclosed options. Interiority relies on abstract phrasing ("luminous ache") rather than embodied contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed—who Mara is and what "lost soul collector" means arrives obliquely, and the gorge's geography remains vague throughout. The Drive Lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (pattern of grief → laughter), but the closure lacks visible cost: spirits transform off-stage, and Mara simply "understood her purpose" without forfeiting a path or altering her stance with felt consequence. The ending recounts aftermath ("travelers reported") rather than landing a decisive image on the page. No meaningful tightening or deepening narrows options mid-story.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The gorge supplies atmospheric detail (slick stones, water echoing laughter) and the crocodile's tooth charges the ending, meeting micro-setting criteria. Spatial choreography is loose—Mara's movement through the gorge lacks concrete anchors, and the harp's location floats. Sensory detail leans visual and auditory; tactile and olfactory senses are absent during high-pressure beats. The tooth's glow at closure elevates the score slightly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—healing spectral confessions—is signaled early but never tightened by a reversal or complication. Mara encounters no resistance; the joke succeeds immediately without risk or trade-off. The transformation of spirits happens passively ("emerged a wave of luminous laughter") rather than through protagonist agency under pressure. One micro-turn (tooth hums → joke → laughter) provides modest escalation, but no visible cost alters later tactics or forecloses an option.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Theme of grief-to-laughter emerges from events rather than assertion, and the crocodile's tooth as healing artifact carries modest symbolic weight. However, the final image ("glowing tooth...beacon") states the theme overtly rather than trusting particulars. The joke about a goat conducting a choir feels whimsical but disconnected from prior material, reducing thematic resonance. "Luminous ache" recurs but remains abstract, not anchored in specific experience.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is weak—Mara's way of noticing feels generic ("pale gold of dawn," "translucent sighs"). Diction drifts into elevated register ("luminous ache," "symphony of light") that clashes with scene urgency. Filter verbs cluster in peak beats ("She understood," "She recalled"), dulling immediacy. No dialogue is present; voice lacks distinct rhythm or character-specific idiom.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "spectral confessions" recurs six times with minimal variation; "luminous ache" appears thrice in identical phrasing. Template cadence dominates ("She [verb]" stems in seven consecutive sentences mid-story). Mixed metaphors muddle clarity: "chorus of unseen voices" conflicts with "translucent sighs," and "sunrise glass" lacks coherent vehicle. Stock phrases ("modestly fearless," "bright pulse") replace concrete imagery. Information density is low—many sentences restate prior content without advancing pressure. Artifacts touch the closure beat ("luminous ache" in final third), triggering the −1.7 penalty and disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The premise—soul collector uses laughter to heal grief—follows a familiar redemption template without transformation. The crocodile's tooth and misaligned harp offer specific anchors but remain underused in causal work. The joke itself (goat conducting a choir) feels arbitrary, not particular to Mara's voice or the gorge's history. Emotional truth is present but generic; the arc could function unchanged with different names and setting. No bold structural or perspectival risk heightens stakes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Mara is present throughout and her role as collector frames the stakes, but she makes no consequential choice that alters tactics or forecloses a path. Her decision to tell the joke is reactive rather than driven by internal conflict. Setup is clear; middle development is passive observation; closure participation is descriptive ("understood her purpose") rather than active.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The crocodile's tooth appears in three beats: Mara cradles it (setup), presses it to the wall to coax spirits (middle), and places it glowing on the altar (closure). It enables the middle turn and charges the final image with reweighted meaning. However, its mechanics remain vague—why it resonates with grief is asserted, not demonstrated through cost or constraint. Swappable with another relic without major structural edits.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Spectral confessions are the dominant stake and shape Mara's pursuit throughout. They arrive as "translucent sighs" and transform into "stories of redemption," but the transformation happens off-stage without dramatized resistance or cost. The concept frames expectations early and returns at closure, but does not constrain mid-story choices—Mara encounters no failed attempt or complication. Functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Modestly fearless" is declared twice but never constrains or enables an on-page action with cost. Mara faces no moment where fear would alter her tactics or where modesty forecloses a bolder option. The trait remains a label without visible tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Pursue" is signaled early and drives Mara's movement through the gorge. She follows the harp's notes deeper, and the pursuit structures the first two-thirds. However, the pursuit does not create a major turn—Mara never loses the trail or confronts a dead end. The action shapes one key choice (to follow the sound) but does not redefine options at closure. Could be replaced with "listen" or "follow" without major edits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The misaligned harp's distorted notes are signaled early and guide Mara's steps, appearing in setup and middle beats. However, the mechanics remain abstract—how the discord enables her pursuit is asserted, not shown through trial or adjustment. The harp's "last crooked chord" returns at closure but does not causally shape the ending action. Functional presence across beats, but swappable with another sonic guide.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Echo Gorge is named early and supplies atmospheric pressure (shadows, water, slick stones). The gorge "exhales" voices and the stone wall is used to anchor the tooth, providing micro-setting that alters tactics. The gorge's echoing laughter returns in the final image, charging closure. However, spatial choreography is loose—Mara's exact location within the gorge is never concrete. Strong closure linkage elevates the score.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Hidden sunrise" is mentioned in the opening and returns at closure ("fully rose"), creating a lyric frame. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions—no clock pressure shapes Mara's tactics, and the passage of time is untracked. The sunrise charges the final image with golden light but does not constrain mid-story choices. Present but replaceable with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"To integrate laughter into healing" is Mara's stated motivation and drives her final action (telling the joke). However, the motivation is never conflicted—she recalls the tale without hesitation or cost. No friction between want (to heal) and fear (of failure) creates tension. The motivation shapes one key beat but lacks dramatized struggle or trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Luminous ache" appears three times (middle and twice near closure), establishing a tonal thread. The phrase attempts to unify sorrow and hope but remains abstract, not grounded in concrete sensory detail or contradictory embodied emotion. Tone does not modulate with pressure—Mara's perception remains consistent rather than degrading under stress. The phrase charges the final paragraph but lacks specificity to elevate higher.</comment>
