<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The librarian is presented through descriptive labels ("harmonious choral," "empathetically decisive") rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. Her motivations are asserted—"vowed to rehabilitate," "believed"—without on-page friction or visible trade-offs. The final sequence shows her conducting and placing the weight, but no choice forecloses a path with felt cost; she walks bridges others built and confirms success without struggle. Interiority remains abstract and therapeutic ("vigorous tenderness," "surge") rather than embodied and character-particular.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation arrives late and remains vague: "old city," "astronomical clock tower," "silo network" establish genre texture but no concrete geography or timeline anchor by ~120 words. The dominant lens reads Accumulative/Textural—interspersed languages weave into bridges—but causality is opaque: the weight's chime somehow makes workers emerge and lay planks without dramatized agency or constraint. The closure image (city breathing, silos singing) offers lyric resonance but no decisive change, renunciation, or conceptual repricing with visible cost; the librarian's action succeeds without friction, and no price is legible on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The clock tower interior ("gears and constellations," "stained glass," "brass balcony") and silos are evoked through ornamental description but do not constrain choice or alter tactics. The cuckoo clock weight is retrieved and replaced, yet its mechanics (how dropping it summons workers, how bridges are built between towering silos in one night) remain unexplained. Spatial choreography is unclear: workers "emerged" from silos and "laid wooden planks between towering silos" with no physical grounding. The setting supplies atmosphere but does not pressure the librarian's actions or charge the final image with tactical cost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—healing the city by linking silos—is declared but never tested. The librarian drops the weight, languages intersperse, workers appear, bridges are built, gratitude rises; no reversal, tightening, or trade-off occurs. Coincidence does not merely complicate; it resolves: the chime's effect is instantaneous and total. No agency narrows options, no price is paid, no want conflicts with fear. The resolution is delivered rather than earned, and the accumulative texture does not deepen or shift cadence to reweight the stake.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Theme—empathy, bridges, communal healing—emerges through assertion and prompt-label language ("empathetically decisive," "bridges from silos," "beats of compassion") rather than specific events. The final paragraph states the theme directly: "a day built on empathy, decisive action, and the tender vigor of a choral librarian's song." Motifs (starlight, weight, languages) recur decoratively but do not constrain choice or charge the closure; they are mentioned rather than reweighted. The piece tells its meaning instead of trusting concrete particulars to generate resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Third-person narration maintains stable distance and some distinct texture ("harmonious choral," "citadel of gears"), but diction drifts into elevated abstraction ("empathetically decisive," "vigorous tenderness," "beats of compassion") that clashes with the librarian's presumed POV. Filter verbs and passive constructions appear frequently ("She believed," "she felt," "were etched"). No dialogue is present. Perceptual signature is generic: the librarian "hears" and "listens" without idiosyncratic bias. Purposeful compression is not taught, and the final image's lyricism does not resolve ambiguity or elision paid off earlier.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops cluster throughout: "The weight, when dropped, would release a chime" / "When the first note rang"; "interspersed languages" appears three times in near-identical phrasing; "bridges" and "silos" recur in synonym chains ("planks," "pathways," "towering silos," "empty husks"). Template cadence dominates the middle: "She [verb]…The [noun] [verb]…Workers [verb]…" Figurative density is high without pattern-teaching: "captured in amber," "tapestry of sound," "incense from the silos," "tender vigor." Register drifts into abstraction ("empathetically decisive," "vigorous tenderness") that flattens the voice. Elevated diction pervades peak beats, obscuring causality and dulling the closure image. Artifacts touch the final third, triggering cumulative penalties and disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The premise—librarian uses choral music and languages to heal a fractured city—follows a familiar unity-through-art template without transformation. The astronomical clock tower and grain elevators supply genre texture but remain ornamental; the mechanics (chime召唤, instant bridge-building) are unexplained and convenient. No specific lived detail, occupational logic, or non-obvious moral calculus distinguishes this from stock allegory. The final image ("city breathed as one") delivers the expected resolution without surprise or earned inevitability. Derivative premise penalty applies; transformation is insufficient.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>The librarian is named early and present throughout, but her choices do not create turns: she retrieves the weight, drops it, conducts, walks the bridges, and replaces the weight without friction or cost. Workers build the bridges; her role is catalytic description rather than decision under pressure. Observation and confirmation dominate; no tactic is altered by a choice she makes.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The cuckoo clock weight appears in three beats: retrieved from the alcove, dropped to release the chime, and replaced in its cradle. Its brass body "hums with the echo of centuries," and the final placement hears "the echo of every language." The weight enables the chime but its unique properties (why this weight, why "heavy," why "centuries") do not constrain or complicate; it functions as a switch. The reprise reweights slightly (languages now embedded in its echo) but does not charge the closure with cost or alter the librarian's options.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Grain elevator talks" is named twice: the silo network's "low rumble" at night and the elevators' shift to "harmonious chorus" after the chime. The concept shapes the setting and provides the metaphor (industrial structures learning to converse), but on-page mechanics are absent—how elevators "talk," what changes their sound, how this alters the librarian's tactics—and the concept is thematically echoed rather than tactically decisive. It complicates atmosphere but does not constrain choice or enable a turn.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Empathetically decisive" is declared twice as a label and once more as "empathetically decisive" in the final paragraph. No on-page action demonstrates both empathy and decisiveness constraining each other or enabling a choice with visible cost. The trait is asserted, not dramatized; it does not shape a trade-off or alter the librarian's approach under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Rehabilitate" is stated in the librarian's vow ("to rehabilitate the forgotten voices") and echoed in the outcome (workers reminded of families, bridges built). The action frames the goal but does not drive turns: the chime and languages do the work; the librarian's role is to initiate, not to struggle or adapt. Swappable with "restore" or "revive" without structural change. The concept is present and relevant but not causally indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Interspersing languages" is signaled early ("She interspersed languages—Latin verses, Mandarin lullabies, and the guttural chants of the old miners—into the chimes") and its mechanics matter: the tapestry of sound crosses cultural divides, workers are reminded of families, planks are etched with verses. The method shapes two beats (the chime and the plank-laying) and is present in the final image ("every language she had interspersed"). Its specific execution (which languages, how woven, why these) is not detailed, and no friction or cost arises from the choice to intersperse. Functional and essential to the concept but does not complicate or narrow options.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The astronomical clock tower is introduced early ("spiraling citadel of gears and constellations") and houses the librarian, supplies the cuckoo clock weight, and provides the brass balcony from which she conducts. The final chime announces the new day. The tower supplies resources (weight, vantage) but does not pressure choices or constrain tactics; it functions as a thematic anchor and staging ground. Removing it would require rehousing the weight and balcony but would not break the logic of bridges or languages.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Under the hush of borrowed starlight" appears twice (opening and near-close), framing the night. "Before dawn" and "faded into dawn" bracket the timeline, and the clock marks time "with the precision of a heart." Time is evoked lyrically but not tracked or tightened: one night somehow contains chime, emergence, plank-laying, bridge completion, and market activity with no duration cues or urgency. The timeframe supplies atmosphere but does not constrain or accelerate decisions.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The motivation "to construct bridges from silos" is stated ("she believed that the only way to heal the city's scars was to construct bridges") and shown in outcome (wooden planks, pathways). The desire frames the goal but is not dramatized through conflicted choices or friction between cost and want. The librarian enacts the plan without obstacle; workers comply, bridges appear, gratitude rises. Told more than shown; no visible trade-off complicates the pursuit.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>"Vigorous tender" (or "vigorous tenderness," "tender vigor") appears three times, labeling the librarian's gestures and feelings. Tone reads consistently lyric and elevated throughout, with no modulation under pressure; the librarian's success is untroubled, and the final image maintains the same register. The tone is coherent but static, and the oxymoronic pairing is asserted rather than enacted through contradictory actions or embodied tension. It colors the voice without charging the closure with felt cost.</comment>
