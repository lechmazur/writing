<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Mara's "involuntary truthfulness" is declared but never shown in micro-choices that embody contradiction under pressure. The final confrontation with smugglers ("You cannot hide behind relics") reads as assertion rather than a dramatized embodied dilemma. Internal conflict remains told ("my rational mind could not merely catalog truffles") without simultaneous contradictory impulses acting in scene. The renunciation of relic-trafficking lacks visible cost tied to specific personal stakes on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed: who Mara is, what the orchard's social structure entails, and why this moment matters remain vague past the 120-word mark, triggering the −0.4 penalty. The closure unit—Mara tending the glass eye as communal mirror—asserts a new social contract without on-page dramatization of acceptance, resistance, or cost from the community. The causal lens (inferred dominant) breaks when the smugglers' "greed eclipsed by sudden realization" replaces earned pressure with convenient capitulation. No before/after alteration is legible with felt price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The hanging orchard setting is vividly rendered ("roots hung on sheer cliffs," "slick bark," "hollowed trunks") and the storm recurs to test the moss seal, constraining Mara's tactic. However, spatial choreography in the clearing remains abstract—smuggler positions, distance to the log, line-of-sight for the eye's glow are not tracked. The orchard shapes one key choice (placement under moss) but does not charge the final image beyond backdrop.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—turning the eye into a communal truth-mirror—is signaled early but escalation is minimal. Mara's plan faces no genuine opposition: the smugglers' reversal ("fell silent, their greed eclipsed") is instant and unmotivated, erasing friction rather than deepening it. One tightening occurs (placing the eye, storm testing the seal), but the cost of Mara's involuntary truth-burst is abstract, and no live option is visibly foreclosed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Theme—psychological safety through shared reflection—emerges from the glass eye motif and is developed across the narrative arc. However, the final paragraph moralizes overtly: "psychological safety grows not from the absence of pain, but from the courage to reflect it together" states the thesis rather than trusting the image to resonate. The smugglers' instant conversion undercuts the complexity the premise promised. The eye as recurring object reweights meaning but the moral is spelled out, lowering resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>POV remains stable first-person with a consistent perceptual signature—"methodical calm that felt almost like prayer," "the orchard's breath"—and diction fits Mara's reflective stance. However, register drifts into elevated abstractions under pressure ("fractured grace," "covenant of empathy") that feel authorial rather than character-particular. Dialogue with smugglers is functional but carries minimal subtext or goal-driven indirection. Psychic distance is controlled; no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout ("cathedral of fruit," "certainty of a mushroom's spore," "leaf-dust like confetti") without pattern-teaching or causal payoff, cluttering peak beats. Template cadence appears: "I saw… I placed… I spoke…" across three sentences in the climax. Mixed metaphor: the eye "glittered like a frozen tear" yet later "glimmered under muted light" without coherent vehicle logic. Paraphrase loop: "truthfulness meant every claim I uttered slipped out" restates "involuntary truthfulness" without added pressure. Artifact penalties (−0.8 total) and elevated diction in crisis beats lower clarity and momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The premise—post-empathy-virus society using a relic as communal mirror—offers a fresh synthesis, but execution leans on stock therapeutic language ("psychological safety," "cultivate empathy") and the smuggler-conversion trope is familiar. The orchard setting and Mara's forager role provide specificity, yet the emotional arc (isolation → communal tending) is predictable and the turn lacks earned surprise. No bold structural risk; the final image restates rather than transforms the premise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mara's forager role is signaled early and her decision to hide the eye under a false mushroom bloom is specific to her expertise. However, the rational/truffle angle does not constrain later choices—any character could place the eye and confront smugglers. Present in setup, development (placement), and closure (tending), but causal pressure is modest and cost generic. Mid-band for functional presence across beats without irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The glass eye appears in multiple beats: introduction, placement under moss, glow witnessed by smugglers, and final tending. Its reflective property ("reflect one's innermost grief") is declared and drives Mara's plan, but the mechanics of reflection are never shown on the page—no grief is actually mirrored. Present in closure as symbol but not causally active there. Strong setup and development; closure linkage is thematic rather than plot-driving.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The smuggled relic concept frames the conflict and Mara's moral stance ("hide the eye... occlude the darker motives of those who trafficked relics"). The smugglers' presence and the museum origin establish stakes. However, the smuggling itself does not force a tactical choice under pressure—Mara's plan succeeds without friction. Present in setup and development; shapes one turn but could be replaced with any contested object. Mid-band for functional role without deeper causal necessity.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Involuntary truthfulness is declared twice but never shown constraining a choice with cost. The moment "my involuntary honesty surged like a sapling in a windstorm" leads to spoken truth, but no visible tradeoff or consequence follows—smugglers simply accept it. Label-only trait without on-page friction. Present in setup and one beat; missing closure participation and genuine cost. Low-functional band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Occlusion operates twice: Mara uses honesty "to occlude the darker motives" of smugglers and later hides the eye under moss, an "occlusion that the storm would not betray." The moss-seal tactic is specific and tested by the storm. However, the social occlusion claim is abstract and the final turn (smugglers seeing their secrets reflected) does not hinge on occlusion mechanics. Present across beats; one causal role (moss seal); lyric reprise in final image ("clear... symbol"). Mid-to-upper band for dual presence and one grounded use.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Rumored cures in discredited textbooks are mentioned once in exposition ("marginal notes that suggested the glass eye could reflect... grief") but never shape an on-page attempt or choice. The method does not appear in the climax or resolution. Ornamental setup without development or closure participation. Low band for mention without causal work.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The hanging orchard setting is richly detailed and recurs: storm batters the canopy, slick bark under Mara's boots, hollowed trunks, and the moss seal tested by rain. The orchard's physical constraints shape the hiding tactic and the storm provides a live test. Present in setup, development (storm as pressure), and closure image ("storm-kissed silence"). Essential to two beats and charges the final tone. Upper band for strong integration and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The post-empathy-virus timeframe is signaled early and establishes the world's cautious emotional climate, motivating Mara's project. However, the timeframe does not tighten tactics or create urgency—no clock runs, no viral threat resurges. Thematic presence without tactical pressure. Setup and thematic closure participation; missing middle development and live constraint. Functional but replaceable band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to cultivate psychological safety is stated explicitly and drives the plan to turn the eye into a communal mirror. The desire is told rather than shown in conflicted micro-choices, and no friction between this want and competing costs (personal risk, forager livelihood) appears on the page. Present in setup, development (placing the eye), and closure (tending as symbol). Functional across beats but lacks embodied conflict. Mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Fractured grace as tone is coherent: elegiac diction ("broken cathedral," "old sorrow," "quiet sentinel") blends with pressured imagery ("wind scattering leaf-dust like confetti"). The tone modulates with the storm's intensity and charges the final image ("fractured grace of the orchard's storm-kissed silence"). However, elevated register occasionally clashes with crisis beats, and the phrase "fractured grace" is repeated verbatim at open and close, reducing subtlety. Present across narrative arc; charges closure. Upper-mid band for coherent modulation with minor register slips.</comment>
