<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The narrator's interiority is heavily abstract and label-reliant ("confidently uncertain," "strange comfort") rather than embodied through contradictory impulses in scene. The celestial signal interpreter role remains ornamental—no choices test professional knowledge against personal cost. Emotional progression consists of declared states ("I felt," "I realized") without the messy irrationality or visible tradeoffs that pressure would force. The final paragraph's therapeutic self-congratulation ("humbled and empowered") replaces earned struggle with summary assertion.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early enough, but causality is largely decorative: the pen "emits a faint phosphorescent trail" and suddenly "the hologram rippled, the wrong seeds sprouting tiny luminescent buds" without dramatized agency or cost. The closure effect—"editing history"—is asserted rather than enacted through a choice that forecloses options. The "gravitational anomaly" functions as atmospheric set-dressing rather than a constraint that narrows tactics. No meaningful tightening or cost is legible on the page; the narrator moves from problem to solution via metaphor rather than because/therefore linkage.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The gravitational anomaly and laboratory setting are vividly named but remain postcard elements: the anomaly "pressed gently" and "swayed like a slow tide" without altering a single tactical choice. The pen's "exotic nib" receives repeated mentions yet never constrains an action—its "phosphorescent trail" is visual decoration. Spatial choreography is coherent (desk, holo-screen, window) but static; no environmental detail forces a micro-decision or charges the final image beyond metaphor.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake ("edit history … to reverse the seed planting error") is signaled early but never tested by a live constraint or competing cost. The single reversal—hologram buds glowing with corrected data—arrives via narrated magic ("I whispered to the pen") rather than protagonist choice under pressure. Escalation is asserted through intensifiers ("strange comfort," "profound," "redemption") without an on-page turn that narrows options. No visible price is paid; the anomaly "settled" conveniently, and the narrator ends empowered without forfeiting a path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The theme of editing/redemption is stated overtly ("editing history was less about control and more about listening") rather than earned through concrete particulars. The "exotic nib," "gravitational anomaly," and "confidently uncertain" recur as labeled motifs but do not accumulate pressure or reweight meaning at closure—they decorate rather than constrain. The final paragraph moralizes ("the universe rewards those who can unbend") in place of a resonant image. No thematic contradiction or ambiguity; the resolution is tidy satisfaction without cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The narrative voice is stable and maintains psychic distance, but diction drifts into elevated abstraction ("paradoxical steadiness," "tangled ribbons of light," "tapestry of intentional threads") that feels imposed rather than character-particular. No dialogue present. Filter verbs ("I felt," "I realized") cluster in reflective beats without embodied immediacy. Perceptual signature is generic—"celestial signal interpreter" does not shape what or how the narrator notices. Rhythm is consistent but lacks modulation under the stated pressure of the anomaly.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops proliferate: "edit history" / "editing history" / "edited history" across multiple paragraphs without added pressure; "gravitational anomaly" recurs eight times in static constructions. Template cadence is pervasive—"I felt … I turned … I whispered … I set … I realized"—across seven consecutive beats. Stock metaphors ("garden," "tapestry," "beacon," "slow tide") stack without coherent vehicle logic. Register drifts into corporate abstraction ("contingent relationships," "ambient gravity," "intentional threads") that clashes with the lyric frame. Figurative density in the middle third obscures causal linkage rather than sharpening it. No loops touch the closure beat directly, but their spread dulls momentum throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>The core frame—celestial signals, gravitational anomaly, editing history via a mystical pen—assembles SFF prompt elements without fresh synthesis. "Editing history" and "planting the wrong seeds" resolve through metaphor alone, swappable with any abstract error-correction plot. The "confidently uncertain" paradox and "strange comfort" tone are label-only, never dramatized as specific friction. Emotional beats follow a tidy redemption arc (error → correction → empowerment) without ambiguity or risk. Proximity to genre clichés (magical artifact, wise-narrator retrospective) without transformation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Present throughout but passive: the interpreter observes, feels, and narrates metaphors rather than making decisions that alter tactics. The role's professional expertise (signal interpretation) never constrains a choice. The final act—setting the pen down—is closure by gesture, not a choice with cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The pen appears in three beats (desk description, tracing phosphorescent trail, final set-down) but remains ornamental. Its "exotic nib" and "dry" state are mentioned repeatedly without constraining use or evolving function. The phosphorescent trail is visual decoration, not a causal tool. The ending reprise ("set the pen down") does not reweight prior material with cost.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Editing history is the stated goal and recurs as a theme-label, but the mechanics are metaphorical: "weave new connections," "unbend logic," "coax the old script." No on-page choice demonstrates how editing works or what trade-off it imposes. The corrected data appears via narrated magic, making the concept ornamental rather than stake-shaping.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>"Confidently uncertain" is declared twice as a paradox but never constrains an action or creates visible friction. The trait remains a label without embodied cost—no moment shows the narrator hesitating, second-guessing, or paying a price for simultaneous confidence and doubt.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Unbend" recurs four times (unbend logic, unbend expectations, unbend reality) but functions as metaphor rather than a discrete action with causal weight. Removing "unbend" and substituting "shift" or "reframe" would not alter plot or stakes. No turn traces specifically to unbending as a method.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Contingent relationships" appears twice as an abstract method ("weave new connections through contingent relationships") but its mechanics are unexplained and it does not shape a visible attempt. The phrase is ornamental jargon; the hologram correction proceeds independently of any dramatized contingent logic.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The gravitational anomaly is named early and recurs throughout, but it functions as atmosphere—"pulling thoughts like tides," "pressed gently," "swayed like a slow tide"—without altering a single tactical choice. It never constrains movement, resource use, or decision timing. The anomaly "settled" at the end without cost, making it a backdrop rather than a pressure element.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The timeframe "after planting the wrong seeds" is established early and frames the error-correction goal, but elapsed time is untracked and no clock tightens decisions. The error and its correction occupy an undefined span; urgency is asserted ("that morning") but not dramatized through time pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"Thresh meaning from experience" appears once near the end as a theme-label. The motivation is told rather than dramatized—no scene shows the narrator choosing between meaning-making and another competing want, or paying a cost to extract insight. The phrase is ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Strange comfort" recurs three times and marks the tone as paradoxical (comfort amid anomaly), but the mood remains static and declarative rather than modulating with pressure. The final image ("strange comfort … whispered back") restates the label without charging it with new cost or friction, making the tone consistent but inert.</comment>
