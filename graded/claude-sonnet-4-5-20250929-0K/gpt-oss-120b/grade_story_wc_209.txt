<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Mara is presented as "quietly driven" but her interiority remains abstract and label-driven throughout. The childhood memory of night flowers and the climactic tears are asserted emotional beats without embodied contradiction or micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values under pressure. The cathedral vision feels like a delivered epiphany rather than one earned through struggle; no genuine mistake or foreclosed path with visible cost emerges. Diagnostic label-speak ("restless need to reckon") and therapy-inflected self-awareness flatten what should be contradictory impulses acting in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The story opens with reasonably clear anchors (amber pavilion, Mara, postcards) but causality collapses past midpoint. The postcards "unlock the cathedral's secret" through a vision mechanism—aligning one postcard with a sunburst motif triggers concealed lenses and a phosphorescent garden—that introduces no prior constraint and arrives as convenient magic. The closure asserts understanding ("the dawning hush was not silence but a promise") without dramatizing a choice, refusal, or reweighted option; the protagonist simply gathers postcards and steps back outside, unchanged in tactics or knowledge legibility. No meaningful tightening or deepening occurs; the vision answers her question without cost, rendering the ending a thematic echo rather than a Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with felt consequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The amber pavilion, cathedral, and garden are described with vivid sensory detail (cracked panes, incense, etched glass, phosphorescent flowers) and the setting anchors early. However, the environment never constrains a choice or alters tactics; Mara moves through spaces that admire her rather than pressure her. The postcards function as keys but their mechanics are not grounded in how glass, light, or memory would physically operate, weakening plausibility. Spatial choreography remains clear, and the autumn-to-winter melt provides atmospheric continuity, lifting the score into mid-band despite the lack of setting-driven constraint at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"why do flowers bloom at night?"—is signaled early but remains abstract and never crystallizes into a choice with competing goods or unavoidable harms. The cathedral sequence presents a vision rather than a reversal that narrows options; the protagonist observes a spectacle and departs with declarative understanding, no visible price paid or path foreclosed. No escalation or deepening occurs; pressure does not tighten through protagonist agency. The ending asserts transformation ("her heart humming with a new rhythm") without demonstrating a trade-off or tactic shift on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The theme of nocturnal bloom as a "promise whispered in the dawning hush" emerges repeatedly but is stated rather than dramatized through specific, non-literal action. The postcards, glass, and flowers recur but function as ornamental motifs rather than particulars that constrain choice or charge the closure with earned cost. The final paragraph moralizes explicitly: "the dawning hush was not silence but a promise that even the coldest winter yields to a softer, brighter bloom"—a thematic echo that replaces scene pressure with assertion, triggering the explicit-moralizing penalty. The story gestures toward a question about darkness and light but resolves it through convenient epiphany rather than ambiguous, resonant reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping, and the perceptual filter shows Mara's attention to light, color, and memory. However, diction drifts into elevated, non-idiomatic register ("umbral tenderness," "the dawning hush of the season settle around her like a soft veil") that sits uneasily with a "vivid mural artist" who splashes city walls; the lexicon reads more like literary tourism than character-specific thought. Filter verbs ("felt the stone floor vibrate," "felt tears trace paths") stack without voice motivation, dulling immediacy in peak beats. Psychic distance remains consistent, but the prose does not reflect a distinct mind under pressure—it narrates around Mara rather than through her idiosyncratic noticing.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The prose features stacked modifiers, ornamental metaphors, and paraphrase loops that dull momentum. "Dawning hush," "umbral tenderness," and "amber light" recur as decorative motifs without shifting meaning; "quietly driven" and "restless need" are synonym variants of the same abstraction. Register drifts into corporate-academic phrasing ("the world's quiet pulse," "collective memory embedded in the postcards") that clashes with scene urgency. Template cadence appears in parallel constructions ("She remembered… Now, the winter's last snow… Mara's curiosity led her…") without pattern-teaching or payoff. Filter-verb stacks in the cathedral beat ("felt the stone floor vibrate," "felt tears trace paths") and stock metaphors ("glowed with a quiet fire," "bridge woven through postcards") reduce clarity and propulsion. Multiple artifacts touch the closure beat (final paragraph moralizing), disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8 per the artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The core premise—artist seeks meaning in night flowers via hidden cathedral glass—follows a familiar template (creative protagonist, liminal season, mystical epiphany through symbolic objects) without transforming it through non-obvious choices or lived specificity. The postcards-unlock-vision mechanism reads as magical convenience rather than an earned synthesis. The emotional arc (doubt → vision → understanding) is generic and could transfer unchanged to another protagonist with different props. No bold risk heightens stakes; the story opts for safe lyricism and avoids committing to a stance with conceptual cost, triggering the derivative-premise guardrail.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Mara is present throughout and her occupation as mural artist is mentioned, but she makes no on-page decisions that create key turns. She spreads postcards, walks to the cathedral, places one postcard against glass, watches a vision, and returns—all observational moves without forfeiture or trade-off. The vision answers her question without requiring choice, and her "gathering the postcards" at the end is a cleanup gesture rather than a tactic shift. Observation without decision trends low per the rubric.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The postcards are handled in two beats (spread on the table at the pavilion; one placed against cathedral glass) and are present at closure ("She gathered the postcards"). However, their mechanics are ornamental: aligning one postcard with a sunburst motif triggers hidden lenses without prior constraint or cost. The collection returns at the end but is not reweighted—Mara simply gathers them and leaves, unchanged in understanding of the objects themselves. Early signal and two-beat involvement lift the score into functional range, but lack of causal pressure or closure-scene transformation prevents higher placement.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Dawning hush" recurs as thematic label throughout (opening paragraph, cathedral legend, final paragraph) but never constrains an on-page choice or alters tactics. It functions as atmosphere and assertion rather than a stake-shaping concept. The story claims Mara seeks to understand the dawning hush but presents no dramatized conflict between understanding and not-understanding; the vision simply delivers the answer. Present but ornamental, with no causal pressure or closure-scene cost tied to the concept itself.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>1.9</grade><comment>"Quietly driven" is asserted in exposition ("Mara was quietly driven, not by fame or gold, but by a restless need") and never demonstrated through a visible tradeoff or constrained action. The trait does not enable or foreclose any on-page move; Mara's pursuit of the cathedral and postcards would proceed identically if she were loudly driven or casually curious. Label-only mention without causal work or cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Reckon" appears twice as a verb of intent ("to reckon with a question," "to reckon not only with the flower's nocturnal secret but with her own lingering winter") but does not drive a major turn or redefine options. The protagonist does not wrestle with competing interpretations or make a choice that alters her stance; the vision answers the question for her. The action is swappable with "understand" or "confront" without structural impact. Functional presence without causal necessity.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The hidden layers of etched glass are signaled in the legend paragraph and become the method in the cathedral beat: Mara places a postcard against the glass, the etchings glow, lenses are revealed, and the vision occurs. This method shapes one key beat and is present at closure (the vision "shown her that the answer lay" in the dialogue between elements). However, the mechanics are never constrained or tested—one postcard alignment succeeds immediately without friction or cost. Early signal and clear beat involvement meet the two-of-three gate threshold, and the method's presence in the ending lifts the score into mid-band, though lack of escalation or cost tied to the method itself prevents higher placement.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>The amber pavilion frames the opening and closing paragraphs and provides atmospheric coherence (amber light, wooden table, cracked panes, autumn scent) but does not pressure any choice or supply a resource that affects outcome. Mara spreads postcards there and returns at the end, but the space is interchangeable with any quiet interior. The setting is vividly described yet functionally ornamental, present in setup and closure without middle development or causal constraint.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>The melting of winter's last snow is mentioned in the opening ("the last snow dripped from its eaves"), middle ("the winter's last snow was melting across the valley"), and closing ("as the final flakes vanished"), but the timeframe never tightens decisions or alters tactics. No clock constrains Mara's moves; the melt functions as seasonal atmosphere rather than a live deadline. Present across the text but without pressure or cost tied to the passage of time.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The motivation "to understand why flowers bloom at night" is stated early and recurs at closure, but it is never dramatized through conflicted choices or friction between want and cost. Mara's curiosity leads her to the cathedral without obstacle, the vision answers her question without requiring sacrifice, and she departs satisfied. The desire is asserted rather than tested; told-only presence with no on-page trade-off or competing want that would create tension.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Umbral tenderness" is named explicitly twice (opening and cathedral beats) and the tone aims for quiet melancholy suffused with hope. However, the tone remains static rather than modulating with pressure; there is no escalation or friction that would darken or sharpen the mood before the resolution. The final image repeats the same soft, hopeful register without charging it through prior cost. Coherent but one-note, lacking the tonal shift or cadence break that would reweight the ending.</comment>
