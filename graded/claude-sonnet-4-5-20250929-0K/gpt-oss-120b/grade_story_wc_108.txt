<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Mara's phobias are declared but never embodied in concrete micro-choices under pressure. The interiority relies on abstraction ("trembling certainty," "transformative betrayal") rather than specific contradiction acting simultaneously. The ending gesture—stepping onto the lever—arrives as assertion without on-page struggle or visible cost foreclosing a path. Motivation remains label-only throughout.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Drive lens is ambiguous: the story oscillates between causal puzzle-solving (cipher, lever) and lyric accumulation (stars, dust, amber) without teaching a coherent pattern. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration ("fearless, forever changed") but lacks visible cost; the leap to "hovering on the edge of the universe" is metaphoric assertion, not an on-page reweighting with felt consequence. The orientation anchor (who/where/when) arrives late—library identity and Mara's stunt-double role emerge piecemeal past the opening 120 words, though not fatally obscure. Applied −0.3 for orientation drift and −0.5 for cost ambiguity at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The rusted library, cracked dome, and constellations provide vivid visual detail but function as backdrop rather than constraint. Spatial choreography (central aisle, third shelf, lever) is legible. The seashell and cast are handled, yet neither environment nor object meaningfully narrows Mara's options or charges the final image—she succeeds without spatial friction. Sensory hierarchy remains generic rather than POV-filtered.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—overcoming fear to prove vulnerability is power—is declared but never tested on the page. The cipher-solving sequence functions as puzzle rather than escalating pressure; no reversal or tightening forecloses an option. The lever's potential collapse is defused without cost ("the hidden mechanism held"), undercutting any price. Agency is gestural assertion rather than decision with trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Theme (vulnerability as power, betrayal as weapon) is stated repeatedly rather than emerging from particulars. The seashell's "true heart" and amber vial arrive as symbolic convenience late in the narrative, resolving the stated fear without dramatized struggle. The final image—"forever changed"—asserts transformation without showing what was reweighted or lost. No counter-reading is invited; the moral is spelled out.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Voice carries a consistent lyric register but lacks a perceptual signature specific to a stunt double under stress. Diction ("half-whispering," "firmly adaptive," "trembling certainty") recycles compound modifiers that blur rather than sharpen. No dialogue present to assess. POV remains stable first-person, though internal access is abstract rather than embodied. The prose reads as curated rather than character-particular.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Severe paraphrase loops and template cadence dominate: "firmly adaptive" appears three times, "trembling certainty" twice, "betrayal" and "transformation" churn across adjacent sentences without added pressure. Figurative density ("cracked dome," "dust-laden specters," "amber fire") saturates peak beats without coherent vehicle logic. Filter-verb stacks ("sensed," "felt," "realized") and stock metaphors ("second skin," "beacon") dull immediacy. Applied −1.4 for pervasive artifacts touching closure; disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band entries at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The premise—stunt double confronts fear via mystical library puzzle—leans on template "ordinary person discovers inner strength" arc without transformation. The cipher-as-stunt-moves conceit is mildly fresh but remains ornamental rather than driving inevitable turns. The seashell, vial, and lever arrive as convenience rather than synthesis of prior particulars. Emotional specificity is absent; the arc could transfer unchanged to another protagonist and setting.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Mara's stunt-double identity is present and mentioned at key beats (opener, cipher decoding via stunt moves, final leap), satisfying setup and middle-development gates. However, her choices do not meaningfully turn the plot—she succeeds at each task without friction. The phobia is declared but does not constrain on-page action. Late cipher linkage (mid-story) and lack of closure consequence limit score. Swappable with "acrobat" or "dancer" with minor edits. Applied −0.5 ornamental use, −0.4 swappability.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The seashell appears early (setup), is lifted and handled mid-story releasing the silver thread and scroll (development), and returns at the ending when Mara pours amber into it and hears the voice (payoff). All three gates satisfied. The shell constrains one choice (lifting it to access the cipher) and is present at closure, though the ending use is declarative rather than causally decisive. Applied +0.8 early signal, +0.9 two beats, +0.7 closure linkage. Deducted −0.3 for swappability (could be "whispering box" or similar mystical container) and −0.3 for summary-only final use (the voice emerges but does not test a new choice).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>Transformative betrayal is thematically invoked ("betrayal of my own mind," "embracing the betrayal") but never dramatized as an on-page event that changes options. Setup gate missed—no betrayal event occurs; middle and closure gates also absent as no choice hinges on betrayal. The concept functions as abstract theme claim rather than story engine. Applied −1.0 ornamental use, −0.8 summary-only, −0.5 late thematic mention without causal work.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"Firmly adaptive" appears three times as label ("I was firmly adaptive," "firmly adaptive rhythm") but never constrains or enables a choice with visible cost. Setup gate satisfied (early mention), middle-development gate missed (no action blocked or enabled by adaptability), payoff gate satisfied (final paragraph recurrence). The trait is asserted rather than shown altering tactics. Applied −0.8 label-only use, −0.3 template phrasing (repeated verbatim).</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Outwit" anchors the cipher-solving sequence (middle beat: "outwit with my stunt-trained eye," "outwit the destiny"), satisfying setup and development gates. The action enables one turn (decoding to find the lever), but the mechanics are summary rather than scene pressure. Closure gate missed—final success is assertion ("I accepted") rather than an outwitting move. Applied +0.4 one beat, +0.5 causal pressure in middle. Deducted −0.4 summary-only execution, −0.6 late first detailed use, −0.8 swappable with "solve" or "decode."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The smudged notes on the cast appear mid-story (setup gate missed—introduced past first third), are decoded via stunt moves (middle-development gate satisfied), and enable finding the lever. Payoff gate missed—the cast does not return or shape the ending. The mechanics are gestural ("pairing each curve with a stunt move") rather than pressure-tested. Applied +0.4 one beat, +0.5 causal pressure. Deducted −0.5 late introduction, −0.5 ornamental description, −0.4 summary-only use.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The rusted library under stars is established early (setup gate satisfied), provides spatial structure (central aisle, third shelf, lever), and is present in the final image ("library's walls glowed," "emerged from rusted doors"). All three gates satisfied. However, the setting does not meaningfully constrain choice—Mara's movements encounter no spatial friction, and the stars function as decorative motif rather than tactical element. Applied +0.8 early signal, +0.4 one beat (lever location), +0.7 closure linkage. Deducted −0.5 ornamental use (vivid but does not alter tactics), −0.4 swappability (could be "abandoned observatory" with minor edits).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>The timeframe "after discovering you're not who you thought" is referenced in the opener ("revelation came on a set") and final line ("forever changed"), satisfying setup and payoff gates. Middle-development gate missed—no mid-story choice hinges on this realization. The discovery is backstory rather than present pressure; time does not tighten tactics on the page. Applied +0.3 early signal, +0.7 closure linkage. Deducted −0.8 summary-only (the discovery is recounted, not dramatized), −0.5 ornamental (does not constrain present action).</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The motivation to prove vulnerability is power is declared early ("promising that I would transform betrayal into a weapon"), referenced mid-story ("the vial required… confession"), and asserted at closure ("to prove that vulnerability is power"). All three gates satisfied. However, the desire is told rather than dramatized in conflicted choices—no on-page moment tests the friction between wanting power and risking exposure. Applied +0.8 early signal, +0.4 one beat (vial scene), +0.7 closure linkage. Deducted −0.8 label-only (stated goal without embodied struggle), −0.5 summary-only execution, −0.3 template phrasing.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Trembling certainty" is introduced early ("mask trembling certainty"), recurs mid-story (implicit in the cipher-solving), and returns at closure ("trembling certainty I stepped," "firmly adaptive rhythm"). Tone is coherent and modulates subtly—fear layered with resolve. Setup, development, and payoff gates all satisfied. However, the phrase is repeated verbatim rather than evolved, and the tone does not meaningfully charge the final image beyond assertion. Applied +0.8 early signal, +0.9 two beats, +0.7 closure linkage. Deducted −0.3 template repetition (verbatim recurrence), −0.4 ornamental final use (tone stated, not embodied in final action), −0.5 swappability (could be "fearful resolve" or similar oxymoron).</comment>
