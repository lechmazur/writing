<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Nabu's interior remains abstract: "curiosity glowed like distant fire" and "his frugality forced him to measure" are labels without embodied contradiction. The final decision to place the tile and trace lines lacks visible cost or internal friction—no moment where competing impulses act simultaneously. The piece tells us he is frugal and curious but never dramatizes a micro-choice where those traits collide under pressure. Emotional progression is summarized rather than shown through contradictory embodied states.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed: "ancient Babylonian palace reimagined" and "frugal astronomer" anchor genre but not concrete spatial position or immediate temporal frame until midway. The Accumulative lens appears intended (tile discovery → schematic work → ritual completion), but causality is thin—the tile's numbers "whisper" and the ritual simply succeeds without dramatized resistance or micro-turn. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (the covenant sealed, prosperity follows), yet cost is asserted in summary ("humility and precise accounting") rather than foregrounded in a specific forfeiture or image. The ending proliferates consequences (markets thrum, grain stores never empty) but does not crystallize a single charged moment where cost is legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The palace setting supplies atmosphere ("dust‑laden archives," "stone corridors," "wind‑chimed arches") but does not constrain a key choice—Nabu moves freely from balconies to archives to altar without spatial friction. The magic square tile is handled twice (discovery, placement) and its surface detail (numbers, etching) recurs, meeting micro-setting criteria. However, the tile's physical properties do not alter tactics; it functions as a symbol rather than a constraint. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered ("dusky," "violet glow") but does not narrow options at the closure beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—sealing a covenant to bind star-watching to cosmic ledger—is signaled early but remains abstract. One tightening occurs when Nabu aligns tile numbers with planetary positions, yet this choice is frictionless: no dramatized obstacle, no visible price paid mid-scene. The ritual's success is immediate and complete ("the covenant sealed with a gentle click"), foreclosing tension rather than escalating it. The story lacks a moment where a live option is visibly surrendered or a trade-off forces tactical change. Agency is present (Nabu performs the ritual) but pressure does not cohere into a narrowing or deepening that tests commitment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Theme of measurement/calculation bridging mortal and cosmic appears in recurring vocabulary ("ledger," "measure," "accounting," "empirically ironic") but is stated more than enacted. The final paragraph moralizes: "even the most empirically ironic calculations can uncloak devotion when rendered through careful schematics." The magic square tile recurs but shifts meaning only in summary; no specific on-page image reweights prior material with undeniable pressure. The piece abstracts its central question—how frugality and cosmic ambition intersect—into prompt-like phrasing rather than letting particulars answer it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited distance is stable, and diction ("waning amber," "uncloak," "dusky harmony") establishes a consistent lyric-elevated register. However, vocabulary often drifts into abstract elevation ("encrypted devotion," "celestial signature," "perpetual note of dusky harmony") that exceeds immediate perception. Perceptual signature is generic—descriptors like "ancient dust" and "violet glow" could apply to any mystical scene. No dialogue appears. Psychic distance remains steady but does not modulate with pressure; the narrator's register at discovery, ritual work, and closure is uniform.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "the covenant's true shape" / "uncloak the covenant" / "the covenant began to uncloak itself" / "the uncloak‑ed covenant"; "dusky" appears five times without functional variation. Template cadence runs through the middle third: "He sensed… He set out… He worked… He placed…" Figurative language is dense but often mixed: "curiosity glowed like distant fire" (thermal metaphor), "sketching… each line a bridge" (structural metaphor), "the palace walls seemed to inhale the dusk" (animate metaphor) within adjacent sentences without coherent vehicle. "Empirically ironic" is repeated as a stock phrase without concrete illustration. Information density is low—many sentences restate atmosphere or theme rather than advancing situation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The core synthesis—frugal astronomer uses ancient numerology to bind mortal practice to cosmic order—is a familiar mystical-discovery template (scholar finds relic, deciphers it, performs ritual, world changes). "Empirically ironic" is asserted as fresh texture but functions as a label. The "between regimes" window and Babylonian setting add specificity, yet the emotional arc and plot beats (discovery, research, ritual success, prosperity) follow a well-worn path without a non-obvious turn. The tile's mechanics and the ritual's stakes remain abstract, reducing transformation. Risk is minimal: no structural or perspectival gamble heightens engagement.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Nabu anchors POV and drives discovery, schematic work, and ritual performance across three beats. However, his choices are frictionless: no moment where frugality constrains his ritual work or creates a tactical trade-off. "Frugal" is mentioned three times but never visibly alters an option or imposes cost. He functions as a vehicle for the plot rather than a source of resistant pressure. Present in setup, development, and closure; functionally essential but causally passive.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The tile is discovered in beat one, studied/aligned in beat two, and placed on the altar in the climax. It recurs with reweighted meaning: first as relic, then as ritual tool, finally as humming confirmation. Setup, development, and payoff gates are met. However, the tile's specific properties (the numbers that sum equally) are mentioned but not mechanically leveraged—any inscribed object could serve the same role with minor edits. Causal pressure is moderate; closure linkage is clear.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"Encrypted devotion" is described as "hidden within the tile" and "coded in numerals" but never dramatized as a puzzle Nabu must solve or a constraint that shapes his method. It appears in summary (beat one) and is referenced thematically ("uncloak‑ed devotion" in the final paragraph) but does not alter on-page options or tactics. Present in setup and thematic payoff; absent from middle development. Ornamental use without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Empirically ironic" is labeled three times: discovery paragraph, middle paragraph, final paragraph. The trait is never enacted—no scene where Nabu's empirical habit conflicts with mystical faith or where irony creates a visible cost. It functions as a thematic assertion rather than a constraint on action. Label-only mention without embodied trade-off. Present in setup and ending as commentary; does not shape a middle beat.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Uncloak" recurs five times and frames the central task: discovering the covenant's shape, then revealing it via ritual. The climax beat—"the covenant began to uncloak itself"—depends on this action. However, the uncloaking is passive (it happens to Nabu) rather than an earned choice with friction. Setup (he sets out to uncloak), development (working through schematics), and payoff (the violet glow) gates are met. Causal role in two beats; closure linkage clear. Swappable with "reveal" or "decode" with minor edits, capping irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Schematics are mentioned in beat two: "sketching the tile's pattern through schematic representations on parchment" and later "he hoped the schematics will translate the encrypted devotion." They are described but not shown—no on-page detail of diagram construction or how the schematics enable the alignment. Present in setup (implied as method) and development (one sentence), absent from the ritual beat itself. Functional but replaceable; the mechanics do not constrain tactics.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The palace anchors atmosphere and supplies the altar, archives, balconies, and courtyard across three beats. "Between regimes" adds temporal urgency in one sentence. However, the setting does not constrain movement or choices—Nabu accesses all spaces freely. Setup (discovery in archives), development (corridors, observatory), and payoff (altar, courtyard) gates are met. The setting charges the final image (palace walls inhale dusk) but does not alter tactics. Causal role is atmospheric rather than mechanical.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"Between regimes" is mentioned once in beat three: "a fleeting window for secret rites." The text states this urgency but does not track time or show the window closing. No beat where the approaching regime change forces a tactical adjustment or accelerates Nabu's work. Present in development as a one-sentence frame; absent from setup and not leveraged at closure. Summary-only use without on-page pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The motivation to seal a covenant is stated early ("His ultimate motivation") and drives the ritual sequence. However, it is told rather than dramatized through conflicted micro-choices—no moment where Nabu weighs the covenant's cost against another want. The motivation is present in setup (paragraph seven), shapes the climax action (placing the tile), and receives thematic closure (the pact honored). One causal beat (the ritual); closure linkage via the sealed covenant. Friction between wants and costs is absent.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>"Dusky" appears six times, establishing a consistent twilight register. "Harmony" recurs three times, linked to wind chimes, analytical heart, and the final covenant. Tone is static—no modulation with pressure; the lyric-elevated mood persists uniformly from discovery through ritual to aftermath. Present in setup, maintained through development, and restated in the final beat ("perpetual note of dusky harmony"). Coherent but does not charge the final image with new tension or cadence shift. Mid-band for consistency without escalation.</comment>
