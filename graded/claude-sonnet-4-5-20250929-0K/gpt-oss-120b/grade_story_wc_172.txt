<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The philanthropist is a label more than a living character; his "amoral grace" and "secretly sentimental yearning" are asserted through narration rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses acting in scene. The final tear "tasted of sand and redemption" reads as emotional summary without the embodied struggle that would earn it. No on-page micro-choices reveal a hierarchy of values—he executes a plan without friction or cost to his own stance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation is unclear past 120 words: who this man is, why he stands here now, and what immediate decision faces him remain vague until well into the piece (−0.4). The closure unit—egg shattering and echo preserved—occurs on the page, but no visible cost alters the protagonist's options or stance; he simply "turned away," his world unchanged. The piece reads as Accumulative/Textural in aspiration, but the final image does not reweight prior material with felt pressure, landing instead as a static tableau.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The salt flat is vividly rendered with specific detail (cracks "like veins of forgotten rivers," brine pool as amplifier), and the environment enables the egg's release. However, the setting does not constrain a choice or force a trade-off—it provides a stage rather than shaping tactics under pressure. The description occasionally drifts toward catalog ("iridescent with the faded colors") without filtering through immediate urgency.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving the extinct bird's echo—is signaled early but never tested by opposition or cost. The protagonist's plan proceeds without a single reversal, tightening, or moment where failure is risked on the page. The "lull" of thunder provides a timing cue, not a pressure point; no agency decision forecloses a path or alters tactics. The weeks-later discovery by scientists is summary, not dramatized escalation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The theme of cruelty entwined with preservation emerges through the manufactured drought and sentimental motive, but the final image states rather than dramatizes the paradox: "amoral yet tender" is declared, not shown through a choice that costs him something. The phrase "a song from silence" in the penultimate paragraph borders on thematic echo. The piece gestures toward complexity but resolves into a tidy moral frame where "even in a world of engineered scarcity, a single act of release could carve a song from silence."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Third-person narration remains stable, but the voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature—elevated diction ("lattice of white fissures," "fractured grace") pervades without modulation under pressure. Phrases like "amoral philanthropist" and "fractured grace" repeat as external labels rather than emerging through the character's particular way of noticing. The prose reads as elevated literary omniscience throughout, with no shift in psychic distance or rhythm to reflect the protagonist's state at key beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout without pattern-teaching or payoff: "sky bruised," "thin sheet of glass," "ghostly chorus," "broken glass that somehow felt whole" stack without coherent vehicle logic (−0.6). Paraphrase loops appear ("the salt flat caught the vibration, sending it spiraling upward" / "the echo rippled across the emptiness") and template cadence runs in the opening half ("He had engineered," "He cradled," "He had learned," "He stepped") (−0.5). The final third remains artifact-heavy, disqualifying 9+ globally. Several sentences restate the same content: the map/cracks converge on the basin in adjacent lines without added pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The core premise—amoral philanthropist engineers drought to preserve extinct bird's echo via salt-flat acoustics—offers specificity, but the execution leans on stock literary gestures: the "secretly sentimental" villain, the poetic natural phenomenon, the scientists who later confirm the wonder. The manufactured drought, despite its conceptual promise, exerts no narrative friction and reads as backdrop rather than a bold moral calculus with on-page cost. The final image of "fractured grace" is asserted rather than discovered through the character's choices.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Present throughout and labeled "amoral philanthropist," but his choices do not create key turns—he enacts a pre-formed plan without on-page friction. The "secretly sentimental" attribute is told, not tested. He appears in the closure image but only as a witness turning away, not as an agent whose decision alters options.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The egg is introduced early (setup), unsealed and lowered onto the brine pool (middle action), and its shattering produces the echo that defines the closure image (payoff). All three gates are met. However, the egg does not constrain a choice or create a trade-off—it is a prop in a plan that proceeds without resistance. The shell's iridescence and the "breath of ancient air" add texture but do not shift tactics or stakes.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>The manufactured drought is mentioned early and again in the summary paragraph, but it does not shape on-page stakes or tactics. It functions as backstory context rather than a live pressure that narrows options or forces a choice. The drought could be replaced with "he traveled to a remote salt flat" without altering the scene's logic.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>The "secretly sentimental" trait is asserted in the opening paragraph and again in the final section ("allowed himself the fleeting indulgence of a tear"), but it never constrains or enables an on-page action with visible cost. It remains a label rather than a driver of choice or friction.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The release of the egg (unsealing, lowering, fracturing) occurs on the page and defines the closure moment. Setup and payoff gates are met. However, the action is not the result of a difficult choice or a turn—it is the execution of a plan without opposition. The release does not redefine options or foreclose a path with cost; it completes the protagonist's intent without friction.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The map of cracks is described early ("traced a narrow corridor toward the oldest basin") and revisited at closure ("The cracked map...lay half-buried"). Setup and payoff are present, but the map does not shape attempts or constrain tactics—the protagonist follows it without error or complication. Middle development is absent; it guides rather than pressures.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The salt flat is anchored early and provides the acoustic properties (amplifier) that enable the echo's preservation. It supplies a resource central to the plan. However, it does not pressure a choice or alter tactics—the protagonist uses it as intended without obstacle. The brine pool and resonance mechanics are present in setup, middle, and payoff, but the setting is cooperative rather than resistant.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The "lull of distant thunder" appears in the opening line and again as a timing cue for the egg's release ("the moment the wind paused"). It provides atmospheric framing but does not tighten decisions—there is no on-page urgency or cost if the window is missed. The thunder returns at the end to carry the echo, but this is result, not pressure. Time is decorative rather than tactical.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The desire to "preserve the echo of extinct birds" is stated early and revisited in closure, meeting setup and payoff. However, it is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choices. No on-page moment shows this motive in friction with another want or cost—he pursues it without impediment or trade-off. The motivation is label-level rather than choice-driven.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The phrase "fractured grace" appears three times (opening, middle, close) and the prose sustains a lyric, elevated register throughout. Tone is coherent but does not modulate with pressure—the same figurative density and diction pervade calm description and the closure beat alike. The final image is charged by recurrence of the phrase, but the tone itself does not shift to heighten the moment; it remains static and decorative.</comment>
