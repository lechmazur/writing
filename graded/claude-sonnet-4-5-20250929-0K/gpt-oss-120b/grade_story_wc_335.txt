<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The archivist remains a walking label collection—"combative tenderness," "mentor resilience quietly"—rather than a person with contradictory impulses dramatized in scene. Her backwards-walking nervousness appears twice but never constrains a choice or creates friction; it's ornamental. The emotional progression from nervous to confident is asserted through summary ("confidence took the place of retreat") rather than earned through on-page micro-choices under pressure. Internal conflict is absent; she executes her archival quest without any competing desire or cost that would make her decisions revelatory.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early, but the drive lens remains ambiguous throughout—accumulative lyricism competes with pseudo-causal tea-leaf decoding without committing to either. The "reversible exile" closure hinges on tea-leaf geometry unlocking a solar alignment, but this mechanism is introduced and resolved in the same continuous narration with no prior constraint or cost; the shadow dissolves, walls seal, and the library sighs relief in a sequence that reads as wish-fulfillment rather than earned closure. No visible cost accompanies the reversal—no knowledge sacrificed, no relationship altered, no tactical price paid—so the RR/DC test fails. The piece teaches no consistent pattern by the 25% mark and offers only a decorative cascade at the end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The forgotten library supplies vivid anchors (dust, cracked teacups, vaulted ceiling, pine-scented hidden chamber) and the micro-objects (afternoon shadow in glass, tea leaves) appear in multiple beats. However, the setting never constrains a choice—every door opens, every manuscript yields, every alignment succeeds—so it functions as backdrop rather than pressure. The swing outside offers atmospheric repetition but no causal role. Spatial choreography is clear, and the sensory selection (metallic hymn of chains, smell of pine) is purposeful, lifting the score into mid-band despite the lack of constraint-driven choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—ending the library's reversible exile—is signaled early, but escalation is absent: each annotation glows, each tea-leaf circle forms perfectly, each ancient mechanism responds on cue without friction or failure. The archivist's agency consists of performing a ritual (tip tea, read geometry, annotate, place shadow) that encounters zero resistance; coincidence (the sun striking "at the precise angle") resolves the problem the protagonist did not help create. The backwards-walking moment offers a micro-turn ("She steadied herself") but it deflates immediately with no tactical cost or foreclosed option. No tightening, no price, no deepening—only a sequence of decorative successes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The theme of resilience and reversible exile is stated rather than enacted: "mentor resilience quietly," "Endure, then return," and the final whisper "You will not be exiled again" are direct thematic declarations that replace scene pressure. The tea-leaf geometry and afternoon shadow could serve as charged images, but they function as magical plot keys rather than motifs that reweight prior material. The ending offers no non-literal answer—walls literally heal, exile literally ends—so the conceptual cost is absent. "Combative tenderness" is named twice but never shown as a simultaneous contradiction in a choice, reducing it to a decorative oxymoron.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping, and the perceptual signature (shard-mirror archivist noting fractured memories, geometry, and light) is character-specific. However, the diction drifts into elevated register ("vaulted hall," "reversible pilgrimage," "luminous shards") that feels authorial rather than rooted in the focalizer's working idiom, especially during high-pressure moments. The whispered dialogue ("You will not be exiled again; I will guard your stories as fiercely as I guard my own heart") sounds like written exposition rather than spoken thought. Psychic distance remains consistent, and the narrative stance is controlled, but the voice lacks the contradictory rhythms that would reflect genuine stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade the text: "forgotten library" / "lost codices" / "forgotten lore," "ancient stacks" / "ancient altar," "combative tenderness" stated three times without variation, "reversible exile" / "reversible journey" / "reversible pilgrimage." Template cadence dominates: "She felt... She felt... She placed... She followed... She whispered..." across a dozen consecutive sentences. The figurative density is high without payoff—"afternoon shadow caught in glass" is described four different ways (thin rectangle of darkness, quivering edges like a blade, fractured into ribbons of gold, dissolved into a cascade of light) but the metaphors contradict one another (solid blade vs. dissolving cascade). Stock phrasing clusters in peak beats: "tiny cartographers mapping the routes of hope," "battle fought with kindness," "heart beating anew with the rhythm of resilient hope." The artifact accumulation spans the closure beat, triggering the escalated penalty and disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The core premise—decoding tea-leaf geometry to reverse a library's exile—offers a fresh surface combination, but the execution is template-driven: a lone archivist restoring a forgotten place through a mystical key reads as a mid-list fantasy trope without transformation. The tea-leaf method is mentioned but never constrains a choice or fails; it succeeds on first use, reducing it to a convenience rather than a tactical puzzle. The "combative tenderness" oxymoron and backwards-walking quirk are decorative rather than load-bearing. Emotional specificity is absent—terms like "resilience," "exile," and "hope" remain abstract throughout. The story could swap the archivist for a gardener, the tea leaves for seeds, and the library for a greenhouse with no structural change, failing the transformation test.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The shard-mirror archivist is present throughout and performs all key actions (annotate, analyze tea leaves, place the shadow, whisper to the stacks), satisfying the setup, development, and payoff gates. However, her decisions do not create turns—each annotation succeeds, each tea-leaf reading yields the answer, each placement triggers the desired effect without friction or cost. She observes, performs ritual, and witnesses results, but no choice narrows options or trades one good for another. The character's occupation (archivist) and metaphorical descriptor (shard-mirror) are labels rather than causal levers; removing the "shard-mirror" descriptor would not alter the plot. Late-penalty does not apply (introduced in opening sentence), but swappability and ornamental use lower the score. Integration frictions: ornamental use −0.7, swappability −0.6. Positive signals: three beats +1.4, early signal +0.5. Net: 3.0 + 1.9 − 1.3 = 3.6, capped at 3.4 for missing middle development (no constrained choice), rounded down to 3.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The afternoon shadow caught in glass appears in four beats: carried in the opening, quivers mid-story, fractures when struck by sunlight, and dissolves at the altar in the ending. It satisfies setup, development, and payoff gates. However, its function is passive—she carries it, places it, and the sun acts upon it; she never uses it to make a constrained choice or sacrifice another option. The object's properties shift metaphorically (thin rectangle, blade-like edges, ribbons of gold, cascade of light) without causal logic tying those transformations to her actions. Integration frictions: ornamental in two beats −0.6, swappability (any ritual object could occupy this slot) −0.5. Positive signals: early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.2. Net: 3.0 + 3.2 − 1.1 = 5.1, rounded down to 4.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Reversible exile is the story's stated central stake, signaled in the first third ("reversible exile of forgotten ages") and repeated across beats ("reversible journey," "reversible pilgrimage"). It shapes the archivist's goal (to end the exile) and the ending event (walls seal, exile undone). However, the concept remains thematic rather than tactical—no on-page rule explains what makes exile "reversible," no prior attempt has failed, and no cost is paid to reverse it. The protagonist does not choose between reversing the exile and another goal; she simply performs the ritual. Integration frictions: summary-only mechanism −0.5, swappability (replace "reversible exile" with "forgotten curse" or "lost enchantment" with no structural change) −0.6. Positive signals: early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.0. Net: 3.0 + 2.5 − 1.1 = 4.4, capped at 3.8 for swappability, rounded down to 3.7.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>Walks backwards when nervous appears twice: in the opening ("When nervous, she walked backwards") and once mid-story ("The archivist's nervous habit resurfaced briefly... prompting her to step backward"). The trait satisfies setup and development gates. However, it never constrains a choice or creates cost—she steps backward, scans the shadows, steadies herself, and continues with no tactical consequence. The backwards motion does not prevent her from accessing a space, slow her progress, or force a trade-off. Integration frictions: ornamental use −0.8, label-only (told but not shown affecting outcomes) −0.3. Positive signals: early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9. Net: 3.0 + 1.4 − 1.1 = 3.3, capped at 3.4 for missing closure participation, rounded down to 2.1 after applying the dominant limiter (ornamental).</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Annotate is the protagonist's central action, appearing in at least four beats: she annotates the brittle journal margins, each annotated line glows, she begins the process on unannotated journals, and she writes "Endure, then return" beside the pentagon tea-leaf formation. The action satisfies all three gates and drives the visible plot progression. However, it is swappable—replace "annotate" with "inscribe runes," "trace symbols," or "whisper incantations" and the sequence remains identical. The annotations themselves do not fail, require revision, or force a tactical choice; they simply succeed. Integration frictions: swappability −0.6. Positive signals: early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +0.9, closure linkage +1.2. Net: 3.0 + 4.1 − 0.6 = 6.5, reduced by dominant limiter (swappability) to 5.9.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>By analyzing the geometry of tea leaves appears in three beats: introduced in the first third as the method to decode hidden dates, used mid-story when she tips a cup and notes the pentagon (symbol of resilience), and implied at the ending when the tea-leaf geometry's foretold angle triggers the shadow fracture. The method satisfies all three gates. However, its mechanics are asserted rather than shown—no competing interpretation, no failed reading, no visible cost when the method succeeds or constraint when it might fail. The tea leaves form "tiny triangles and spirals" that "correspond to a stanza," but this correspondence is declared, not demonstrated through prior pattern or choice. Integration frictions: ornamental in middle beat −0.4, summary-only mechanism −0.5. Positive signals: early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.0. Net: 3.0 + 3.0 − 0.9 = 5.1, reduced by dominant limiter (summary mechanism) to 4.3.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The forgotten library is present throughout, providing spatial anchors (vaulted hall, table with cracked teacups, far wing, hidden chambers, ancient altar) and atmospheric detail (dust, cracked window, smell of pine). It satisfies all three gates and supplies the stage for every action. However, the setting never constrains a choice—every door opens, every chamber is accessible, every object is available when needed. The library's "reversible exile" is the story's stake, but the setting itself does not pressure tactics; it is a passive container. Integration frictions: ornamental use −0.5. Positive signals: early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure (weak: supplies resources but no obstacles) +0.4, closure linkage +0.9. Net: 3.0 + 3.4 − 0.5 = 5.9, reduced by weak causal pressure to 5.7.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>At the hush as an empty playground swing drifts in the breeze is a poetic timeframe cue in the opening sentence, with the swing returning twice: mid-story ("the swing moved ever so slightly, its chains singing a soft metallic hymn") and implied in the ending through the metaphor of the library breathing. It satisfies setup and lyric-reprise conditions. However, "at the hush" does not anchor a clock or tighten decisions—no urgency, no deadline, no tactical window. The swing's motion is atmospheric rather than temporal; it does not track elapsed time or create pressure. Integration frictions: ornamental use −0.7, no causal pressure on time −0.6. Positive signals: early signal +0.5, lyric reprise +0.3. Net: 3.0 + 0.8 − 1.3 = 2.5, capped at 2.8 for missing closure participation (swing does not appear in final beat), reduced by dominant limiter (ornamental) to 1.8.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>To mentor resilience quietly is stated in the opening paragraph as the archivist's motivation and echoed in her whispered vow ("I will guard your stories") and the final line ("resilience, once mentored quietly, would now roar back"). It satisfies setup and payoff gates. However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized—no scene shows her choosing to mentor over another desire, no friction arises between quiet mentorship and a louder impulse. The "quietly" adverb is asserted but not tested; she whispers, but no moment forces her to choose silence over declaration at a cost. Integration frictions: label-only (told without friction) −0.6, ornamental in middle beats −0.4. Positive signals: early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.8. Net: 3.0 + 2.3 − 1.0 = 4.3, reduced by dominant limiter (label-only) to 4.1.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Combative tenderness is named three times: opening paragraph ("combative tenderness rise within her"), mid-story ("the combative tenderness of the moment"), and late ("recalling the combative tenderness that had guided her earlier"). The tone is present throughout and modulates slightly (nervous → confident). However, it is asserted rather than enacted—no scene shows simultaneous combat and tenderness in a single choice. The archivist is uniformly gentle and successful; no moment forces her to wound in order to heal or to fight while offering care. The oxymoron remains decorative. Integration frictions: label-only (stated, not dramatized) −0.6, static mood (no modulation under pressure) −0.5. Positive signals: early signal +0.5, three beats +1.4, closure linkage (implied in final stance) +0.5. Net: 3.0 + 2.4 − 1.1 = 4.3, capped at 3.4 for missing middle development (no constrained tonal choice).</comment>
