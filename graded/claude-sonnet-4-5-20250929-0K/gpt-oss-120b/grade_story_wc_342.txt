<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Lira's face-blindness is label-only; it never constrains a choice or shapes perception on the page. Her motivation to "mirror the sky" is declared but not tested against competing desires or material limits. The prose recycles "fractally precise" as a tic rather than showing contradictory impulses under pressure. No visible cost forecloses a path—Lira completes the mural and smiles, satisfied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece attempts an accumulative design but never tightens or reweights the dominant stake. The demolition "scheduled for noon" arrives without altering tactics; Lira finishes on time, the mural "holds its shimmer," and the safe remains closed—no decisive change, no visible cost, no Charged Poise that crystallizes options. Orientation is delayed past 120 words (first anchor ~180 words into fragmented description), triggering −0.4 here and capping Q3 at 7.0 per the test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The hollowed tree trunk library supplies vivid, particular imagery: bark-lined aisles, leaf-filled windows, pigments catching fire on rough bark. The coin's grooves and the secret safe are handled on the page. However, setting never constrains a choice or alters tactics—Lira's process unfolds without friction from the condemned space or the impending demolition. Cap at 7.0 applied per orientation debt in Q2.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—complete the mural before demolition—is signaled early but never escalates. No reversal or meaningful tightening narrows options; Lira mixes pigments, presses the coin, finishes the final segment, and the building falls with the mural intact. The demolition crew's arrival does not force a trade-off or alter her process. No on-page cost is legible; she "smiled" and the piece ends in declarative triumph.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The theme of "limits as thresholds" is stated multiple times rather than earned through specific struggle. The final paragraph moralizes: "the true craft was not the painting but the moment she chose to defy the silence" and "where limits end and imagination begins." The mural's survival after demolition undercuts the promised stakes rather than reweighting them. No resonant, non-literal answer emerges from the ending image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited is stable and the perceptual signature is lyric and image-dense. However, the prose recycles stems ("fractally precise," "secret book safe," "centuries-old coin") and the character's face-blindness never filters perception in character-specific ways. The narration asserts facts Lira cannot see: "the sky inside the library seemed to inhale" reads as external omniscience. No dialogue is present; internal voice is consistent but not distinct.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Heavy paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade: "secret book safe" appears seven times, often mid-sentence scaffolding; "fractally precise" recurs as decorative filler; "the hush," "silence," and "held breath" cycle without added pressure. Template cadence in the final third: "She stepped back... She completed... She smiled." Figurative language stacks without payoff: "sunrise trapped in timber," "cathedral of sky," "breath of sky" blur into generic lyricism. Deductions total −1.4 in Q7; artifacts touch closure, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The face-blind portrait artist painting sky indoors is a fresh premise, but the piece does not follow its implications—face-blindness remains ornamental. The coin-guided pigment mixing and secret safe feel like prompt checklist rather than organic causality. The mural surviving demolition is a convenient miracle with no groundwork. Elevated diction ("fractally precise," "heightened stillness") reads as prompt echo rather than lived voice, reducing authenticity of vision.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Face-blindness is mentioned but never shapes a choice or constrains perception. Lira observes, mixes, paints—none of which require reading faces. Ornamental trait.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>The safe is opened once to reveal diagrams, then "remained closed" at the end. Introduced early but static; it does not enable a middle choice or participate causally in closure. Two touches (open, final mention) across two beats, but both are summary-only. Cap at 4.6 for missing middle development; further reduced for swappability and summary use.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Discovering limits" is stated repeatedly as theme but never dramatized as a stake or choice. Lira feels limits are "a gift" and "thresholds"—labels only. The concept does not change options on the page. Present as thematic assertion, not causal force.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.2</grade><comment>"Fractally precise" appears six times as a tic, never constraining or enabling action with cost. Label-only decorative trait.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Craft (painting the mural) occupies most beats and shapes the ending image. However, it is process without friction—no failed attempts, material limits, or trade-offs. Present across beats and closure, but easily replaceable with another meticulous art form. Two gates (setup, payoff) met; middle development is weak.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The coin is introduced early, unlocks the safe, and Lira presses it into wet pigment at the end. Three beats, but its mechanics (constellation map, notches suggesting drying intervals) are told rather than tested. Present in closure but does not redefine options or carry visible cost. Two clear gates (setup, payoff), weak middle.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The tree trunk library is vividly rendered and supplies materials (bark walls, leaf-filled windows, ancient wood). The demolition time-pressure is declared but does not alter tactics. Present early and at closure; the mural "held its shimmer" even as the building fell, but setting does not constrain choice. Three gates met; causal pressure is weak but closure linkage is clear.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The "hush just before... demolition... scheduled for noon" is mentioned but never tracked. Lira completes the mural with no urgency or adjustments due to the clock. Time does not tighten decisions. Present as ambient detail, not causal force. Setup present, middle and payoff gates missing.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Mirror the sky inside walls" is stated early and the mural depicts azure, but the motivation is never conflicted or tested against cost. Lira wants it, executes it, succeeds. Functional but frictionless. Setup and payoff gates met; no middle friction or trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Heightened stillness" is declared in the opening and recurs ("hush," "held breath," "silent promise"). Tone is consistent but static; it does not modulate with pressure or charge the final image with new weight. Lyric reprise without reweighting. Two gates (setup, payoff), weak middle development.</comment>
