<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation—to find unused courage—is told rather than dramatized through internal contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. The cave discovery and chest opening feel choreographed rather than earned by conflicting impulses acting simultaneously. The "map of the inner self" epiphany arrives as an abstract gift rather than through struggle, and the final "reclaimed courage" reads like a therapeutic label instead of embodied cost. Ferry guides remain observation figures without decisions that create turns.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the opening paragraph and remain stable. The dominant stake—Mira seeking courage—is signaled early but never meaningfully tightens; the ferry journey and cave entry proceed without a reversal that narrows options. The chest opens via ticket-stamp mechanics rather than protagonist agency, and the ending "reclaimed courage" is asserted without visible cost or a credible before/after that forecloses a path. Accumulative/Textural lens is inferred but closure lacks the density increase or cadence shift required to reweight the stake with felt price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Pebble pier, veiled ridgeway, and cave entrance with star rune provide vivid anchors filtered through a lyric voice. The ticket punch constrains the chest-opening beat, satisfying the micro-setting test for choice constraint. Sensory detail (lantern glow, mist, weathered boards) is purposeful and selective, though the ridgeway's "indirect routes" remain abstract choreography rather than spatial obstacles that alter tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding unused courage—is declared but never tested by a live dilemma or visible trade-off. The ferry arrives, the cave opens, the chest reveals a map; each step proceeds via world mechanics rather than Mira's agency under pressure. No reversal narrows options, and the final "reclaimed courage" carries no on-page cost—no visible price paid, no path foreclosed. Coincidence (the ticket fits the clasp) resolves rather than complicates.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The core question—what happens when courage lies dormant—emerges through recurring imagery (seed beneath sand, star stamp, lullaby) but never moves beyond decorative recurrence to constrain choice or charge the closure. The ending "star-stamped ticket punch clutched like a talisman" and "traversing hidden melodies" are abstract assertions rather than a resonant, non-literal answer rooted in particulars. "Vigil in twilight" and "gently persistent" function as thematic labels rather than dramatized costs, and the final paragraph moralizes the journey without scene pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Voice maintains a consistent lyric register with purposeful compression ("dreaming clouds," "sea's sighs") and a stable third-person limited stance on Mira. Psychic distance remains controlled, though the narration occasionally drifts toward poetic assertion ("reclaimed the courage that had waited in silence") rather than Mira's immediate perception. No dialogue appears; interiority is filtered but abstract at peak beats, relying on therapy-adjacent phrases ("map of the inner self," "unused courage") that weaken specificity under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Rhythm varies across beats and opening/closing lines anchor voice and stakes effectively. Template cadence appears in mid-passage runs: "Each turn reminded… Each stroke… each step" creates mild paraphrase loops, and figurative language clusters densely without pattern-teaching ("pulse of hope," "seed sleeping beneath sand," "tide to uncover it"). The closure beat's "bright star now etched upon her soul" and "world's hidden melodies" layer abstract metaphors that blur rather than sharpen the final image. Information density is moderate; many lines do double duty but scaffold phrasing ("gently persistent," "wise ferry guides") recurs without added pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The hero's-journey frame—mentor figures, symbolic voyage, inner-cave treasure, returned courage—follows a familiar template without transformation through specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The ticket-punch mechanism and star-rune match offer surface cleverness but do not synthesize into an inevitable hindsight turn. Emotional specificity is limited by abstract language ("unused courage waits," "map of the inner self"), and the ridgeway's "indirect routes" remain a stated concept rather than grounded world logic that pressures choice.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Ferry guides appear in setup, middle (singing to part darkness), and closure (greeting Mira with a smile), satisfying two gates. Their singing enables the cave opening but they make no decisions that create key turns; Mira's action (placing the ticket) drives the chest reveal. Their presence is functional but replaceable with any mentor archetype; "wise" and "silver eyes" are label-only traits without visible tradeoffs.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Ticket punch with star stamp appears in setup (Mira clutches it), middle development (she places it against the latch, hears the click), and closure (rests in her palm as reminder). It constrains the chest-opening beat via its star-shaped mechanics and is reweighted in the final image as "talisman." Early signal, multi-beat involvement, and closure linkage elevate the score, though the element's cost connection is implied rather than dramatized—removing it would change logistics but not Mira's internal arc.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Vigil in twilight appears in setup ("prepared for the night's vigil in twilight") and is thematized at closure ("the vigil in twilight was not a watch over others, but a promise to herself"). It shapes the timeframe and tone but does not constrain a middle choice or enable tactics under pressure; the vigil is abstract backdrop rather than active stake. Setup and closure participation allow mid-band eligibility, but the element is swappable with "night watch" or "threshold moment" without structural cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Gently persistent" describes Mira's waiting (setup), the rhythm of the sea's lullaby (recurrent texture), and the ferry guides' approach (attributed trait). It colors tone and pacing but does not constrain an on-page action with visible cost; persistence enables endurance rather than forcing a trade-off. Present across beats and linked to closure mood, it reaches low-mid band, but remains replaceable with "patient" or "steady" without altering choice logic.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Traverse" drives setup (ferry traversing the ridgeway), middle beats (Mira stepping through indirect routes of her own heart), and closure (setting foot upon the ridgeway "ready to traverse the world's hidden melodies"). The action is central to the journey structure and reweighted in the final image, but its mechanics are abstract—removing "traverse" in favor of "journey" or "cross" would require only synonym swaps. Early signal, multi-beat presence, and closure linkage support mid-band, yet specificity and irreplaceability remain moderate.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Through indirect routes" is signaled in setup ("not by straight lines but by indirect routes that curled like dreaming clouds"), enacted in the ferry's middle-beat navigation ("slipped through hidden inlets, lingered at forgotten coves, turned back"), and thematized at closure ("traverse the unknown, even when the roads were hidden"). The method shapes the ferry's path and Mira's metaphorical arc, but its causal pressure is ornamental—the indirectness does not force a tactical choice or visible cost. Setup, development description, and closure echo allow mid-band, though the element is swappable with "winding paths" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Veiled ridgeway appears in setup (the path marked by stars), middle (the ferry's lantern weaving through mist that cloaked the ridgeway), and closure (sunrise painting the ridgeway's veil in gold; Mira sets foot upon it again). It supplies the journey's route and charges the final image with transformed light, yet it does not constrain a middle choice or alter tactics—the ridgeway is traversed via ferry mechanics rather than Mira navigating its obstacles. Early signal, multi-beat presence, and closure participation support mid-band; lyric reprise reweights the stake, but causal pressure and irreplaceability remain moderate.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"After the leash breaks" marks the inciting shift in setup (the frayed rope falls, Mira feels sudden freedom) and is echoed at closure (the journey "only the beginning of many more traverses"). The timeframe triggers Mira's decision to board the ferry but does not tighten tactics or impose a live clock in middle beats; once the leash breaks, time becomes ambient twilight rather than tracked pressure. Setup and thematic closure mention allow low-mid band, but the element is swappable with "after the anchor lifts" or any threshold moment without altering escalation.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Motivation "to find where unused courage waits" is declared in setup, developed via the cave's "map of the inner self, charting paths to the bravery that had never been summoned," and restated at closure ("reclaimed the courage that had waited in silence"). It names the dominant stake but is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choices or friction between wants and costs. The desire drives the journey's frame yet lacks on-page collision with a competing want or visible price. Setup, middle thematic articulation, and closure assertion satisfy two gates, but the motivation remains abstract—replacing "unused courage" with "hidden strength" would not alter the plot structure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Tone "shoreline lullaby" is established in setup (village humming a shoreline lullaby, ferry's lantern glowing like a lullaby) and sustained through middle beats (guides' voices "low and rolling," sea's "gently persistent rhythm") to closure (sunrise and ferry guides' smile "echoed the lullaby she had sung all night"; sea's "endless lullaby"). Coherent through turns and modulates subtly from communal opening to solitary vigil to affirmed return, charging the final image with layered sonic texture. The tone is purposeful and irreplaceable—removing lullaby cadence would flatten the lyric cohesion—but it does not constrain a choice, capping the score below high band.</comment>
