<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The stationer remains almost entirely opaque: we see ornate description of his movements but no contradiction, genuine struggle, or embodied emotion. His motivation is told ("to collect the textures of different times") but never tested; no choice forecloses a path or reveals hierarchy of values. The piece reads as extended portraiture rather than a character under pressure making difficult decisions with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed past 120 words with dense figurative language obscuring who/where/when; this triggers the −0.3 penalty and Q3 cap at 7.0. The drive lens wavers between Accumulative/Textural (collecting textures, prismatic light patterns) and thematic meditation without teaching a stable pattern by midpoint. No meaningful closure: the final paragraph restates the opening premise ("invented histories," "refract," "chart") without a decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing with legible cost. The stationer walks deeper into the labyrinth ready to repeat the same action—a loop, not closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The bonsai labyrinth and fluorescent lamp offer vivid, specific imagery and the setting anchors the reflective mood effectively. However, spatial choreography remains vague (stone paths, corridors, a hut, silver birch mentioned but never choreographed into clear proximity or constraint). The environment never constrains a choice or meaningfully alters tactics; it serves as backdrop for description rather than pressure. This caps the score below the 9+ gate despite strong atmospheric texture.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>No discernible escalation or reversal. The stationer's goal (collect textures, write histories) is stated early and simply repeated in varied phrasing throughout; nothing narrows options, raises cost, or forces a trade-off. The ending announces readiness to continue the same action indefinitely ("ready to refract another day"), making the entire piece a static tableau. Even under an Accumulative lens, no density increase or pattern break reweights the stake—only synonym churn around the same premise.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The theme—"invented histories as bridges across time's chasm"—is articulated directly in the penultimate paragraph rather than emerging from concrete events and choices. The piece offers ambient meditation on refracting time and silence but no conceptual repricing with undeniable cost; the final image of walking "deeper into the bonsai corridors" simply restates the initial posture. The thematic statement in "he understood that invented histories were not lies but bridges" is explicit moralizing that replaces earned resonance, triggering the −0.5 to −0.8 penalty for thematic echo in the closing stretch.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The perceptual signature is highly stylized ("each leaf a careful inkstroke," "blue echo of yesterday, amber pulse of tomorrow") but consistent throughout, establishing a lyric register. However, the same elevated diction and parallel structures recur without modulation under pressure, creating a static tonal layer rather than voice that breathes with scene needs. Psychic distance remains stable third-person-limited with no head-hopping. The prose reads as authored voice rather than the stationer's embodied mind; filtration through character priorities is thin.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Persistent paraphrase loops and synonym churn across adjacent lines: "refract" appears in nearly every paragraph with minimal variation in function; "invented histories," "textures," "hum," and "battered notepad" are restated rather than advanced. Template cadence runs: "He would [verb]" structures repeat without taught pattern. Figurative density in most sentences ("bruised violet," "whispered verses," "inkstroke on a living page," "prism that refracted past and future") without escalation or payoff, triggering the overwriting penalty (−0.5). Mixed metaphor: light cannot be "refracted" by charting a hum (sound ≠ light path). These artifacts dull momentum and obscure causality, pushing the score into the 4–5 band and disallowing 9+ globally per the artifact cap.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The premise—solitary artisan collecting ephemeral textures in a symbolic landscape—follows a recognizable template (contemplative figure in liminal space recording the ineffable). The bonsai-labyrinth and fluorescent-lamp details offer specific imagery, but the emotional arc and thematic resolution are generic: the protagonist begins writing invented histories, continues writing them, and will keep writing them with no transformation. No bold structural risk or non-obvious synthesis; the piece reads as a stylized mood piece rather than a narrative with stakes and ingenuity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>The gilded-leaf stationer is present throughout but makes no decision that alters tactics or forecloses a path. He observes, walks, sits, writes, closes the notepad, and walks deeper—all passive or repetitive actions without conflict or cost. His choices do not create key turns; the story could proceed identically if he were replaced by any contemplative observer. Introduced early but ornamental; no causal pressure or closure linkage beyond being the named observer.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The battered notepad appears early ("Clutched in his hand") and recurs in multiple beats: he opens it to write, records observations, closes it feeling "the weight of collected textures," and it "collected new textures" each night. However, it never constrains a choice or evolves in function—it remains a passive repository for his recordings. The final closure image does not depend on the notepad; he walks deeper without it in hand. Functional across beats but swappable with any recording medium; no causal pressure or irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Invented histories" is named early and repeated throughout, but it operates as thematic label rather than a stake-shaping concept. The stationer writes them, they "grow like bonsai," they "sang softly," and "would be woven" into the town's voice—all told rather than dramatized. The concept does not change options, narrow tactics, or create friction; it is what he does, not what he must choose or sacrifice. Present as description but ornamental to plot structure; no middle development or cost tied to inventing versus recording truth.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Earnestly studious" is asserted early ("He was earnestly studious, his eyes scanning every mossy crevice") but never constrains or enables action with visible cost. The trait is label-only; we do not see him make a trade-off between scholarly precision and speed, or between detachment and emotional engagement. The attribute does not shape a beat's outcome or differentiate his choices from a casual observer's. Ornamental mention without causal work.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Refract" appears repeatedly as a verb describing his method ("refract that hum," "light refracted off moss," "refracted through the lanterns," "ready to refract another day") but does not drive major turns. The action is decorative and metaphorical; swapping it for "record," "translate," or "capture" would not alter the story's structure. No beat's outcome depends on the specific mechanics of refraction versus another observational method. Present throughout but functionally interchangeable; no escalation or closure participation tied to the act of refracting specifically.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>"Charting the faint hum in a fluorescent lamp at dawn" is mentioned once in the middle ("He would refract that hum…by charting the faint hum in a fluorescent lamp at dawn") and recurs as "the fluorescent lamp's ghost would hum, and he would still chart its song" near the end. However, the mechanics never shape an attempt, create friction, or alter tactics. The method is told, not enacted on the page; we do not see him use tools, make notations, or adjust his approach. Summary-only use, introduced mid-story, with no causal pressure. Missing middle development and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The "blooming labyrinth of bonsai forests on a mountaintop" is established early and provides vivid atmosphere. The bonsai "lean toward him," scatter light, and "inhale" in one personification beat. However, the labyrinth never constrains choice or supplies a resource that affects outcome; spatial choreography remains vague (he walks "along stone paths," sits "beside a silver birch," walks "deeper into corridors" without clear navigation or obstacle). The setting frames mood but does not pressure decisions. Functional as backdrop; no causal work or closure participation beyond ambient presence.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"After the town goes silent" is signaled early ("the town below had gone silent") and recurs ("Even as the town below remained mute," "when the town finally whispered again"). However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions or create urgency; the stationer's actions proceed at an unhurried, meditative pace with no clock pressure. The silence is a static backdrop rather than a countdown that narrows tactics. The ending suggests future continuation ("when the town finally whispered again") but no on-page cost tied to elapsed time. Functional mood-setter but replaceable; no live clock that alters moves.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"To collect the textures of different times" is stated explicitly ("His motivation was simple yet profound: to collect the textures of different times") and recurs in action beats (noting textures of wind, moss, silence, pine resin; "the weight of collected textures"). However, the desire is never conflicted or tested; no friction arises between the want to collect and a competing cost or obstacle. The motivation explains his behavior but does not create dramatic tension or force a trade-off. Functional but told-only; no on-page friction between wants and costs. Middle presence via repeated enactment, but the ending restates readiness to continue without sacrifice or reprice.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Incandescent restraint" is achieved through the prose's elevated, controlled lyricism and consistent restraint from overt drama ("bright enough to illuminate the void yet measured so the glow never blinded"). The tone is coherent throughout and does not break under the (absent) pressure. However, it remains static—no modulation that responds to escalation or charges the final image with new intensity. The tone fits the meditative concept but does not deepen or shift; the final paragraph maintains the same register as the opening. Coherent and purposeful but one-note; no tonal turn that reweights the stake. Eligible for mid-band given consistent execution, but lacks the modulation or closure charge required for higher scores.</comment>
