<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The translator's motivation ("to graft new meaning onto old wounds") is declared but never tested by an on-page choice with cost. Her "shrewdly innocent" trait appears only as a label in the opening. The child remains a passive prop under anesthetic throughout; no interaction forces a decision. Interiority consists of abstract metaphor ("lotus-hearted ache") rather than embodied contradiction or micro-choice under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation Test: WHO (translator), WHERE (atrium), WHEN (twilight, after anesthetic) anchor by ~120 words—waived. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural (mist/coral/notes accrue symbolic weight). Closure unit: the droplet onto the plaster is offered as Resonant Reconfiguration, but no decision, renunciation, or foreclosed path appears on the page; the translator "walks away feeling" is summary, not a dramatized change. Cost is asserted ("would not heal instantly") rather than shown. The anesthetic deepening and the child's passive acceptance provide no reversal or tightening that narrows options.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The mist-clad atrium and brain-coral vial are vividly rendered and recur across beats. The plaster cast appears late and remains a static prop; the translator never handles or manipulates the notes in action. Spatial choreography is minimal (translator on bench, child absent or asleep). The coral vial is lifted and placed beside the cast, but this gesture does not constrain a choice or alter tactics—it remains symbolic decoration.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("unknot the tangled narratives") is signaled early but never tested. The translator faces no opposition, dilemma, or cost; the child is asleep, the notes glow "faintly" and become legible without effort. No reversal or tightening occurs; the anesthetic deepening is a passive timer, not a pressure point that forces choice. The final "droplet" sealing is coincidental resolution with no prior setup or earned cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Theme of healing/grafting emerges from coral metaphor and translator's stated goal, but remains abstract. The final image (droplet on plaster) attempts resonance but is unearned by prior conflict. "Shared anxieties" as a concept is named repeatedly without dramatized particulars that test or complicate it. The phrase "lotus-hearted ache" recurs as a mood label rather than an insight earned through scene pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Single POV, stable distance, no head-hopping. Diction is consistent but elevated throughout ("pacific conflict-zone translator," "lotus-hearted ache"), bordering on ornamental lyricism that never modulates with pressure. The child does not speak; no dialogue to test naturalism or subtext. Perceptual signature is generic poetic filter rather than character-particular. Free-indirect style is clean but unvaried.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Overwriting is pervasive: nearly every sentence deploys metaphor or elevated diction ("twilight mist deepening into a dream-like veil," "porous lattice," "gentle tide"). Template cadence in the second half: "She [verb], [object]" structure repeats across six sentences. Paraphrase loop: "The brain coral fragment vibrated faintly, as if acknowledging the shared anxieties now bound within its porous lattice, ready to grow stronger" restates the coral's symbolic role already established. Filter-verb stack ("She whispered back... her voice a gentle tide, promising that...") in peak beat. Figurative density without pattern-teaching or payoff triggers −0.6; template cadence −0.5; loop −0.2; artifacts touch closure beat, disqualifying 9+ globally and adding −0.3.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Premise (translator decrypts trauma via symbolic object) is not fresh and leans on stock metaphor (coral = resilience, scars = wounds). The anesthetic-timer and glowing-notes devices are convenient rather than earned. No bold risk or synthesis; execution reads as median literary-fiction template. Transformation test fails: swap "brain coral" for "amber" or "sea glass" and the arc is unchanged.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>Present throughout but makes no decision that alters tactics or stakes. Observation without agency; the translator receives glowing notes passively and "walks away feeling" in summary.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Appears early (vial lifted, placed beside cast) and in the final beat (droplet onto plaster). Two touches across beats, but neither constrains choice or enables a tactic under pressure. Static symbolic prop; swappable with any talismanic object.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Named repeatedly ("shared anxieties") as theme, but never dramatized in a choice or conflict. The refugees' whispers are backdrop; no on-page moment where competing anxieties force a tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>Label-only mention in opening sentence ("shrewdly innocent gleam"). No subsequent action demonstrates the trait or costs it imposes.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The unknotting is described ("She traced the looping letters... unknotting the fear-laden knots") but not enacted. No puzzle-solving beats, no failed attempts. Swappable with "translate," "interpret," or "decipher."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Notes on the cast appear mid-story; decryption is asserted ("each illegible swirl turning into a cipher") rather than shown. Mechanics are vague; the notes "glow faintly" and become legible without effort or cost. Does not shape attempts.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Atrium and mist frame the scene and recur in the ending ("mist rose higher"). Twilight timing anchors when. However, setting does not constrain choice or supply resources; the translator could unknot notes anywhere. Atmospheric rather than tactical.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Anesthetic kicks in mid-story and "deepens" toward the end, but no ticking clock alters decisions. The child is passive throughout; time does not tighten tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>Stated in the opening ("to graft new meaning onto old wounds") and echoed at closure. Desire is told, not tested by friction or cost. No want-versus-need conflict dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Phrase "lotus-hearted ache" appears twice (mid and end), but tone is uniform lyric melancholy throughout. No modulation with pressure; no tonal shift that charges the final image.</comment>
