<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to protect cultural memory is clear, but her interiority reads as abstract catalog rather than embodied contradiction—she "possessed an empirically whimsical mind that catalogued dreams as if they were weather charts" labels rather than dramatizes. The translation task (jade vine → tributaries, orchid pulse → festivals) arrives as summary exposition without visible struggle or competing impulses acting simultaneously. The seed's awakening feels declared by incantation rather than earned through prior micro-choices that reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. Emotional progression remains smooth and illustrative; no genuine flaws complicate her resolve.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (Mara, the ridge, pre-monsoon window) arrive cleanly within the first third. The piece establishes an Accumulative/Textural lens: dream fragments accumulate, each translated symbol adds density, and the final sprouting reweights the opening premise. One meaningful deepening occurs when Mara names the symbols and the lanterns intensify, narrowing the path to awakening. However, the closure—"the seed had indeed wakened"—lands as assertion rather than a dramatized reversal with on-page cost; the "luminous doubt" mentioned two lines earlier is rhetorically invoked but not felt as a foreclosed option or visible price paid. The monsoon's arrival is promised but not tested, so the timeframe's constraint remains potential rather than realized.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The ridge setting is vivid (jade vines, granite, orchids pulsing with sunrise colors) and filtered through Mara's empirical-whimsical lens, but it functions as backdrop rather than constraint. The lanterns' glow intensifies in response to her translations, charging the final image, which lifts the score into mid-6s. Spatial choreography (camp beside ridge, woven mat, satchel) is clear. The "scent of old stories" rising toward clouds is a purposeful reprise of earlier "citrus and rain," but the ridge does not pressure a tactical choice—Mara's translations succeed without environmental friction.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—awakening the seed before the monsoon—is signaled early. However, the escalation reads as a checklist (name jade vine, orchid, petals) without a live reversal or tightening that narrows options. The "luminous doubt" arrives two beats before success and is immediately converted into "the engine of her resolve," defusing tension rather than forcing a trade-off. No on-page cost alters Mara's tactics; the seed sprouts after the incantation without resistance, and the monsoon remains offstage, so the timeframe's pressure is asserted but not tested. The resolution is a fulfillment rather than a choice with visible price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The theme of collective memory as living archive emerges concretely through the knowledge fruit and dream pool. The final image—petals as repositories of forgotten chants, the ridge exhaling old stories—reweights the opening premise without overt moralizing. However, the incantation "Let the seed awaken, let the ridge remember, let the rain hear our story" edges toward thematic echo, and the phrase "even empirical whims could be nurtured by shared dreams" reads as a summary statement rather than earned resonance. The piece resists simplistic resolution, but the absence of dramatic cost keeps the thematic answer more illustrative than interrogative.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization is stable; Mara's perceptual signature (empirically whimsical, cataloging dreams as weather charts) establishes a distinct filter. Diction is controlled and elevated ("translucent realm," "luminous doubt"), appropriate to the voice and world. However, under the pressure of the climactic translation, the prose does not modulate or compress—syntax remains lyric and even-paced throughout. No dialogue appears, so those bullets are not applicable. The phrase "a balance she vowed to keep as the seed's story unfolded" at closure reads as future-facing summary rather than present-tense embodied perception, a minor distance slip.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout ("lanterns that hummed," "petals falling onto a still pond," "leaves shimmering like silvered pages"), but most images cohere without contradiction. However, the climactic passage stacks metaphor without pause: "luminous doubt," "bright uncertainty," "engine of her resolve," "wind of thought," and "scent of old stories" appear within three sentences, diluting clarity at a peak beat. Template cadence appears in the middle third: "One fragment glowed brighter: a memory… She realized the seed… The method of waking… Mara began to name…" uses similar stems across four consecutive units. Paraphrase loop: "the seed would only sprout before the monsoon arrives" and "the monsoon's first heavy breath could drown the fragile shoots" restate the same temporal constraint without added pressure. Apply −0.6 for template cadence, −0.3 for figurative density at closure, −0.2 for paraphrase loop; total artifact penalty −1.1, lowering from a baseline ~7.4 to 6.3.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The premise—reality checkers who test myths, a seed awakened by dream translation—offers a fresh synthesis. However, the execution trends toward allegory with transparent stand-ins (knowledge fruit = ideas, ridge = cultural archive) that lack narrative friction. The translation task (jade vine → tributaries, orchid → festivals) reads as label-assignment rather than a non-obvious interpretive leap. The monsoon timeframe and "luminous doubt" are promising stakes, but neither is tested with a specific cost that grows from character flaw or world constraint. The piece commits to its lyric mode, but the resolution—seed sprouts, ridge exhales—feels inevitable without hindsight surprise or earned complexity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Mara's role as reality checker is established early and her translation task (middle) drives the awakening (closure), satisfying all three gates. However, her decisions are illustrative rather than constrained by competing pressures—no on-page moment where her empirical or whimsical impulse forecloses an alternative path. The character is present and functional but replaceable with any earnest scholar. Early signal +0.5, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +0.9, minus swappability −0.8, minus ornamental observation −0.5, minus no visible cost −0.6 = ~4.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The knowledge fruit seed is introduced in paragraph four (setup), handled in Mara's satchel (middle touch), and sprouts at closure (all three gates). It appears in at least three distinct beats: receipt, translation task, and awakening. However, its properties are asserted rather than tested—no moment where the seed's demands constrain Mara's method or force a tactical shift. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.2, minus swappability −0.5 (any magical seed could function similarly), minus no cost connection −0.5, minus ornamental middle mention −0.3 = ~6.7.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Collective memory is named early (paragraph ten) and the shared dreaming pool provides the method for awakening (middle), and the closure states the seed will be "a living conduit" for it (all three gates). However, its mechanics are told rather than dramatized—no on-page moment where collective memory contradicts or complicates Mara's individual interpretation. It shapes the task but not tactics under pressure. Early signal +0.4, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.8, minus summary-only use −0.7, minus swappability −0.4 (any archive/tradition concept could substitute) = ~5.9.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Empirically whimsical" is introduced in paragraph three (setup) and colors Mara's perceptual filter (middle), but it never constrains or enables a choice with visible cost. The trait is label-only; we do not see an empirical impulse clash with a whimsical one in a way that narrows options. It modulates voice but does not drive a beat. Early signal +0.4, one beat (perceptual filter) +0.4, minus label-only −0.8, minus swappability −0.5 (any curious scholar works), minus no cost −0.6 = ~3.2.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Waken" is signaled early (paragraph six: "coax the seed awake"), structures the middle translation task, and the sprouting is the closure image (all three gates). The action is irreplaceable—removing awakening would break the arc. However, the awakening itself is achieved by incantation rather than a choice that forecloses an alternative, so causal pressure is moderate. Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.6, high specificity +0.6, minus no visible cost on tactics −0.6 = ~7.1.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Through interpreted dreams" is introduced in paragraph seven (setup), the shared dreaming pool and translation work form the middle method (development), and the final image references the dream fragments (closure participation). All three gates satisfied. However, the method is summary-told ("translate each symbolic image into a concrete truth") rather than dramatized with friction—no moment where the interpretation itself is uncertain or costly. Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.7, minus summary-only −0.7, minus swappability −0.4 (any symbolic task could substitute) = ~5.3.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The ancient ridge in bloom is introduced in paragraph four (setup), houses Mara's camp and the seed (middle), and "stood radiant" at closure (all three gates). The ridge supplies the sensory texture (jade vines, orchids) that Mara translates, so it enables the method. However, it does not constrain a choice—Mara could perform the task anywhere. The ridge charges the final image ("releasing a scent of old stories"), which lifts the score. Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, minus postcard description −0.5, minus no tactical constraint −0.6 = ~6.2.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Before the monsoon arrives" is stated in paragraph six (setup) and the gathering clouds bookend the closure (closure participation), but no middle beat dramatizes the time pressure altering Mara's tactics. The monsoon remains potential threat rather than live clock. Two gates (setup, closure mention) allow eligibility to ~6.0, but the timeframe is told-only without escalation. Early signal +0.5, closure cameo +0.4, minus no middle development (gate missing) −0.8, minus told-only −0.6 = ~4.6, capped at 4.6 per missing middle-development gate.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The motivation to protect cultural memory is stated in paragraph five (elders' trust) and paragraph twenty-four ("to protect cultural memory she must confront the possibility of loss"), and the closure fulfills it (all three gates). However, the desire is asserted rather than dramatized through conflicting wants—no moment where protecting memory costs Mara something she values equally. Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.9, minus told-only friction −0.7, minus swappability −0.4 (any preservationist motive works) = ~5.7.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Luminous doubt" is introduced in paragraph twenty-three and named again in the final paragraph, forming a purposeful reprise that charges the closure image. The tone modulates subtly—early passages are confident catalog, the ending pairs hope with storm weight. However, the tone shift is asserted ("luminous doubt," "bright uncertainty") rather than enacted through syntax or rhythm change. Late first appearance (final third) −0.7, lyric reprise +1.2, closure linkage +0.9, coherence through turns +0.6, minus static assertion −0.5 = ~6.4.</comment>
