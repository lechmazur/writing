<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is asserted rather than tested through contradictory pressures. Her actions—tracing squares, aligning phrases—read as procedural steps without embodied emotion or internal conflict. The final success arrives without visible cost or foreclosed options; she "steps back" with "quiet pride" in a moment that feels decorative rather than earned. Interiority remains at the surface with stock exploratory enthusiasm never complicated by doubt or sacrifice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The closure unit—harnessing the luminance—occurs on the page but lacks felt cost; the ship "hummed anew" and the crew "felt a warm presence" without any price paid or option foreclosed. Orientation is delayed: who/where/when coalesce slowly across the opening, and the hopscotch board materializes abruptly in the middle third without prior anchoring. Causality is weak: the phrasebook clues and chalk-drawn pattern succeed immediately with no resistance, reading as convenient discovery rather than earned breakthrough. Under a hybrid lens (leaning Accumulative), the piece needed one tightening or deepening that narrowed options; instead, every step advances smoothly without friction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The airship and its brass hull, copper pipes, and lanterns supply vivid sensory anchors. The hopscotch board and phrasebook are concrete objects, yet they function as plot tokens rather than constraints—Lira interacts with them once each without spatial friction or evolving difficulty. Spatial choreography is legible (cabin, deck, portholes) but static; the environment does not pressure her choices or charge the final image beyond atmospheric decoration.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—charting luminance to guide future voyages—is declared but never tested. No reversal or tightening occurs; Lira's phrasebook translation and chalk ritual succeed on first attempt without complication. The "stray halo intensified" and "wrapped around the copper" with no resistance, trade-off, or visible price. Pressure remains flat from setup to resolution, and the ending grants success without agency-driven cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Theme of discovery through pattern-seeking emerges but is stated rather than embodied: "to chart the next great discovery, she must first understand" reads as thesis. The hopscotch board and polyglot phrasebook function as symbolic set-dressing without constraining choice or accumulating fresh meaning at closure. The final image—starling murmurations "acknowledging the ship's newfound glow"—gestures at resonance but remains ornamental, offering no reweighting of prior material or non-literal answer to a lived question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited with stable focalization; no head-hopping. Diction tilts elevated ("sociable isolation," "stranded luminance," "polyglot's phrasebook") in ways that sometimes clash with immediate scene needs—peak beats carry metaphorical density ("living constellations," "pocket of stranded luminance") rather than urgent perception. Perceptual signature is generic scholarly wonder without character-specific bias. No dialogue present to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Heavy figurative layering ("sea of clouds," "living constellations," "chorus," "copper veins hidden beneath the deck," "silver threads that wrapped around the copper like vines") appears in most sentences without pattern-teaching or payoff, reducing clarity and momentum. Paraphrase loops: "She believed that such a glow… could become a beacon" restates the prior setup without added pressure. Template cadence: multiple sentences open with "She [verb]" across contiguous lines. Register drifts into elevated abstraction ("sociable isolation of lone scholars") that sits uneasily with the map-apprentice POV. Information density is low; many lines redescribe rather than advance.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The premise—airship cartographer decoding light via hopscotch and polyglot phrasebook—assembles familiar steampunk and puzzle-discovery tropes without transformation. The phrasebook clues (Latin, Sumerian, Swahili) feel like ornamental global nods rather than lived linguistic friction. Emotional arc and conflict would function identically if she were decoding star charts in a library. No risk-taking in structure or stance; the piece follows a smooth discovery template to a warm, obstacle-free conclusion.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Lira is present throughout but makes no high-stakes choice that alters tactics or forecloses a path. Her curiosity is asserted ("diligently curious") but never tested by competing pressures. Observation dominates; decision work is minimal and consequence-free.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The phrasebook dog-ear appears in two beats (reading margins, applying phrases to the hopscotch squares) with minimal causal pressure. Its clues enable the ritual but do not constrain or complicate; any annotated text could serve the same function. No reweighted meaning at closure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Stranded luminance is the object of discovery and is visualized ("faint halo," "silver threads"). It shapes the goal but does not constrain tactics—Lira's ritual succeeds immediately. The concept appears in setup, middle, and ending, meeting the gate threshold, but its mechanics remain vague and its capture carries no cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Diligently curious" is a label that describes Lira's inheritance and approach but does not constrain or enable a visible trade-off. Curiosity leads her to note patterns, but no scene shows curiosity forcing a difficult choice or exacting a price.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Note" is the dominant verb across the story: Lira notes light patterns, notes the sequence, records observations in her journal. The action structures beats and drives the arc from observation to harnessing. However, noting itself is passive and consequence-free; major turns trace to her ritual (chalk, phrases) rather than the act of notation alone.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The hopscotch board is signaled mid-story, used as a spatial map for aligning cryptic symbols and lantern glow, and its pattern guides the chalk ritual that completes the arc. The method is specific and shapes the middle and ending beats. Mechanics are asserted but not tested—Lira's interpretation succeeds on first try without constraint or complication.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The antique airship frames every scene and supplies sensory detail (brass hull, copper pipes, cabin, deck, portholes). Setting provides atmosphere and a platform for the luminance project but does not pressure Lira's choices or supply resources that alter outcome. Micro-setting potential (the board, the lanterns) is present but underused.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>Starling murmurations appear as scenic backdrop in three passages (outside portholes, as metaphor for light patterns, acknowledging the glow at the end). They do not tighten decisions, function as a clock, or alter tactics. The timeframe is atmospheric rather than pressuring.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Lira's desire to chart the next great discovery is declared early and motivates the luminance project. However, it is told rather than dramatized in a conflicted choice. No friction appears between this want and competing costs, fears, or needs; the motivation drives setup and closure but lacks visible struggle.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Sociable isolation" is named once ("the cabin was filled with the sociable isolation of lone scholars") and echoed in the closing phrase ("quiet pride that balanced the sociable isolation of her solitary work"). The tone is asserted rather than modulated through pressure; no charged shift occurs. The phrase reads as decorative framing rather than lived tension.</comment>
