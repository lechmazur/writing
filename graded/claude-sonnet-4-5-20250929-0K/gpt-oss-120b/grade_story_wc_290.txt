<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The claustrophobic explorer is labeled rather than enacted through micro-choices under pressure. Internal contradiction appears as "prudently adventurous" label without dramatized tension between caution and daring in pivotal moments. The emotional arc from claustrophobia to freedom is asserted through abstract philosophy ("rebellion against the limits he once knew") rather than embodied in specific action. The final beat's "carrying the mutiny of space within his heart" reads as placeholder sentiment disconnected from prior struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation debt: who/where/when remain vague past 120 words—"the explorer" is a role, not a name; "shadowed nexus" lacks concrete anchors until the organ appears. Lens ambiguity persists: causal gestures (compass triggers passage) compete with accumulative mood-building without teaching a pattern. Closure disperses across multiple micro-resolutions (key retrieved, door opened, garden revealed, vow made) rather than landing in one decisive image with legible cost; the "mutiny of space" remains metaphorical decoration. The Cost proof test fails: no exact line shows what the protagonist forfeited or risked at the ending beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The organ and cavern are vivid as atmosphere but do not constrain a middle choice—the compass solves spatial problems without the environment resisting. The luminescent fungi garden arrives late as reward rather than obstacle. Spatial choreography weakens when "the cavern walls quivered" and "passage unfolded" without legible mechanics tying compass geometry to stone yielding. The 9+ gate fails: no environment, body, tool, or object constrains a choice or charges the final image with felt cost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("uncover a vital key") is signaled but never tested by a live cost—no fork where retrieval demands sacrifice. The "spatial mutiny" reads as effect rather than escalating pressure; the passage opens on cue without forcing a trade-off. Claustrophobia is told ("whispering that the tunnel would crush him") but does not alter tactics or narrow options on the page. Band guardrail: the tightening does not foreclose a live option or force visible price, keeping score below 8.0.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Theme ("rebellion... against the forgetting of stories") is stated in the penultimate paragraph rather than earned through image and action. The compass-as-symbol and key-as-symbol are labeled ("not a weapon but a symbol") instead of letting objects accumulate pressure. Thematic Echo penalty applies: "the rebellion he had sparked was not against stone, but against the forgetting of stories that bind humanity" is prompt-like thesis in the final third (−0.6). The ending disperses into multiple declarative summaries rather than offering one resonant, non-literal image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Register drifts into elevated diction ("bittersweet resonance," "wistful rebellion") that clashes with the urgency of claustrophobic exploration. Perceptual signature is generic: the explorer notices mood and metaphor rather than tool-feel or breath-count under pressure. Free indirect style is clean, but the voice lacks character-specific lexicon—"prudently adventurous" and "transfixing his senses" read as narrator overlay. Psychic distance flattens when peak stress (entering the new corridor) is narrated in the same ornate cadence as calm exposition.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Overwriting pervades high-pressure beats: "transfix," "mutiny," "reverberation," "constellation" stack figurative weight in most sentences without pattern-teaching or payoff (−0.7). Paraphrase loops: "Each step was a silent mutiny, the walls yielding space to his will" repeats the compass's earlier spatial control without advancing pressure. Template cadence: multiple paragraphs open "He [verb]" without variation. Stock metaphors: "walls close like a familiar wound," "blossoming map." Filter-verb stacks in the organ-activation beat ("seemed to sigh," "seemed to rewrite") dull immediacy. Line-artifact penalty pack totals approximately −1.4; artifacts touch the closure beat (final paragraph's "felt the weight," "understood," "realized"), triggering the disallow-9+ global cap and capping high-band entries at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Core premise (explorer uses mystical compass to reshape space and find lost key) follows a familiar template: magical object solves spatial puzzle without personal cost. The organ and compass feel like checklist fulfillment rather than organic synthesis. Transformation test fails: swap names and setting, the emotional arc (overcoming fear through metaphorical rebellion) remains unchanged. The "spatial mutiny" concept is repeated as label without fresh dramatization—"staging its own quiet rebellion," "silent mutiny," "carrying the mutiny of space"—creating thematic echo rather than specific invention.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Claustrophobic explorer: Setup clear (opening line), middle beats show him advancing despite fear ("his prudently adventurous spirit urged him forward"), closure involves emergence. Two gates met (setup + payoff). However, claustrophobia does not force a visible trade-off; he moves forward on declaration rather than dramatized cost. Mid-band: present across beats but swappable trait without specific constraint shaping tactics.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Blueprint drafting compass point: Setup (introduced mid-first-third on altar), middle beat (triggers spatial change via incantation), closure participation (needle points toward exit, "reminder that even the tightest corridors can be redrawn"). Three gates met. Causal pressure: enables passage opening (+0.9). Closure linkage: reappears with shifted meaning (+0.7). Swappability friction: "ancient device" could be generic talisman (−0.5). Total neighborhood ~6.1.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Spatial mutiny: Setup absent (phrase first appears mid-story as descriptor). Middle beat: compass causes "spatial mutiny" effect (walls quiver, passage unfolds). Payoff: "carrying the mutiny of space within his heart" is metaphorical cameo. Two gates met (development + payoff, missing setup; cap 4.6). Decorative phrasing (−0.3) and swappability with "spatial transformation" (−0.5) lower score. Neighborhood ~3.8.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>Prudently adventurous: Setup (opening paragraph label), middle mention ("his prudently adventurous spirit urged him forward"), no closure participation. Two gates (setup + development). Label-only trait without on-page tradeoff showing prudence constraining adventure or vice versa (−0.6). Missing closure participation cap 2.8. Neighborhood ~2.6.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Transfix: Setup mention ("transfix the void"), middle beat ("cascade of organ tones... transfixing his senses"), closure absent. Two gates (setup + development; missing payoff cap 2.8 for closure absence). However, the organ's transfixing effect enables emotional shift mid-journey (+0.5 causal). "Transfix" as verb is specific but could swap for "mesmerize" (−0.4). Lyric-resonance allowance applies: early seed returns with reweighted sensory charge, lifting above base cap to ~5.8.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Through the reverberation of a lonely church organ: Setup (organ introduced early, "dominated the nave"), middle beat (incantation triggers "single note rose, trembling the air," drawing compass into motion), closure ("organ's final chord faded," "reverberating organ pipe that still sang faintly" shapes his vow). Three gates met. Causal pressure: organ activates compass mechanism (+1.1). Closure linkage: final chord frames his vow (+0.9). Specificity: "church organ" mechanics (pipes, notes, hymn memory) are irreplaceable (+0.6). Total neighborhood ~6.4.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Shadowed nexus under starlight: Setup (opening line), middle use (cavern setting throughout), closure participation (emerges "into the starlit night," starlight bookends). Three gates met. However, "nexus" is vague anchor; specific tactics unaffected by starlight or shadow (−0.7). Postcard description: "starlit night" and "sky's cold expanse" are atmospheric without constraining choice. Early signal (+0.4) and closure reprise (+0.5) lift from base. Neighborhood ~4.8.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>During the fallow period: Setup (second sentence), no middle pressure (time does not tighten decisions), closure absent (no clock reference in ending). One gate only (setup; missing development and payoff). "Fallow period" allows him to "linger" but imposes no visible deadline or seasonal constraint shaping tactics (−0.8). Ornamental mention (−0.5). Cap for missing two gates and lack of causal work: neighborhood ~2.1.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>To uncover a vital key lost to time: Setup (stated early: "not for treasure, but to uncover a vital key"), middle beats (compass used to reveal passage, key sought), closure (key lifted, used in lock, garden revealed, vow to share). Three gates met. Causal pressure: goal drives compass use and corridor navigation (+1.2). Closure linkage: key retrieval and use anchor final sequence (+1.1). Friction: desire is declared without conflicted micro-choice showing cost of pursuit (told-only −0.6). Total neighborhood ~6.7.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Wistful rebellion: Tone labeled late ("wistful rebellion against the limits he once knew" near end). Setup weak (not established by first third). Modulation absent: ornate register persists uniformly across stress and calm. Closure tone: final paragraph declares "wistful" without image embodying that specific bittersweet charge. Single static mood applied as label (−0.7). Late first appearance in final third (−0.8). Does not charge final image with felt tone shift. Neighborhood ~4.3.</comment>
