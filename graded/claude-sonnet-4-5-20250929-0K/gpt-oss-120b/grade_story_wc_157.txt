<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Lysander is presented through label-heavy abstraction ("charming rogue scholar," "candidly cryptic verses") rather than contradictory impulses dramatized under pressure. His motivation to guard his "spark of defiance" is told as metaphor without embodied stakes or micro-choices that foreclose paths with visible cost. Dr. Mirabel's pivot from scientist to protector arrives without prior contradiction or earned causality. The greenhouse club members emerge as collective gesture rather than individuated agents, flattening what could have been a crucible of status or trust.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed past 120 words—no clear "when" anchor, and "after thoughts become taxable" remains a conceptual backdrop rather than a dramatized constraint shaping the present scene. The story offers sequential elaboration (seed planted → whispers → Dr. Mirabel enters → club emerges → alliance forms) without a meaningful tightening or reversal that narrows options. Closure reads as expansion and alliance rather than a decisive change or renunciation with legible cost; the final image promises future rebellion but does not land a felt price on the page. The drive lens appears Accumulative/Textural, yet no cadence shift or density break reweights the dominant stake at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The greenhouse setting supplies vivid sensory texture (beetles, moths, metallic echo, moss, marigolds) and the gourd seed functions as a recurring focal object. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or force a tactical shift; spatial choreography remains vague (where Lysander stands relative to the vents, seedlings, Dr. Mirabel's entry point), and no detail alters the outcome. The "community gardens that dotted the city" are mentioned but never grounded in concrete proximity or access that pressures the scene.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake—protecting the "spark of defiance"—is signaled early but remains abstract and never tested by a live on-page dilemma that forces a trade-off. No reversal or tightening narrows options; Dr. Mirabel's arrival could threaten exposure, yet she immediately aligns without conflict. The resolution is collaborative expansion rather than earned agency with visible cost. Coincidence (Mirabel's curiosity aligning) resolves tension rather than complicating it.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Theme of rebellion against thought taxation is stated rather than emerged from concrete choices with visible consequence. The "living cipher" and "secret language club" function as prompt-echo labels without irony or counter-reading. The final image ("the next warp would come with the next dawn") offers cyclical promise but not a non-literal reweighting of prior material. Lysander articulates the thematic premise in line six ("after thoughts become taxable…"), triggering a thematic echo deduction of −0.4.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping, and the narration maintains an elevated, metaphor-dense register throughout. However, voice lacks perceptual signature—Lysander's way of noticing is generic rather than character-specific, and diction ("candidly cryptic," "converging chaos," "luminous thread") reads as prompt-derived rather than idiomatic. Dr. Mirabel's interior is withheld, yet her decision pivot is asserted without the micro-thought that would earn the shift. Dialogue is absent, so those bullets are not applied.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>High metaphor density without pattern-teaching or payoff ("metronome that reminded the hidden listeners of the rhythm of revolt," "kaleidoscope of fragrant, humming possibilities") obscures causality and dulls momentum. Paraphrase loops appear: lines 9–10 restate the seed's chant spiraling and converging without added pressure. Template cadence runs in the final third ("They whispered back… he welcomed it… they cultivated… the club blossomed…") with identical stems across four sentences. Filter-verb stacks and synonym churn ("warp," "converging chaos," "stitched," "reweights") reduce clarity. Applying artifact penalties: −0.6 baseline, escalated to −1.0 for spread across multiple beats including closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The core premise—secret resistance via coded seedlings—reads as a familiar rebellion-against-thought-control template without a fresh angle grounded in specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The "gourd rattle seed" and "secret language club" function as ornamental labels rather than constraints that generate inevitable turns. The greenhouse-as-archive ending echoes similar resistance narratives without transformation. Applying derivative premise adjustment of −0.8 within Q8.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Lysander is introduced early (line 2) and appears in multiple beats, but his decisions are told rather than dramatized (he "scattered," "watched," "felt," "welcomed"). No on-page choice alters tactics or forecloses a path with cost. The "charming rogue scholar" label is ornamental; his agency is passive observation. Gates: setup present, development label-only, closure cameo. Caps at 4.6 for weak middle development; label-only trait and summary-only involvement each −0.3; swappability −0.4. Final: 3.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The gourd rattle seed appears in lines 2, 8, 9, 13, and 22 across distinct beats: initial brushing, scattering among marigolds, whispers rising, cracking open with seeds spilling, and final reverberation promising the next warp. It drives the chant that summons the Loom and shapes the closure image. Gates: setup, development (enables the whisper chant), and closure (final reverberation) all present. Causal pressure +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, beat involvement (three beats) +1.4. Base 3.0 + 3.3 = 6.3, rounded down to 6.1.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The secret language club (the Loom) is named in line 4, elaborated as communicating through seedling spirals, and its members emerge in line 14 to whisper back. It frames expectation early and participates in the closure alliance, but does not constrain an on-page choice or narrow options. Gates: setup, weak middle (described but not used), closure (members present). Early signal +0.5, closure linkage +0.7, ornamental description −0.7, swappability −0.5. Base 3.0 + 0.0 = 3.0; strong closure participation lifts to 4.8.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Candidly cryptic" appears once in line 3 as a label for Lysander's verses; no on-page action demonstrates the trait constraining or enabling a choice with visible cost. Gates: setup only, no development or closure use. Late first-third mention −0.3, label-only −0.3, swappability −0.8. Base 3.0 − 1.4 = 1.6; minimal setup presence lifts slightly to 2.1.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Warp" recurs in lines 4, 9, 15, and 22, shaping perception and the final promise. It is tied to the spirals, the ambient air chant, the greenhouse transformation, and the closing line. Gates: setup, development (warp the greenhouse), closure (next warp promised). Early signal +0.6, beat involvement (three touches) +1.4, closure linkage +1.0, specificity +0.5. Base 3.0 + 3.5 = 6.5; ornamental recurrence without forcing a tactical choice −1.1. Final: 5.4.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Joining community gardens to plant message patterns is introduced in line 7, with marigold-row planting in line 8 and expansion into city plots in line 18. The method enables the network but does not shape an on-page attempt with visible friction. Gates: setup, weak development (mentioned), closure (expanded). Early signal +0.5, closure linkage +0.8, ornamental middle −0.6, swappability −0.6. Base 3.0 + 0.1 = 3.1; strong closure expansion lifts to 4.3.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The entomologist's greenhouse anchors the entire scene from line 1, supplies beetles/moths/glass/moss/vents as sensory texture, and becomes "a living cipher" and "living archive" in the closure. It does not constrain a tactical choice but charges the final image as the container of rebellion. Gates: setup, development (ambient setting), closure (archive image). Early anchor +0.8, closure linkage +1.4, beat involvement +0.9, ornamental middle −0.5. Base 3.0 + 2.6 = 5.6; strong closure charge lifts to 6.8.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"After thoughts become taxable" is named in line 6 as backstory context but never materializes as a live constraint that tightens decisions or alters tactics in the present scene. No tax collector appears, no deadline looms, no on-page cost is paid. Gates: setup (backstory), no development, no closure use. Ornamental mention −0.6, swappability −0.7, summary-only −0.4. Base 3.0 − 1.7 = 1.3; thematic frame presence lifts slightly to 2.6.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Standing guard over the "spark of defiance" is stated in line 5, repeated in line 14 ("defiant spark"), and affirmed in line 20 ("spark safe"). It frames Lysander's goal but is not tested by a dilemma that forces a trade-off with visible cost. Gates: setup, weak development (told desire), closure (affirmed safe). Early signal +0.6, closure linkage +0.8, ornamental desire without friction −0.8, swappability −0.5. Base 3.0 + 0.1 = 3.1; strong closure affirmation lifts to 5.7.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Converging chaos" is named in lines 15 and 16, with related imagery ("restless buzz," "kaleidoscope," "storm of colors and scents") throughout. Tone is consistent and modulates subtly from hum to climax to promise, charging the final image of cyclical rebellion. Gates: setup (restless hum), development (kaleidoscope), closure (thriving chaos/promise). Beat involvement +0.9, closure linkage +1.2, cadence modulation +0.6, label repetition −0.3. Base 3.0 + 2.4 = 5.4; strong closure charge lifts to 5.9.</comment>
