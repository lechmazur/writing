<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Marlowe is given a clear motivation and observational method, but his internal experience remains largely external and poetic rather than embodied. The "investigate" arc proceeds without visible friction, contradiction, or cost-driven micro-choices. His final gesture (placing the flower, lighting the lamp) reads as symbolic completion rather than a decision that forecloses a live option. The lone keeper's isolation is declared and ornamented but not tested by competing impulses or genuine struggle on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates lyric images (gaps in the tide, the flower, the lamp) toward a final reconfiguration where Marlowe "gives voice to a solitary gesture" and feels "truly seen." Orientation anchors (lighthouse keeper, opal dock, twilight) arrive early. However, the closure effect—Marlowe's lighter heart and the promise "no one… will ever be lost to oblivion"—lacks demonstrable cost: no path is foreclosed, no relationship altered, no tactical price paid on the page. The cost remains asserted rather than felt or visible, preventing higher-band entry.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The opal dock, mist, twilight palette, and lighthouse are vividly rendered and filter perception through Marlowe's lonely vigil. The dried Edelweiss constrains his investigation and charges the final image when he aligns it "with the longest lull of the sea." Spatial choreography (dock, tower, water) is coherent. Setting detail is selective and purposeful, meeting the 9+ test by using the recurring flower and dock surface to constrain choice and charge closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—decoding the stranger's gesture—is signaled early, but escalation under the Accumulative lens requires density increase or pattern break with cost. Marlowe's observation of tide-gaps and whisper to the wind proceed without visible friction, competing options, or tactical trade-offs. The final alignment of the flower is a symbolic gesture, not a tightening that forecloses a path or forces a choice with felt consequence. The "softly persistent" attribute recurs but does not visibly narrow options or impose cost at the closure beat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme—loneliness as canvas, memory as witness—emerges through recurring images (the flower, the gaps, the lamp) rather than direct statement. The Edelweiss and tide-gaps shift meaning across beats, from "borrowed memory" to "beacon for any future soul." However, the ending offers an asserted promise ("no one… will ever be lost to oblivion") rather than a resonant, non-literal reconfiguration earned by prior particulars. The final paragraph edges toward moralizing ("quiet comfort of being truly seen") without irony or complication, preventing 9+ eligibility.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV remains stable; perceptual signature (bruised lavender, opal surface, brittle petals) is consistent and poetic. Psychic distance is controlled. However, diction converges around "softly persistent" (three uses), "borrowed memory" (four uses), and elevated phrases ("hollowed sigh," "invisible ink") that read as thematic assertion rather than Marlowe's interior idiom. No dialogue on the page. Voice is distinct but leans lyric-decorative rather than inhabiting the keeper's mind under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Figurative language is dense and often vivid ("bruised lavender," "opal surface reflected… isolation"), but synonym churn and template cadence appear: "softly persistent" (×3), "borrowed memory/memories" (×4), "gaps" (×6). Paraphrase loops: "The flower seemed softly persistent…" echoed by "…the flower's softly persistent spirit" and "a softly persistent echo." Adjacent sentences in the middle third repeat the structure "He [verb], [gerund clause]…" across multiple beats. These artifacts dull immediacy and information density. Apply baseline −0.8 for loops and template cadence, preventing 9+ eligibility globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The core synthesis—lonely keeper decodes a stranger's floral message via tide-gaps—offers a lyric premise, but the execution leans on prompt labels ("borrowed memories," "softly persistent") without transforming them into irreplaceable story logic. The tide-gap observation method and Edelweiss alignment are specific yet remain ornamental: swapping "gaps" for "currents" or "edelweiss" for another alpine flower would not break the arc. The ending's "beacon for any future soul" reads familiar rather than inevitable, and the piece does not take bold structural or moral risks that heighten stakes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Marlowe frames the story and enacts the investigation (observing gaps, whispering to the wind, placing the flower, lighting the lamp). He appears in setup, middle, and closure. However, his choices do not create key turns: the arc proceeds as linear observation → symbolic completion without visible friction or cost-driven pivots. He observes rather than decides under pressure. Causal pressure is low; closure linkage is present but passive. Score: setup +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +0.9, minus swappability −0.4, minus summary-only peak moment −0.5, minus ornamental use −0.4 = ~5.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dried Edelweiss appears in setup (lapel), middle (journal page, lifted/trembling), and closure (placed on dock, "imprint… remained"). It recurs across three beats and charges the final image as "beacon." However, its handling is largely descriptive; it does not enable or constrain a tactical choice with cost—Marlowe's placement is symbolic gesture, not a decision that forecloses options. Score: setup +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.2, specificity +0.5, minus ornamental peak use −0.6, minus late causal work −0.3, minus label-only "softly persistent" echo −0.3, minus summary phrasing −0.3 = ~6.2.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Borrowed memories" is named four times but functions as thematic label rather than on-page stake or mechanic. The concept does not shape a tactical choice or alter Marlowe's options with cost; it is asserted ("the tide had borrowed the flower's memory," "the stranger's borrowed memories") without dramatized pressure. Score: setup +0.4 (journal hint), one beat +0.4 (Marlowe realizes gaps = memories), minus ornamental/label-only −0.8, minus swappability −0.4, minus late first clear signal −0.3, minus summary-only −0.3, template/label artifacts −0.3 = ~4.1.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Softly persistent" appears three times (flower ×2, spirit ×1) as adjectival descriptor. It does not constrain or enable an on-page action with cost; Marlowe's choices (observe, whisper, place flower) proceed regardless. The trait is label-only and does not alter tactics. Score: setup +0.3, closure mention +0.4, minus ornamental/label-only −0.9, minus swappability −0.5, minus no causal pressure −0.5, label-artifact −0.3 = ~3.8, capped at 3.8 for swappability.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Investigate" is declared early ("He decided to investigate") and drives the middle beats (observing gaps, noting pauses, marking patterns). It appears in setup and development. However, the investigation proceeds as linear observation without friction or pivot; the method is ornamental detail rather than a tactic that reshapes stakes. Closure shows result (flower placed, lamp lit) but "investigate" itself does not redefine options there. Score: setup +0.7, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +0.8, minus swappability (could be "decipher" or "honor") −0.6, minus no closure pivot −0.4, minus summary middle −0.3 = ~5.9.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"By observing gaps" is the stated method (gaps in tide, pauses, spaces between petals). It appears in setup hint (journal's "empty" page) and middle beats (Marlowe watches ebb/flow, notes longer pauses, marks gaps). The method is signaled and used, but its mechanics remain vague: how do tide-gaps encode memory? The piece asserts correspondence ("Those longer pauses matched the spaces between the pressed petals") without showing the decoding constrain or enable a choice. Score: setup +0.4, two beats +0.9, causal attempt +0.6, minus ornamental/vague mechanics −0.7, minus summary-only key moment −0.4, minus no closure pivot −0.3 = ~4.7.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The opal dock in mist is the anchoring location, present in title phrase, opening line, and final paragraph ("opal dock in mist"). It supplies the spatial resource (longest lull of the sea) for Marlowe's final act (placing the flower). The dock's "opal surface reflected… isolation" charges the mid-story beat. However, the dock does not constrain a choice with cost—Marlowe could complete his gesture elsewhere. Score: setup +0.8, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.4, specificity +0.6, minus no tactical constraint/cost −0.6, minus postcard description in places −0.3 = ~6.8.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Nautical twilight" is named once in the second sentence and evoked ("sun slipped below the horizon," "night deepened," "first pale stars," "dawn crept in"). Time passes across the vigil but does not tighten decisions or tactics: Marlowe's investigation proceeds at his own pace with no live clock or deadline pressure. The timeframe sets mood but does not alter moves. Score: setup +0.5, closure mention (dawn) +0.3, tone contribution +0.4, minus no tactical pressure −0.7, minus ornamental/atmospheric only −0.5, minus vague tracking −0.3, cap at 4.6 for missing middle development, further reduced by summary-only use = ~3.2.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"To decode a stranger's final gesture" is declared motive in paragraph six and drives the investigation beats. Marlowe's desire to "give voice to a solitary gesture" recurs at closure. However, the want is not conflicted or tested by cost: no competing pull (duty, fear, fatigue) challenges his choice to investigate. The motive is told and enacted but not dramatized with friction. Score: setup +0.6, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, minus told-only/no friction −0.8, minus no visible cost −0.5, minus summary peak −0.3 = ~5.3.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Witnessed isolation" coheres across the piece: Marlowe as "solitary witness," "isolation… not as emptiness," "no longer a void," "quiet devotion." Tone is stable and modulates subtly (mist/twilight loneliness → lighter heart at dawn). The final image ("no one… will ever be lost to oblivion") charges isolation with promise. However, a single static mood (melancholy wonder) dominates without sharp pressure modulation. Score: setup +0.7, closure charge +1.3, coherence +0.8, specificity +0.5, minus static middle mood −0.6, minus ornamental phrasing ("canvas," "gentle companion") −0.4, label-artifact ("isolation" ×3) −0.2 = ~6.1.</comment>
