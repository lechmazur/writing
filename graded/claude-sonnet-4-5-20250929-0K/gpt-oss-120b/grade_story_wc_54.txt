<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The intern operates as a vehicle for concept demonstration rather than a character with contradictory impulses. Her "functionally creative" mind and "stoic wonder" are asserted labels that never create friction or cost in her choices—she encounters no resistance, makes no mistakes, experiences no doubt. The sextant alignment, power rerouting, and equation-drafting succeed without struggle, rendering her competent to the point of implausibility. Interiority consists of elevated abstraction ("maze of intentions," "ethical currents") rather than embodied emotion under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who and where within the opening, but the Drive Lens remains ambiguous throughout—shifts between causal engineering problem-solving and accumulative lyric meditation never cohere. The closure unit attempts Resonant Reconfiguration via the activated beacon, but cost is absent: the intern faces no trade-off, loses nothing, and the "resurrected hope" arrives through technical success without personal sacrifice or foreclosed path. The carnival's departure is mentioned but never pressures the engineering work; the two threads (emotional loss vs. technical resurrection) run parallel without causal linkage or convergence at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The spaceport is vividly sketched with "silent hull," "cracked control panel," "massive conduit," and "dormant servos," establishing a concrete ruin. However, setting functions primarily as backdrop for demonstration rather than constraint—conduits and panels cooperate with the intern's intentions without spatial friction or resource scarcity. The sextant's use to "set voltage flow" and align with panels gestures at instrumental constraint but the mechanics remain abstract; we never see her struggle with access, tool limits, or environmental resistance that would make the space pressure her choices.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—resurrect the terminal to create hope—is declared but never tested by meaningful opposition or cost. Every technical move succeeds: rerouted power lines light panels, servos whir, windows open, the beacon activates. No reversal or tightening occurs; the "hidden schematic" discovery adds information without complicating her task. Agency is present in her calculations and rerouting, but because no option is foreclosed and no price paid, escalation flatlines into a demonstration sequence. The carnival's "transient joy" versus engineered permanence could create ethical tension, but the story never dramatizes a choice between them.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>The theme of hope resurrected through engineering is stated rather than emergent: "to resurrect hope she must puzzle out new equations" and "how functionally creative thinking could resurrect hope" are explicit thesis sentences. The sextant's shift from sea-navigation to "ethical currents" is asserted as metaphor without on-page friction to earn the transformation. The final equation "balanced" and the terminal's "renewed purpose" deliver symmetric satisfaction without ambiguity or moral cost, reducing complex questions of technology and sentiment to a tidy success. The "maze of intentions resolved into order" and "spiral of purpose" are abstract philosophical flourishes disconnected from concrete dramatized experience.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited throughout, but the narrative voice oscillates between technical register ("voltage flow," "life-support bays," "communication array") and elevated lyric diction ("stoic wonder," "maze of intentions," "ethical currents," "elegant curve") without consistent character grounding. The intern's perceptual signature is generic rather than distinct—phrases like "each hallway a vector of unfinished plans" and "the weight of a distant star" could belong to any contemplative narrator. Psychic distance wavers: close access to her engineering mind alternates with distant philosophical summary. No dialogue appears, so those bullets are not evaluated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: "resurrect hope" appears five times, "maze of intentions" four times, "functionally creative" twice, "stoic wonder" three times, creating synonym churn without accumulation. Template cadence runs dominate the middle: "She traced... She rerouted... She realized... She drafted... She recorded... She walked... She returned... She documented." Mixed metaphors muddle key beats: the sextant "becomes a compass for navigating ethical currents" conflates nautical tools incoherently, and "each decision... encoded like a mathematical promise" mixes code/promise/equation without clarifying any. Register drifts into academic abstraction ("functionally creative," "lattice of intention pathways," "rhythmic pulse of redirected flows") that clashes with on-page engineering action. Information density is low; many sentences restate her success without advancing situation or choice.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The core premise—lone engineer resurrects abandoned facility—follows a familiar template without transformation through specific conflict or cost. The sextant's repurposing from navigation to voltage-setting is mentioned but not dramatized through constraint or failure that would make the choice particular. "Stoic wonder" and "functionally creative" are prompt-echo labels rather than fresh synthesis. The carnival's departure and the equation-based resurrection are juxtaposed thematically but never collide in a non-obvious choice or irony. The story's emotional and technical arcs proceed in parallel success tracks, avoiding risk or ambiguity that would create hindsight inevitability.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The curious civil engineer intern is present throughout and makes decisions (aligning the sextant, rerouting power, drafting equations), satisfying setup and development gates. However, her choices create no turns—every action succeeds without complication. At closure, she "walked away" and "returned to the sextant," but these are passive observations rather than causal drivers of the beacon's activation. The character is functional but highly replaceable; any competent technician could perform the same steps. Cost is absent; her engineering proceeds without error, sacrifice, or foreclosed alternative. Swappability and ornamental involvement lower the score despite multi-beat presence.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The explorer's sextant piece appears in the first paragraph, is used to align with the control panel and "set voltage flow" in the middle, and reappears at closure when "the instrument vibrate[s] as if acknowledging her success" and is loaded with recorded equations. This satisfies all three gates. However, its function is abstract—how a navigation tool sets voltage is never clarified, making its mechanics ornamental rather than constraining. The final "vibration" is metaphorical validation rather than causal participation. The sextant shapes two beats (alignment, recording) but does not constrain a choice with visible cost; it could be replaced by any technical instrument with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"A maze of intentions" is introduced early as metaphor for the terminal's corridors, mentioned twice more as "lattice of intention pathways" and "maze of intentions resolved into order," and reappears at closure as "spiral of purpose." Setup and lyric payoff gates are met, but the concept never shapes stakes or tactics on the page—the intern does not navigate competing intentions or face a decision structured as a maze. It remains thematic decoration rather than active constraint. The final "resolved into... elegant curve" is asserted transformation without cost. Swappability is high; "complexity" or "tangle" could substitute with no structural change.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Functionally creative" is mentioned three times but never enables or constrains an on-page action with cost. The intern's problem-solving proceeds linearly without friction between creativity and function, or between creative risk and engineering caution. The trait is label-only, indistinguishable from generic competence. No beat dramatizes a tradeoff where functional thinking limits creative insight or vice versa. Setup gate is met (mentioned early), but development and payoff gates fail; the attribute does not alter tactics or charge the closure. Highly swappable with "resourceful," "ingenious," or similar.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Resurrect" appears by name six times and structures the dominant goal: the intern works to resurrect the terminal, hope, and purpose. Setup, development (multiple rerouting beats), and payoff (beacon activation, "revived pulse") gates are met. However, because every resurrection attempt succeeds without complication, the action does not create turns or redefine options—it is the through-line rather than a pivot. Cost is absent; nothing is sacrificed to achieve resurrection. The action is present in closure but does not transform prior material with visible price. Essential to the plot but does not reach high bands due to lack of felt cost and swappability with "restore" or "revive."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Through redirected flows" is signaled early ("imagined reversing its current," "rerouted the dormant power lines," "redirected flows surged") and recurs at closure ("resurrected flow," "revived pulse"). Setup and development gates are met. However, the method's mechanics remain abstract—what makes flow-redirection distinct from simple power restoration is never clarified, making it functionally ornamental. The flows do not constrain her choices (no resource scarcity, no competing demands) or impose visible cost. The method could be replaced with "repair," "reconnection," or "reactivation" with minimal edits. Present across beats but swappable and cost-free.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport passenger terminal is established in the opening line and detailed throughout (corridors, conduits, control panels, boarding gates, windows, steel ribs). It provides the problem space and resources for the intern's work, satisfying setup and development. At closure, "the terminal's new lighting traced the outlines of the old boarding gates" and the beacon transmits, linking setting to payoff. However, the terminal does not constrain choices—conduits and panels cooperate without spatial friction, access limits, or resource scarcity. It functions as a vivid stage rather than an active pressure on tactics. One causal role (the terminal's state defines the task) but no visible cost tied to setting choices.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>"After the carnival leaves town" is mentioned in the opening paragraph and invoked twice more as the source of "quiet" and "transient joy" now absent. Setup gate is met. However, the timeframe never tightens decisions—the intern works at her own pace with no clock pressure, resource depletion, or competing deadline. Development and payoff gates fail; the carnival's departure remains thematic backdrop rather than a constraint that alters tactics or charges the ending. Time is static rather than tracked. The element could be removed and the engineering plot would proceed unchanged, indicating high swappability and ornamental use.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"To puzzle out new equations for hope" is introduced by the midpoint ("she must puzzle out new equations") and recurs as motivation through the drafting and recording beats, with closure noting "the promise of hope she had engineered." Setup, development, and payoff gates are met. However, the desire is told rather than dramatized in conflicted choices—no beat shows her weighing hope against technical feasibility, personal cost, or ethical friction. The equations succeed without struggle, making the motivation declarative rather than lived. One causal role (drives the equation-drafting) but no friction between wants and costs, and swappable with "restore meaning" or "create purpose."</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Stoic wonder" is named three times and colors the narrative voice throughout with restrained, contemplative diction ("silent hull," "quiet anthem," "elegant curve"). Setup and payoff gates are met; the tone is coherent and modulates subtly from opening quiet to closure's "faint beacon." However, the tone remains static—no pressure shifts it toward doubt, urgency, or elation that would create tonal contrast or charge the final image with earned emotional cost. The "stoic" quality insulates the intern from friction, and "wonder" never deepens through struggle. The tone supports the piece's meditative design but does not escalate or reweight the stake, placing it in the functional-replaceable band.</comment>
