<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The archivist's interior world is filtered through poetic abstractions rather than embodied emotion under pressure. His "reactively visionary" nature is labeled but never dramatized through contradictory impulses or micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. The exile's end and his solitary purpose are told rather than tested; when he sets out at the end, no visible cost or forfeiture is legible—he simply continues his mission without friction. The few gestures present (lifting the valve, blowing notes) remain externalized choreography rather than windows into contradictory wants or flawed reasoning.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes who/where/when by the second paragraph (ocean-spray archivist, ivory harbor after rain, post-exile). Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the archivist gathers fragments across beats, the valve absorbs stories, and the harbor becomes a communal chorus. However, no on-page Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with felt cost is legible at closure. The final beat—setting out aboard a sloop—reads as continuation rather than a crystallized shift in stakes, options, or meaning. The ending claims connection but does not reweight prior material or foreclose a path with visible pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The ivory harbor after rain, wooden piers, stone arches, and brass valve are vivid and selectively deployed. Sensory detail (glistened like shattered glass, salt-stained wool, distant clink of rigging) is purposeful and filtered through the archivist's perceptual priorities. The valve as micro-setting object recurs across beats and absorbs the gathered fragments, but it does not constrain a choice at closure—it merely accompanies the archivist on the sloop. Spatial choreography is coherent; the environment supports atmosphere without pressuring final options.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—compiling fragments into coherent meaning—is signaled early and sustained. However, no meaningful tightening or deepening occurs: the archivist gathers fragments, the valve hums, the community responds, and he sets out again without a visible trade-off or narrowed option. The "distant shout" at the end introduces a new call rather than escalating prior pressure. Coincidence (the shout) complicates but does not test; the archivist answers "without hesitation," signaling no internal conflict or cost. One meaningful pressure point under the Accumulative lens is not legible on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Theme—stitching scattered memory into communal story, letting gaps breathe—emerges from particulars (the valve, the harbor, the gathered fragments). The archivist's shift from "lonely exile into communal chorus" offers a thematic claim, but the ending does not reweight prior material with a non-literal answer; instead it restates the mission ("to connect the scattered songs of the sea") without fresh inflection. The final image (setting out with the valve) reads as continuation rather than conceptual repricing. Subtext operates in the valve's shift from triumph-herald to repository, but the piece leans toward direct thematic statement ("his reactively visionary approach," "letting the sea's own silence tell part of the tale") rather than trusting image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV is stable; no head-hopping. The prose carries a lyric, poetic texture with controlled diction ("ocean-spray archivist," "living tide of memory," "staggered intervals") that remains consistent across beats. However, perceptual signature is generic rather than character-specific—the archivist's way of noticing reads as elevated narrator rather than an individual mind under pressure. Psychic distance is consistently distant, which suits the accumulative design but flattens interiority. Sentence rhythm is purposeful but occasionally mechanical (repeated "he" + verb stems in the first half). No dialogue present; filter verbs ("aware that," "knowing that") are frequent but voice-motivated for the reflective mode.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The prose is clear and rhythmically controlled with purposeful sentence variety. Information density is moderate: many lines advance atmosphere and theme but not plot pressure. Loop check: the phrase "navigating absences" and variants recur without adding pressure; "reactively visionary" is labeled twice; "staggered intervals" appears twice with slight variation. Template cadence is present in the middle third: "He gathered them," "He understood that," "He learned to," "He answered" (runs of subject-verb stems). Minor synonym churn: "fragments," "shards," "pieces," "whisper" cycle without functional distinction. Figurative language is dense but coherent; no mixed metaphors. The final third accelerates slightly but remains contemplative rather than propulsive. Apply −0.6 for template cadence and loop artifacts (Non-closure Accumulation Cap).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The ocean-spray archivist and brass valve as memory repository offer a specific synthesis, but the core premise—solitary chronicler gathering fragments into meaning—echoes familiar archivist/librarian templates without a non-obvious moral calculus or lived-detail transformation. The "reactively visionary" trait and "navigated absences" concept are intriguing labels but remain abstract rather than dramatized through fresh, earned beats. The communal chorus turn is signaled rather than pressured. The exile-to-communal arc and the final call to retrieve "a legend lost to the deepest trench" read as setup for continuation rather than inevitable closure. Risk-taking in structure (lyric accumulation) is present but does not heighten stakes or meaning; the piece opts for atmospheric median choices over bold specificity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The ocean-spray archivist is present throughout and makes micro-choices (blowing the valve, gathering fragments, setting out). However, his choices do not create key turns; the narrative is additive rather than decisive. Setup is immediate; middle development is observational (he gathers, he listens); payoff is continuation (he sets out). No on-page cost or trade-off tied to his agency is legible. Swappable with another collector-observer role. Score in functional-but-replaceable band; lift slightly for three-gate presence and causal involvement in beats, but cap below 6.0 due to lack of closure-shaping decision.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The herald's trumpet valve appears in setup (salvaged from shipwreck), is used in multiple beats (blown to signal, filled with fragments, released a chord, secured beside him), and is present in the ending beat. Its shift from triumph-herald to memory repository provides thematic reweighting. However, it does not constrain a choice or impose a visible cost at closure; it accompanies the archivist without altering final options. Strong beat involvement and purposeful reprise, but closure linkage is presence rather than causal pressure. Score in mid-6s for essential presence across beats and thematic charge, but below 7.0 for lack of closure constraint.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The concept "navigated absences" is named explicitly and illustrated through the archivist noting "where silence fell like a missing stanza" and "letting gaps breathe." Setup is clear; middle development shows him listening to silences; the ending claims "an absence waiting to be filled." However, the concept shapes theme more than stakes or tactics—no on-page choice is altered by the presence or treatment of an absence. The archivist's approach to gaps is descriptive rather than pressured. Score in low-5s for coherent thematic presence and middle illustration, but below 6.0 for lack of causal constraint on action.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The attribute "reactively visionary" is labeled twice ("Because his mind was reactively visionary," "his reactively visionary approach") but never dramatized through a specific on-page action or tradeoff. The archivist senses "a story's direction before the ink had even dried," yet this foresight does not enable or constrain a beat with visible cost. Setup is present; no middle constraint or payoff involvement is legible. Label-only mention without functional pressure. Score in ornamental band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The action "hearten" drives multiple beats: the archivist blows a note "meant to hearten the weary fishermen," sends "a tentative trill that would hearten the next generation," and his gathered chorus presumably heartens the community. Setup and middle development are clear; the ending continues the heartening mission. However, major turns do not trace to this action—the story is additive rather than turn-driven, and "hearten" could be replaced with "gather" or "signal" with minor edits. Strong beat involvement and thematic coherence, but swappability caps the score in mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The method "through staggered intervals" is named and demonstrated: "The note traveled through staggered intervals, pausing at each dock," and later "Through staggered intervals of storm and calm, the sloop cut through the night." Setup is implicit in early pacing; middle and ending both reference the method. However, the mechanics do not alter tactics—the intervals are descriptive of pacing rather than a constraint that shapes choices. The method supports atmosphere but is swappable with other tempo descriptors. Score in low-5s for thematic coherence and ending presence, lifted slightly for clear middle and ending reference, but capped below 6.0 for lack of causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The "ivory harbor after rain" is established in the opening line and recurs in the final paragraph ("the moon rose high above the ivory harbor after rain"). Setup is immediate; the setting provides atmosphere and spatial anchors (piers, stone arches, docks). However, it does not pressure choices or supply resources that affect outcome—the archivist operates within it rather than being constrained by it. The ending reprise reweights the image lyrically but does not alter tactics. Score in low-5s for purposeful early-final reprise and coherent presence, but below 6.0 for lack of micro-setting constraint on action.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the exile ends" is established in the first paragraph and frames the archivist's return. However, time does not tighten decisions or tactics—the exile's end is backstory rather than a live pressure. The passage of time is vague ("Days turned into weeks," "One evening") without a clock that alters moves. The ending departure does not carry time urgency. Setup is present; middle and ending do not track time as constraint. Score in functional-but-replaceable band, capped below 5.0 for lack of causal time pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The motivation "to compile fragments into meaning" is named explicitly and demonstrated across beats: the archivist gathers fragments, notes absences, lets the valve absorb stories, and forms "a map of the night's journey." Setup and middle development are clear; the ending continues the mission. However, the desire is not dramatized through friction between wants and costs—the archivist pursues it without visible trade-off or internal conflict. The motivation shapes the plot but is not tested under pressure. Score in mid-6s for strong beat involvement and thematic coherence, but below 7.0 for lack of on-page conflict or cost tied to the motivation.</comment>
