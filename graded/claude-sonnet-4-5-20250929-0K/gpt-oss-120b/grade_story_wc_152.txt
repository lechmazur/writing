<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The galaxy-chart embroiderer remains a label rather than a character with embodied choices. Her "disguises wisdom as foolishness" trait is asserted but never dramatized through contradictory impulses or visible cost. The synchronization with the candle flame is described in summary ("she taught herself") rather than shown as a live decision under pressure. No on-page micro-choice forces her to navigate competing desires or forecloses a path with felt consequence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed—who she is, her precise spatial position, and the timeline anchor emerge slowly across the first third without deliberate disorientation taught as pattern (−0.4). The "adjacent possibilities" mechanism remains abstract; the story tells us she imagines scenarios (the clerk, the governor's aide) but these visions do not alter her on-page tactics or narrow her options in a causal chain. The closure—finishing the tapestry and sending it via courier—occurs, but the cost is conceptual and unanchored: we do not see what she sacrifices, what path she forecloses, or how the act changes her situation with felt pressure. Under a causal lens the linkage is weak; under accumulative the final image does not reweight prior material with undeniable cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The cobalt observatory, autumn air, and brass domes are vividly described and establish atmosphere. However, the setting functions primarily as backdrop; the loom, telescope, and candle are mentioned but do not constrain her choices or supply resources that alter outcome. The courier's departure and the observatory's sigh are scenic rather than tactical. Sensory detail is present but does not pressure the protagonist's decisions at key beats.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—unraveling the conspiracy before the coup—is signaled early but never tested on the page. The embroiderer encounters no obstacle, makes no tightening choice that forecloses an option, and faces no visible antagonist or complication. The progression is linear: she stitches, interprets the flame, finishes, and dispatches the chart without a reversal or cost that narrows her path. The "adjacent possibilities" visions are recounted summaries, not dramatized pressure points. No on-page escalation or agency-driven turn alters tactics or stakes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The theme—truth in suppressed voices, wisdom disguised as foolishness—is stated rather than earned through concrete action. The final sentence ("truth could be sewn") summarizes the premise instead of letting the image resonate. Motifs (the flame, the tapestry, autumn leaves) recur but do not constrain choice or charge the closure; they are decorative rather than load-bearing. The piece gestures toward complexity but resolves into an unambiguous triumph without plausible counter-reading or moral cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Third-person narration maintains stable distance and the prose carries a lyric, elevated register throughout. However, the diction frequently drifts into stock poetic phrasing ("bruised with dying stars," "echoed silence," "promise of change") that reads generic rather than character-specific. Filter verbs ("she felt," "she believed," "she knew") stack without voice-driven purpose, dulling immediacy. Perceptual signature is minimal; the narrator's way of noticing does not reveal selective bias or character-particular priorities. No dialogue is present to judge.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The prose is grammatically clean but suffers from repeated scaffold patterns: "She was," "She placed," "She adjusted," "She finished," "She returned" across multiple beats (−0.5). Figurative language clusters densely without pattern-teaching or payoff—"bruised with dying stars," "stitching constellations into silk," "the echoed silence," "humming with the promise of change"—creating overwriting that obscures rather than propels (−0.6). Several adjacent sentences restate the same content in synonym loops: "the flame flickered in a pattern" followed by "she interpreted that as a code"; "she whispered to the flame" followed by "the candle obliged" (−0.3 for paraphrase loops). Information density is low; many lines describe atmosphere without advancing choice or situation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The core premise—embroidering star charts to decode conspiracies via a magical flame—offers a fresh surface combination. However, the execution relies on stock fantasy imagery (eternal candles, mystical looms, prophetic visions) without transforming them through grounded choice or world logic. The emotional arc is generic: a wise figure uncovers a plot and succeeds without cost or complication. The "adjacent possibilities" mechanism and "disguises wisdom as foolishness" remain unexplored abstractions. Transformation test: the plot and arc could be rewritten with a different magical system and character role without loss, indicating surface novelty rather than synthesis from particulars.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The galaxy-chart embroiderer is present throughout and her role as unraveler is thematic, but her on-page choices do not create key turns. She performs actions (stitching, placing the ember, finishing the chart) that are recounted rather than pressured. No beat shows her deciding under conflicting options or paying a visible cost. The character is functional but replaceable; the story's logic does not hinge on her specific agency.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The flame from the eternal candle appears early (setup gate met), is placed beside the loom, flickers in patterns she interprets, and steadies before dimming at the end (development and payoff gates met). It enables her interpretive method and is handled across multiple beats. However, its mechanics remain abstract—how the flame's rhythm reveals truth is asserted, not shown—and the final dimming is scenic rather than causally decisive. The element shapes atmosphere and method but does not constrain a choice with visible cost. Score: functional across beats, but swappable with another mystical interpretive tool.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Unraveling conspiracies is the stated goal and frames the plot, but the work is recounted in summary. The embroiderer "taught herself to synchronize," imagines scenarios via adjacent possibilities, and finishes a chart—all told rather than dramatized. The concept appears in setup and payoff but does not alter on-page tactics or force a trade-off. It is thematic scaffolding rather than causal engine.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Disguises wisdom as foolishness" is asserted in the opening ("Her reputation rested on the paradox") but never enacted. No on-page moment shows her laughing at patterns, playing the fool to disarm others, or trading credibility for insight. The attribute is label-only, without visible cost or enabling action. It does not constrain a choice or shape a beat.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Synchronize appears as method: "she taught herself to synchronize the cadence of her stitching with the pulse of the candle's flame." This action is described as ongoing work and is present in the middle section when she adjusts the loom. However, the act of synchronizing is told rather than dramatized—we do not see her struggle to achieve rhythm or suffer when it slips. The action enables her interpretive process but could be replaced with another mystical technique without rewriting major beats. It contributes to the method but does not drive a key turn or redefine options with cost.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Adjacent possibilities" is named as her method: "she believed that truth lingered in the gaps between official reports, in the adjacent possibilities of what could be." The phrase recurs when she imagines the clerk and the governor's aide. However, the mechanics are abstract—how imagining scenarios differs from ordinary deduction is never shown—and the visions do not shape on-page attempts or force a choice. The method is present in setup and middle but remains ornamental, swappable with "intuition" or "vision" without structural change.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The cobalt observatory is anchored early with vivid details (cliffs, brass domes, glass roof, autumn winds) and recurs across beats. It provides atmosphere and houses the loom and telescope. The autumn cold contrasts with interior warmth, and the copper dome is reprised at the end. However, the setting does not pressure her choices or supply resources that alter outcome; she could perform the same work in another mystical location. It is functional and persistent but not indispensable. Score: shapes atmosphere and provides coherent space, but does not constrain tactics or charge closure with site-specific necessity.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Before the coup" anchors the timeframe early and creates implicit urgency: the conspiracy must be exposed before the plotters strike. However, the timeline is not tracked—no clock tightens her choices, no deadline forces a trade-off. The phrase recurs near the end ("the night before the coup"), but the temporal pressure remains abstract. The timeframe is present in setup and payoff, shaping the premise, but does not drive on-page escalation or force a cost. Functional framing, but swappable with other pre-crisis windows.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>The motivation "to listen for unheard stories" is stated early ("Her motive was simple: to listen for unheard stories") and repeated when she whispers to the flame. It frames her goal and connects to theme. However, the desire is told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants or visible cost. We do not see her sacrifice another path, endure friction, or choose listening over an alternative. The motivation is functional—it explains her actions—but lacks on-page friction or trade-off. Swappable with other altruistic drives without structural change.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"Echoed silence" is introduced early ("a quiet echo swelled, an echoed silence that pressed on ears") and recurs near the end ("the echoed silence now humming with the promise of change"). The phrase creates an atmospheric paradox—silence that resonates—and modulates slightly from oppressive to anticipatory. However, the tone is static across pressure beats rather than shifting with escalation, and the final reprise is descriptive rather than charged by a visible cost. The tone is purposeful and coherent but does not constrain choice or reweight the closure image with undeniable pressure. Present in setup and payoff with minor evolution, but ornamental.</comment>
