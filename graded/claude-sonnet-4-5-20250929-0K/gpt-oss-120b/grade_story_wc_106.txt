<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Lira remains flat throughout—her "quietly savvy" trait is label-only, never dramatized through contradictory impulses or cost-laden micro-choices. No internal conflict appears; she moves like liquid dusk through the piece without hesitation, doubt, or genuine struggle. The conductor and other figures are props, applying zero interpersonal pressure. The ending grants her a thief-turned-guardian epiphany without earning it through prior causality or visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The piece offers no on-page closure with visible cost: Lira's whispered promise to the lantern is assertion, not a decisive change, renunciation, or earned reconfiguration. Spatial orientation drifts—grand hall, tunnels, jade door, cavernous library—without clear transitions or consistent anchoring, breaking the Orientation Test by ~120 words (−0.4). The Drive Lens remains ambiguous throughout; no causal because/therefore linkage drives escalation, no accumulative density reweights stakes, and situational pressure never crystallizes into stance. The ending describes traveler reactions rather than landing a closure unit with felt cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Setting shifts—emerald station, grand hall, hidden tunnels, jade door, library—are named but not grounded in spatial choreography or sensory anchors filtered through POV. Moonbeams and flower arrangements function as magical props without physical constraints. The station does not pressure Lira's choices; she moves unimpeded, suggesting postcard description over lived-in micro-setting. No recurring object or environmental detail constrains a choice or charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The stated stake—witness illuminated moments—never faces on-page opposition or cost. Lira encounters no locked door she cannot open, no time pressure, no trade-off between competing goods. The conductor hands her exactly what she needs; the moonbeams project a map; the jade door opens; the lantern ignites. No reversal, tightening, or deepening narrows options or forecloses a path. The final "promise" is asserted rather than earned through agency under pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Theme is stated in the final paragraph—"not to steal images, but to preserve the fleeting brilliance of existence"—rather than emerging from concrete particulars. "Illuminated moments," "destiny's door," and "luminous disbelief" recur as ornamental labels without reweighting prior material through action or image. The ending replaces scene pressure with overt moralizing. No thematic question is posed early and answered non-literally by the closure unit.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>Voice is uniform across narration and characters, relying on elevated lyricism ("liquid dusk," "soft sighs of forgotten travelers," "luminous disbelief") that never modulates under pressure. The conductor's single rose and midnight lilies arrive without dialogue or gestural subtext, flattening any interpersonal texture. Perceptual signature is absent—Lira notices everything with equal, ornate attentiveness. Purposeful elision is not taught; the piece withholds mechanics (how flowers unlock things) only to assert them later without cost.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Overwriting pervades high-pressure beats: "liquid dusk," "velveteen case," "luminous disbelief," "whispers urging her to press her ear against destiny's door." Paraphrase loops abound—"illuminated moments" appears six times, "moonbeams" thirteen times, often in near-identical constructions. Template cadence runs ("She [verb]… The [noun] [verb]…") span paragraphs without pattern-teaching or payoff. Mixed metaphors ("pressed the velveteen case against the rose, feeling the petal's vibration echo like a heartbeat") blur sense. Applying Text Artifact penalties (−0.6 baseline for loops, −0.4 for template runs, −0.3 for register drift into abstraction) and escalating for density at closure: total −1.4 in Q7, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The core—thief learns to preserve rather than steal—is a familiar redemption template executed without fresh lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. Flower-coded locks and captured moonbeams read as decorative fantasy without internal logic or constraint. The emerald station, golden sunset, and midnight lilies are generic high-fantasy placeholders. Transformation test fails: swap names and setting, the arc remains unchanged. No bold risk charges the ending; the piece retreats into safe, pretty assertions.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Lira is named early and present throughout, but her choices are frictionless—she "learned to reinterpret," "felt the pull of destiny," "whispered a promise." No on-page decision alters tactics or forecloses a path with cost. She observes and receives rather than choosing under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The jar appears early, returns in the middle (moonbeam map), and ignites the lantern at closure. Present across three beats with escalating function. However, it solves problems it did not help create and its mechanics remain asserted rather than dramatized with cost, capping around mid-6s. No visible trade-off tied to using it.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Illuminated moments" recurs as thematic label throughout but never constrains a choice or alters tactics on the page. The concept is claimed in narration ("storing their hopes," "witness the illuminated moments") rather than dramatized through pressure. Ornamental rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"Quietly savvy" appears twice as static descriptor ("quietly savvy golden-hour portrait thief," "still quietly savvy") without enabling or constraining an action. No visible tradeoff, cost, or decision traces to this trait. Label-only.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Reinterpret" appears three times (flower language, lilies, each new sunrise) but the mechanics are never shown. Lira "learned to reinterpret," then does so off-page. The action is told rather than dramatized with cost, and easily swappable with "decode" or "understand." Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Flower codes appear early (rose, midnight lilies) and unlock key objects. Present in two beats but mechanics remain asserted ("petal's vibration echo," "arranged to spell a new question") without on-page demonstration or cost. Functional but the method could be swapped for any magical key system.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The emerald station is named in the opening and final paragraphs, and its hidden tunnels supply the jade door and library. Spatial presence across the arc, but the station does not pressure Lira's choices—she moves unimpeded. Postcard backdrop rather than constraint. Mid-band for presence without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.2</grade><comment>"Fleeting golden sunset" appears in paragraph one and the penultimate paragraph ("fading sunset") but no live clock tightens decisions. Lira operates without time pressure; the sunset never shortens her window or forces a trade-off. Ornamental bookend.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"Press your ear against destiny's door" recurs three times as metaphor but is never tested by conflicting wants or costs. Lira "felt the pull," "understood," "whispered a promise"—all frictionless assertions. The desire is told rather than dramatized through choice under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"Luminous disbelief" appears twice (lanterns casting it, travelers' widened eyes) as static mood label. Tone remains uniformly lyrical and reverent throughout without modulation under pressure. No coherent tonal shift charges the final image; the ending sustains the same ornate register as the opening.</comment>
