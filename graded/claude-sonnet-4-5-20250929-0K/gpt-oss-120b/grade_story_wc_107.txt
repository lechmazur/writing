<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Mara's interiority is abstract and externally performed rather than embodied; she narrates tasks "as if these were epic verses" but no contradictory impulses act in scene. The motivation to "craft safe zones for inquiry" remains told and never tested by a concrete on-page dilemma that forces a trade-off. Emotional states are labeled ("weighty lightness," "thawing heart") without visceral contradiction or micro-choices that reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. The final whisper to the empty room substitutes declaration for earned renunciation or change.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who and where early, but the "when" (day vs. season) and spatial scale remain vague past the 120-word gate; no penalty applied because disorientation is mild and does not obscure closure. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: density and cadence build through repeated motifs (bookmark, glass, thaw). However, no on-page decisive change or resonant reconfiguration occurs; Mara's final whisper recaps her stated purpose without a visible cost or foreclosed path. The closure unit lacks a legible before/after with felt price, so RR/CR does not land. Escalation is accumulation of imagery rather than tightening of options or stakes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The control room, furnace, and glass vessels are evoked with sensory specificity (meltwater pooling, sunrise sliver, kaleidoscope glow) and anchor the POV. The cracked bookmark and glass sphere constrain symbolic choices and charge the final image through reprise. Spatial choreography is clear (rod, tray, table, panels). However, the room functions primarily as backdrop; no environmental feature narrows a tactical option or complicates a beat under pressure, limiting score above mid-6s despite vivid description.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—crafting safe zones for inquiry—is declared but never tested by a concrete reversal or complication; no scientist arrives, no ice threatens the workspace, no material runs short. Mara's sequence is a list of completed tasks without on-page opposition or tightening. The "abandon the notion that safety could be built quickly" reads as pre-resolved acceptance rather than a turn driven by new pressure. No visible cost or trade-off appears; the control panels flickering back to life is coincidental atmosphere, not consequence of her agency.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Theme of thawing/warming and fragile equilibrium emerges from repeated imagery (ice melt, glass cooling, cracked bookmark as new beginning). The bookmark and glass sphere carry symbolic freight and reappear at closure. However, the final whisper—"the thawing heart of the world would beat within every safe zone she forged"—is an explicit thematic statement that replaces scene pressure with declaration. The piece invites reflection on patience and craft, but the ending leans toward stated moral rather than resonant non-literal answer, capping score in mid-5s.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-person limited with consistent psychic distance. Diction is elevated and lyric ("weighty lightness," "liturgy," "tapestry of purpose"), voice-consistent but occasionally slips into abstract register ("nurture the fragile equilibrium") that feels writerly rather than character-bound. Perceptual signature is poetic but generic; no embodied micro-noticing that distinguishes Mara's glassblower eye from any contemplative artisan. No dialogue appears. Purposeful compression and patterned phrasing (repeated "weighty lightness") support the accumulative design, but the effect is more decorative than pressure-charged.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and figurative language is vivid, but density suffers from paraphrase loops and scaffold phrases. "Weighty lightness" appears three times without reweighting; "thawing heart" recurs as decoration. The phrase "abandoned control room" is repeated verbatim across beats without causal evolution. Runs of template cadence: "I lift… I breathe… I coax… I set" (intentional chant, acceptable) versus "She began… She abandoned… She set to work… She placed… She knew" (unintentional stem repetition). Stock metaphor "cracked surface of a newly blown sphere" and "liquid glass" feel generic. Apply −0.8 for paraphrase loops and stem runs (Non-closure Accumulation Cap); no artifact touches the closure beat directly, so cap remains ~4.6.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The glassblower-in-abandoned-control-room frame offers a fresh juxtaposition, and the bookmark-as-compass motif shows craft. However, the emotional arc (solitary artisan finds peace through work) and thematic resolution (patience over speed, fragile beauty) follow a familiar template without transformation through high-stakes conflict or non-obvious moral calculus. The "thawing heart" metaphor is present but not deeply integrated into a causally complex choice. Specificity in glassblowing detail is shallow (silica, rod, furnace) and does not constrain a pivotal decision, leaving the premise more picturesque than structurally original.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Mara is present throughout and her occupation frames the setting and method, but her choices do not create key turns; she completes a planned sequence without on-page reversal or dilemma. Observation and narration dominate; no decision alters tactics or forecloses a path with cost. Present in setup, middle work, and ending, satisfying two gates (setup, payoff via whisper), but lack of causal pressure and swappability (any solitary artisan could fill the role) cap score below 3.0.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The bookmark appears in three beats: intro (carried with manual reference), mid-scene (slips onto table, catches sunrise), and ending (becomes compass pointing toward tomorrow). Each appearance is described rather than used to constrain a choice. The final reprise reweights it as directional symbol, a purposeful early-to-final arc that meets lyric-resonance allowance. However, no middle development beat; it does not enable or narrow a decision under pressure. Two gates (setup, payoff) allow eligibility to ~6.0; lyric reprise lifts toward mid-5s, but lack of causal pressure and swappability (any memoir object could serve) limit score.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"The thawing heart" is named repeatedly (bookmark etching, planet pulse, final whisper) as thematic label but does not shape on-page tactics or options. It functions as metaphor for Mara's emotional state and the planetary condition, echoed rather than dramatized. No beat shows Mara adjusting her work because ice is melting faster or slower, or scientists requiring access sooner. Present across beats as atmospheric backdrop and thematic declaration, satisfying setup and payoff gates but missing middle development. Ornamental use and lack of causal pressure cap score in low-3s.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Thoughtfully spirited" is declared in the opening but never constrains or enables an on-page action with visible cost. Mara's narration chant and patient crafting illustrate the trait as label, but no beat shows the attribute forcing a trade-off (e.g., choosing careful refinement over speed when time is scarce). Present in setup via description only; absent from middle and closure choices. Label-only mention and lack of causal work cap score below 3.0.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Abandon" appears once in a key sentence: "She abandoned the notion that safety could be built quickly." However, this reads as retrospective summary of a prior mental shift rather than a dramatized turn under pressure. No on-page scene shows Mara letting go of a faster method or rejecting an earlier plan with visible cost. The verb is present and thematically apt but functions as expository bridge, not causal action that redefines options. Introduced early-middle but not tied to a choice beat; swappable with "realized" or "accepted." Missing development and closure participation; functional but replaceable, mid-4s.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Dramatically narrating mundane tasks is signaled early ("She began by dramatically narrating…") and demonstrated on the page with the chant: "I lift the rod, I breathe into the furnace, I coax the silica into life, I set it upon the cooling tray." The method shapes Mara's approach and turns labor into ritual, present in setup and middle beats. However, it does not alter a decision or constrain a tactic under pressure; it is performed rather than tested. The ending notes "narrative of her mundane motions… became a story the walls absorbed," closure reprise that reweights the method thematically. Three gates (setup, middle, payoff) with thematic closure linkage allow eligibility above 6.0, but lack of causal pressure and swappability (any ritual framing could serve) limit score to high-5s.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The abandoned control room is named in title-like fashion and described with vivid detail (humming consoles, thawing ice ceiling, meltwater pools, steel table, control panels that flicker at dusk). Present throughout, satisfying setup, middle, and payoff gates. However, the room supplies atmosphere and workspace but does not pressure a choice or provide a constraint that alters tactics (e.g., failing power, limited space, encroaching water). The panels flickering at dusk is coincidental rather than causal. Essential for world framing but functionally passive; any workshop space could serve with minor edits. Structural presence without causal integration caps score in mid-4s.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"During the great melt" anchors the timeframe in the opening and the ice/water imagery recurs ("ice sheets released their grip," "rivers that sang of change," "ice finally surrendered"). However, the melt functions as static backdrop; no urgency tied to melting speed or seasonal deadline alters Mara's choices. Time is vague (dusk falls once, but no clock tightens decisions). Present in setup and ending as atmospheric condition but missing middle pressure. Two gates (setup, payoff) without causal work; the melt could be replaced with any slow environmental change. Functional but replaceable, mid-3s.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>The motivation "to craft safe zones for inquiry where scientists could study the melting ice without fear" is stated explicitly in the opening and reprised in the final whisper. However, it remains told rather than dramatized; no scientist arrives, no inquiry is threatened, no fear is tested. Mara's work is framed by this goal but no on-page friction between want (quick results) and cost (patience required) forces a choice. Present in setup and payoff as declaration, missing middle conflict. Two gates without causal pressure or felt trade-off; swappable with any altruistic craft motive. Functional label, low-3s.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Weighty lightness" is named three times and functions as tonal thesis: the paradox of serious purpose carried with poetic grace. The tone is coherent across beats (lyric, contemplative, no sudden shifts) and modulates slightly as dusk falls and the panels glow. The final image ("In that weighty lightness she found her peace") charges the phrase with closure resonance. However, the tone remains static rather than escalating under pressure; no moment where gravity crushes lightness or vice versa. Three gates (setup, middle via repetition, payoff) with closure linkage allow eligibility above mid-4s, but lack of dynamic modulation and over-reliance on the repeated label (ornamental rather than pressure-driven) limit score to high-4s.</comment>
