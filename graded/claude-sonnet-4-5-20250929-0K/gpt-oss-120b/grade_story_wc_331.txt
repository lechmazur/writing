<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Mara remains a cipher throughout: "sanely eccentric" is label-only, never constraining a choice or creating visible cost. Her interiority consists entirely of exposition about analog memories and hyperbolic geometry—she whispers algorithms and adjusts scarves, but no competing impulse or doubt appears. The patrons exist as backdrop without distinct personalities or pressure on Mara's actions. No meaningful change or endurance with foreclosed path occurs; she simply logs the event and waits for the next cycle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: atmospheric density builds toward the star-chronicle projection and Mara's return to the desk. Orientation anchors (midnight library, Mara, patrons) arrive early. However, no reversal or tightening narrows options—the reawakening proceeds without obstacle, and the ledger-logging closure offers no visible cost or reconfigured stance, only a promise of future repetition. The Möbius-strip metaphor and hyperbolic-field mechanics are asserted rather than dramatized, weakening causal texture.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The scientific poetry library supplies vivid, purpose-driven images: glowing shelves with equations in rhyme, vellum rustling, ozone scent. The tattered silk scarf functions as a recurring object that charges the ending moment when tucked back into Mara's coat. Spatial choreography (aisles, atrium, desk beneath black-hole poems) remains clear. However, the environment never constrains a choice or supplies a tactical obstacle; it serves as atmospheric backdrop rather than crucible, capping the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—reawakening analog memories to guide seekers—is signaled early but remains abstract and untested. No on-page obstacle or cost appears: the scarf's vibration, Mara's algorithm, and the star-chronicle projection occur without friction or trade-off. The patrons' awe and Mara's logging are outcomes, not earned through protagonist agency under pressure. One meaningful tightening or deepening that narrows options is absent, and the "delicate balance" mentioned at the end is told rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Theme—stories as hidden geometry bridging analog memory and lived perception—emerges from imagery (Möbius strip, hyperbolic curvature, firefly narratives) rather than direct statement, which is a strength. The ledger as "bridge between measurable and mythic" offers resonant particularity. However, the ending's promise that "analog memories would find a way to reawaken" and "countless tales" is abstract reassurance, not a non-literal answer that reweights prior material with cost. The thematic question lacks the friction of a genuine difficulty overcome on the page.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. The perceptual signature—"invisible lines across the vaulted ceiling," "angles that only a mind tuned to both poetry and quantum mechanics could discern"—is specific to Mara and lends voice texture. Diction ("sanely eccentric," "observed solitude," "transient constellations") stays elevated and consistent. However, the prose at peak moments (scarf aligning, ripple reaching atrium) relies on abstract nouns ("resonance," "reawakening," "communion") rather than embodied perception, dulling immediacy and capping the score in mid-6s.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and opening/closing images anchor effectively. Information density is uneven: many lines restate the reawakening process with synonym churn ("dormant narratives," "analog memories," "hidden geometry," "hyperbolic transformations"). The phrase "observed solitude" appears twice in near-identical constructions (penultimate and final paragraphs), creating a template loop. Stock metaphors ("ghostly fireflies," "beat again when needed") and filter-verb stacks ("felt the tug," "knew that") in reflective passages reduce propulsion. These patterns lower clarity and momentum, especially in the final third, disqualifying 9+ and applying −0.8 cumulative artifact penalty.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of poetry, quantum mechanics, and analog memory offers a fresh conceptual frame, and the hyperbolic-geometry method is non-obvious. However, the execution leans on familiar tropes: the midnight librarian as mystic custodian, the magical object (scarf) that glows at key moments, and the cycle-of-care ending that promises infinite repetition. The star-chronicle projection and walnut-tree flashback are vivid particulars, but the narrative arc (problem-free ritual → affirmation → return to watch) does not transform or complicate the premise with earned risk. Swapping "hyperbolic geometry" for another esoteric discipline would leave the emotional and causal structure largely unchanged.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Mara is present throughout but makes no choices that create turns. She traces lines, whispers algorithms, adjusts the scarf, smiles, and logs—observations and rituals without visible cost or competing options. Setup and development beats are filled with her, but no decision alters tactics or stakes; closure is a return to waiting. Label-only eccentricity and summary-only involvement lower the score. No causal pressure or irreplaceability is demonstrated.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The scarf appears in setup (flutters in opening paragraph), mid-scene (vibrates, glows emerald, sweeps across curvature, acts as conduit), and closure (tucked back, humming promise). It constrains no choice but accumulates symbolic charge across at least four distinct beats, and its return in the final third reweights the promise of future reawakening. Swappable with another mystical object (wand, amulet) without deep structural change, but its recurring presence and closure linkage lift it into the low 7s before deducting for ornamental function and lack of causal cost, settling mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Analog memories are named repeatedly and supply thematic vocabulary (physical imprints, dormant lattice, vivid recollection of child under walnut tree). They shape the stated goal but do not create an on-page tactical choice or obstacle—Mara's method proceeds without friction. Present in setup, middle exposition, and ending promise, meeting two gates. However, the concept remains abstract rather than enabling or constraining a dramatized choice, placing it in the functional-but-replaceable band with a small lift for closure mention.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>"Sanely eccentric" is declared in the opening paragraph (tattered scarf as only visible marker) but never enables or constrains an action. No tradeoff, no cost, no on-page demonstration of how eccentricity shapes a choice under pressure. The trait is ornamental label, present in setup only, absent from middle beats and closure. Static description without integration.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Reawaken is the stated task, named in setup, enacted in the middle (scarf vibration, hyperbolic transformations, star-chronicle burst), and promised at closure (ledger entry, future cycles). It drives the narrative spine but faces no obstacle or alternative, so major turns do not trace to protagonist struggle. Present across all three gates and linked to closure, but swappable with "restore," "summon," or "invoke" without deep revision. The action's mechanics are asserted rather than tested, capping it in the mid-5s for functional presence without irreplaceability or cost.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Hyperbolic geometry appears in setup (mentioned in paragraph ~7), middle (Möbius strip transformation, curvature alignment), and closure (scarf as conduit of hyperbolic field). It supplies the unique method but its mechanics are told rather than dramatized—no failed attempt, no visible cost of choosing this geometry over another. The specificity ("angles that only a mind tuned to both poetry and quantum mechanics could discern") adds texture, but the method resolves a problem it did not help create and could be swapped for another esoteric system. Functional across beats, present in closure promise, but ornamental in execution.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The scientific poetry library frames every beat: glowing shelves, atrium projection, desk beneath black-hole poems. Setup clear, middle beats occur within its micro-geography (aisles, central atrium), and closure returns to the desk and infinite corridors. However, the setting never supplies an obstacle or resource that alters tactics—no locked door, no forbidden shelf, no patron interference. It enriches atmosphere and anchors spatial choreography but remains backdrop rather than crucible. Present in all three gates with closure linkage, lifting it into low 6s, but lack of causal pressure and swappability with another mystical archive prevent higher scoring.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Patrons browse throughout, mentioned in opening, middle (turning pages, whispering in awe), and closure (soft sigh of pages). The timeframe is continuous but imposes no urgency or ticking clock—Mara's task proceeds at her chosen pace without deadline pressure. Present but purely atmospheric; easily removable or replaceable with "during closing hour" or "at dawn" without structural change. No decision is tightened by the patrons' presence.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The motivation—to find the place where stories live—is declared in setup (paragraph ~6) and closure promise (final paragraph). It supplies the thematic spine but is never dramatized as a conflicted choice or tested by friction. Mara's belief in hidden geometry is exposition, not an on-page struggle between competing wants or a cost paid to pursue this desire. Present in setup and closure, functional but told-only, with no middle beat where the motivation narrows options or forces a tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Observed solitude is signaled early ("calm anomaly," "quiet stewardship") and recurs in the penultimate and final paragraphs ("observed solitude of the library's infinite corridors"). The tone remains coherent and modulates subtly from hushed opening to charged projection moment to quiet return. However, it does not pressure or reweight the final image with cost—solitude is static backdrop rather than a stance that crystallizes under escalation. Present in setup and closure, with consistent atmospheric texture, but lacks the charge or friction that would lift it above mid-band.</comment>
