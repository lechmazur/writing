<question>1</question>
<grade>3.8</grade>
<comment>Eli's motivation to "discover the color of sound" is told, not dramatized through contradictory impulses or genuine struggle. His journey unfolds without meaningful internal conflict or embodied emotion—he simply follows steps to a revelation that arrives without cost or renunciation. The interiority relies on abstract phrases ("luminous vow," "meteor hush") rather than character-particular thought patterns, and no micro-choice under pressure reveals a hierarchy of values. The final "fulfillment" lacks visible cost; Eli's vow is satisfied rather than tested.</comment>

<grade>4.2</grade>
<comment>The piece presents a quest structure (pier → hull → library → discovery) but lacks causal linkage; each step unfolds because the plot requires it, not because prior choices narrow options. The "hide behind truth" instruction is opaque and never clarified on the page, leaving the reader to infer meaning without dramatized friction. Closure arrives as satisfaction rather than decisive change or cost: Eli finds what he sought and simply vows to continue, with no visible trade-off or foreclosed path. The Orientation Test is waived (pier, night, lamplighter anchored early), but the Drive Lens remains ambiguous—neither causal pressure nor accumulative density coheres at the end.</comment>

<grade>5.4</grade>
<comment>Vivid, lyrical images (sea-glass windows, coral-like shelves, floating tomes) anchor the pier and sunken library with sensory specificity and tonal coherence. However, the environment never constrains a choice or alters tactics; Eli moves through spaces without friction, and the setting functions as backdrop rather than pressure. The library's mechanics (pages turning without wind, colors emitting from books) are asserted but not explored in ways that shape Eli's decisions. Spatial choreography is clear, and the tone is consistent, but the micro-setting does not charge the final image or force a trade-off.</comment>

<grade>3.6</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—discovering the color of sound—is signaled early but never tested or deepened by opposition. Eli's journey is frictionless: the key works, the door opens, the library appears, the revelation arrives. No reversal, tightening, or meaningful choice narrows options or forces a trade-off; the protagonist's agency is limited to observation and reception. The resolution is handed to Eli rather than earned through his alteration or renunciation, and no visible price is paid on the page. Escalation is absent under any lens.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>4.1</grade>
<comment>The concept of translating sound into color carries thematic potential, but the story asserts rather than dramatizes it. The final paragraph moralizes ("every vow, once luminous, can light the deepest ocean of forgotten libraries") instead of letting the image resonate. Eli's quest is framed as profound, yet no particular detail or contradiction earns the weight; the "luminous vow" remains abstract and untested. The ending offers a stated moral rather than a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>5.2</grade>
<comment>The prose establishes a consistent lyrical register with a distinct perceptual signature (meteor hush, luminous vow, salt-filled gloom). However, the narrator's voice relies on stock poetic constructions and elevated diction that flatten under repetition: "whispered in a tone," "a quiet river of stars," "a sleeping leviathan." Free indirect style is clean, and POV remains stable, but the rhythmic control is monotonous—most sentences follow a similar length and cadence, creating a drumbeat effect that dulls propulsion. No elision serves closure or imposes cost.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>4.6</grade>
<comment>Line-level craft is polished but overwritten. Figurative language appears in nearly every sentence without pattern-teaching or payoff: "meteor hush," "luminous vow," "sleeping leviathan," "coral in the salt-filled gloom." Mixed metaphors and register drift (e.g., "the color of that chord was a deep teal that pulsed like a heartbeat") muddle clarity without enhancing pressure. Paraphrase loops and template cadence are evident: "He believed… He understood… He lifted… He walked…" Repetitive sentence openings and uniform length create monotony, and the high density of metaphor in peak beats obscures rather than sharpens the moment. Apply −0.6 for density, −0.4 for template cadence, total −1.0 in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>3.2</grade>
<comment>The core premise—a lamplighter seeking the color of sound in a sunken library—is imaginative on paper but executed through stock quest-fantasy tropes without fresh transformation. Emotional truth is absent; Eli's journey feels like a checklist of whimsical elements rather than a lived experience with specific stakes. The "luminous vow" and "meteor hush" function as ornamental labels, and the ending's moralizing ("every vow, once luminous, can light the deepest ocean") reads as platitude rather than earned insight. The transformation test fails: swap names and places, and the arc remains a generic spiritual quest without particularity or risk.</comment>

<question>9 A</question>
<grade>2.4</grade>
<comment>Eli is present throughout and central to the plot, satisfying the setup and development gates. However, his role is largely observational and passive; he follows steps (finds key, opens door, reads book) without making choices that alter tactics or narrow options. The ending decision—to "keep seeking colors"—restates his initial vow rather than reflecting a turn or cost. He does not create key turns; he receives them. Score: setup +0.5, presence across beats +0.4, closure participation +0.3, but passive role and no causal pressure −1.0, swappability −0.4, summary-only closure −0.4. Net ~2.4.</comment>

<question>9 B</question>
<grade>4.8</grade>
<comment>The key tag is introduced early (setup +0.6), handled in two beats (drawer discovery, lock use +0.9), and present at closure when the ribbon binds it into a sigil (+0.5). However, its function is purely mechanical—it opens a door without constraint or cost—and the cryptic phrase "hide behind truth" is never clarified on the page, leaving its meaning ornamental. The final sigil moment is descriptive rather than action-driven. Swappability −0.5 (any key would work), ornamental use of phrase −0.5. Net ~4.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question>
<grade>2.1</grade>
<comment>The concept "luminous vows" appears early (setup +0.5) and recurs in the final paragraph (+0.3), but it functions as a thematic label rather than a stake that constrains choices or alters tactics. Eli's vow is stated, fulfilled, then restated; it does not create friction, trade-offs, or visible cost. The concept is summary-only and ornamental −0.8, swappable with "sacred promise" or similar −0.5. Net ~2.1.</comment>

<question>9 D</question>
<grade>1.8</grade>
<comment>The attribute "hides behind truth" is introduced mid-story as a cryptic phrase on the key tag. Eli "understood that the instruction meant he must hide behind truth—his own unspoken oath," but this is told rather than dramatized, and no on-page action demonstrates how hiding behind truth constrains or enables a choice with cost. The attribute remains a label without visible mechanism or trade-off. Late introduction −0.5, label-only −0.5, no causal pressure −0.8. Net ~1.8.</comment>

<question>9 E</question>
<grade>3.6</grade>
<comment>"Signify" appears twice: the key tag "signify[ing] the path," and the sigil beginning "to signify his next journey." Both uses are ornamental descriptions rather than actions that drive turns or redefine options. The verb does not constrain Eli's choices or shape the closure; it functions as thematic echo. Setup +0.4, two mentions +0.6, but ornamental use −0.8, swappable with "indicate" or "mark" −0.6. Net ~3.6.</comment>

<question>9 F</question>
<grade>2.9</grade>
<comment>The method "by wandering purposefully" is stated once: "By wandering purposefully, he traced the water's low murmur to the point where the hull… broke the surface." This single mention does not establish mechanics that shape subsequent attempts or constrain choices. The method is summary-only and not revisited at closure. Late introduction (second third) −0.3, one mention +0.4, no causal pressure −0.8, ornamental −0.5. Net ~2.9.</comment>

<question>9 G</question>
<grade>5.9</grade>
<comment>The sunken library is introduced in the first third (setup +0.6), occupies the middle sequence where Eli descends and discovers the books (development +0.9), and provides the revelation (closure participation +0.8). The setting is vividly described and atmospherically coherent. However, it does not constrain Eli's choices or supply resources that alter tactics; he simply observes the library's offerings without friction or cost. The library is essential to the plot's location but not to pressure or decision. Specificity +0.4, but no tactical constraint −0.8. Net ~5.9.</comment>

<question>9 H</question>
<grade>2.2</grade>
<comment>The sky lantern release is mentioned in the opening and closing paragraphs but does not tighten decisions or shape tactics. Time is vague—"Tonight" and "the night stretched"—with no live clock or urgency. The lanterns serve as atmospheric mirror to Eli's quest but exert no pressure on his choices or the closure's timing. Setup +0.4, closure mention +0.3, but no time pressure −0.8, ornamental use −0.5. Net ~2.2.</comment>

<question>9 I</question>
<grade>3.4</grade>
<comment>The motivation "to discover the color of sound" is stated early (setup +0.6) and frames Eli's journey (development +0.4), and the ending claims fulfillment (+0.3). However, the desire is told rather than dramatized; Eli expresses no conflict, doubt, or cost in pursuit of this goal. There is no friction between want and obstacle, and the resolution is satisfaction rather than sacrifice. Summary-only −0.6, no conflict −0.5, label-only trait −0.3. Net ~3.4.</comment>

<question>9 J</question>
<grade>3.7</grade>
<comment>"Meteor hush" is introduced early as the lantern's "soundless glow" (setup +0.6) and recurs in two later beats ("pier seemed to hold its breath in meteor hush," "guided by the same meteor hush") (+0.9). The tone is coherent and lyrical throughout, modulating slightly at closure when the image charges the final line (+0.5). However, the phrase itself is ornamental—a label for quietness without specific sensory grounding or pressure. The tone does not shift under stress or constrain choice. Ornamental use −0.5, label-only −0.4. Net ~3.7.</comment>
