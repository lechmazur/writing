<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The peacekeeper remains a label rather than a character with embodied contradictions or micro-choices under pressure. Interiority is abstract ("calmly intuitive," "shadow-laced") without concrete sensory detail or competing impulses. The reconstitution sequence lists actions but never dramatizes internal conflict or a felt cost that forecloses a path. Emotional progression is flat; the protagonist moves through beats without visible struggle or transformation earned by prior causality.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The story opens with vague spatial anchors ("lighthouse orchard," "shifting ice floes") that remain ungrounded past 120 words, triggering the Orientation Test penalty (−0.4). The inferred lens is Accumulative, but the closure—mirrors knitting the crystal whole—arrives without legible cost or a before/after that the protagonist's choices produced; the mirrors "sighed" and "glowed" autonomously. The final image ("world breathe in unison") asserts resonance rather than dramatizing a felt or conceptual price, and the causal chain from whisper to mirror-use lacks motivated linkage.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Setting details ("frosted roots," "weathered van," "tarnished mirrors") appear but remain postcard descriptions that do not constrain choice or alter tactics. The orchard and ice floes never pressure a decision; the protagonist walks through them without resistance. The crystal fragment and mirrors function as objects rather than micro-setting that charges the final image, and spatial choreography (distance from lighthouse to van, mirror arrangement) stays vague across moves.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—reconstituting the crystal—is signaled early but never tightens or deepens through protagonist agency; the mirrors perform the work autonomously. No on-page reversal or complication narrows options; the protagonist places the fragment, watches reflections, and whispers intention without a trade-off or felt price. Escalation is asserted ("fragment's heart pulse in rhythm with her own resolve") rather than dramatized through a decision that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Theme ("map empathy onto action," "willingness to listen") is stated multiple times in the final third rather than emerging from concrete particulars. The reconstituted crystal and blossoming orchard deliver symmetric satisfaction without ambiguity or cost. Subtext is absent; the peacekeeper's understanding is articulated directly ("true power lay not in the stone but in the willingness to listen") in place of a resonant image that invites reflection.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Narrative distance remains stable in third-person limited, and no head-hopping occurs. Perceptual signature is generic; diction ("shadow-laced," "quiet call," "tentative green") could belong to any fantasy narrator. Filter verbs ("felt," "sensed," "understood") stack without voice-motivated purpose, dulling immediacy in high-pressure beats. Psychic distance flattens rather than modulating with emotional intensity, and the prose lacks character-specific rhythm or idiom.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: "fragment's rhythm matched the breath of the lighthouse" and "lighthouse's beam turned gentle, wrapping the scene in warmth" restate resonance without adding pressure. Template cadence runs through the middle third ("She recalled... She slipped... She placed... She watched... She felt"). Stock metaphors ("like water," "like snow on a quiet night") and elevated diction ("reconstitute lost wholeness," "sync with the sea's pulse") clash with embodied immediacy. Cumulative artifact penalty: −1.0 in Q7; final-third presence disallows 9+ globally and caps high-band entries at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The premise—mystical object restoration via vintage mirrors—follows a familiar template (broken artifact, magical method, symbolic closure) without transformation through specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The peacekeeper's journey lacks bold risk or fresh synthesis; "anomalies become ordinary once shared" is a tidy moral rather than an earned insight. Turns feel scripted rather than inevitable in hindsight, and the world logic (mirrors "sigh," spirits debate) borrows stock fantasy conventions without grounding them in this story's rules.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The shadow-laced peacekeeper is present throughout but makes no decision that creates a key turn. She recalls, slips, places, watches, whispers, and walks—all observational or procedural actions. The mirrors and crystal perform the reconstitution autonomously; her agency is limited to alignment and intention without visible cost or a choice that narrows options.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The broken crystal ball fragment appears early (setup), is handled in the middle (placed on mirror), and is reconstituted at the end (closure participation). It shapes the dominant stake and returns with reweighted meaning (from broken to whole, guiding lost sailors). However, its mechanics are passive; it "pulsed" and "glimmered" without the protagonist's actions creating the transformation through cost or sacrifice, limiting causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>The "courageous anomaly" is mentioned twice as a label ("courageous anomaly that refused to surrender," "courageous anomaly awaken within the crystal") but never shapes stakes or tactics on the page. It functions as thematic echo rather than a constraint or enabler that alters the protagonist's options or forces a trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Calmly intuitive" appears once as a label ("Her mind, calmly intuitive, sensed") but does not constrain or enable an on-page action with cost. No visible tradeoff or decision-point hinges on this trait; it describes the protagonist's perceptual mode without dramatizing a choice where calmness or intuition forecloses an alternative.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Reconstitute" is the central action and frames the dominant stake. It appears in the first third ("reconstitute lost wholeness") and the climax ("reconstituted sphere pulsed brighter"). However, the action is performed by the mirrors rather than the protagonist's causal chain; her role is procedural (placing, aligning, whispering) without the reconstitution redefining her options through a cost she pays.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The method ("via glimpses in vintage store mirrors") is signaled early ("recalled an ancient method") and the mirrors appear in the middle third, satisfying setup and development. However, their mechanics are told rather than dramatized: the mirrors "sighed" and "rippled" autonomously, showing reflections without the protagonist shaping or testing the method through attempts or failure. Swappable with minor edits (any mystical viewing device).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The lighthouse orchard perched above shifting ice floes is named early and provides spatial backdrop. The orchard blossoms at the end, contributing to closure. However, the setting never pressures a choice or supplies a resource that alters outcome; the protagonist walks through it without resistance or tactical constraint. Postcard description rather than micro-setting that shapes moves.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"During the weighted breath before reply" appears once in the first third as a phrase ("the weighted breath before reply—she felt the weight of unspoken hopes") but does not tighten decisions or track elapsed time. No live clock alters the protagonist's tactics; the timeframe remains vague and atmospheric rather than imposing a deadline or urgency.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"To map empathy onto action" is stated directly in the climax ("whispered the intention to map empathy onto action") and again in the final line. It frames the dominant motivation but is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choices or friction between want and cost. The protagonist's empathy is asserted without an on-page moment where mapping it onto action requires a sacrifice or trade-off.</comment>
