<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The alchemist remains a vessel for abstract concepts rather than a person making contradictory choices under pressure. Interiority consists entirely of label-only states ("stoically sensitive," "hopeless," "quiet triumph") without embodied sensation or visceral contradiction. The protagonist never makes a difficult trade-off; each step succeeds incrementally without cost, and the final "revival" arrives without any visible price paid—no exhaustion, no resource depletion, no relational or moral friction. Therapy-speak and diagnostic phrasing ("stoically sensitive," "fragile curiosity") recur throughout, flattening the character into a mood board.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed: who this person is, where the nexus sits in space, and what "twilight" means as duration remain vague past the 120-word mark, triggering the −0.3 penalty and capping Q3 at 7.0. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (ritual repetition, density increase via tincture variations), but escalation is weak—each elixir application succeeds without complication, and the final "eruption" lacks a legible cost or choice that forecloses a prior path. Closure occurs on the page (the crozier vivifies, the realm responds), but the cost is asserted rather than dramatized: no visible sacrifice, failed attempt, or relational price anchors the transformation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The ember nexus is described vividly ("amber gloom," "frozen bloom") and recurs across beats, but it does not constrain a choice or alter tactics—it functions as backdrop rather than pressure. Spatial choreography is unclear: the nexus, tower, market square, and "realm" float without legible distance or layout. The crozier's physical handling (brushing liquid, watching metal sigh) grounds some moments, and the final placement "at the heart of the nexus" charges the ending image enough to lift the score into mid-6s despite the cap from orientation debt.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—vivifying the crozier to interrupt destiny—is signaled early, but escalation is absent: each tincture application advances smoothly without reversal, complication, or trade-off. The protagonist's agency never forecloses a path or pays a price; no failed attempt, no resource scarcity, no moral friction. The "penny drops" marker recurs but triggers no tightening—it times actions without consequence. Closure asserts transformation ("destiny no longer predetermined") without dramatizing the cost that makes the shift legible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Creative destruction" is declared repeatedly but never enacted with visible friction; the alchemist does not tear or lose anything meaningful before rebirth. The final paragraph moralizes the theme overtly: "forged a new future through patient, creative destruction" and "even broken things can bloom anew" replace scene pressure with summary. Subtext is absent—every thematic claim is stated directly rather than embodied in a choice or image that reweights prior material.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited, and the voice maintains a lyric register throughout. However, diction drifts into generic elevated phrasing ("silent promise," "whispered promise," "quiet triumph") that could describe any contemplative protagonist. Perceptual signature is weak: the alchemist notices in committee-voice abstractions rather than through a distinctive sensory or conceptual filter. No dialogue is present. Filter verbs ("sensed," "felt," "realized") cluster without voice-motivated purpose, dulling immediacy in peak beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: "The powder glowed faintly" / "The resulting elixir hissed, then settled" / "A frozen bloom of light unfurled" cycle through synonym variations without added pressure. Template cadence dominates: "He mixed… He brushed… He waited… He adjusted…" runs for six consecutive beats, triggering −0.6. Stock metaphors ("dying hearth," "silent promise" ×3, "frozen bloom" ×4) stack without specificity. Figurative language appears in nearly every sentence of the climax without pattern-teaching or payoff, applying an additional −0.5 for density in high-pressure beats. Artifacts touch the closure beat ("a silent promise that even broken things can bloom anew"), disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8 per the artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The core premise—alchemist revives a holy relic through incremental experiment—follows a recognizable template without fresh synthesis. "Creative destruction," "frozen bloom," and "when the penny drops" are prompt elements used as labels rather than transformed through specific world logic or character cost. The emotional arc (hopeless → purposeful) could transpose to any setting without alteration, failing the transformation test. No bold risk-taking or non-obvious moral calculus; the narrative chooses the median safe path throughout.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The hopeless alchemist is named in the opening and drives all on-page actions (grinding, mixing, applying tinctures), satisfying setup and development gates. However, his choices do not create turns—each decision succeeds incrementally without complication or cost. The final placement of the crozier involves him but is passive observation rather than a choice that forecloses options. Present across beats but replaceable with "determined artisan" or "patient craftsman" without structural loss. Late-arrival and ornamental-use penalties do not apply, but swappability (−0.6) and lack of causal pressure (no bonus) hold the score low.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The broken crozier appears in the second sentence (setup), is handled in multiple beats (brushing liquid, watching pulse, placing at nexus), and shapes the ending image (development and payoff gates satisfied). Its "shattered wood" and "splintered crook" constrain the protagonist's goal, and its transformation drives the visible arc. However, the crozier does not impose cost—no risk of further breakage, no failed repair that alters tactics. Causal pressure (+0.9 for two beats) and closure linkage (+1.2) lift the score, but swappability (any broken sacred object would serve similarly, −0.5) and lack of tied cost (−0.3) prevent higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Creative destruction" is mentioned five times but never dramatically enacted: the alchemist does not destroy, dismantle, or sacrifice anything on the page. The concept appears as thematic narration ("creative destruction demanded further tearing") without shaping a choice or tactic. Setup gate is satisfied (paragraph five), but development and payoff gates fail—no middle choice hinges on it, and the ending asserts it in summary rather than demonstrating it through action. Ornamental use (−0.8) and summary-only (−0.6) penalties apply.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Stoically sensitive" appears in paragraph two and recurs once ("His heart, stoically sensitive, surged"). The trait is label-only—it does not constrain or enable an on-page action with visible cost. Setup gate satisfied, but development and payoff gates fail. Ornamental mention (−0.8) and label-only trait (−0.3 text-pattern) apply, and the late first functional appearance (second third, −0.3) further lowers the score.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Vivify" is named as the goal in paragraph six, enacted through the tincture applications (middle beats), and achieved in the climax when "the crozier erupted" and its light "vivify the realm" (all three gates satisfied). The action drives the structure and closure. However, it does not create turns—each step succeeds without reversal—and swappability is moderate (any restorative ritual could replace it with minor edits, −0.5). Early signal (+0.5), beat involvement across three moves (+1.4), and closure linkage (+1.4) elevate; lack of tied cost (−0.3) and moderate swappability prevent higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Successive approximation" is named in paragraph seven, demonstrated in the repeated tincture adjustments (development), and implicit in the final eruption (payoff). Setup occurs late (beyond the first third, −0.4), but the method shapes multiple attempts (two distinct beats, +0.9) and enables the climax. Specificity is weak—"minute increase" and "adjusted concentration" are generic descriptions without unique mechanics that would fail if swapped for "trial and error" (−0.6 for swappability). Causal pressure is present but modest (+0.7), and closure linkage is indirect (+0.5).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The ember nexus appears in the opening line (setup), supplies ash for the first tincture (development), and "pulsed in response" at the climax (payoff; all gates satisfied). However, it functions as backdrop rather than constraint—no access limitation, spatial challenge, or resource scarcity alters tactics. The protagonist can gather sparks freely without cost. Two-beat involvement (+0.9) and closure presence (+0.8) lift the score, but ornamental use (postcard description without pressure, −0.7) and swappability (any magical workshop, −0.5) cap it below 5.5.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"When the penny drops" is introduced in paragraph eight as a recurring marker, times two tincture adjustments (development), and marks "the last time" at the climax (payoff; all gates satisfied). However, it does not tighten decisions—the alchemist waits for the cue but never faces a risk of missing it or a cost for mistiming. The timeframe is ambient rather than a live clock that alters moves. Two-beat involvement (+0.9) and closure mention (+0.5) apply, but lack of tactical pressure (no causal bonus) and vague mechanics (−0.5 for swappability with any ritual timing) hold the score low.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"To interrupt a stifling destiny" is stated in paragraph ten (setup beyond first third, −0.3) and asserted at closure ("destiny was no longer predetermined"). The motivation is told rather than dramatized—no on-page moment shows the alchemist struggling between fear of failure and hope, or paying a relational or moral cost to pursue freedom. Development and payoff gates are marginal (closure assertion without enacted friction). Ornamental framing (−0.7) and summary-only treatment (−0.6) apply; lack of visible cost (no bonus) and late setup further lower the score.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Frozen bloom" recurs six times, anchoring the tone from "frozen bloom of twilight" in paragraph thirteen to "frozen bloom of flame" at the climax (setup and payoff satisfied). The oxymoron (cold fire) is coherent and charges the final image with paradox. However, tone does not modulate—every beat shares the same hushed, lyric register without breathing or tightening under pressure. Early seed (+0.6), closure linkage (+1.2), and specificity (+0.5) elevate; static mood across all beats (no modulation, capping mid-band) and ornamental mid-story mentions (−0.4) prevent higher scores.</comment>
