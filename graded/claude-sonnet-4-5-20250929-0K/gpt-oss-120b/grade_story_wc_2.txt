<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mara's interiority leans heavily on abstract philosophical positioning ("uncertainly certain pull," "befriend uncertainty") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. Her decision to follow the compass lacks visible internal conflict or cost—she simply proceeds through a sequence of discoveries without meaningful hesitation or trade-off. The final "smile" and comfort with uncertainty read as resolution without earned struggle; no path is foreclosed with visible price. Body and emotion remain mostly labeled rather than enacted in micro-choices that reveal competing impulses.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes who/where/when adequately within the first third and maintains spatial coherence through the tunnel-greenhouse-cavern sequence. However, the closure is a thematic echo rather than a decisive change or renunciation with felt cost—Mara "finally felt a harmony" and offers the compass to city planners, but no prior option is foreclosed on the page and the stakes never narrow. The narrative operates in Accumulative/Textural mode but delivers conceptual statement ("trust uncertainty") instead of a resonant reconfiguration that reweights prior pressure. The brazier inscription functions as overt theme delivery rather than image-based repricing.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The subterranean waterfall, phosphorescent algae, and greenhouse with swirling leaves are vividly rendered and consistently tracked through spatial moves. The compass rose placed on the stone pedestal and later the brazier provides tactile anchoring. Setting does constrain Mara's path (the fissure behind the waterfall), meeting the 9+ gate test in principle, but the environment never forces a difficult choice or alters tactics under resistance—it merely stages sequential discoveries. Sensory detail is selective and voice-filtered, avoiding catalog syndrome.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Mara's search for meaning in broken relics—is signaled early but never tightens into a dilemma with visible cost. The compass points, she follows, discovers inscription, and accepts its lesson without resistance or sacrifice. No reversal or narrowing occurs; coincidence (courier delivery, leaf swirl, needle swing) propels each step rather than protagonist agency under opposition. The brazier scene could provide escalation but instead delivers thematic conclusion without a prior climb or trade-off. Pressure remains static rather than accumulating toward a choice that forecloses alternatives.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The theme of embracing uncertainty versus seeking perfect order emerges from Mara's craft and the compass metaphor, and the brazier inscription makes it explicit. However, the final beat articulates the theme in near-prompt language ("uncertainly certain that the future will always be a swirl of hidden currents beneath the ashes") rather than letting image and action alone do the work. The compass-as-metaphor is stated outright ("she understood that the compass was a metaphor"), violating show-through-particulars. The ending offers a conceptual answer but with declarative framing instead of resonant ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Voice remains consistent in third-person limited with stable psychic distance and a lyric-philosophical register that suits the material. Perceptual signature is present (moss light, ozone smell, drip-drip rhythm) and character-specific. However, diction occasionally drifts into abstract elevation ("paradox itself were a compass," "when coincidence becomes pattern") that sits at the edge of the POV's plausible lexicon during action beats. No head-hopping or tense breaks. The prose has intentional rhythmic patterning but some phrases echo prompt language too closely, reducing voice particularity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and information density is generally high; spatial choreography tracks cleanly through tunnel, greenhouse, cavern, and fissure. The piece avoids major loops or scaffold but exhibits mild synonym churn around "uncertainty" and repeats the stem "She [verb]" across multiple adjacent beats in the middle third. A few figurative phrases stack without clear payoff ("swirl of hidden currents beneath the ashes" recurs without evolving pressure). The brazier scene delivers clarity and momentum, keeping the closure beat clean. Proofreading is solid; no grammatical breaks.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The core premise—tinkerer follows mystical compass to discover thematic inscription—maps closely to quest-for-meaning templates without significant transformation through world logic or character-specific stakes. The greenhouse, waterfall, and brazier function as atmospheric stages rather than obstacles that Mara must overcome through ingenuity tied to her craft. The "broken-clock tinkerer" detail is evocative but underutilized; the compass could guide any seeker. The inscription payoff is direct thematic statement rather than an earned, non-obvious synthesis. Specificity in setting detail (phosphorescent moss, silver dust) provides texture but does not fundamentally alter the template arc.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The broken-clock tinkerer identity is present throughout (workbench, collection of relics, final creation of a waterfall-driven clock) and frames Mara's worldview. However, her craft does not constrain or enable key turns—she never uses tinkering skill to solve a problem or make a tactical choice under pressure. The final clock creation is a thematic echo rather than a causally necessary action. Present in setup and closure but functionally ornamental; her decisions (follow compass, slip through fissure, place compass on brazier) are generic seeker moves, not tinkerer-specific.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The admiral's compass rose appears in the opening (courier delivery), midpoint (placed on pedestal, needle quivers), and closure (placed on brazier, reveals inscription). It drives at least two beats (pointing to tunnel, pointing to fissure) and its hidden inscription shapes the thematic resolution. However, it functions as a mystical plot device rather than an object whose specific properties (admiral's history, frozen needle, battle context) matter causally. Swappable with any enchanted artifact that points and reveals. Strong beat involvement but low irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Beneath the ashes" is seeded in the opening (burned citadel backstory) and returns in the final line ("swirl of hidden currents beneath the ashes of the past") and at the brazier ("fire had refused to die beneath the ashes"). It shapes the thematic frame but not the on-page stakes or tactics—Mara never excavates literal ashes or confronts destruction as an obstacle. The concept functions as metaphorical container rather than a constraint that alters choices. Early signal, closure reprise, but mid-band causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Uncertainly certain" is labeled in the opening ("felt an uncertainly certain pull") and echoed in the final line ("uncertainly certain that the future will always be a swirl"). It describes Mara's stance but does not constrain an action with visible cost—she never hesitates between certainty and uncertainty in a way that forecloses an option. The trait is asserted rather than dramatized through a trade-off. Label-only with thematic reprise; no on-page friction or price.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Improvise" is named explicitly ("decided to improvise a method") and frames the greenhouse test, and the theme urges improvisation over "preset gears." However, Mara's actions are not improvisational in execution—she follows a linear sequence (place compass, follow needle, discover inscription) without adapting under surprise or constraint. The brazier moment could show improvisation but instead delivers revelation. The action is thematically present and early-signaled but does not drive key turns through on-page adjustment under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The neglected greenhouse with swirling leaves is introduced early as Mara's planned method and used in the middle beat (compass on pedestal, leaves scatter silver dust, needle quivers). The leaves return at the end "swirling faster, as if applauding." The method enables the discovery (needle points to tunnel) and receives a charged reprise. However, the greenhouse mechanics (why leaves swirl, how they interact with compass) remain unexplained, and the method could be replaced by any divinatory setup. Two-beat involvement plus closure echo, but mid-range causal necessity.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The subterranean waterfall is discovered at midpoint, supplies sensory pressure (mist, ozone, drip-drip rhythm, cool spray), and houses the fissure that leads to the brazier—directly enabling the climax. Mara's new clock will "run on the rhythm of the subterranean waterfall," tying it to closure. The setting is specific, irreplaceable (only this waterfall hides the fissure and provides the rhythm), and active across beats. Strong setup-development-payoff with clear causal role and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"When coincidence becomes pattern" is named once in the middle ("a moment she had long anticipated") and echoed in the final paragraph's "pattern" language, but no on-page timestamp or decision window is tracked. The timeframe is conceptual rather than a pressure device—Mara never races against or waits for a specific moment when pattern crystallizes. The element frames the theme but does not tighten tactics. Late functional appearance, thematic reprise, but no clock that alters moves.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"To befriend uncertainty in planning" is stated explicitly in the middle third and drives the thematic arc. Mara's journey enacts this motivation (she trusts the compass's unknown direction, whispers willingness to follow), and the brazier inscription confirms it. However, the desire is told more than dramatized—no scene shows her wrestling between a safer, certain path and the uncertain one with visible cost of choosing. The motivation is present across beats and closure but lacks on-page friction or trade-off that would elevate it into high bands.</comment>
