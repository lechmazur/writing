<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Mara operates as a label ("lucid dream chronicler") rather than a character with contradictory impulses. Her interiority consists of abstract declarations—"words could heal with words," "understanding dawns only when the stars themselves shift"—without embodied emotion or micro-choices under pressure. The decoding task unfolds through passive witnessing and whispered affirmations rather than decisions that foreclose paths with visible cost. No meaningful change or credible endurance is earned; the burden "lifts" conveniently without dramatized sacrifice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The piece establishes who/where/when adequately but proceeds via "and then" sequencing: telegram arrives, dome opens, she aligns telescope, inscription appears, temple opens. No because/therefore linkage tightens options; each step grants Mara exactly what she needs without friction. The ending offers no decisive change, renunciation, or conceptual repricing with felt cost—burdens are "shared" and doors open without on-page trade-off. Orientation Test penalty (−0.3) waived as anchors appear early, but causality remains decorative rather than motivated.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The observatory setting is vividly described—"marble chair," "telescope lenses," "dome opened"—and the variable stars provide atmospheric texture. However, the environment never constrains a choice or alters tactics; Mara moves freely through the space, and props appear when needed without spatial friction. The daylily telegram and crystal function as thematic tokens rather than objects that force trade-offs. Micro-setting potential exists but is not leveraged for pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—decode temple inscriptions—is declared but never tested by meaningful opposition or cost. Each step (journal review, telescope alignment, glyph decoding) resolves smoothly without reversals or tightening that narrows options. The "shared burden" concept operates as theme rather than a constraint that forces sacrifice. No on-page price is paid; the temple door simply opens and the crystal confirms success, undercutting any sense of escalation or agency-driven closure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Shared burdens" and "words heal" are asserted repeatedly but never dramatized through concrete trade-offs or earned insight. The ending delivers a thematic summary—"burdens would always be shared"—rather than a resonant image that reweights prior material. Epiphanies ("understanding dawns," "the universe was offering her a method") arrive as declarations instead of emerging from specific struggle. The final paragraph moralizes explicitly, penalized −0.6 per guidelines.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization is clean with no head-hopping, and the prose maintains a consistent elevated register. However, diction frequently overreaches—"letting the midnight solace…seep into her bones," "whispered a prayer of gratitude"—into pseudo-poetic phrasing that blurs specificity. Perceptual signature is generic: Mara notices "glyphs that glowed," "stars flickered," without character-particular selectivity. No dialogue appears. Voice remains stable but lacks the texture and urgency needed for higher bands.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Heavy paraphrase loops and template cadence pervade: "She knew…She realized…She felt…She understood" across consecutive beats. Figurative language appears in nearly every sentence ("restless night," "fragrant paper curling like a sigh," "residue of her recent lucid dreams") without pattern-teaching or payoff, triggering density penalties. Mixed metaphors ("burden…settle in her chest," "words…mend…as gently as sunrise mends night") reduce clarity. Stock phrases ("the weight lift," "the promise of a new understanding dawning") dull momentum. Cumulative artifact penalties: paraphrase loops −0.4, template cadence −0.6, figurative density −0.5, total deduction ~−1.5 in Q7; disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band entries at 8.8 per artifact rules.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The premise—mystical decoder uses dreams and stars—relies on familiar template elements (observatory, ancient inscriptions, cosmic alignment) without fresh synthesis. The "daylily telegram" adds decorative specificity but does not transform the core arc. Each turn follows predictable beats: mysterious message → dream guidance → celestial decoding → temple opens. The transformation test fails: swap names and setting, the emotional and plot arc remains identical. No bold risk heightens stakes; the piece hedges into safe mysticism without surprising inflection.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>Mara is present throughout but makes no on-page choice that alters tactics or narrows options. She passively receives the telegram, recalls a dream, aligns a telescope, and witnesses inscriptions appear. The role "lucid dream chronicler" functions as a label rather than a trait that constrains decisions. No cost is tied to her agency; the story would function identically if she were any mystical observer. Ornamental presence, late-penalty waived as she appears in opening, but causal work is absent: default ~3.0, minus ornamental use −0.5, minus swappability −0.3 = 2.2, round to 2.3.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The daylily telegram appears in three beats: arrival, Mara whispers its message, and it reappears beside the crystal at the end. However, it never constrains a choice or enables a tactic—Mara would decode the temple identically without it. The "scent of daylilies" recurs as atmospheric detail rather than charged reprise. Setup and closure participation present, but middle development absent (cap 3.4 applies). Lyric reprise lifts slightly: 3.4 cap +1.2 beat involvement +0.2 early signal = 4.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Shared burdens" is declared in the telegram and echoed thematically ("she felt the burden lift," "burdens would always be shared") but never dramatically tested. Mara does not sacrifice, delegate, or trade to share a cost on the page; the concept remains abstract. No middle beat uses it to narrow options. Present in setup and closure as theme, but not as causal pressure: 3.0 default +0.3 setup −0.5 ornamental −0.3 label-only = 2.5, round to 2.5. Adjusting for thematic closure mention: 3.1.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Heals with words" is stated twice ("words could heal with words," "healed the world with words") but never enacted with visible cost. Mara whispers the telegram and offers a prayer, but no on-page consequence or trade-off follows. The trait is label-only; swapping it for "decodes with insight" would not alter the plot. Setup present, closure cameo, but no middle use or cost: 3.0 default +0.2 setup −0.5 label-only −0.3 swappability = 2.4, round to 2.6 for closure echo.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Witness" shapes the entire arc: Mara witnesses dreams, variable stars, projected inscriptions, and the temple interior. The action is present in setup, middle, and closure. However, witnessing is passive—she observes rather than decides—so it does not narrow options or impose cost. The verb is specific but does not transform the stakes. All three gates met: 6.0 base −0.4 passivity −0.4 swappability (could be "discover" or "perceive") = 5.2.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Through variable stars" is signaled early ("decode…through variable stars"), dramatized in the middle beat (telescope alignment matching star rhythm), and present at closure ("variable stars that had guided her," stars "pulsed brighter"). The method constrains her approach—she must read the sky—and charges the final image. All three gates met, causal pressure moderate: 6.0 base +0.5 causal pressure +0.4 one beat +0.7 closure linkage −0.4 swappability (could use constellations) −0.3 specificity moderate = 6.9, cap at 5.9 due to passivity overlap with action.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The observatory is present throughout, providing the telescope, dome, and marble chair. It supplies resources (telescope, lens) and frames the entire sequence. However, it never pressures a choice—Mara moves freely, and the environment adapts to her needs without friction. Setup, middle resource use, and closure participation all present: 6.0 base +0.4 one beat +0.3 setup +0.3 closure −0.4 no constraint on choice −0.5 postcard description bias = 5.7, adjusted to 6.1 for resource provision across beats.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"When understanding dawns" is referenced thematically ("understanding dawns only when the stars themselves shift," "the promise of a new understanding dawning") but does not function as a live clock that tightens decisions. The timeframe is "tonight" and progresses to "dawn," yet no urgency or deadline alters Mara's tactics. Setup and closure mentions present, but no middle pressure: 3.0 default +0.3 setup +0.2 closure echo −0.3 vague tracking = 3.2, round to 3.4 for dual mention.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"To decode temple inscriptions" is the stated goal, present in setup, pursued in the telescope alignment and glyph-reading beats, and completed at closure when the temple opens. The motivation is clear and consistent. However, it lacks internal friction—Mara never hesitates, questions, or sacrifices to pursue it. All three gates met: 6.0 base +0.9 two beats +0.3 setup +0.7 closure linkage −0.8 told-only, no friction −0.4 swappability (any mystical quest) −0.4 summary of key involvement = 6.3.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Midnight solace" appears as a phrase ("midnight solace of the empty corridors," "a lullaby of midnight solace," "midnight solace lingered in her bones") and the tone is consistently hushed and contemplative. However, tone does not modulate with pressure—no shift in rhythm or diction as stakes rise—and the static mood never charges a choice. Setup, middle, and closure mentions present, but no tonal escalation: 6.0 base +0.3 setup +0.2 closure −0.8 static mood −0.5 decorative −0.5 template phrasing = 4.7.</comment>
