<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Eliam's role as carver is richly drawn through sensory-specific gestures ("hands shivered stone"), but his journey from observation to action lacks on-page contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. Mara appears as a pure guide without internal tension, and the family dinner ritual is told rather than dramatized with conflicting impulses. The ending declares understanding ("he understood that the shape of collective grief was not a jagged scar but a flowing tapestry") without showing a visible choice or forfeiture that closes a live path. Label-only interiority ("fiercely meditative river," "thundering calm") floods the prose without embodied micro-decisions that test commitment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation arrives cleanly (Eliam, greenhouse, dusk), but the drive lens remains ambiguous—accumulative texture competes with causal mentorship without clarifying which governs closure. The ending offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (the carved basin monument), yet the cost is conceptual and implied rather than felt on the page; no sentence makes visible what Eliam loses or forecloses by this act. The piece teaches a lyric pattern early, but the final image does not reweight prior material with undeniable pressure—it illustrates a thesis already stated. Accumulative density peaks mid-story (ribbon, butterfly spiral, poems), then plateaus rather than tightening options at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The greenhouse is vividly anchored with "glass panes frosted with the memory of seasons" and "jasmine intertwined with the metallic tang of stone," and the highest arch becomes a functional convergence point for the butterfly spiral. The ribbon roll rests "beside the stone table," grounding micro-setting. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or alter tactics—Eliam arranges stones and unfurls ribbons without friction from the space itself. The final basin monument is described but does not emerge from a greenhouse-specific resource or obstacle, capping the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—mapping collective grief into a monument—is signaled early and sustained, but escalation is spread across descriptive beats (spiral grows, ribbon unwinds) rather than a tightening choice that narrows options. The butterfly migration's "final wave" and the carved basin arrive as fulfillment, not reversal or deepening with visible cost. Mara's mentorship supplies information without opposition, and the family dinner ritual is told in summary. One meaningful turn occurs when Eliam "knelt, feeling the weight of each poem, each butterfly, each stone," but the act does not foreclose a live alternative or exact a felt price—he simply proceeds to carve. Coincidence (butterflies gathering at dusk) complicates texture but does not raise stakes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Theme—grief as a flowing tapestry rather than a jagged scar—emerges from the ribbon, butterfly, and basin imagery, which recur with shifting weight. However, the final paragraph states the theme overtly ("he understood that the shape of collective grief was not a jagged scar but a flowing tapestry"), reducing resonance to thesis. The carved basin with rain-water is a purposeful image, yet it illustrates rather than complicates the premise. Subtext operates in the greenhouse's "paradox" and Mara's whispered guidance, but the ending explains meaning instead of letting the monument speak. The piece resists tidy morals in its middle beats, then delivers a summary in the penultimate line.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited to Eliam, with distance controlled throughout. Perceptual signature is present in diction ("fiercely meditative river," "thundering calm"), but these phrases recur as labels rather than shifting under pressure. Diction occasionally slips into elevated register ("collective grief," "spectral mentorship") that reads more authorial than character-particular. The family dinner poems are told in summary ("Eliam would recite a poem about winter stone, and his sister would offer one about sunrise lilies") without on-page dialogue to test voice distinction. No head-hopping, and the narrative stance is consistent, but the texture does not degrade or sharpen with emotional intensity—it remains uniformly ornate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout ("fiercely meditative river," "thundering calm," "flock of butterflies," "spectral figure," "river of color"), creating rhythmic beauty but obscuring sentence-level propulsion in peak beats. Paraphrase loops appear: "The ribbons, now unfurling like tiny flags, recorded each verse" and "the woven ribbon roll unwound more, its length becoming a river of color" restate the same image across adjacent paragraphs. Template cadence runs in the middle third ("Mara whispered," "Mara explained," "Mara's presence") and synonym churn surrounds "grief" (sorrow, mourning, aching heart). "Thundering calm" is a striking paradox but appears three times without evolving, reading as stock recurrence. The closing beat summarizes rather than showing Eliam's chisel at work, dulling the final image. Filter-verb stacks ("felt the weight," "felt Mara's presence") dull immediacy in high-pressure lines. Line-level artifacts touch the closure beat, triggering the disallow-9+ rule.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The carver-as-grief-mapper premise offers a fresh synthesis, and the butterfly migration as timeframe is non-obvious. However, the spectral mentor, the woven family heirloom, and the carved monument that "sings" are familiar magical-realism motifs executed without transformation. The ending's basin that collects rain is visually elegant but echoes countless "tears/rain = grief" images. The family dinner poems are mentioned but never dramatized, reducing them to decorative rather than lived detail. Emotional arc—observation to understanding to carving—follows a predictable apprenticeship template. The piece commits fully to its lyric voice, which partially offsets derivative elements, but the final image does not surprise or reweight prior material in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Eliam is present throughout but makes few on-page decisions that alter tactics. He observes butterflies, arranges stones, and carves the monument in fulfillment of Mara's instruction rather than through conflicted choice. The kneeling moment ("felt the weight of each poem") is realization, not decision. Introduced early, touches three beats (arrival, spiral, monument), but lacks causal pressure or visible cost. Mid-band, capped by passivity and swappability (another artisan could fulfill the same arc).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The ribbon roll appears early ("rested beside the stone table"), unfurls mid-story to map verses and butterfly paths, and coils into a heart shape that is etched onto the monument at closure. Three distinct beats with evolving function. However, its transformation is told ("its length becoming a river of color," "lay coiled in the shape of a great, soft-edged heart") rather than handled on the page, and its final state illustrates theme rather than constraining a choice. Strong setup and closure participation, but cost linkage is absent. Caps at upper 6-band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Mara introduces the premise ("only by learning the shape of collective grief could Eliam carve monuments") and reappears as guiding presence, but spectral mentorship supplies information without opposition or cost. The concept does not change options—Eliam follows her instruction linearly. Present in three beats (introduction, ribbon unfurling, ending breeze), but all are facilitative. No causal pressure, no tradeoff. Mid-band for presence and thematic accent, but lacks necessity.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Fiercely meditative" is labeled twice ("his mind was a fiercely meditative river," "fiercely meditative now") but never dramatized as a constraint or enabler. No on-page action tests the trait's cost or benefit. Ornamental descriptor, swappable with "contemplative" or "focused." Present but does not alter tactics or narrow options.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Eliam retraces butterfly flight paths to arrange the stone spiral, which becomes the monument's foundation. The action appears in two beats (observation, arrangement) and contributes to closure. However, the retracing is summary ("began to retrace the flight paths of the butterflies, noting how they gathered") rather than dramatized struggle, and another action (e.g., "map," "carve") could replace it with minor edits. Setup and closure present, but swappability and lack of visible cost cap at lower 6-band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>The family dinner custom is introduced mid-story, told in summary ("Eliam would recite a poem about winter stone, and his sister would offer one"), and reappears at closure ("the family's dinner tradition continued, each poem now echoing the stone's inscription"). Lyric reprise reweights meaning slightly, but no middle beat dramatizes the custom or uses it to constrain a choice. Two touches (introduction, ending), both summary. Swappable with another family ritual. Mid-4s for presence without causal work.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The greenhouse anchors every scene, provides the "highest arch" convergence point for butterflies, and houses the carved monument at closure. Its "glass panes" and "jasmine intertwined with metallic tang" are sensory-specific. The space enables the spiral arrangement and ribbon unfurling. Three beats (arrival, spiral, monument), and the final image depends on the greenhouse's transformation into sanctuary. Strong setup, development, and closure participation. However, the greenhouse does not impose a constraint—Eliam works freely—so causal pressure is absent. Upper 7-band for essentiality without friction.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The butterfly migration spans three months and structures the narrative arc (observation → spiral → final wave). Time is tracked in broad strokes ("each evening," "as the butterflies migrated further," "when the migration's final wave passed") and the ending spans "the evenings that followed" and "each year." The timeframe enables the spiral's growth and reappears at closure, but it does not tighten decisions—Eliam's work proceeds without urgency or deadline. Two gates (setup, closure), but middle development is passive. Mid-5s for structural presence without pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The desire to "map the shape of collective grief" is stated early ("his purpose was a quiet, thundering calm that rose from the collective grief of the town") and drives Eliam's nightly visits and monument design. It reappears at closure when he understands grief as "a flowing tapestry." Two beats (setup, realization), but the motivation is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choices. No on-page friction between this want and a competing cost. Mid-5s for thematic presence without embodied stakes.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Thundering calm" is labeled three times ("a quiet, thundering calm," "the thundering calm of the greenhouse," "the air resonated with the thundering calm") but does not modulate with pressure or shift in meaning. The tone remains uniformly serene and ornate throughout, with no tension between quietness and intensity enacted in syntax or pacing. Present and coherent, but static. Swappable with "serene intensity." Mid-4s for label-only consistency.</comment>
