<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Mirela's interiority is heavily abstract ("swallowed truth," "weight of truth") without concrete embodiment of the contradiction or struggle. The fever-recovery frame provides a state change, but her micro-choices (spreading paper, adjusting barometer) feel procedural rather than driven by competing impulses. The ending suggests a shift from inward to outward carrying of truth, but the cost is asserted ("heavy yet surprisingly light") rather than dramatized through a forfeited path or visible sacrifice. Backstory (the swallowed lie ceremony) anchors in the present stimulus but does not create friction that alters her stance on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the story builds through linked images (fever → illustration → smudged ink → barometer reading) toward a moment where truth "settles" and sorrow "fades into resolve." The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (resolve to carry truth outward), but cost remains conceptual and implied rather than undeniably legible in a final image or forfeited option. Orientation anchors (weather station, dawn, Mirela alone) appear early. The meaningful deepening occurs when the barometer reading "matched the weight of a stone," but this feels declared rather than earned by a visible turn or narrowed option that the reader witnesses.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The mountain weather station supplies concrete sensory anchors (rusted panels, humming console, amber lights, old heater's hiss, antennae swaying) that recur and frame the scene. The illustration's ink bleeding on cold glass is a micro-setting detail that enables the discovery moment. The setting does not constrain a choice under pressure, but it charges the final image when Mirela steps onto the deck and the wind lifts the paper edges. Spatial choreography is clean (console, deck, mountain beyond), and the auroral sky returns at closure to weight the tone.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"to find the weight of a swallowed truth"—is signaled early and pursued through the illustration ritual and barometer adjustment. Pressure tightens once when the final reading stabilizes and "matched the weight of a stone," but this moment is told rather than shown through a choice that forecloses an option. No reversal or complication tests Mirela's commitment; the sequence is additive (spread paper → smudge → adjust → read → resolve) without a turn that narrows tactics or raises cost. Agency is attention and interpretation rather than decision with visible trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Theme—truth, certainty, and the cost of carrying hidden knowledge—emerges through images (botanical illustration, smudged ink, stone, aurora) rather than direct statement. The illustration returns at closure with reweighted meaning (now "stained with the story of the mountain's breath"), and the auroral sorrow evolves into "quiet resolve." The ending offers a non-literal answer (truth as both heavy and light, sorrow as beautiful guide) without moralizing. However, phrases like "swaying certainties," "peripherally aware," and "occupying margins" read as thematic echo of the prompt rather than dramatized insight, and the final shift (inward to outward) is asserted rather than earned through a scene-tested choice.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Single-POV third-person limited with stable distance and a consistent lyric register ("bruised gold," "auroral sorrow," "a feather caught in a gale"). Perceptual signature leans abstract-poetic; diction ("fault-tolerant oracle," "peripherally aware," "occupying margins") mixes tech/scientific register with metaphysical phrasing in a way that feels prompted rather than organically Mirela's. No dialogue. Psychic distance is controlled, but the voice lacks a concrete, character-particular texture—descriptions could apply to any contemplative protagonist in an atmospheric setting. Under peak stress (discovering the barometer match), the prose remains uniformly figurative rather than compressing or tightening.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Significant overwriting and paraphrase loops: "swaying certainties" appears three times; "weight of truth" and synonyms (stone, heavy/light) recur without added pressure. Figurative density is high throughout ("bruised gold," "brittle leaf," "peripherally aware," "occupying margins," "feather caught in a gale") without teaching a pattern or varying rhythm. Template cadence in the final third: "She recalled… She adjusted… She inhaled… She folded… She stepped…" Metaphors occasionally muddle (aurora as "reminder that sorrow can be beautiful" is abstract rather than image-specific). The Text Artifact Screen triggers −0.6 for paraphrase loops and template stems; additionally, the figurative load in peak beats (barometer reading, final deck scene) obscures concrete action. Information density is low; many sentences restate mood or concept without advancing situation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The premise—oracle processing emotional truth through atmospheric data—offers a fresh frame, but execution leans on abstract metaphor and stock lyricism ("fever breaks," "truth as stone," "light and heavy") without grounding the process in specific, irreplaceable detail. The botanical illustration as encoded data sheet is an intriguing concept but remains ornamental; the smudging and barometer mechanics are described rather than shown to constrain or enable a non-obvious choice. The ending (truth carried outward, aurora lighting the path) resolves into a familiar arc of solitary epiphany without risk or complication. Transformation test: swap the weather station for another isolated setting and the emotional arc functions unchanged.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Mirela (fault-tolerant oracle) is present throughout and makes procedural moves (spreading paper, smudging ink, adjusting barometer), but these actions are reactive and interpretive rather than choices that create turns or narrow options. The "fault-tolerant" attribute is mentioned in the opening and echoed once ("algorithms… parsed the new patterns without faltering") but does not constrain or enable a decision with cost. She is the sole POV and drives the scene's attention, yet her agency is observation and ritual rather than a decision that alters tactics. Setup: yes (first line). Development: marginal (barometer adjustment is described, not a choice under pressure). Payoff: she steps onto the deck and opens the illustration, but this is enactment of resolve rather than a turn. Early signal +0.6, three beats (spread/smudge/adjust/deck) +1.4, but swappability (any contemplative character could perform these steps) −0.7, ornamental "fault-tolerant" label −0.5. Final: 4.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The botanical illustration is introduced early (first third), handled in multiple beats (spread, smudge, fold, open on deck), and returns at closure with reweighted meaning ("stained with the story of the mountain's breath"). Its ink bleeding on cold glass is the mechanism that reveals humidity/pressure data, and Mirela traces its veins in the final image. Setup: yes. Development: yes (smudging enables the discovery). Payoff: yes (final image). Early signal +0.7, three distinct beats +1.4, causal pressure (smudging reveals gradient) +0.8, closure linkage (final tracing on deck) +1.2, specificity (encoded in chlorophyll tones) +0.5. Friction: the mechanics of encoding remain vague, and the illustration could be swapped for another data artifact without breaking logic −0.5. The object is essential to the ritual but not to the outcome (the barometer reading confirms what the illustration whispers). Final: 6.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Swaying certainties" is a core concept mentioned three times (fever insight, intertwined with memory, final hum of the station) but functions as thematic label rather than shaping stakes or altering options. The fever shows her "certainty is a brittle leaf, swaying certainties that snap," but this insight does not generate a tactical choice or cost on the page; it is backdrop for the truth-seeking ritual. Setup: yes (first paragraph). Development: no (the concept is echoed but does not constrain action). Payoff: marginal (the station continues to "record swaying certainties," but Mirela's closure is about carrying truth, not managing uncertainty). Early signal +0.6, one thematic beat +0.4, but ornamental use (description without pressure) −1.0, swappability (concept could be "fragile knowledge" with minor edits) −0.7. Final: 3.6.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Peripherally aware" appears twice: the illustration is described as "peripherally aware of the station's atmospheric logs," and the oracle logs data "as peripherally aware data points that the world often ignores." This is a label-only attribute; it does not enable or constrain an on-page action or choice with visible cost. The concept colors the world-building (data at the margins) but remains metaphorical rather than mechanical. Setup: yes (first third, illustration description). Development: no (no choice hinges on peripheral awareness). Payoff: no (not present in or shaping the final image). Early signal +0.4, one thematic mention +0.4, but label-only trait without tradeoff −1.0, no causal pressure −0.8, no closure linkage −0.6. Final: 3.1.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Smudge" is the major action: Mirela places her hand to let skin heat smudge the ink, and the bleeding ink reveals humidity/pressure lines that whisper back the lie's mass. This action is central to the discovery beat and is specific to the illustration's encoding. Setup: yes (mid-first-third). Development: yes (the smudging is the mechanism of revelation). Payoff: marginal (the smudged veins are traced at the end, but the barometer reading, not the smudge itself, provides the "weight" that matches the stone). Early signal +0.5, two beats (smudge act, final tracing) +0.9, causal pressure (smudging enables discovery) +1.0, specificity (heat on cold glass) +0.5. Friction: the action could be replaced by another tactile reveal (wetting, folding, heating) without restructuring the plot −0.6, and the mechanics of how smudging encodes data are vague −0.4. Final: 5.9.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"By occupying margins" is a method mentioned twice: Mirela's hand "occupying margins where the image met the cold glass," and she adjusts the barometer "by occupying margins of its calibrated range." The phrase signals a tactic (working at edges or limits), but the mechanics are abstract and do not visibly shape attempts or alter options. The method is not taught early or tested under pressure; it appears as poetic phrasing rather than a constraint. Setup: yes (mid-first-third). Development: marginal (barometer adjustment mentions it, but the effect is told). Payoff: metaphorical only (the illustration's "margins themselves were guiding her"). Early signal +0.4, two mentions +0.9, but summary-only use (not dramatized with cost) −0.8, swappability (could be "by subtle adjustments" without edits) −0.7, no closure linkage −0.5. Final: 3.4.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The mountain weather station is the setting throughout: it supplies the console, barometer, heater, antennae, and deck. The station's atmospheric logs are peripherally encoded in the illustration, and its barometer reading provides the climactic "weight" match. The station does not constrain a choice under pressure, but it frames the ritual and charges the final image (Mirela steps onto the deck; the station "hums behind her, a sentinel"). Setup: yes (opening line). Development: yes (console and barometer are used). Payoff: yes (station hums as she leaves; aurora over mountain). Early signal +0.8, three beats (console, barometer, deck) +1.4, closure linkage (final hum and deck departure) +1.0, micro-setting (glass, cold, altitude) alters the smudging +0.6. Friction: the station is a backdrop rather than a constraint that narrows options −0.8, and the atmospheric data could come from another isolated tech setting with minor swaps −0.7. Final: 5.7.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"After fever breaks" is the timeframe noted in the opening: "the clock read the moment after fever breaks," and Mirela has "just emerged from the ward of her own body." This frames her state (clarity after delirium) but does not tighten decisions or create a live clock. The time window is a single post-fever morning/day/night sequence without pressure from elapsed time or deadline. Setup: yes (opening lines). Development: no (time does not constrain choices or tactics). Payoff: marginal (night falls at the end, but the passage of time is atmospheric rather than causal). Early signal +0.6, one thematic beat (fever insight) +0.4, but no causal pressure from time −1.0, vague tracking (dawn → night without stakes tied to duration) −0.5, no closure linkage −0.4. Final: 4.8.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"To find the weight of a swallowed truth" is Mirela's motivation, signaled early ("Mirela's purpose now was to find the weight…") and pursued through the illustration ritual and barometer reading. The desire is stated and enacted (she performs the ritual, finds the match), but it is not dramatized with friction between wants and costs. The "swallowed lie" backstory anchors the present quest, yet the discovery (barometer matches stone) is a confirmation rather than a choice with visible trade-off. Setup: yes (first third). Development: yes (the ritual is motivated by the quest). Payoff: yes (she finds the weight and resolves to carry it outward). Early signal +0.7, two beats (setup, discovery) +0.9, causal pressure (motivation drives all action) +1.2. Friction: the motivation is told rather than shown through competing desires −0.8, no on-page cost or sacrifice that tests commitment −0.9, and the resolution (truth as "heavy yet light") is asserted rather than earned through a forfeited option −0.6. Final: 5.3.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Auroral sorrow" is the tone established in the opening ("thin veil of auroral sorrow over her mind"), sustained through the mournful heater and swaying antennae, and returned at closure ("auroral sorrow… faded into a quiet resolve"; "sky burned with the pale glow of aurora, a reminder that sorrow can be beautiful"). The tone is coherent and modulates slightly (sorrow → resolve), charging the final image. Setup: yes (first paragraph). Development: yes (heater's mournful sound, swaying certainties). Payoff: yes (aurora lights the path; sorrow as beautiful guide). Early signal +0.7, three beats (opening veil, mournful heater, closing aurora) +1.4, closure linkage (tone shapes final image) +1.2, coherence across turns +0.5. Friction: the tone is consistent but static—sorrow does not deepen or complicate under pressure; it simply shifts to resolve −0.8, and "auroral sorrow" reads as a poetic label rather than embodied affect −0.6. Final: 5.6.</comment>
