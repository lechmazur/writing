<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Mira's interior is told rather than embodied; her "motivation was simple yet profound" arrives as exposition. The critical choice to step onto the spiral and "rejoin" lacks prior contradiction or struggle—she drifts toward it without visible cost or foreclosed path. Diagnostic label-speak ("keeper of secrets…inevitably whimsical") and summary interiority ("She realized…") replace scene pressure at the climax.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates prismatic imagery but the closure unit is unclear—Mira's final "rejoin" is asserted ("she had rejoined") rather than dramatized with a decisive act or visible cost. The spiral's mechanics (how letters "find homes," how the thread "unlocks") remain abstract; no on-page reversal or tightening narrows options. Orientation is present early (who/where/when by paragraph one), but causality from whispered letter → mosaic transformation → constellation → rejoin reads as declarative sequence without motivated ellipsis or visible price paid.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The lotus temple, pond, and spiral are vividly described with prismatic detail, but setting remains postcard backdrop. The spiral does not constrain a choice—Mira steps onto it without resistance or tactical shift. The "mosaic of whispered confessions" and "cascade of silver light" are visual spectacle without spatial consequence or resource cost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake ("find the thread that connects all things") is told in exposition but never tested on the page. No on-page reversal or tightening narrows options; Mira's approach to the spiral, whisper, step, and realization unfold without complication, refusal, or visible cost. The "rejoin" is declared complete without forfeiting a live option or altering tactics.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The "thread that connects all things" and "keeper of secrets" operate as abstract labels rather than emerging from dramatized particulars. The final paragraph overtly explains the cycle ("each secret weaving into the next") instead of charging the image. Recurrent motifs (thread, spiral, prismatic quiet) appear frequently but do not constrain choice or reweight meaning at closure—they are ornamental rather than causal.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited on Mira. Diction is elevated and consistent ("sequined ribbons," "vaulted ceiling blossomed with constellations") but not character-particular—register reads generic lyric rather than Mira's perceptual signature. Filter verbs ("she felt," "she realized," "she sensed") stack in peak beats, dulling immediacy. No dialogue is present to judge.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Heavy overwriting throughout: figurative language in nearly every sentence ("pale sunrise hovering," "sequined ribbons," "mosaic of whispered confessions," "cascade of silver light") without pattern-teaching or payoff. Paraphrase loops: "keeper of secrets" recurs with synonym variants; "prismatic quiet" appears three times without evolution. Template cadence in the middle: "She felt…She stepped…She realized…" Scaffold phrases ("simple yet profound," "role she could fulfill") lower density at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The core premise—ghostwriter at a temple art installation—is present but the synthesis is ornamental rather than causal. The "love letter ghostwriter" role and "thrush's nest twig spiral" do not transform familiar temple-as-liminal-space tropes; the emotional arc (seeking connection → finding it through art) could swap names and places without substantive change. Elevated diction and abstract motifs ("invisible thread," "chorus of hidden stories") read as template lyric rather than a singular vision.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Mira is present throughout and her role as ghostwriter frames the premise, but she makes no key turn—her approach, whisper, and step onto the spiral are consecutive actions without choice-pressure. The ghostwriter occupation is told in exposition ("known as the keeper of secrets") and does not constrain tactics or alter outcome.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The spiral appears early (paragraph six), is handled in two beats (Mira whispers into it; places the petal on its apex), and is present at closure ("remained, now a quiet monument"). However, its mechanics are abstract—twigs "respond" and "hum" without physical causality. Removing the spiral's specific form (thrush's nest twigs) would not break the story; any mystical conduit would function identically.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"Keeper of secrets" is a label applied to Mira in exposition ("She was known as…") and echoed thematically at closure ("content as a keeper of secrets"), but does not shape on-page stakes or tactics. The concept is told rather than enacted; no scene shows her keeping or revealing a secret with cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Inevitably whimsical" appears once as narrative summary ("a title that felt inevitably whimsical to those who whispered her name") and is not tied to any on-page action, constraint, or cost. The attribute is ornamental label-only.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Rejoin" is named as the key action late (paragraph nineteen: "the act of rejoin…was the key") and declared complete at closure ("she had rejoined the world of whispered hearts"), but is not dramatized as a turn. The action resolves a problem it did not help create—Mira was never shown separated or refusing connection. Swappable with "reconnect" or "return."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The public art installation (spiral) is signaled early (paragraph six) and its mystical function is described, but its mechanics remain abstract ("a conduit, a bridge through which love could travel"). The installation does not constrain Mira's approach or choices; she steps onto it without resistance. Method is present but not causally essential—any mystical object could serve the same narrative role.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The lotus temple and lily pond are vividly described throughout and frame the entire scene. The setting provides atmosphere and houses the spiral, but does not pressure Mira's choices or supply resources that alter tactics. The pond's "sigh" and the temple's "acceptance" are metaphoric rather than physical constraints.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"After the cloud bursts" anchors the opening and "a gentle rain fell" continues in paragraph one, but thereafter weather does not tighten decisions or alter tactics. Time is vague—no clock or urgency is tracked. The timeframe sets mood but does not escalate pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Mira's desire "to find the thread that connects all things" is stated in exposition (paragraph five) and declared fulfilled at closure ("she had rejoined…knowing she had found"), but is never dramatized in conflicted choice. No on-page moment shows Mira weighing cost or friction between this want and another need.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>"Prismatic quiet" appears as a repeated phrase (paragraphs two, thirteen, twenty-four, twenty-nine) anchoring tone, and the final image echoes it ("a harmonious chorus of prismatic quiet"). However, tone remains static—no modulation with rising pressure. The phrase is ornamental recurrence rather than a charged shift that reweights stakes.</comment>
