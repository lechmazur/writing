<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is stated but not tested through contradictory impulses in scene. The "weathered innocence" and "reticent" traits remain labels without embodied choices that reveal hierarchy of values. Her actions (placing notebook, recording echoes, leaving a folded page) never force a trade-off or foreclose a path with visible cost. The final "smile" and "melting reticence" read as unearned transformation without dramatized struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation Test: who/where/when anchor by ~120 words passes narrowly. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural (pattern of echoes and light), but no meaningful tightening or deepening occurs—Mara observes, records, realizes, and leaves without a decisive constraint or cost that changes her options. The "realization" that fractured sequences encode language growth is told, not dramatized through a choice or renunciation. Closure unit is unclear: the final offering (folded page) and the crystal's "promise" gesture toward Resonant Reconfiguration but lack visible cost or foreclosed path on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The library, stained glass, crystal, and oak table are vividly rendered with selective detail (must of old paper, marble floor, fractured light). The crystal constrains observation and charges the final image through its "humming" and "glow fade," narrowly meeting the 9+ gate requirement. However, spatial choreography is static—Mara never navigates obstacles or uses the environment to alter tactics. Sensory hierarchy remains visual throughout without stress-driven narrowing.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("decode the pattern of growth") is signaled but never tested by a reversal or cost. Mara encounters no obstacle; the crystal "resists" observation in name only and then "answers her questions" without dramatized effort or trade-off. No agency-driven tightening appears—she observes, the crystal cooperates, she leaves. The "suspended hush shifted" is passive environmental change, not protagonist choice under pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Theme (language as living pulse, continuity vs. decay) emerges from the crystal and dictionary milestone but remains abstract. The "pattern of growth" and "fractured sequences" gesture at meaning without specific contradiction or ambiguity. The final image (crystal humming over folded page) offers lyric resonance but no non-literal answer or conceptual cost—Mara accepts both "weight of history and lightness of possibility" in tidy summary rather than earned friction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>POV distance is stable; no head-hopping. Diction frequently drifts into elevated register ("suspended hush," "sonically reflective shards," "testify through the crystal") that sits uneasily with the "reticent scholar" frame. Perceptual signature is generic—Mara notices light and echoes but her way of noticing lacks character-specific bias. Filter verbs ("seemed to answer," "seemed to bless") cluster in key beats without voice-motivated purpose. No dialogue present to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: "suspended hush" appears five times with minimal reweighting; "fractured sequences" and "weathered innocence" recur as labels without evolving function. Template cadence: "She [verb]...she [verb]" runs across multiple paragraphs. Mixed metaphor: light cannot "scatter sonically" (contradictory vehicle). Register drift into academic abstraction ("lexical," "sonorous gift," "testimony") clashes with scene immediacy. Line-level debt disallows 9+ globally and triggers artifact penalties of −1.4 in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Premise (scholar decoding language via magical crystal) follows a familiar template: solitary researcher, mystical object, epiphany without friction. The "last dictionary printed" detail and "sonically reflective" crystal offer surface novelty but do not transform the core arc. Emotional progression is generic (reticence melts into resolve, innocence accepts history). No bold risk or non-obvious synthesis; the ending's promise and blessing read as reassuring closure rather than inevitable complication.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Mara ("reticent scholar") is present throughout but makes no key turn—she observes, records, realizes (off-page), and leaves an offering. Reticence is stated but does not constrain a choice or shift under pressure. The final "smile" and "melting reticence" are summary, not decision. Present in closure (folded page offering) but functionally passive; a near-synonym ("solitary researcher") would fit with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Crystal appears in three beats: hanging center-hall (description), "testifying through" (observation), and final "humming lullaby" over folded page (closure). It enables Mara's recording and charges the final image with its dimming glow and hum. However, it never constrains a choice or imposes cost—it resists, then cooperates without dramatized friction. Strong closure linkage and beat involvement lift it to mid-6s, but swappability (any mystical artifact) and lack of causal pressure cap it below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Suspended hush" recurs five times as atmospheric label but does not shape stakes or tactics. It "settled," "shifted," "turned into a promise," all passive environmental description without altering Mara's options. No on-page choice hinges on hush vs. noise. Present early and in closure image but ornamental; treated as mood rather than stake.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Sonically reflective" appears twice: light scattering "sonically reflective shards" (mixed metaphor) and crystal's "sonically reflective tones" that "amplified into soft chorus." The trait enables observation (crystal answers via sound) but imposes no constraint or cost—Mara records echoes without trade-off. Physics violation (light cannot scatter sonically) and label-only use without visible friction.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Testify" appears once: "Mara...began to testify through the crystal, recording each echo as if the stone were a reluctant witness." Functional in one beat (middle observation phase) but easily swappable ("examine," "interrogate," "decode"). The major realization (fractured sequences encode growth) is told in summary afterward, not dramatized through testimony's mechanics. Does not define a turn or cost.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Fractured sequences" named early (crystal's surface "shimmering with fractured sequences that fractured time") and revisited at realization ("fractured sequences were not random") and closure ("carrying...fractured sequences of a language reborn"). Method shapes one key turn (recognition that sequences encode growth like tree rings) but mechanics remain vague—how comparison to marginal notes reveals growth is told, not shown. Two-gate presence (setup, payoff) with modest causal role.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Shadowed library at dawn" anchors all action and recurs in final paragraph ("Leaving the shadowed library at sunrise"). Setting provides the crystal, stained glass, and oak table that enable Mara's work. The library's "memory" (fractured sequences) is the object of investigation. Environment constrains lightly (must work within library hours, dawn light matters) and charges closure (sunrise painting gold). Strong setup and closure presence with modest causal pressure lift it above 6.0.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"After the last dictionary was printed" mentioned once as backstory context ("She had come...after the last dictionary was printed, a milestone that marked the end of an era"). Frames motivation (why decode now) but imposes no time pressure—narrative clock is absent, and Mara's actions unfold without urgency or deadline. Final reflection ("no printed dictionary could capture what she had witnessed") echoes the milestone but does not tighten tactics. Present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"To decode the pattern of growth" is the named motivation, signaled early ("Her motivation was simple yet stubborn") and revisited at realization ("pattern of growth was not merely lexical") and closure ("pattern of growth she had decoded began to pulse anew"). Desire is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choices—Mara pursues it without friction, cost, or competing want. One-gate middle development (realization) and closure mention with lyric reprise, but no on-page trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>"Weathered innocence" appears three times: describing Mara's voice/pursuit mid-story and twice at closure ("weathered innocence...melted into quiet resolve," "weathered innocence that accepted both weight...and lightness"). Tone label without embodied modulation—narrative voice remains elevated and abstract throughout, not "innocent." No coherent texture shift under pressure. Present in closure but as summary assertion, not tonal charge in the final image.</comment>
