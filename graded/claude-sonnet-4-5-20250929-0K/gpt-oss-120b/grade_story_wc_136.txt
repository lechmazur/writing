<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The route mapper remains a label throughout, defined by her occupation and mission statement rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. Her "daring" is declared in opening exposition but never tested by a visible cost that forecloses a path; she moves through the vault without friction, hesitation, or trade-off. The final "promise to return" is told rather than dramatized, and no micro-choice under pressure reveals a hierarchy of values. Interiority consists of stock phrases ("trembling certainty," "awe") without embodied sensation or character-particular perception.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The story signals closure as a Resonant Reconfiguration (the protagonist steps into the role of conduit and promises to return), but the cost is abstract: no before/after option is foreclosed on the page, and the "promise" remains a declaration without visible sacrifice. Causality chains exist (clue → arrows → vault → ledger), yet each beat unfolds as a guided tour with no reversal or tightening that narrows her choices. The piece teaches a lyric-accumulative lens early but never deepens pressure or reweights the dominant stake with felt cost. The orientation anchors arrive late (vault interior ~40% in) and the "hour that divides" timeframe is mentioned twice without constraining a single tactic.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The "starlit vault in mist" and "phantom ticket punch" are vivid and recur across beats, charging the final image when the punch is placed beside the ledger. Spatial choreography is coherent (street → doorway → staircase → cavern), and the constellations mirror her map, constraining the unlock mechanic. However, the vault's amber light and crystalline pedestal remain postcard description without altering tactics, and the "cracks in pavement" guide her without friction or resource cost. Sensory detail favors the visual; other senses appear formulaically ("cold mist," "iron door") without POV bias.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"to find the fortress of unspoken truths"—is declared early but never tested by a reversal that narrows options. Each arrow and unlock proceeds as scripted discovery with no complication or trade-off: she kneels, she presses, the lock clicks. The final ledger's reveal is accumulative rather than a tightening, and no visible price (time, stamina, social cost) alters her tactics. The piece opts for situational pressure (she must dare beyond her maps) but never crystallizes a stance under conflicting goods or harms. Coincidence (the phantom punch always pulses correctly) enables rather than complicates.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly—hidden narratives, the archive as living conduit—and the final ledger image reweights the "fortress" from stone to archive without overt moralizing. Yet the insight ("she had become the conduit") is asserted rather than earned by a specific on-page struggle, and the closing "promise to return each hour" reads as thematic echo rather than dramatized choice with cost. The phantom punch and constellations recur purposefully, but their symbolic weight is overstated ("humanity's hidden narratives") without grounding in a micro-choice that reveals hierarchy or ambiguity. The piece resists banality yet leans toward abstraction in its final beats.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited, and the narrative voice carries consistent elevated diction ("analytically artistic blend," "trembling certainty"). However, register drifts into stock lyricism under pressure ("each footfall echoing against the vaulted ceiling," "promise to the unseen architects") that feels authored rather than focalized through the mapper's perceptual signature. No dialogue appears. Psychic distance remains static; the mapper's "tremor of certainty" and "awe" are named rather than shown through embodied perception or micro-gesture. The prose voice is uniform across calm and crisis beats, missing the compression or cadence shift expected when stakes tighten.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade: "mysteries she had unraveled were merely a prelude" restates the opening promise to "dare beyond the maps"; "arrows pointing like skeletal fingers" and "arrows etched in the stone seemed to pulse" recycle the same image without added pressure. Template cadence runs appear ("She knelt… She inhaled… She placed… She lifted…") across four consecutive beats, flattening rhythm. Stock metaphors cluster in high-pressure moments ("colossal eye," "skeletal fingers," "trembling certainty"), and filter verbs stack ("felt the vault's ancient echo," "felt the metal sizzle," "feeling the cracks align"). Figurative density is high (most sentences carry metaphor) without pattern-teaching or payoff, and the closure beat ("stepping into a world where art and analysis danced on cracked arrows") dissolves into abstraction. The artifact spread touches closure; apply −1.7 baseline and disallow 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The mosaic of prompt elements (phantom ticket, cracks forming arrows, vault in mist) is assembled competently but reads as checklist rather than organic synthesis. The "route mapper who unravels mysteries via pavement cracks" premise is high-concept yet generic in execution—replace the cracks with runes or the ticket with a key and the emotional arc remains unchanged. No bold structural risk is taken; the story follows a linear descent-to-discovery template without subversion or non-obvious moral calculus. One fresh inflection appears: the ledger titled "Unspoken Truths" holding maps of thoughts in constellation colors, which earns mid-band credit. The piece avoids cliché but does not transform its tropes into something irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The meticulous route mapper is present in setup, middle (kneeling to trace arrows, pressing the punch), and closure (placing the punch beside the ledger, promising to return). However, her choices are scripted observations rather than decisions that alter tactics: she follows arrows without friction, and the final "promise" is declaration without visible cost or option foreclosed. She could be swapped for "determined explorer" with minor edits. Two beats + closure participation place her in the 5–6 neighborhood, but swappability and lack of causal pressure cap at 3.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The phantom train ticket punch appears in setup (found lodged in a crack, pulses when following arrows), middle (pressed against stone relief to unlock staircase), and closure (placed beside the ledger, now warm). It drives two distinct beats (unlock + final placement) and its "phantom energy" mechanic is specific. However, the punch's properties are convenient rather than constraining—it always works when needed—and removing it would require only a generic key substitute. Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.9, minus swappability −0.5 = ~6.7.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Unraveling mysteries" is declared in setup and frames the mapper's occupation, shapes middle beats (tracing arrows, unlocking vault), and is restated at closure ("never cease the unraveling"). Yet it operates as theme rather than stake-shaping mechanic: the mysteries unfold without complication or cost, and the concept could be replaced with "exploring secrets" or "discovering truths" without structural change. Functional across beats but lacks specificity and causal pressure; mid-functional band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"Analytically artistic" is mentioned once in setup ("blend of precision and imagination") and echoed abstractly in the final line ("art and analysis danced"). It never constrains or enables an on-page action with visible cost—the mapper's choices are neither more analytical nor more artistic than a generic explorer's. Label-only trait without dramatized tradeoff; ornamental band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Dare" appears in setup ("urging her to dare beyond the maps") and is invoked at closure ("daring to seek the fortress," "daring mission"). The middle beat where she "dared to press the punch" is the sole moment where daring might shape a choice, yet no hesitation or cost is shown—the lock simply clicks. The action is present across structure but remains declarative rather than causal; mid-band for structural presence without pressure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Cracks in pavement forming arrows" is signaled early (setup: phantom punch pulses when following arrows, "first arrow curved toward a shallow groove"), recurs in middle beats ("pavement cracks widened, arrows pointing," "arrows etched in the stone"), and reappears at closure ("cracks align like a compass, each arrow pointing toward the next mystery"). The method drives navigation across three beats and its mechanics matter (arrows guide each stage). However, the arrows never mislead or complicate; they are convenience rather than constraint. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +0.9, swappability −0.4, ornamental ease −0.5 = ~5.9.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The "starlit vault in mist" is seeded early ("distant glow of the starlit vault in mist"), developed in middle (vault opens "like a colossal eye," "walls inscribed with constellations that mirrored the map"), and charged at closure ("starlit vault in mist shimmered behind her, a reminder that… guidance could be found"). The constellations constrain the unlock mechanic (mirroring her map), and the vault's amber light and whispered voices frame the ledger discovery. Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, causal constraint +0.8, minus postcard elements −0.5, decorative mist −0.6 = ~6.2.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"The hour that divides bad habits and new starts" is mentioned in setup and invoked once at closure ("promising to return each hour that divides"). It never tightens a decision, tracks elapsed time, or alters tactics—time remains vague and untracked throughout the vault descent. The phrase functions as lyric decoration rather than pressure mechanic. Lyric reprise without causal work; ornamental band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"To find the fortress of unspoken truths" is declared early ("her motivation: to find the fortress"), developed in middle (staircase descent "toward" the fortress), and restated at closure ("daring to seek the fortress"). The motivation frames the quest but is never conflicted by a want-versus-cost friction or tested by a trade-off that forecloses a path. Setup + middle development + closure mention meet two gates, but the desire is told rather than dramatized with visible price; cap at 4.6 per missing-development-constraint rule.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Trembling certainty" is named in setup ("tremor of certainty in her fingertips"), recurs in middle ("trembling certainty guiding her"), and modulates at closure ("trembling certainty in her chest steadied into awe"). The tone is present across structure and attempts a shift (trembling → steadied), yet the modulation is asserted rather than earned by pressure—awe replaces trembling without friction or cost shown on the page. Setup + development + closure shift meet all gates, but the effect is label-driven; functional band ~4.8.</comment>
