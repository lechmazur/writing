<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The crystal gazer remains a label without contradictory impulses or embodied emotion. Interiority consists entirely of abstract mystical declarations ("incubate goodbye letters," "unused love") rather than concrete stakes or micro-choices under pressure. The final act—placing the film strip back and vanishing—reads as symbolic gesture without visible cost or foreclosed path. No relationship crucible exists; the protagonist operates in isolation with shadows as audience.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Drive lens remains ambiguous throughout: the piece gestures at accumulative/textural (film frames, letters, humming tune) but lacks pattern-teaching or a decisive tightening that reweights stakes. Orientation is delayed—who, where, and when emerge slowly across the first third without deliberate disorientation serving closure. The ending offers no legible closure unit: the gazer "vanishes into the night, carrying the stored unused love like a lantern" is metaphor without on-page cost, decisive change, or conceptual repricing that reconfigures prior material. Causality is opaque: psychometry "surges," letters "glow faintly," and the map appears without earned linkage.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The projection booth is anchored with some atmospheric detail (velvet seats, ancient projector, black velvet curtain), and the hidden compartment provides one spatial turn. However, the space never constrains choice or alters tactics—the gazer moves freely through abstraction ("rooms that folded into each other," "galaxies"). Sensory detail tilts heavily visual and metaphorical ("liquid light," "river of memory") without grounding in body, tool, or physical constraint. The booth functions as backdrop rather than pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"to find where unused love is stored"—is declared but never tested by opposition or meaningful tightening. No reversal occurs: the gazer searches, hums, finds the box, reads letters, and the process unfolds as smooth revelation without cost or trade-off. Agency is absent; the protagonist receives rather than decides. The "final goodbye" whispered to empty seats carries no felt price or foreclosed option. Coincidence (hidden compartment revealed by humming) resolves rather than complicates.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Theme—unused love and unsent farewells—is stated repeatedly in abstract terms ("unused love," "vault of unused love," "sorrow transformed into something bright") rather than emerging from concrete particulars. The final image ("carrying the stored unused love like a lantern") offers metaphor without non-literal reweighting or earned resonance. No contradiction or complexity textures the emotional arc; the piece moves in a single emotional register toward aesthetic satisfaction. The psychometry and film strip function as ornamental motifs without constraining choice or charging closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited, but perceptual signature is generic mystical rather than character-specific. Diction drifts into elevated register ("spatially imaginative labyrinth," "constellations waiting for a story to give them shape") that reads authorial rather than voice-motivated. No dialogue appears. Figurative language dominates without variation: every beat converts to metaphor ("tiny birds perched on frames," "river of memory," "telescope that surveyed the inner universe"), flattening rhythm and obscuring concrete action.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Severe overwriting pervades: nearly every sentence stacks figurative vehicles ("dust swirled like slow snow," "ghostly impressions like a cartographer," "letters as tiny birds," "liquid light that pooled like a river"). Template cadence runs through the piece—repeated "The [noun] [verb]" and "she [verb]" stems without variation. Paraphrase loops: "unused love" appears six times, "goodbye letters" five times, with synonym churn ("unsent affection," "farewells that had never been delivered"). Mixed metaphors: letters are birds, then keys, then glowing ink rearranging into a map. Artifacts touch the closure beat ("carrying the stored unused love like a lantern"), triggering −1.7 and disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>The core premise—psychometry reading on film to find unsent love letters—echoes familiar tropes (mystical archivist, forgotten emotions as treasure) without fresh synthesis. Execution relies on stock metaphors (birds for messages, rivers for memory, lanterns for hope) and aesthetic middle-ground choices that avoid risk. The transformation test fails: swap "crystal gazer" for "archivist" and "film strip" for "manuscript" and the arc remains unchanged. No bold perspectival or structural risk heightens stakes; the piece prioritizes atmosphere over ingenuity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Crystal gazer is present throughout and performs the psychometry reading, but her choices are passive receptions rather than decisions that alter tactics. She "slipped," "carried," "performed," "began to search," "followed," "knelt," "whispered," "placed"—a sequence of actions without conflict or cost. No turn traces to her agency; events unfold as revelation. Missing middle development (no choice constrains later options) and missing closure participation (vanishing is metaphor, not decision). Cap 2.8 for missing closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Film strip appears early (first paragraph), returns in the middle beat (psychometry surges, frames melt), and is placed back in the projector at the end. Three beats, but causal pressure is weak: the strip is read, melts into light, then restored without its properties narrowing options or altering tactics. The "edges torn and spattered with ink" and "each frame a silent echo" are descriptive rather than functional. Lyric reprise at closure charges the image modestly (projector lights the screen, shadows applaud), reaching mid-band for patterned return without irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Goodbye letters are the object of the quest, discovered in the hidden box, read, and present at closure when the gazer carries "stored unused love." Setup clear, middle beat (letters glow, ink rearranges into map), and closure cameo. However, the letters do not constrain choice—they are found, not earned through tactical pressure. Swappable with any symbolic cache (photographs, recordings). Mid-functional: present across beats but replaceable without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>"Spatially imaginative" is named twice ("spatially imaginative labyrinth," "spatially imaginative walls") but never enables or constrains an on-page action. The trait is descriptive of the setting's metaphorical expansion rather than the gazer's capability. No cost, no tradeoff, no tactical use. Label-only attribute. Cap 2.8 for missing closure participation; additional −0.5 for ornamental use.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Incubate" appears once in the quest statement ("to incubate goodbye letters") and the process unfolds passively: the gazer reads, follows, kneels, lets the river wash over the letters. No visible incubation action distinct from discovery. The verb is metaphor rather than dramatized method. Missing middle development (no beat shows incubation altering tactics) and missing closure participation (the act is not revisited). Cap 2.8 for missing closure participation; swappability lowers further.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Psychometry reading is performed early ("she performed a psychometry reading on the film strip, letting her fingertips trace ghostly impressions"), returns mid-beat ("The psychometry of the film strip surged"), and implicitly underlies the discovery. Two beats with modest causal linkage: the reading enables her to sense the hidden compartment. However, mechanics are vague—tracing impressions does not visibly narrow options or impose cost. Functional but replaceable with generic mystical sensing.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Projection booth is established early (title and opening line), provides spatial resources (hidden compartment behind curtain, ancient projector, velvet seats), and the final beat returns to the projector lighting the screen. Three beats. The booth's "thunderous hush" and vibrating walls cue the compartment's location, contributing to discovery. However, the space does not constrain movement or choices—choreography is abstract ("rooms opening into galaxies"). Setup, middle resource use, and closure participation meet the three-gate threshold; causal pressure is modest, lifting into mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>1.9</grade><comment>Timeframe "while forgotten lyrics search for tune" is poetic but non-functional. The gazer hums a fragment and the melody resolves, but no clock pressure or tightening window alters her decisions. Time is untraceable and does not escalate stakes. Metaphorical framing only. Cap 2.8 for missing closure participation; vague tracking lowers further.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Motivation "to find where unused love is stored" is declared in the opening third and drives the search through beats (finding the box, reading letters, feeling love cascade into her heart). Setup and middle beats present, closure cameo (she carries the love like a lantern). However, the desire is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choice or visible cost—no friction between want and obstacle, no trade-off. Functional quest driver but lacks pressure or internal contradiction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Tone "hushed thunder" is named repeatedly ("hushed thunder," "thunderous hush," "thunderous sigh," "whispered thunder") and modulates slightly (soft to sigh to applause). The phrase charges the atmosphere and recurs at closure when "shadows applauded in whispered thunder." Setup, middle accent, and closure reprise meet gates. However, the tone remains static aesthetic rather than escalating with pressure—"hushed thunder" at the opening carries the same charge as at the end. Lyric consistency without dynamic reweighting, reaching lower mid-band.</comment>
