<question>1</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The protagonist is a cipher; "end of history witness" remains a label without embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. Internal experience is absent—no competing impulses, no embodied emotion, no hierarchy of values tested on the page. The final vanishing reads as ornamental rather than earned by prior causality, and no credible path is foreclosed with visible cost. Motivation is declared ("unravel cosmic illusions") but never dramatized through conflicted choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early enough. The piece gestures toward accumulative/textural logic but no meaningful tightening or deepening occurs; the protagonist walks, reads, places the dictionary, and vanishes without a legible before/after shift in options or knowledge. The ending offers spectacle (walls fall away, horizon converges) but no felt or conceptual cost; the "aching peace" is asserted, not dramatized. Closure form is unclear—neither Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, nor Conceptual Repricing lands with on-page evidence of cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The ancient temple library is vivid and consistently rendered (vaulted aisles, stone arches, tablets, crystal pedestal). Sensory detail is selective and atmospheric, filtered through a heightened register. However, the environment never constrains a choice or alters tactics; it remains a backdrop. The dictionary-on-crystal moment provides a physical anchor at closure but does not charge the final image with setting-driven consequence, capping the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The dominant stake ("unravel cosmic illusions") is signaled early but never tested by opposition or cost. No meaningful escalation or tightening occurs; the protagonist encounters no resistance, makes no trade-offs, and faces no narrowing of options. The ritual unfolds as spectacle without agency—luck or the universe's compliance resolves everything off-stage. The final "aching peace" is declared without visible price, and no live option is foreclosed on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Theme (unity, spiral recursion, illusion versus truth) is present but abstract, advanced through direct statement and prompt labels ("spiral arbitration," "cosmic illusions") rather than concrete particulars. The final image (converging horizon, seamless understanding) offers visual spectacle but no non-literal answer to a question dramatized in scene. The ending moralizes gently ("not a finality but a doorway") rather than allowing resonance to emerge from earned cost. Subtext is minimal; most meaning is on the surface.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The narrative voice is elevated, lyric, and consistent in register—purposeful compression and patterned repetition ("resounding hush," "journeying inward while walking out") teach a rhythmic mode. However, POV interiority is absent; the focalizer remains distant, and perceptual signature is generic rather than character-specific. The lexicon ("wanderingly exact," "spiral arbitration") feels imposed rather than organic to the witness's mind. No dialogue appears; the piece is purely atmospheric narration with no embodied thought.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Rhythm is deliberate and often effective (balanced parallelism, cadenced repetition). However, paraphrase loops and synonym churn appear throughout: "resounding hush" opens and recurs without evolution; "spiral arbitration" is repeated with minor variation; "journeying inward while walking out" cycles three times. Template cadence is present ("She felt," "She knew," "She stepped"). Figurative density is high in every beat without clear pattern payoff, and several metaphors muddle (a dictionary "whispers," margins are "wanderingly exact," silence is "resounding"). Information density is low; many sentences restate atmosphere without advancing situation. Applying cumulative artifact penalties: paraphrase loops −0.4, template stems −0.4, figurative overload −0.3, total −1.1, plus baseline issues yield the score.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The premise (witness in lost temple unraveling cosmic illusions via spiral arbitration) synthesizes multiple prompt elements but remains abstract and generic—"cosmic mystery in ancient library" is familiar. Execution leans on prompt labels ("spiral arbitration," "end of history witness") without transforming them into lived particulars. The vanishing ending and "doorway not finality" moral are stock. No bold risk or fresh inflection appears; the piece could be recast with different labels without structural change. Derivative premise adjustment −0.8 within Q8.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>The "end of history witness" is named in the opening line and provides the POV anchor, satisfying setup. However, the character makes no on-page decisions that create turns—she walks, reads, places the dictionary, and vanishes. Observation without agency. Development and payoff gates are missing. Late-element and swappability penalties do not apply, but lack of causal pressure and decision-making cap the score in the ornamental band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The softcover dictionary is introduced early (setup), handled in the opening beat, translated tablets mid-story (development), and placed on the crystal to trigger the vortex at closure (payoff). All three gates present. It appears in three distinct beats and is causally linked to the ending spectacle. However, the dictionary's specific properties ("yellowed," "margin notes," "wanderingly exact") do not constrain choice or impose cost—it functions as a generic magical key. Swappability and lack of visible tradeoff limit the score to mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Spiral arbitration is named in paragraph one (setup) and described as "turning back upon itself until every loop found its counterpoint." It reappears when glyphs unfold and again at closure ("spiral arbitration completed its cycle"). Present in two distinct beats. However, it remains thematic label rather than on-page tactic—no mechanics are shown, no choice is altered by its use. The concept does not shape options or impose cost; it is atmosphere. Functional but replaceable, trending low-mid band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Wanderingly exact" appears once as a descriptor of the dictionary's margin notes. No setup in character action, no development, no payoff. The trait does not constrain or enable an on-page action with cost; it is ornamental description. Label-only mention, absent causal work. Score in the ornamental low band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Unify" is the stated purpose ("urge to unify the disparate strands") and recurs in the penultimate beat ("would forever unify all strands of being"). Present at setup and closure. However, unification happens off-stage or by assertion—no major turn traces to a specific act of unifying. The protagonist does not make a choice to unify; it occurs as spectacle. Swappable with "resolve" or "harmonize" with minor edits. Functional but not indispensable, mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Journeying inward while walking out" is introduced early as the ritual method, described again mid-story, and becomes literal when she moves through constellations while consciousness retreats. Present in three beats (setup, development, payoff). The paradox is narrated rather than mechanically constraining tactics, but it shapes the narrative's spatial logic and charges the closure movement. One key causal role (the literal split at closure). Score in the middle functional band, recognizing closure linkage but weak constraint on earlier choices.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The ancient temple library is introduced in the opening line (setup), its shelves and tablets constrain the protagonist's path mid-story (development), and she returns to it in the final beat where the dictionary rests on the pedestal (payoff). All three gates present. The setting supplies the crystal that triggers closure and frames the recursive structure (she steps back into the library). However, the temple does not impose a visible tactical cost or resource limit; it is stage rather than pressure. Essential across beats and ending, but lacking strong causal constraint. Score in the 6.5–7.0 neighborhood.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Across a universe's hiccup" appears once mid-story as a metaphor for a crack in time. No setup, no development constraint, minimal payoff. The timeframe does not tighten decisions or alter tactics; the protagonist's actions unfold without temporal pressure. Ornamental phrase, no causal work. Score in the low ornamental band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"To unravel cosmic illusions" is stated as the purpose in the opening third (setup) and referenced at closure ("cosmic illusions unraveled"). Present at beginning and end. However, the motivation is declared, not dramatized—no on-page friction between want and cost, no conflicted choice. The protagonist encounters no resistance or sacrifice. Functional presence in framing beats but no development gate or cost. Mid-low functional band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Resounding hush" opens the piece, recurs three times, and closes the story ("resounding hush of the place embraced her once more"). Present at setup and payoff; the phrase accumulates slight weight through repetition. Tone is coherent—elevated, meditative, static throughout. However, tone does not modulate with pressure (no turns exist to test it) and the final reprise repeats rather than reweights. Lyric-resonance allowance applies for the purposeful seed-and-return, lifting the score into mid-5s, but lack of tonal escalation and closure charge prevent higher placement.</comment>
