<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Selric's underachieving status is asserted but his choices rarely compel genuine conflict or cost. The internal contradiction—lingering luminance as both flaw and gift—remains abstract, never dramatized through competing impulses in a single beat. The "unstrapping" gesture and palm-on-stone moment are symbolic rather than choices that foreclose paths; the transformation from underachiever to fulfilled mage occurs through declaration rather than earned agency. Embodied emotion is minimal; "doubts dissolve" and "magic ignites" without physical manifestation or visible struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The piece opens with anchor (who/where) within tolerance. A Resonant Reconfiguration is attempted—Selric's acceptance of his quiet magic—but the cost remains conceptual and unfelt on the page; no specific option is foreclosed, no tactical shift forced. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (layered symbolic images building to a thematic payoff), but the keystone's "pulse" and the mist's "coalescence" feel convenient rather than motivated by prior beats. The ending offers thematic declaration ("the sacred was not a distant relic") without a decisive image that reweights prior material with undeniable pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The icebound spire, mist, and keystone are vividly rendered with sensory specificity ("thin veil of frost," "luminous fog," "faint chime"). Spatial choreography is coherent: base → ledge → summit. The keystone anchors the final beat and the mist enables the crossing, satisfying the micro-setting constraint test. However, the environment does not meaningfully narrow Selric's options; the mist "accommodates impossibilities" by fiat, removing rather than imposing constraint. The closure image charges the spire ("icy walls reflecting brilliant dimness") but does not make the setting indispensable to the choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Selric's quest to validate his quiet magic—is signaled early. Escalation under the Accumulative lens is minimal: the spire, mist-walk, and keystone touch do not meaningfully tighten options or force trade-offs; each step succeeds without friction. No reversal or complication narrows his path; the "unstrapping" and "stepping onto the ledge" are symbolic gestures without dramatized cost. The resolution is delivered by the keystone's pulse, not Selric's agency under pressure. One beat (reaching the keystone) shifts the emotional register, but the cost remains abstract ("doubts dissolved") rather than visible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Theme—finding the sacred in the simple, the value of quiet brilliance versus mechanized spectacle—is coherent and emerges from the spire journey and keystone encounter. The "lingering luminance" and "brilliant dimness" recur with pattern, reweighting the opening reputation of underachievement. However, the final insight is stated directly ("the sacred was not a distant relic but the simple act of letting go") rather than dramatized through a non-literal image or action. The automated cities below function as thematic counterpoint but remain distant abstraction. Epiphany is asserted, not earned through specific struggle; the piece leans toward thesis statement at closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Distance is consistent, interior access clean. However, the prose carries an elevated, lyric register throughout ("garden folly keystone," "brilliant dimness," "accommodates impossibilities") that remains uniform under pressure, lacking the perceptual signature or rhythmic modulation expected from an "underachieving mage" in crisis. Diction stays ornate and abstract even at the keystone touch, where embodied simplicity would serve the theme. No dialogue is present. The voice reads as authorial-poetic rather than character-particular, with repeated template phrasing ("lingering luminance" appears seven times) that flattens momentum.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Heavy pattern-artifact debt: "lingering luminance" recurs seven times, "accommodates impossibilities" four times, "brilliant dimness" twice, "garden folly keystone" three times—synonym loops and label repetition pervade without functional variation. Template cadence in multiple beats: "He then stepped... began mist walking... a method taught... to glide..." and "He placed his palm... feeling the lingering luminance pulse... a secret cadence..." register as list-like sequencing. Figurative density is high throughout ("fireflies that refused to be measured," "heart a garden folly") without clear pattern-teaching or payoff, and metaphors mix vehicles (keystone as "anchor," heart as "garden folly," magic as "candle" and "fireworks"). Stock metaphor strings ("dim candle in a world of mechanized fireworks") and elevated diction in peak beats clash with the POV's humble stance. Paraphrase loops: "the lingering luminance from the keystone" / "the stone's glow was not just light" restate within two lines. These artifacts touch the closure paragraph and disqualify 9+ globally; baseline deduction −1.4 in Q7, escalated to −1.7 for closure contamination, plus artifact cap applies.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The underachieving mage premise, the journey to a mystical summit, and the validation-through-acceptance arc follow familiar fantasy templates without transformation through specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The "automated creativity" timeframe adds a science-fantasy accent but remains abstract backdrop. The keystone and mist-walking are ornamental rather than causally irreplaceable; the plot would function unchanged with a different magical object and traversal method. Diction leans toward stock ("quiet brilliance," "sacred in the simple") and the final image ("heart a garden folly keystone") is poetic but generic. No bold structural risk or fresh synthesis; the piece executes a template without subversion or particular grounding.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Selric is present throughout and the story tracks his journey. He makes two on-page choices: unstrapping the spellbook and placing his palm on the keystone. However, these are symbolic gestures without dramatized cost or tactical consequence; the unstrapping is described as "freeing his focus" but does not alter a subsequent beat's difficulty or outcome. The keystone touch triggers transformation passively (the stone "pulses," magic "ignites") rather than through Selric's decision under pressure. The character is functional but replaceable; the arc would hold with a different underachiever and similar gestures. Setup present; middle choice weak; closure participation passive. Two gates met, weak causal pressure, late closure passivity: 5.0 base, −0.8 for swappability and passivity at closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The keystone appears in three beats: summit arrival (description), approach (luminance seeping into fog), and palm touch (pulse triggers transformation). Setup clear, middle involvement present (luminance affects the mist), closure participation strong (pulse is the closure trigger). However, the keystone's specific properties—"accommodates impossibilities," "anchor for any dream"—are asserted rather than demonstrated through cost or constraint; it functions as a convenient transformation device without requiring Selric to sacrifice or navigate a tradeoff. The object shapes the ending but could be replaced with a similar mystical artifact. Three beats +1.4, early signal +0.5, closure linkage +1.0, swappability −0.6: base ~6.3, reduced to 5.8 for lack of unique cost.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Lingering luminance" recurs as label throughout: Selric's soft-glowing spells, the keystone's glow, the mist's glow, fireflies at the end. However, it never constrains a choice or alters tactics; it functions as thematic atmosphere rather than stake-shaping mechanic. The concept is told (Selric's magic "glows too softly to impress") but not shown affecting a beat's outcome or forcing a tradeoff. At closure, luminance is asserted to "travel far beyond the spire" without on-page cost. Setup present (first paragraph), middle mention decorative, closure thematic echo only. Two gates (setup, weak closure), ornamental use, no causal pressure: 3.0 base, +0.3 lyric reprise, −0.5 ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"Accommodates impossibilities" is a label for the keystone (twice) and the mist (once). The keystone is said to "accommodate" dreams and the mist "accommodates" Selric's footfalls, but these remain descriptive claims without visible cost or mechanical constraint. The attribute does not enable a tradeoff or limit a choice; instead, it removes obstacle (the mist solidifies, the keystone grants transformation). Setup present (keystone introduction), middle mention (mist), closure passive (transformation granted). Two gates met, label-only use, no cost: 3.0 base, +0.4 for closure presence, −0.3 label-only.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Selric "unstraps the silver cords that bound his spellbook to his wrist" in one beat mid-story. The text declares this "symbolic, releasing the weight of expectation," but no subsequent beat shows different tactics or capabilities as a result. The unstrapping does not enable the mist-walk, does not affect the keystone interaction, and is not reprised at closure. It appears once, is told to be meaningful, but is swappable with any other symbolic gesture. One beat, no causal pressure, no closure linkage: 3.0 base, +0.4 middle beat, −0.6 swappability, +0.3 setup signal.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Mist walking is introduced ("a method taught by an ancient hermit") and executed in one extended beat: Selric steps onto the ledge, the mist thickens, each footfall chimes, the mist coalesces into a platform. The method is signaled and its mechanics matter (without it, he cannot cross to the keystone), and it enables the closure beat. However, the mechanics are convenient—no cost, no risk of failure, no tradeoff—and the method could be replaced with another magical traversal. Setup via backstory reference, middle execution, closure enabling. Two beats, causal enabler, but low cost and swappable: 5.0 base, +0.7 closure enabling, −0.4 swappability.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The icebound spire anchors all action: Selric hovers at the base, climbs to the ledge, crosses the mist, reaches the summit keystone. The setting is present in setup, pressures the middle (height, frost, mist), and charges the closure image ("icy walls reflecting brilliant dimness"). The cold and vapor are vivid; the spire's verticality structures the ascent. However, the environment does not constrain Selric's choices—the mist accommodates, the keystone grants—so it remains atmospheric rather than tactical pressure. Three beats, early signal, closure image contribution, but low constraint: 6.0 base, +0.7 closure charge, −0.3 for low tactical cost.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"When creativity gets automated" appears once in the opening paragraph as backdrop for Selric's underachievement, with one reprise in the penultimate paragraph ("automated cities hummed with algorithmic art"). It never tightens a decision, alters Selric's tactics on the spire, or imposes a deadline. The timeframe is thematic context, not a narrative clock. Setup present, no middle involvement, closure mention thematic only. One gate, ornamental: 3.0 base, −0.4 ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Selric's desire "to find the sacred in the simple" is stated in the opening and echoed at closure ("realized the sacred was not a distant relic but the simple act of letting go"). However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants. No beat shows Selric tempted by acclaim, weighing simplicity against spectacle, or paying a cost to honor this value. The quest drives the plot (he climbs the spire) but the friction is external (doubt, test) rather than internal trade-off. Setup clear, middle implicit, closure thematic payoff. Two gates, told desire, no on-page friction: 5.0 base, +0.7 closure linkage, −0.3 told-only, +0.3 setup.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Brilliant dimness" recurs as tonal anchor: opening ("dim candle"), mist crossing ("brilliant dimness that felt both hopeful and mournful"), keystone touch ("brilliant dimness enveloped Selric's soul"), closure ("brilliant dimness fading into the ordinary world"). The oxymoron is consistent and modulates slightly with pressure (hopeful/mournful at the crossing, warm at the keystone). However, the tone remains static-lyric throughout; no sharp tonal shift marks escalation or release. Setup clear, middle present, closure charged. Three beats, coherent but static, closure charge: 5.0 base, +0.5 closure charge, −0.4 static mood.</comment>
