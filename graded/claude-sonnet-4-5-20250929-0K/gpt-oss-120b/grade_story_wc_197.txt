<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Mara remains fundamentally flat—her "quiet smile often masked fierce resolve" is a stock rebel template never complicated by on-page contradiction or genuine flawed decision. Internal conflict is absent; she executes her plan without hesitation, ambivalence, or visible cost to her values or relationships. The interiority consists of label-only qualities ("underestimated," "carefully resourceful") rather than embodied emotion or specific micro-choices that foreclose paths. The ending offers no character change or renunciation with felt weight—she simply walks away, her resolve untested.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation is severely delayed: who Mara is, where the lagoon sits in relation to the city, and when "plans unravel" occurs remain vague well past 120 words, triggering the Orientation Test penalty (−0.4). The causality is thin—Mara's possession of the key, discovery of the map, and arrival at the transmitter feel like narrative convenience rather than earned tactical choices. The closure unit is a Conceptual Repricing (the broadcast "revises histories"), but the conceptual cost is abstract and told rather than shown; no on-page consequence forces Mara to trade or forfeit anything legible. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural (imagery and motifs layer toward thematic resonance), but the final image does not reweight prior material with undeniable pressure—it merely restates the premise.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The auric lagoon appears in nearly every paragraph, and the water/reflections motif recurs, meeting minimal setup and reprise. However, the lagoon never constrains a choice or supplies a tactical resource that alters Mara's options—it remains postcard scenery. The key insertion and transmitter are spatially generic; we never learn how she approaches, whether the platform is exposed or hidden, or what physical risk proximity entails. Sensory detail ("starlight like scattered coins," "molten gold") is vivid but undifferentiated across the piece, lacking the urgency modulation that would reflect rising pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—broadcasting truth to awaken resistance—is signaled early but never tested by a meaningful obstacle or trade-off. Mara's plan proceeds without friction: the map appears, the platform is found, the key fits, the transmission succeeds. No reversal or tightening narrows her options; no visible cost (stamina, exposure, ally sacrifice) alters her tactics. The "tyranny of indifference" is abstract antagonism with no on-page agent or consequence that Mara must navigate. Escalation under the Accumulative lens would require a density increase or pattern break that reweights the stake; instead, the piece loops through similar imageried beats without deepening pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Theme ("revised histories," resistance against indifference) emerges consistently but remains stated rather than dramatized. The lagoon, puddle map, and transmitter function as ornamental symbols rather than particulars that constrain choice or complicate moral calculus. The final lines ("quiet persistence of coded freedom") deliver a thesis statement instead of a resonant image that reweights prior material. No counter-reading or ambiguity is present; the regime is flatly indifferent, Mara purely noble, and the outcome unambiguously hopeful without visible friction or cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is generic—Mara notices poetic environmental details ("silver veil," "glittering waves") without character-specific bias or blind spots. Diction remains elevated and uniform throughout, lacking modulation under pressure; the transmitter scene should compress syntax and narrow sensory range, but the prose sustains the same lyrical register. Filter verbs ("she knew," "she felt") appear but are not excessive. The final paragraph's "they learned to read the night" shifts briefly to collective narration without clear focalization, creating minor distance slippage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Significant paraphrase loops: "The story of that night would circulate in underground verses, each retelling revising the history of the oppressed" immediately echoes prior lines about revised histories without advancing pressure (−0.3). Template cadence: "She whispered… She slipped… She walked…" across multiple beats (−0.5). Stock metaphors pervade ("phantom fireflies," "cracks of complacent stone") without fresh vehicle logic. Figurative density in nearly every sentence ("silver veil," "scattered coins," "molten gold," "liquid memory") obscures rather than sharpens action, especially during the transmitter scene where clarity is paramount (−0.6). Information density is low—many sentences restate theme or describe without advancing situation. The cumulative artifact penalty approaches −1.4, and the final-third presence of loops disallows 9+ globally and caps high-band entries at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Core premise—underestimated rebel broadcasts hidden truth—is a widely used template not transformed by specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus (Derivative Premise Guardrail: −0.8). The "map suggested by puddle reflections" and "liquid memory" read as clever ornament rather than integrated world logic that shapes tactical choices. Emotional arc and thematic resolution would work unchanged with different names and places (Transformation Test failure). No bold risk-taking or perspectival ingenuity; the piece opts for safe lyricism over specificity or surprise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Mara is present throughout but her choices do not create key turns—she follows a preordained path (find map, reach transmitter, broadcast) without on-page decision that alters tactics or forecloses options. "Underestimated" is label-only; no beat dramatizes others' misjudgment or Mara exploiting it. Introduced early (setup ✓), but middle development and closure participation are observational rather than agentive (missing Development and Payoff gates per causal definition). Cap at 3.4 (missing middle development). Swappable with "resourceful outsider" (−0.6). No visible cost tied to her being underestimated.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Setup: key introduced early, "still warm from a defunct company." Development: she carries it but does not use it mid-story. Payoff: insertion at transmitter enables the broadcast. Present in two beats (pocket, insertion) but the second is summary-only action without tactical friction (−0.4). The "defunct company" detail is ornamental; any key would serve (−0.5). Late first use (final third) reduces causal necessity (−0.3). Two gates (Setup, Payoff) allow eligibility to ~6.0; the generic function and summary insertion prevent higher scoring.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Setup: "revised histories" named early. Development: the concept frames Mara's goal but does not constrain her tactics—she does not navigate competing historical narratives or face a cost in choosing which truth to broadcast. Payoff: the transmission "revises histories" by inserting forgotten defiance, but this is told outcome rather than on-page reconfiguration of options. Present in two gates (Setup, Payoff) but middle development is thematic echo, not tactical constraint (Development gate weak). Swappable with "broadcast truth" or "awaken resistance" (−0.6). The mechanics of revision are abstract, not specific world rules that shape action.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"Carefully resourceful" is illustrated (salvaged circuitry, shadow maps) but these details are backstory summary, not on-page choices under pressure. No beat shows Mara making a trade-off where resourcefulness constrains her options or imposes visible cost—she simply possesses what she needs when she needs it. Label-only in the critical beats (−0.5). Missing Development and Payoff gates causally; ornamental mention. Cap at 2.8 (missing closure participation) but the early illustration nudges slightly above.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Setup: "reappear" is promised late ("if ever the world again fell silent"). Development: echoes and ghosts "reappear" thematically but do not drive a middle turn. Payoff: "a forgotten echo reappeared from the lagoon's depths" at the end. Introduced implicitly but not concretely until final third (−0.7). The action is metaphorical rather than physical—no character or object literally reappears to alter Mara's choices (−0.8). Swappable with "resurface" or "return" (−0.5). Cap at 4.6 (introduced after 40%).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Setup: "a map suggested by puddle reflections at dusk" introduced early. Development: Mara follows the reflected lines to the platform—one causal beat where the method enables navigation. Payoff: "the reflected map faded, but its lessons remained." Present in all three gates. However, the mechanics are vague—how do puddle reflections encode passages? (−0.5). The method could be replaced with "hidden chart" or "coded directions" without altering story logic (−0.6). The specificity ("dusk," "puddle") is ornamental rather than tactically necessary.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Setup: "auric lagoon" named in the opening line. Development: setting recurs in description but does not pressure Mara's choices—she moves freely without environmental constraint. Payoff: the lagoon is present in the final image but as backdrop, not active constraint or resource. Present in Setup and Payoff but Development is postcard description (Development gate weak). Could be replaced with "hidden cove" or "secret shore" (−0.7). No tactical cost tied to the location (e.g., exposure, surveillance, tides).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"When plans unravel" signals urgency but the timeframe is never tracked—Mara's actions unfold without clock pressure or deadline that alters her tactics. No on-page moment shows plans actually unraveling; the phrase is setup-only metaphor (−0.6). Missing Development and Payoff gates causally. Cap at 3.4 (missing middle development). Generic temporal marker swappable with "crisis moment" (−0.4).</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Setup: "hold the line against the tyranny of indifference" stated late-middle as Mara's stance. Development: her actions align with the motivation but no beat shows conflicting desire or cost of holding versus yielding. Payoff: the phrase "hold the line" recurs in the ending. Present in two gates (Development weak, Payoff present). The motivation is told and abstract—never dramatized through a choice where indifference tempts or threatens Mara (−0.8). Swappable with "resist oppression" or "fight tyranny" (−0.5).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>"Coded freedom" appears throughout (coded phrase, coded ripple) as tonal anchor—Setup ✓. The tone remains static: lyrical, elevated, hopeful without modulation under pressure—no compression or urgency shift when Mara activates the transmitter (Development weak). Payoff: "coded freedom" reappears in the summary paragraph. Present but does not charge the final image with pressure; the mood is uniform (−0.6). Swappable with "secret liberation" or "hidden rebellion" (−0.5). The single static register prevents higher scoring.</comment>
