<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Nara's interiority is abstract and label-driven throughout ("ghostly resolve," "shadow work," "hidden grief") rather than embodied. No micro-choices under pressure reveal competing impulses; she drifts through actions without visible internal friction. The shift from corridor work to dimension-opening feels declared rather than earned by on-page struggle. Her pacifist stance is named but never tested by a concrete dilemma that would make the cost visible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation remains vague past 120 words—who Nara is beyond a label, where exactly she works, when this occurs relative to the premise's timeline are unclear. The inciting incident (decision to stitch the veil) is missing; she is already doing it when we arrive. The "closure" (stepping through the dimension) lacks visible cost—gravity lightens, the door opens, she floats through without forfeiture or friction. Causality is associative rather than because/therefore: the tear glows, the seam cracks, the dimension opens in a sequence that feels like a list rather than linked pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The recycled spaceship is named early and "rusted corridors" and "patched panels" provide texture, but spatial choreography is absent—where the veil is, how Nara moves to it, what tools or props constrain her actions remain unanchored. The final garden erupts in abstract color without sensory grounding (scent of forests is told, not shown through Nara's reaction). The crystal and photographs function as magic tokens rather than objects with weight, temperature, or tactile resistance that shape her attempts.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake (open the locked dimension) is declared but never narrowed by on-page reversal or cost. Nara presses the crystal, the veil tightens, she smiles, gravity loosens, the seam cracks—each step succeeds without trade-off or complication. No choice forecloses an alternative path; the sequence reads as a to-do list rather than escalating pressure. The pacifist vow is invoked but never challenged by a concrete temptation or threat that would test it with visible consequence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Theme (grief-to-hope, compassion-as-key) is stated repeatedly in summary rather than emerging from concrete images or choices. "Shadow work" and "confronting hidden grief" are named but not dramatized through a specific memory or action that imposes cost. The final paragraph moralizes directly: "the dimension would no longer require a locked door; it would welcome all who came seeking healing." No ambiguity or counter-reading survives; the resolution is a thesis statement rather than a resonant image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited holds without head-hopping, and diction remains elevated throughout ("ghostly resolve," "mournful fireflies," "luminous garden"). However, register is uniform and abstract across calm and crisis beats—no rhythmic shift marks the dimension's opening. Filter verbs ("she believed," "she felt," "she whispered") stack without voice motivation. Perceptual signature is generic; Nara's way of noticing does not reflect pacifist training or personal history, only poetic catalog.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops abound: "The shadow work was not merely a repair; it was an unveiling" immediately follows explanation of the same idea. "She pressed the crystal… and the tear's shimmer rippled" / "The crystal glowed brighter, the tear's shimmer expanding" recycles imagery without new pressure. Template cadence dominates: "The [noun] was [quality], [elaboration]" recurs across a dozen sentences. Purple figurative density ("photons like mournful fireflies," "colors that had no names," "a stitch in the cosmos") blurs rather than sharpens key beats. Stock openers ("When Nara felt," "She whispered," "From that point") flatten propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The premise (pacifist uses compassion-relic to open locked dimension on dead spaceship) assembles stock SFF elements without transformation. The "shadow work" concept is imported from therapy discourse but never grounded in ship systems or Nara's history. Kwan Yin's tear and "joy makes you lighter" feel like prompt tokens rather than organically braided logic. The resolution (step through, place crystal, seal with compassion, welcome all seekers) follows a generic redemption template with no friction or non-obvious turn.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Nara is identified as a pacifist in the opening third, and the vow is repeated late ("no force, only compassion"), but her pacifism never constrains a choice or creates friction. No weapon or violent option appears to be renounced; she floats and stitches without temptation. The trait is ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Kwan Yin's tear is named early, handled at the seam ("pressed the crystal against the seam"), and placed at the garden's heart in the final third. However, its mechanics are vague—shimmer acts as "needle of light" and "scatters photons," but these effects feel interchangeable with any glowing object. Removing it and substituting "energy crystal" would not break the plot.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Shadow work" is named twice ("a form of shadow work, confronting the hidden grief") but remains a label. No specific shadow (a personal loss, a moral compromise, a suppressed memory) is confronted on the page. The concept does not constrain tactics or narrow options; it is thematic decoration.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Gravitational lightness from happiness is stated early and invoked twice: "impossible physics whispered through her bones, making her gravitationally lighter" and "her heart light as the ship." She uses that lightness to "float above the torn seam," but the action is told rather than dramatized—no visible cost (energy drain, risk of drift) accompanies the shift. The trait enables a convenience rather than shaping a choice with tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Stitch" appears in the first third ("the method Nara used to stitch the torn veil") and returns at closure ("a stitch in the cosmos"). The action drives the middle sequence: "each stitch required careful alignment," "with each pass, the veil's ragged edges pulled tighter." However, the stitching is never shown as difficult or interrupted; it succeeds linearly without reversal. Swapping "stitch" for "repair" or "seal" would leave the structure intact.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.7</grade><comment>The shimmer of long-dried tears on photographs is named early and tied to the stitching method ("the faint shimmer of the tear acted as a needle of light"), but the photographs themselves never appear as props. The shimmer is abstract—Nara does not handle, arrange, or react to any photograph on the page. The method is summary-only.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The recycled spaceship is named in the opening line and anchors the first third ("rusted corridors," "patched panels," "dead corridors"). Its hull "seemed to sigh" when gravity loosened, and it "continued its silent drift" after Nara departs. However, the ship never constrains her actions—no airlock, no tool, no failing system complicates the stitching. It is atmospheric backdrop rather than tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"After the last human child had been born" is stated early but functions as worldbuilding flavor. No ticking clock or timeframe pressure shapes Nara's choices; she works at her own pace with no deadline, interruption, or decay threatening the veil. The timeframe is ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Opening the locked dimension is named as Nara's goal in the first third and frames the entire sequence. However, the motivation is told ("she believed") rather than dramatized through a flashback, a loss, or a denied alternative. No moment shows why this dimension matters to her personally or what she sacrifices to pursue it. The desire is present but one-dimensional.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Ghostly resolve" is named early ("the ghostly resolve of her ancestors echoed in the metal") and the tone holds across the piece—elevated, elegiac diction and abstract imagery maintain a consistent mood. The tone modulates slightly when the dimension opens ("pale wind breathed, carrying the scent of untouched forests"), charging the final image with promise. However, "ghostly" is a label; the prose does not embody spectral presence through rhythm or uncanny detail that would make the tone felt rather than named.</comment>
