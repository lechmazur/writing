<question>1</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Mara remains label-only throughout: "cryptic letterpress operator" whose motivation ("compress eternity into a moment") is asserted but never rooted in concrete want, fear, or prior wound. No embodied emotion—she "traces," "believes," "watches," "realizes," "smiled"—all reported states without contradiction or struggle. The climactic press-slam lacks any stakes for her personally; no cost, no foreclosed path, no renunciation. Internal life is a catalog of abstract observations rather than a mind under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed past 120 words (who Mara is and what "destabilize perfect systems" means remain abstract; the sea-of-clouds library is lyric décor, not a grounded locale). Drive lens is ambiguous—accumulative texture competes with causal "because" phrasing, yet no pattern is taught by the 25% mark. The ending offers a conceptual repricing (rupture reconfigures the library into portals), but cost is asserted ("reveal true wonder," "rewrite," "renegotiate") rather than shown through a forfeited option or felt price. Causality is intact but the closure unit lacks on-page weight.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The glass-orchard library and sea of clouds anchor setting early, and the bottled whisper plus the press are handled on the page. Frost patterns and the lattice transformation charge the final image. However, the environment never constrains a choice—Mara uses the press and frost without spatial friction or resource trade-off. Sensory detail (frost, shards, humming) is vivid but ornamental; spatial choreography (where she stands, how objects relate) is vague. Just misses the 6.1 threshold because constraint is absent.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"compress eternity into a moment"—is signaled early but remains abstract and faces no on-page test that narrows options. No reversal or tightening choice; Mara proceeds from bottle to press to completion without friction, failure, or adaptation. The rupture is described as "destabilize perfect systems," yet no credible resistance or cost appears—books slip, panes crack, but these are scenic events, not obstacles she must overcome or prices she pays. Agency is procedural execution, not decision under pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Theme of "negotiating reality" and "rustling awakenings rewrite immutable codes" is stated rather than enacted through concrete stakes. The bottled whisper and frost-spiral method are symbolic furniture; their recurrence does not constrain choice or shift meaning—they illustrate the theme rather than dramatize it. The final image ("compress the infinite," "testimony") declares wonder without showing the cost or contradiction that would make it resonate. Lacks the non-literal answer; instead, the story sermonizes its own thesis in the closing lines.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV holds without leakage, and the lexicon is consistent—elevated, abstract, lyric. However, perceptual signature is generic: Mara notices in stock terms ("traced," "believed," "realized," "watched") without idiosyncratic bias. Diction drifts into prompt-echo phrasing ("rustling awakenings," "negotiable," "compress eternity") that reads like theme labels rather than character thought. Filter verbs stack ("She realized," "She decided," "She traced," "She lifted") across peak beats, dulling immediacy. No dialogue present to judge.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and template cadence pervade: adjacent sentences restate the same content with synonym churn ("whisper," "rustling awakenings," "bottled whisper's hidden song" cycle without adding pressure; "compress eternity into a moment" appears verbatim four times). Mixed metaphors: frost "conduit," whisper "hums," pages "unfurl like wings," shards "sing"—vehicles violate each other's logic. Scaffold phrasing ("She traced… She pressed… She lifted… She placed") stacks across the climax. Final-paragraph thematic echo ("testimony that rustling awakenings can rewrite") is sermon rather than image. Accumulation triggers −1.4 in Q7 and disallows 9+ globally per the artifact cap.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Core premise—reality-bending letterpress in a floating library—is a high-concept fantasy template executed without fresh inflection. The method (frost patterns, bottled whisper pressed into ink) is ornamental magic without cost or trade-off. Turns feel pre-scripted rather than emergent from character want colliding with obstacle. Emotional truth is absent; Mara's arc is a procedural demonstration, not lived complexity. Proximity to stock "reality as text" tropes without transformation lowers the band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Mara is present throughout but makes no on-page choice that alters tactics or forecloses an option. She executes a procedure (trace frost, press bottle) without friction, adaptation, or cost. Observation and procedural action dominate; decision-making is absent. Present in setup, middle, and ending, but functionally passive—barely above ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Bottled whisper appears in beats across the story (received in a sealed bottle, pressed against the press, fused with ink, hums in final page), meeting the two-beat minimum. It enables the climactic act (press-slam) and charges the ending image ("humming against her palm"). However, its mechanics are abstract ("liquid darkness humming the secret") and swappable with any generic magical catalyst. Setup, development, closure present; causal pressure is light; cost connection absent. Solid 5-band integration.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Rustling awakenings" is a repeated label (appears six times) but never defines what it is, how it works, or what choice it constrains. It functions as thematic décor—"pulse of a world renegotiating," "erupted in a cascade"—without dramatized stakes. Present in setup and ending, absent from middle development. Ornamental theme claim, not a concept that shapes tactics or options.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Destabilizes perfect systems" is asserted in the opening and echoed at closure ("can be broken to reveal true wonder"), but no on-page action shows Mara weighing stability versus rupture, and no cost attaches to the destabilization. The library "trembles" and "reconfigures," but these are scenic effects, not prices Mara pays or trades she makes. Label-only trait without visible trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Rupture" is named as the climactic act (press slams, crack ripples, books slip, lattice forms) and the ending hinges on it (library becomes "living lattice," "portals to eternal now"). Present in setup warning, executed at climax, revisited in final image. However, the rupture is a scenic transformation, not a protagonist decision with alternatives—Mara performs it without friction or cost. One major beat involvement, some closure linkage, but swappable with any "break the seal" action. Mid 5-band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Patterns in morning frost" appear early (Mara traces them, believes they encode a method), are used in the climax (arranged into a spiral, pressed at center), and the shards-on-frost moment bridges to the ending. Present in all three gates. However, the frost is passive décor—its "crystalline geometry" is asserted to matter but never constrains a choice or imposes a cost. Functional but replaceable with any symbolic diagram. Low 5-band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Glass orchard library on sea of clouds is anchored early and transformed at closure (becomes "living lattice"). However, it never pressures a choice—Mara uses the press without spatial friction, access limits, or environmental cost. The setting is vivid postcard description (panes, clouds, shards) that illustrates theme rather than shaping tactics. Setup and payoff present; middle development absent. Functional but swappable with any floating magical workspace.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>1.9</grade><comment>"After reality becomes negotiable" is a conceptual backdrop mentioned in one phrase ("reality now negotiable") but never tracked, dramatized, or used to tighten decisions. No clock, no before/after contrast, no sense of when negotiability began or what it costs. Ornamental theme label without temporal mechanics. Missing all three gates.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>"Compress eternity into a moment" is stated as Mara's motivation in the opening and closing, and the final page is declared to achieve it. However, the desire is never rooted in concrete want (why does she need this? what does she fear losing?) or tested by friction—she simply executes the procedure. No on-page conflict between the goal and a cost or obstacle. Setup and payoff present, but no dramatized friction. Told-only motivation, low functional band.</comment>
