<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Kael's motivation ("defeat emotional numbness") is stated but never dramatized through contradictory impulses or embodied emotion under pressure. The "ego death survivor" backstory remains abstract label-speak without showing how this history constrains his present choices. Mara appears at the end as a teaching vessel, and the Guardians/Syndicate function as ornamental obstacles rather than characters who force trade-offs. The climactic "slice" reads as convenient resolution without visible cost or internal conflict—Kael's emotional numbness simply "cracks" without earned progression.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed: who Kael is, where the dojo floats, and what "history rewrites itself" means remain vague past the opening third, forcing the reader to infer stakes from abstract labels. The closure—Kael slicing the jar and feeling a "pulse"—lacks visible cost; the Guardians and Syndicate instantly dissolve their conflict without dramatized consequence. Causality is weak: the "blade of paradox" concept enables the slice without prior setup of what this means or why it works, and the Duplicate awakens via summary rather than on-page struggle. The drive lens is ambiguous (attempted Causal with Accumulative dressing), and the ending offers reconfiguration without felt price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The floating dojo and "sea of shifting chronologies" are vivid in concept but remain postcard description; no environmental constraint shapes Kael's tactics or the jar-slicing act. The basalt platform, glass cylinder, and luminous fluid are present across beats and return at closure, qualifying micro-setting use. Sensory detail is selective but often generic ("dawn light," "low vibrant hum") without POV-specific filtering. Spatial choreography is clear enough for the single scene, though the Guardians and Syndicate's positions are vague.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—vivifying the Duplicate to restore feeling—is signaled early but never tested by a meaningful trade-off or reversal. The Guardians and Syndicate declare opposition but collapse without forcing Kael to sacrifice anything; his "silence" and blade swing face no cost or complication. The piece attempts a tightening (slice the jar) but it reads as convenient solution rather than earned escalation. No persistent constraint (time, resource, moral calculus) alters tactics, and coincidence (the factions simply "lower their weapons") resolves the custody battle off-page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Theme of "complementary opposites" and post-ego-death rebuilding is stated repeatedly ("calm and fury," "compassion and resolve") but remains abstract; the piece tells the theme rather than showing it through concrete choices with friction. The final image (dojo as sanctuary, shared heartbeat) gestures at resonance but lacks specificity—"rebuilding through complementary opposites" could apply to any recovery story. The Duplicate's awakening and Kael's emotional restoration land without ambiguity or cost, producing a tidy moral rather than earned complexity. Mara's brief appearance adds a teaching-coda frame but no thematic tension.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited holds stable with no head-hopping, and Kael's perceptual filter (ego-death lens) is consistent in concept if abstract in execution. Diction leans elevated ("vivifying," "emancipation," "stewardship") without clear character motivation for the register; under peak pressure the prose remains declarative rather than fragmenting or sharpening. The few dialogue lines (Guardians "demand," Syndicate "shouted," Mara's question) lack subtext or distinct idiom. Psychic distance is controlled, but filter verbs ("felt," "understood") cluster in summary beats without adding texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Severe template cadence and paraphrase loops throughout: "slices through pretense" repeats five times with minimal variation, "complementary opposites" appears four times in identical phrasing, and "vivify/vivified/vivifying" recurs eight times without functional escalation. Sentence stems converge ("He [verb]," "The [noun] [verb]," "Kael [verb]") across 12+ lines. Figurative language is dense but often mixed or stock ("ink in water," "dust after collapse," "ice under sunrise"). Paragraphs in the final third are paraphrase loops: the dojo's transformation and shared heartbeat are restated three times without added pressure. Information density is low—many lines rephrase rather than advance. The closure beat is dulled by these artifacts, triggering the Q7 disallow-9+ clause and cross-cap.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The "floating dojo above shifting chronologies" frame and "blade of paradox" concept offer surface novelty, but the custody battle and ego-death recovery follow familiar template arcs without transformation. The Guardians vs. Syndicate conflict resolves via consensus without earned friction. Key images (glass jar, luminous fluid, brain-in-jar) are genre-conventional; the "complementary opposites" method is stated but not dramatized through specific, non-obvious choices. The piece hedges risk by granting Kael success without visible cost or surprise, and the final sanctuary framing reads as safe summary rather than bold stance.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Kael is present throughout and his "ego death survivor" label frames the opening, but his choices do not create key turns—he simply swings the blade and the problem resolves. The backstory (ego collapse) is told rather than shown to constrain present action. His final teaching moment with Mara is expository rather than decision-driven. Swappability is high: another archetype could perform the same beats with minor edits. Present but functional, not causal.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The brain-in-jar ("Duplicate") is introduced early (setup), handled in the middle (Kael approaches, Guardians/Syndicate argue over it), and directly acted upon at closure (sliced free, awakens). It appears in three distinct beats and its state change (contained → released → pulsing) drives the ending image. Cost is implied (the custody factions dissolve) but not made specific to the jar itself. The object is essential to the plot but could be replaced with another "captive consciousness" artifact without breaking logic; its particularity (brain, bioluminescence) is decorative rather than mechanically unique. Score reflects strong beat involvement and closure linkage, reduced by moderate swappability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>The "clone custody battle" between Guardians and Syndicate is mentioned in exposition and provides the declared conflict, but it never shapes on-page tactics—the factions shout, then vanish when Kael acts. The battle is resolved by Kael's unilateral decision rather than negotiation or trade-off involving the concept's mechanics. Present as setup and thematic echo, but ornamental to actual choices. Late-scene mentions do not constrain action.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Slices through pretense" appears as a repeated phrase (five times) but functions as metaphor-label rather than dramatized attribute. Kael's blade "slices" the jar and "slices through" the dojo's illusions, yet no cost or constraint is tied to this trait—it simply succeeds whenever invoked. The attribute is told in exposition and summary rather than enacted with friction. Present throughout but ornamental, without specific causal work or trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Vivify" is signaled as Kael's goal in the opening third, attempted in the middle (approaching the cylinder), and completed at closure (the Duplicate "awakens," Kael's numbness cracks). The action drives the ending and could not be easily swapped—restoration is the narrative spine. Causal pressure is moderate: the vivification succeeds without complication or cost, reducing irreplaceability. Score reflects strong setup, beat involvement, and closure linkage, with deduction for low friction and generic emotional payoff.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"Complementary opposites" is stated four times but never demonstrated through mechanics—how does pairing "calm and fury" enable the slice? The method is invoked at closure ("pair each breath of calm with a strike of purpose") but remains abstract instruction rather than on-page technique. No cost or constraint is tied to using this method versus another approach. Present as thematic claim, absent as dramatized means.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The floating dojo is introduced early and returns in the final third ("drifted higher," "became a sanctuary"), providing spatial continuity and a charged image at closure. However, the setting does not constrain Kael's choices or supply resources that affect outcome—he could perform the same act in any arena. The "sea of shifting chronologies" and basalt platform are vivid but passive backdrop. Setup and payoff are present; middle development (pressure via setting) is absent. Lyric reprise lifts the score into the 5.5–6.3 allowance range, but lack of tactical constraint caps it mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"History rewrites itself" is mentioned in the opening and closing paragraphs as atmospheric detail, but no ticking clock or rewrite event pressures Kael's decisions. The timeframe does not tighten tactics or create urgency—Kael acts when he chooses, and the Duplicate awakens on his schedule. Present as thematic frame, absent as functional constraint. Ornamental use only.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Kael's desire to "defeat emotional numbness" is stated in the opening third and tested at closure when he "felt a surge of feeling flood his chest." The motivation is present across setup, middle approach, and payoff. However, the desire is told rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses or visible cost—numbness simply "cracks" without friction or trade-off. No competing want or fear complicates the goal. Functional and present in all three gates, but replaceable with another emotional-deficit motivation and lacking embodied conflict.</comment>
