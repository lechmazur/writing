<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Lira's motivation to name nameless fears is stated rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. Her lost sailor memory arrives as convenient backstory without altering present choices. The naming sequence proceeds mechanically without visible cost or internal resistance—each crystal obligingly releases its terror without forcing Lira to sacrifice anything on the page. Interiority relies on abstract declaration ("her heart ached") rather than embodied sensation under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors appear early (observatory, reaper, recordings found). The piece follows accumulative/textural mode: crystals accumulate, each named, then dissolve into aurora. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration—Lira remembers her sailor's name and feels release—but the cost is conceptual rather than felt; nothing is foreclosed on the page. The "echo of sacrifice" transforms from burden to bridge via assertion, not dramatized choice. One meaningful deepening occurs (recognition of the constellation spelling her love's name), but the final beat lacks visible price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The observatory's cracked dome and rusted lenses provide vivid anchoring. The atlas page and crystals function as micro-setting objects that shape the naming sequence. However, the environment does not constrain choice—Lira proceeds unimpeded through each naming. The final constellation image charges the closure moment, lifting the score into mid-band despite the largely postcard-descriptive treatment of the stone arches and amber dusk.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—naming nameless fears—is signaled early but never tested by opposition or cost. Each crystal yields its name without resistance; no reversal narrows options. The sequence is additive (more names) rather than escalating. The sailor's name arriving as memory rather than hard-won discovery undercuts agency. No visible price alters tactics; the transformation from grief to gratitude is declared, not earned through foreclosed paths.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The theme of naming as a way to release grief emerges through the crystal sequence and converges with the echo-of-sacrifice motif. The final constellation offers a non-literal answer—love made visible—but the journey lacks complexity; every fear softens on command without counter-pressure. The ending avoids overt moralizing yet borders on sentimentality ("grief to gratitude") without earned ambiguity. Subtext in the melting droplets and aurora is present but not charged by contradictory impulses.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. The prose establishes a lyric register ("dripping with the sighs of unkept promises") but drifts into elevated diction that exceeds plausible focalizer lexicon during high-pressure beats. Perceptual signature is generic—Lira notices in predictable poetic ways. Psychic distance stays consistent, but the voice lacks distinct rhythm or idiomatic particularity; the cadence feels templated across paragraphs.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Figurative language saturates most sentences without pattern-teaching or payoff: "cloak dripping with sighs," "terror pulse like a second heart," "distant intimacy lingering." Mixed metaphors appear (sea monsters as maps, ink crystallizing into statues that hum). Paraphrase loops recur: "echo of sacrifice" is restated across multiple beats without added pressure. Template cadence: "She lifted... She whispered... She felt..." runs dominate. Register drifts into abstract philosophizing ("the weight of centuries of unfinished farewells") during closure. Density −0.7, coherence −0.5, loop −0.4; artifacts touch closure: cap all 9+ globally and apply −1.6 total in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The reaper-naming-sea-monsters premise is distinctive, but the execution follows a comfort-arc template: grief → naming sequence → aurora → release. The atlas-to-constellation recursion offers one fresh turn, yet the emotional journey lacks friction or non-obvious cost. The grief-work frame is well-worn; specificity (phosphorescent ink, crystals humming) decorates rather than transforms. No bold risk reshapes stakes mid-sequence.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Lira names each crystal in sequence, but these are enacted decisions without resistance or tradeoff. Her final choice—whispering the sailor's name—arrives via memory rather than earned discovery. She is present across all beats yet largely observes her own ritual; the heartbroken trait does not constrain action. Setup and closure participation are met; middle development is ornamental (naming proceeds mechanically). Cap at 4.6 for minimal causal pressure; subtract −0.4 for swappability (any grief-worker could perform the sequence).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The atlas page appears early, is lifted and examined (beat one), its ink crystallizes (beat two), and the final constellation mirrors its design (closure linkage). Three beats with clear causal pressure: the page's sea monsters become the crystals Lira must name. The phosphorescent blue and monster-eyes-as-lanterns are specific. However, the page does not constrain choice—it enables without cost. Setup +0.5, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.0, specificity +0.5, minus ornamental first use −0.5, minus no visible cost −0.9.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The echo of sacrifice is named early, recurs across beats ("pulse louder," "ancient rhythm"), and transforms at closure from burden to bridge. It shapes the thematic stakes but does not narrow tactical options—Lira's naming proceeds regardless. Two beats (pulse, rhythm) plus closure linkage; conceptual cost is claimed but not dramatized. Setup +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.9, cost connection claimed +0.0 (not visible), swappability −0.6 (replaceable with "legacy of loss"), summary-only −0.4.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The "echoes forgotten phrases" attribute appears in the recordings Lira finds and in the chant she hears from the crystals. It is setup (recordings) and middle (chant), but does not constrain or enable a specific on-page choice with cost. The phrases are buried rather than shaping tactics. Setup +0.4, one beat (chant) +0.4, late middle appearance −0.3, ornamental use −0.6, swappability −0.5 (replaceable with "lost words" or "ancient voices"). Cap at 4.6 for missing closure participation; apply −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Crystallization is the central transformation: the ink on the atlas page crystallizes into statues that Lira then names. It drives the middle sequence and is causally necessary—without crystallization, no naming occurs. Setup (signaled via "scattered light" cue), middle beats (each crystal), and closure (droplets coalesce into aurora). However, the action itself is passive (Lira watches it happen) rather than chosen. Setup +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +0.8, closure linkage +1.0, no agency cost −0.8, swappability −0.6 (could be "solidify" or "manifest").</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Scattered light appears early (through cracked dome, turning dust to prisms) and triggers crystallization. It is setup and middle mechanism. Closure participation is weak—the aurora is light, but "scattered" is not reprised. The method is signaled and its mechanics matter (light causes ink to crystallize), but it does not shape attempts beyond the initial trigger. Setup +0.6, one beat (crystallization trigger) +0.4, causal pressure +0.7, specificity +0.4, missing closure reprise −0.5, ornamental final use −0.6, late first causal use −0.3.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The ancient observatory at dusk frames the entire sequence. Its cracked dome admits the scattered light (causal), stone walls inhale and reverberate Lira's names (middle pressure), and it becomes a sanctuary at closure. Three beats with clear involvement; however, the setting does not constrain choice—Lira could perform this ritual elsewhere. Setup +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure (light) +0.7, closure linkage (sanctuary) +0.8, no constraint −0.9, ornamental dusk −0.4. Micro-setting (dome, stone) qualifies but does not alter tactics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The timeframe "after finding the old recordings" is established in the opening but does not function as a clock or tighten decisions. The recordings prime Lira's awareness but do not impose urgency. Setup met, no middle development (time does not narrow options), no closure participation. Setup +0.4, one beat (recordings anchor) +0.4, missing middle development cap at 3.4, ornamental use −0.0 (already capped). Final 3.8.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The motivation to give names to nameless fears is stated early, drives the naming sequence (middle beats), and resolves at closure when Lira names her sailor. Three beats with clear causal linkage. However, the desire is told rather than dramatized through friction—Lira proceeds without internal conflict or competing want. Setup +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, told-only −0.8, no friction −0.6, summary-only −0.4.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Distant intimacy is signaled ("distant intimacy of the place wrapping around her") and reprised at closure ("forever echoing"). The tone is coherent—lyric, elevated, melancholic—but static; it does not modulate with pressure or charge the final image beyond label. Setup +0.5, closure linkage +0.8, coherence +0.4, label-only −0.3, static mood −0.6, ornamental mention −0.4. Lyric-resonance allowance applies (early seed → final reprise), lifting into mid-5s.</comment>
