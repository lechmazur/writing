<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Mira is defined by occupation and mission statement but lacks contradictory impulses in scene. Her "slyly heartfelt" mission and emotional arc are told rather than dramatized through choices under pressure. The council elder's sudden shift from "long-held doubts" to unity occurs without visible internal conflict or cost. Interiority relies on label-only feelings ("quiet revelation," "dappled resolve") rather than embodied contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The story anchors who/where/when promptly. The lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with lyric elements, but escalation remains flat—Mira encounters no meaningful resistance or tightening; the floodgate simply works as intended. The ending offers a Conceptual Repricing (water by conversation/encrypted compassion binding the city), but the cost is asserted rather than felt on the page: no visible forfeiture, friction, or price paid by Mira or the council. The "clasp of the chain" gesture declares unity without dramatizing the stakes or consequences that led there.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The amphitheater is vividly rendered with sensory specificity (basalt floor, trembling stone, ash settling) and the volcanic setting charges atmosphere throughout. However, the environment does not constrain Mira's choices or alter her tactics—she completes her task without spatial or resource friction. The final image (water glinting "like a sapphire thread") is atmospheric but ornamental; the setting does not shape the closure beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—harmonizing conflicting values—is declared but never tested on the page. Mira faces no opposition, complication, or reversal; the floodgate works immediately, and the elder's conversion is frictionless. No tightening, trade-off, or visible price accompanies the resolution. Agency (turning the wheel, whispering to the stone) is present but uncontested, reducing pressure to a procedural sequence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The theme of reconciling preservation and progress emerges through "encrypted compassion" and the water-as-empathy metaphor. However, the concept remains abstract and untested—no council debate, no cost of choosing one value over another. The ending states rather than enacts thematic resolution: "each drop a word in the ongoing encrypted compassion" is sermonic. The amphitheater's breath and the chain's cipher offer evocative images but do not complicate or deepen the thematic question through conflict.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Voice leans heavily on elevated diction ("dappled resolve," "slyly heartfelt," "sapphire thread") that often feels imposed rather than character-filtered; Mira's perceptual signature is generic rather than mechanist-specific. Filter verbs ("she felt," "she imagined," "she knew") stack in key beats, dulling immediacy. The single line of dialogue ("When stone weeps, rivers speak") is functional but not tested for subtext or voice distinction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Overwriting pervades: nearly every sentence carries figurative language ("whispered ancient applause," "singing a low hymn," "insects caught in a sunlit breeze") without pattern-teaching or escalation payoff, creating density without propulsion (−0.7). Paraphrase loops appear: "tremble" variants recur six times without reweighting meaning. Template cadence in the second half: "She [verb]… The [noun] seemed to [verb]…" runs across multiple beats (−0.5). Mixed metaphors: the chain "sings a hymn" yet has "metal teeth"; adhesive "retained the imprint" that then "rearranged into binary pulses" without causal linkage. Register drifts into abstraction ("living algorithm," "ongoing encrypted compassion") that clashes with the tactile workshop voice.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The volcanic amphitheater and encrypted-chain mechanic offer a specific synthesis, but the core conflict—council divided over preservation vs. progress—is a familiar template executed without transformation. The floodgate's immediate success and frictionless elder conversion avoid narrative risk. "Encrypted compassion" as cipher and metaphor is evocative but remains ornamental rather than driving a non-obvious moral calculus. The story does not commit to the implications of its premise: no actual cost, friction, or failure tests the ingenuity or the reconciliation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Mira is present throughout and performs technical actions (examining adhesive, connecting chain to valve, turning wheel), but these are procedural rather than choice-driven. No decision alters tactics or forecloses a path; the floodgate works as intended without complication. Her occupation enables the plot but does not create pressure or cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The surveyor's chain appears in the opening, is used to decode the cipher and connect to the floodgate valve (two beats), and returns symbolically in the final paragraph when the elder offers a clasp. It shapes the technical solution and is reprised with reweighted meaning (unity symbol), meeting Setup/Development/Payoff gates. However, it is swappable with any encodable measuring tool without altering the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Encrypted compassion is introduced early as a cipher and recurs thematically throughout. It frames the floodgate's function and the ending image ("each drop a word in the ongoing encrypted compassion"). However, it does not constrain Mira's choices or create tactical friction—she decodes it smoothly and applies it without cost. The concept functions as theme statement rather than on-page pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Slyly heartfelt" is mentioned twice as a descriptor but never enacted through choice or visible cost. No on-page action shows slyness (indirect approach, tactical concealment) or tests heartfelt commitment with a trade-off. The trait is label-only, not dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Tremble" and variants appear six times, anchoring the amphitheater's breath motif and the stone's response to Mira's work. The action is present in Setup (stone trembling), Development (subsiding into ripple when the wheel turns), and Payoff (stone walls tremble in quiet joy; elder's doubts tremble into silence). It charges the final image and is irreplaceable to the breathing-building conceit, but it does not narrow options or create causal pressure—more atmospheric than tactical.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The envelope adhesive is signaled early, examined mid-story, and its analysis yields the cipher key (binary pulses mapped to chain pressure points). It participates in Setup and Development, shaping the technical solution. However, it appears only in summary ("She brushed the residue…") and could be replaced with any cipher-bearing artifact (inscription, etching) without structural impact. Its mechanics are asserted rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The amphitheater is anchored immediately and sustained with vivid sensory detail throughout (stone seats, basalt floor, marble niches, trembling walls). It provides atmosphere and houses the floodgate, participating in Setup and Payoff (the amphitheater exhales at the end). However, it does not constrain Mira's choices or supply resources that alter tactics—she works unimpeded. The setting is present and evocative but not causal.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"As the building breathes" is mentioned in the opening and reprised obliquely in the ending ("the amphitheater's breath slowed"). The breathing motif provides a rhythmic frame but does not tighten decisions or impose a live clock. Time remains vague and untracked; no urgency or deadline pressures Mira's work. The timeframe is atmospheric rather than tactical.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Harmonizing conflicting values is stated as Mira's mission in the opening and is the story's dominant stake. It frames her actions (installing the floodgate to balance water needs) and is restated in the ending (council finding common ground). However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized—no on-page friction tests Mira's commitment, and no cost accompanies the resolution. Present across beats but not conflicted in choices.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Dappled resolve" is mentioned twice and aligns with the story's contemplative, lyric register. Tone is stable and coherent throughout—elevated, atmospheric, earnest—but it does not modulate with pressure (no intensification or complication) and does not charge the final image with felt tension. The tone supports the premise but remains static rather than escalating or reweighting under stress.</comment>
