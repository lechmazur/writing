<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lira's motivation to discover the mathematics of mercy is declared but never tested through genuine choice or contradiction. Her interior is heavy with abstract concepts ("lattice of bruised memories," "mathematics of mercy") rather than embodied emotion or micro-decisions under pressure. The proprioceptive enhancement and trauma-response navigation are labeled traits without constraining a single on-page action. No secondary character appears to create relational friction, and the final removal of the strap reads as symbolic gesture rather than a choice with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The piece opens with disorienting abstraction ("impossible shades of violet," "anesthesia finally wore off") and does not anchor who, where, or when until well past 120 words, triggering the Orientation Test penalty. Drive lens is ambiguous: the forest walk reads accumulative/textural, but the whispered equation and strap removal suggest a decisive change that is never dramatized—no before/after options are legible on the page. The "ultraviolet penance" softening after the whispered equation lacks causal setup or felt cost; the resolution is asserted, not earned. Closure form is unclear: is this Conceptual Repricing or a vague shift? The final image (strap warming, turning golden) is symbolic recapitulation without a visible choice or foreclosed path.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The ultraviolet forest is vivid and consistent, with the pewter strap reflecting light and crystal roots humming notes tied to digits. However, the environment remains decorative; no choice hinges on the forest's properties. The strap constrains nothing and the humming roots enable nothing beyond providing a symbolic match for the equation. Spatial choreography is clear (clearing, mosaic of roots, path of moss), but the setting does not pressure Lira's tactics or alter the outcome.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—discovering the mathematics of mercy—is declared early but never faces on-page opposition or cost. The forest's "ultraviolet penance" (flashes of light that sear skin) is mentioned but never dramatized as a trade-off that alters her approach. The climactic equation ("mercy equals the sum of understood suffering divided by the willingness to remember") is whispered and the forest immediately softens, erasing pressure rather than escalating it. No reversal, no tightening choice, no visible price paid. The ending grants understanding without forcing Lira to forfeit or endure anything concrete.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The theme of mercy as calculated through remembered pain is stated outright in the equation and the final paragraph's moral summary ("the willingness to brace oneself against one's own shadows"). Abstractions like "geometry of compassion" and "displaced yet rooted" are repeated without grounding in specific action. The pewter strap's transformation from shackle to beacon is symbolic but not earned by prior particulars. The ending explains the theme rather than letting it emerge from scene pressure, and the final line delivers a thesis statement instead of a resonant image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Lira, but the diction oscillates between lyric abstraction ("lattice of bruised memories," "ultraviolet penance") and plain narration without a consistent perceptual signature. Register drifts into elevated, abstract phrasing ("mathematics of mercy," "geometry of compassion") that feels authorial rather than character-bound. No dialogue appears. The prose at peak beats (the equation whisper, the strap removal) remains in the same abstracted register, missing the opportunity for compression or rhythmic shift under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Pervasive paraphrase loops and synonym churn: "ultraviolet" appears in nearly every paragraph, often in stock phrases ("ultraviolet fire," "ultraviolet canopy," "ultraviolet penance," "ultraviolet limbs"). Template cadence runs through the middle third with repeated "She braced" and "She reached" sentence openings. Mixed metaphor: the forest "breathes" and has "limbs" but also "retracts" them like mechanical appendages. Filter-verb stacks ("She felt," "She realized," "She recalled") dull immediacy in high-pressure moments. The equation beat is told in summary rather than dramatized. Stock metaphors: "beacon," "scalpel," "roots." Artifacts touch the closure (final paragraph's explanatory summary), triggering the −1.7 penalty and disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>The premise—trauma survivor navigating a magical forest to discover an equation of mercy—is conceptually ambitious but executed through familiar fantasy tropes (glowing forest, symbolic object, epiphany at clearing). The equation itself is generic self-help phrasing rather than a specific, character-earned insight. The pewter strap's arc from shackle to beacon is a well-worn redemption symbol. The story could be rewritten with different names and setting (e.g., desert, cave, mountain) without changing the emotional arc or thematic resolution, failing the transformation test. No bold structural or perspectival risk; the linear walk-to-epiphany structure is safe and predictable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Lira's survivor status is setup (interrogation memories, trauma responses) and present in reflection throughout, but she makes no on-page choice that hinges on this identity. Her decisions (walking, bracing, whispering the equation) are open to any protagonist. The trait is functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The pewter strap appears in setup (clings to her jaw), development (reflects ultraviolet light), and closure (warms, turns golden). However, it constrains no choice and is handled only twice (feeling its weight at start and lifting it at end). The strap's symbolic transformation is asserted, not dramatized through cost. Two beats, closure linkage, but no causal pressure or irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Ultraviolet penance is setup (the forest demands a price: flashes of violet light that sear), but the penance is never paid on the page—no searing scene, no trade-off. It reappears thematically in the final third ("ultraviolet penance became a ritual of forgiveness") but does not constrain tactics or alter stakes. Present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>Proprioceptively enhanced is mentioned in setup ("strange internal compass") but never enables or constrains an action. Lira does not navigate by this sense in any beat; she simply walks to the clearing. Label-only trait with no functional role.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Brace" appears in three beats: against the bark, against the memory, and for the final surge of light. In the second beat it serves as metaphorical transition ("allowing the pain to become a scalpel"), and in the third it signals readiness for closure. However, the action is passive preparation rather than a decision that redefines options. Two-to-three beats, closure linkage, but swappable with "steady herself" or "endure" with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Remembering through trauma responses is setup (trauma responses map the forest's patterns) and mentioned in development (recalling interrogators' numbers), but the method does not shape any on-page attempt or choice. The climactic equation is delivered by whispering, not by enacting the method. Present but not mechanically active.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The ultraviolet forest is setup (first paragraph), development (the humming roots provide symbolic digits), and closure (the forest retracts, leaving ordinary moss). However, the forest provides no resource or obstacle that alters Lira's tactics. The crystal roots enable the equation thematically but do not constrain her approach. Two beats, closure participation, but the setting does not pressure choice.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>"After the anesthesia wears off" anchors the opening moment but is never tracked or referenced again. No clock tightens decisions; the walk to the clearing is timeless. The timeframe is present in setup only, with no development or payoff.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The motivation to discover the mathematics of mercy is setup (early declaration: "Lira's motivation pulsed like a heartbeat") and closure (the equation is whispered, mercy is understood). However, the desire is told, not dramatized through conflicted choices. No friction between want and cost appears on the page. Setup and payoff, but no development or visible trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Displaced rooted" is signaled in the final third ("She felt herself rooted in the displaced world") and recurs in the closing paragraph, but the tone is not established early or modulated under pressure. The prose maintains a single lyric-abstract register throughout, missing the opportunity for cadence shift. Late signal and static mood.</comment>
