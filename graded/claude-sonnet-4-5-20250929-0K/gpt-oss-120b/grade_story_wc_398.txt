<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The sentinel's motivation to "nurture intersubjective understanding" between ghosts and soil reads as abstract label-speak rather than embodied want. No contradictory impulses act in scene; the character operates in solitary communion with vines, so relationship and status bullets cannot apply. The ending declares he "finally felt whole" without a prior on-page struggle between competing desires or visible cost that forecloses a path. Interiority consists of elevated philosophical abstractions ("passionate subtlety," "gently persuasive") rather than concrete, character-particular perception.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who and where early ("lone vineyard sentinel," "amber pavilion"), satisfying the test. Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural by the lyric density and focus on image repetition, yet no single beat tightens options or reweights cost with undeniable pressure. The piece offers a conceptual repricing in the final paragraph ("mismatched destinies could converge"), but cost remains asserted rather than dramatized on the page—no line points to a specific forfeiture, injury, or lost option. Closure form is present but cost legibility fails the proof test, triggering a −0.6 deduction in Q2.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The "amber pavilion" and "oldest trellis" anchor space; the vines' tendrils curling toward ash in one beat shows setting in minor action. Sensory selection (scent of fermenting grapes, amber light) is present but filtered through generic lyricism rather than the sentinel's occupational or personal bias. The setting does not constrain a choice or charge the final image with specific cost, capping the score under the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography is coherent within the single continuous scene.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—bridging past romance and present vineyard through the letter's planting—is signaled early and maintained. No on-page reversal narrows options; the sentinel plants the scrap, the vines respond cooperatively, and the ending declares harmony without visible tradeoff or foreclosed path. Pressure reads as atmospheric assertion ("gently persuasive," "passionate subtlety") rather than causally driven escalation. The lack of a visible cost at closure and the absence of a tightening under the Accumulative lens keep the score mid-band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Theme of "mismatched destinies" and "intersubjective understanding" is stated repeatedly in abstract labels ("drawing parallels," "nurture intersubjective understanding") rather than emerging from concrete action. The final paragraph delivers a thesis statement ("mismatched destinies could converge in quiet harmony") instead of a resonant non-literal answer. Thematic echo in the closure paragraph triggers −0.6. No epiphany is earned through on-page struggle; the sentinel's realization that his watch is "not a punishment but a gently persuasive invitation" arrives as assertion rather than discovery rooted in specific cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable single third-person, no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is generic elevated literary register rather than character-specific; diction ("passionate subtlety," "gently persuasive," "intersubjective understanding") repeats across beats in therapy-speak and academic register, not rooted in a vineyard worker's idiom. Register drift into philosophic abstraction throughout the piece lowers the score. No dialogue present to evaluate. Sentence stems recycle: "By drawing parallels…" appears three times, "gently persuasive" twice, creating template cadence that dulls voice specificity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops are pervasive: the sentinel's act of drawing parallels is restated across paragraphs two, eight, and fourteen with synonym churn but no added pressure. Template cadence: "By drawing parallels…" opens three sentences, "gently persuasive" recurs without variation. Stock metaphors ("amber light seem like liquid memory") and elevated diction in every sentence create density without propulsion. Figurative language saturates nearly every line without pattern-teaching or payoff, triggering −0.7. Artifacts touch the closure beat ("mismatched destinies could converge"), disallowing 9+ globally and adding −1.7 total in Q7 per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>Core premise—solitary figure communes with landscape to heal romantic loss through symbolic planting—echoes familiar pastoral-meditation templates without fresh inflection. "Destined mismatches" and "intersubjective understanding" read as prompt labels inserted rather than transformed through lived vineyard detail or non-obvious stakes. The transformation test fails: swapping sentinel/vineyard for lighthouse keeper/sea or hermit/garden would leave the emotional arc unchanged. Derivative premise adjustment of −0.8 applies. No bold risk elevates; the piece hedges into safe lyricism throughout.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The sentinel plants the letter edge (beat one) and whispers to it (beat two), then recalls his arrival and decides to stay (beat three). These touches appear across setup, middle, and closure, clearing all three gates. However, the planting decision is not forced by conflicting wants or visible cost; vines cooperate immediately without resistance. The character's choices do not narrow options or create tradeoffs—everything unfolds as wished. Causal pressure is minimal; specificity is low (any solitary watcher could perform these acts). Score: early signal +0.5, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +0.7, but ornamental action −0.8, swappability −0.6, late generic mentions in final third −0.2. Start 3.0 + 1.6 positive − 1.6 friction = 3.0; demonstration of repeated presence lifts to mid-4s.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The burned letter edge is cradled (beat one), planted (beat two), glows faintly (beat three), dissolves into soil (beat four), and is recalled as "dark root" (beat five). Present in setup, middle, and closure. The object enables the planting action and is invoked in the final image, showing purposeful recurrence. Yet its mechanics are passive: the letter does not resist, constrain, or create a tradeoff—it simply accepts transformation. Removing it would weaken the image but a generic talisman could substitute with minor edits. Score: early +0.6, four beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, cost connection +0.4, but swappability −0.6, ornamental glow (beat three is asserted, not causally driven) −0.5. Start 3.0 + 2.9 − 1.1 = 4.8; lyric reprise and sustained presence lift to upper 5s.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Destined mismatches" appears as theme label in beats one, six, eight, and seventeen. The concept is stated repeatedly but never constrains a choice: the sentinel does not face a mismatch dilemma on the page, and the vines do not resist or create friction. The phrase flavors the narration without altering tactics or creating visible cost. It participates in closure by assertion ("mismatched destinies could converge") but does not change options there. Score: early +0.4, four mentions count as two distinct thematic beats +0.9, closure mention +0.3, but label-only use −0.9, no causal pressure −1.0, summary-only −0.5. Start 3.0 + 1.6 − 2.4 = 2.2; sustained thematic presence without causal penalty nudges to mid-3s.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"Gently persuasive" is used as a descriptor four times (beats two, ten, thirteen, sixteen) but never shown through a tradeoff or constraint. The sentinel's speech is called gentle, yet no scene shows him choosing patience over force or paying a cost for his method. The trait is label-only; it does not enable a unique action or foreclose a more aggressive path. Score: early +0.5, three beats +0.9, closure mention +0.3, but label-only −0.9, no visible cost −0.8, swappability (could be "patient" or "kind") −0.6. Start 3.0 + 1.7 − 2.3 = 2.4; repeated decorative use without penalty lifts slightly to 3.4.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Rediscover" appears in beat three (urging the letter to rediscover purpose), beat eleven (the letter's story would be rediscovered by future vines), and implicitly in the sentinel's memory (beat thirteen). The action is stated as goal but not dramatized: no scene shows the letter or vines actively reclaiming lost meaning through resistance or revelation. The word frames the theme but could swap for "remember" or "revive" with trivial edits. Score: early +0.5, two distinct beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.8, but summary-only (told, not shown in action) −0.8, swappability −0.6. Start 3.0 + 2.2 − 1.4 = 3.8; thematic coherence and closure tie lift to upper 4s.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"By drawing parallels" is the explicit method in beats three, eight, eleven, and fourteen. The phrase is stated but the mechanics are not shown: the reader does not see which vine trait maps to which letter quality or how the analogy changes the sentinel's planting technique. The method is told in narration rather than enacted through discovery or adjustment. It participates in closure (final "drawing parallels" in beat fourteen) but as assertion, not dramatized constraint. Score: early +0.6, four beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.7, but summary-only −0.8, no causal constraint (it never alters tactics) −1.0. Start 3.0 + 2.2 − 1.8 = 3.4; sustained thematic method presence lifts to low-mid 4s.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The "amber pavilion in autumn" anchors location in beat one and is named again in beats six and twelve. The amber light is described as "liquid memory" in beat nine, charging the atmosphere. The pavilion provides spatial continuity but does not supply a resource or constraint: no trellis configuration, wind, or light angle alters the sentinel's planting choice. Setting is postcard-descriptive rather than tactical. Score: early +0.7, three beats +0.9, closure mention +0.4, but postcard use (no causal pressure) −0.8, no resource or constraint −0.7. Start 3.0 + 2.0 − 1.5 = 3.5; lyric recurrence and coherent space lift to upper 4s.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the final bus departs" appears in beat one and is recalled in beat twelve ("when the final bus finally left"). The bus departure bookends the piece but imposes no clock pressure: the sentinel has unlimited time, and no choice is forced by nightfall or a deadline. The frame is decorative rather than causal. Score: early +0.6, closure reprise +0.5, but no tightening of decisions −1.2, vague tracking (no elapsed minutes or racing dawn) −0.8. Start 3.0 + 1.1 − 2.0 = 2.1.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>"To nurture intersubjective understanding" is stated in beat four and echoed in beats ten and seventeen. The motivation is told as abstract goal but not dramatized through conflicting wants: the sentinel never weighs this desire against, say, protecting the vines from rot or finishing harvest. No on-page friction tests the motive's cost. Score: early +0.5, three beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.6, but told-only (no embodied choice between competing goods) −0.9, no friction between want and cost −0.8. Start 3.0 + 2.0 − 1.7 = 3.3; thematic coherence lifts to upper 3s.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Passionate subtlety" is named in beats four, nine, and twelve. Tone is maintained through elevated lyric diction and restrained action (whispering, planting) across all beats; no sharp turn or register break disrupts coherence. However, the tone is static—no modulation under pressure because no external resistance appears. The final image ("amber night…finally felt whole") sustains the mood but does not charge it with new intensity. Score: early +0.5, coherent across all beats +1.2, closure tone match +0.8, but static (no pressure-driven cadence shift) −0.6, label-only mentions (named rather than enacted through rhythm) −0.4. Start 3.0 + 2.5 − 1.0 = 4.5; consistent execution and closure tie lift to low-mid 5s.</comment>
