<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation ("to prove that listening heals") is declared but never tested against a competing want or fear; she moves through the story without internal contradiction or difficult trade-offs. The locket's revelation and the boy's final request unfold without visible cost to her—no path is foreclosed, no price paid. Interiority relies on abstract phrasing ("the narrative pulse of the neighborhood") rather than embodied sensation. Supporting characters (storyteller, child) apply no pressure that forces Mara to choose between competing goods.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The piece lacks a legible closure unit with visible cost: Mara opens the mailbox, reads letters, arranges an exhibit, and guides a boy—each beat succeeds without resistance or trade-off. The ending image (locket opening to "a sound only the heart can hear") offers lyric resonance but no decisive change, renunciation, or conceptual repricing that reweights prior material with felt consequence. Orientation is delayed: who Mara is and what she wants emerge only after the locket and storyteller appear (~200 words in). The drive lens appears Accumulative/Textural but never tightens or deepens—stakes remain static across all beats.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The courtyard anchors multiple beats (dawn, stone bench, lanterns at night) and sensory detail is vivid ("wet stone and incense," "walls amber"). However, the setting remains postcard-decorative—no spatial constraint or resource alters Mara's choices; she places objects, reads, and guides visitors without friction from the environment. The mailbox is described but its physical state (locked/unlocked, location shift) is unclear across beats.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—solving the locked mailbox mystery or proving listening heals—is declared but never tested by opposition or scarcity. Each action (lifting locket, hearing whisper, opening mailbox, reading letters, creating exhibit) succeeds immediately; no reversal, tightening, or deepening occurs. The boy's request in the final beat offers potential pressure but resolves in two lines without complication. Agency is passive observation rather than decision under constraint.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Theme ("listening heals") is stated outright multiple times ("to prove that listening heals," "listening truly healed") rather than emerging through specific choice and cost. The locket, letters, and storytelling motifs recur but without shifting meaning—they illustrate the thesis rather than test it. The ending offers lyric resonance ("a sound only the heart can hear") but no non-literal answer to a dramatized question. Subtext is absent; all meaning is surface-declared.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Mara with consistent past tense. Diction, however, drifts into elevated register ("narrative pulse," "healing ripple," "invisible threads that bound the community") that feels authorial rather than character-specific. Perceptual signature is generic—Mara notices in catalog mode (coats, mugs, blossoms) without bias or selective attention tied to her thrift-curator lens. No dialogue appears to test voice distinction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and template cadence pervade: "sandstorm calm" recurs five times without reweighting; "locked mailbox mystery," "aged locket," "neighborhood storytelling" repeat as labels rather than evolving images. Synonym churn appears in adjacent lines: "whisper grew louder, forming a melody" / "each note she heard whispered a name." Mixed metaphor: "the locket led through following hidden paths" conflates direction and pursuit illogically. Filter-verb stacks ("seemed to pulse," "seemed to echo") dull immediacy in key beats. The phrase "leads through following" appears twice as scaffolding without clear sense.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Core premise (mystery locket unlocks community healing) follows a familiar found-object-reveals-community template without transformation. "Sandstorm calm," "locked mailbox mystery," and "leads through following" feel prompt-inserted rather than organically motivated. The emotional arc (discovery → exhibit → gratitude) is linear and predictable with no turn or complication. No specific detail (thrift-store mechanics, courtyard geography, locket construction) grounds the fantastical elements in lived texture.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Mara curates, arranges, lifts, listens, catalogues, and guides—all on-page actions—but none involves a decision that narrows options or alters tactics. She is present across all beats but her choices are uncontested; removing "discerning" or "curator" would not change the plot.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The locket appears in four beats (mailbox discovery, courtyard placement, letter exhibit, boy's hands) and is described with tactile detail ("cool memory," "warm glow"). However, its function is static revelation rather than evolving constraint—it whispers, glows, and opens without requiring Mara to solve, sacrifice, or choose. It shapes the middle and ending but does not narrow options with cost.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The "locked mailbox mystery" is named three times and structures the initial discovery, but the mailbox opens without resistance or puzzle-solving—Mara "lifted the latch" and letters slip out. The concept frames expectation but does not constrain tactics or force a trade-off; it resolves through passive reception rather than active pursuit.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>1.9</grade><comment>"Leads through following" is stated twice as a phrase but never dramatized as a specific action with cost. The storyteller claims "the locket led through following hidden paths" and later "the locket had led through following the invisible threads," but no scene shows Mara choosing to follow rather than force, or paying a price for that method.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Hear" drives the central mechanic: Mara hears the whisper, hears a melody, hears names, hears through each paragraph, and the boy hears "a soft echo." It appears in at least four distinct beats and enables the mystery's resolution. However, it does not involve a difficult choice—hearing is passive reception rather than a contested action with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"Neighborhood storytelling" is named twice (storyteller's claim, final summary) but the method is not shown on the page—no scene depicts Mara gathering or testing stories. It labels the solution rather than shaping attempts or constraining tactics. Present in setup and closure mention, absent in development.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The courtyard appears in three beats (dawn arrival, bench placement, lantern-lit night) with vivid sensory detail (blossoms, wet stone, amber walls). It provides a stage but does not constrain or enable—Mara's choices would work identically indoors. It is signaled early and reprised at closure but remains decorative rather than pressuring.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"When the outside world intrudes" is named once midway ("commuters flood the streets") as a contrasting pressure, but no beat shows Mara's choices tightening under a time constraint or external deadline. The timeframe is mentioned but not tracked or used to alter tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"To prove that listening heals" is stated outright once and echoed in the closure summary ("listening truly healed"). It labels Mara's goal but is never dramatized as conflicted desire—no scene shows her wanting recognition versus humility, or fearing failure. The motivation is present in setup and closure theme but absent in middle friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Sandstorm calm" recurs five times across the arc (opening, Mara's interior, courtyard sunrise, visitor effect, night close) as a tonal refrain. It modulates slightly (external weather → internal steadiness → communal effect) and charges the final image ("sandstorm calm heart"), achieving a lyric reprise. However, it does not constrain a choice or shift under pressure—it is descriptive mood rather than active force.</comment>
