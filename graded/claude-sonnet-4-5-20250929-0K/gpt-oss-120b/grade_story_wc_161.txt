<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Lila's motivation is declared—"to preserve the echo of lost songs"—but never embodied through contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. The meteorite chip and pigeons function as symbolic props rather than tools that force trade-offs or reveal character limits. Interiority relies on abstract poetic constructions ("the attic seemed to bloom with a withering grace") rather than concrete, character-particular perception. The ending asserts transformation ("learned to trust again") without dramatizing the cost of that shift on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The piece presents a continuous accumulative sequence in the attic, but the closure—Lila standing beneath the skylight after "the final flight"—lacks visible cost; the map "glows faintly" as testament, but no choice or renunciation forecloses a path on the page. The lens reads Accumulative/Textural, yet the ending offers assertion ("balance and memory can coexist") rather than a charged image that reweights prior material. Causality is weak: the pigeons' flights and meteorite slivers produce a "soft, otherworldly chorus" without resistance or tactical cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The attic skylight and dust motes anchor the setting early and recur, but spatial choreography remains generic—yellowed maps, old paper, cracked glass—without tactile constraint. The meteorite chip's "faint glow" and the pigeons' leg attachments are described but do not alter Lila's options or tactics in any beat. The setting provides atmosphere but does not pressure choice or charge the final image with a micro-setting detail.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving lost songs—is signaled but never tested by a reversal or tightening that narrows options. Lila's actions (mapping dust, attaching meteorite slivers, releasing pigeons) proceed without opposition, failure, or visible price. The ending declares success ("the map she had drawn glows faintly") with no on-page cost or foreclosed path. Pressure is atmospheric rather than escalating, and coincidence (the meteorite chip's hum, the pigeons' mirrored flight) enables rather than complicates.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Theme—renewal layered over loss—emerges through recurring images (dust, pigeons, meteorite glow) and one apt particular: "moss blooming over stone." However, the final paragraph moralizes directly: "reinvention does not erase, but layers the old with the new" and "balance and memory can coexist." The ending asserts thematic resonance rather than earning it through a non-literal image that reweights prior stakes.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable, but diction fluctuates between concrete observation ("thin column of light") and elevated abstraction ("a withering grace," "histories both personal and planetary"). Lila's perceptual signature is generic poetic rather than character-specific; no vocabulary, syntax, or rhythm marks her as a courier pigeon trainer. Register drift into literary generality ("luminous whirl," "labyrinthine network") dilutes voice under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops proliferate: "Each tiny vortex became a paper trail" / "Each turn reminded Lila of a song" / "Each sunrise saw her adding new curves." Template cadence appears in "She believed… She knew… She realized… She felt…" stems. Figurative language clusters without pattern-teaching: "bloom," "wither," "echo," "pulse," "glow" recur decoratively. The closure image—"the map she had drawn glows faintly on the attic wall"—is told rather than shown, and the final sentence summarizes theme ("balance and memory can coexist") instead of letting action land.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The premise—trainer maps dust motes to unlock a meteorite's song via pigeons—combines disparate elements without earned causality; the mars chip's hum and the pigeons' flight patterns feel orchestrated rather than inevitable. The emotional arc (loss → trust) follows a template without fresh inflection. One specific image—"moss blooming over stone"—offers texture, but the piece relies on generic lyricism and thematic abstraction rather than lived detail or a non-obvious moral calculus.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Lila appears throughout but makes no on-page decision that alters tactics or forecloses a path; her actions (sifting maps, mapping dust, attaching meteorite slivers) proceed without opposition or cost. The role "courier pigeon trainer" is labeled but does not constrain or enable any beat. Present but swappable with any contemplative protagonist.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The mars meteorite chip appears early (tucked between poetry collections), humming faintly; Lila attaches slivers to the pigeons' legs, and its glow "deepens" and "fades into night" at closure. Three beats, but the chip's use is decorative—it enables the chorus without resisting or reshaping Lila's approach. The ending reprises it, yet the cost tied to it is absent.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Paper trails" recur: dust trails recorded on parchment, pigeon routes traced beside the meteorite's etchings, and the final glowing map. The concept is present across beats but does not constrain choice or force trade-offs; it functions as motif rather than tactical pressure. Closure participation is thematic rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Lila "seeking to reinvent her personal history" is stated in the opening and echoed at closure ("the paper trails rewriting her story"), but no on-page action demonstrates this attribute shaping a decision or incurring cost. The trait is summary-only, without visible tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Balance" recurs: balancing past and present, fragile trust and meteorite weight, mapping and guiding, give and take. It threads multiple beats and the ending declares "balance and memory can coexist." However, the action is thematic rather than a physical or tactical necessity; it could be replaced by "harmonize" or "reconcile" with minimal structural change.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Mapping dust motes under the skylight is introduced early, shapes the parchment charts Lila creates, and recurs when pigeon flight patterns mirror the dust spirals. The method is present in two beats but does not constrain or fail; it proceeds without friction. Mechanics are told rather than demonstrated with cost.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The vintage bookshop attic anchors the story spatially, provides the skylight and dust motes for the method, houses the meteorite chip between poetry collections, and frames the opening and closing images. Present across setup, middle, and closure, but the setting offers ambiance rather than tactical constraint—Lila's choices are unhindered by the space.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Across learning to trust again" frames the timeframe; "over weeks" marks duration, and "each sunrise… each sunset" implies passage. Trust is declared at closure ("she had learned to trust again"), but no on-page beat dramatizes a moment where distrust yields with cost. The timeframe is present but vague and does not tighten decisions.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"To preserve the echo of lost songs" is stated early, drives Lila's project (mapping trails, attaching meteorite slivers), and is reprised at closure when the notes carry "a fragment of the meteorite's song." Present across beats, but the motivation is told and proceeds without friction or conflicting want. No on-page cost tests the desire.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Blooming withering" appears as paired imagery throughout: "bloom with a withering grace," "bloom even as the old books gathered dust," "bloom and wither in a single breath." The tone modulates with the ending's quieter cadence and charges the final image of the glowing map. Present early and at closure, but the pairing risks decorative recurrence rather than functional pressure.</comment>
