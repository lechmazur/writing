<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lio's motivation to collect silence-flavors is concrete and his claustrophobic fear embodied early ("his chest were a rubber band nearing its limit"). The arc from fear to expansion reads clearly, and the doll's use shows micro-choices. However, interiority leans heavily on poetic assertion rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene; the final "understand that a cramped space could hold the vastness of a sky" edges toward therapeutic summary rather than earned embodiment at the closure beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors arrive late (~150 words before "bunker builder…thin‑skinned boy named Lio" clarifies who/where), warranting −0.4 per the test. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: silence-filaments sprout, intensify by flavor-type, then dissolve, leaving resonance in the doll. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the doll pulses with collected hush; corridors echo a new rhythm), but cost is implied rather than dramatized—no visible forfeiture or choice that forecloses a path on the page. The final paragraph asserts thematic shift without showing a concrete price paid.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The trellis and inverted-gravity setting are vivid and constrain the single-hour window, shaping Lio's climb and doll-placement. Sensory details ("clouds brushed his cheeks like cool silk," "vines humming") are selective and POV-filtered. The recurring porcelain doll charges the final image (warm, pulsing). However, the underground bunker remains somewhat generic—dim corridors, stone, ventilation shafts—without occupational or spatial specificity that would pressure a choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (collect pure silence-flavors) is signaled early and tightens through the limiting-exposure tactic that prevents filament-tangling. The hour-inversion provides one meaningful pressure window. Yet escalation is thin: Lio places the doll, whispers, watches filaments grow, retrieves it—no reversal or choice under conflicting pressure. The cost (limiting exposure) is explained rather than tested; no on-page moment where Lio must sacrifice an option or endure loss to preserve purity.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Theme (cramped space holding sky-vastness; fear dissolving through collected silences) emerges from imagery and Lio's arc. The final doll-on-table moment and mother's smile attempt resonance, but "understand that a cramped space could hold the vastness of a sky, provided one learned to stretch the contracted heart" reads as overt thesis-statement rather than scene-earned insight. The stretched-contracted motif recurs purposefully, yet the ending tells the reader what to feel instead of charging the image to do that work.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent (poetic, sensory, introspective) and diction stays within a lyric register. Filter verbs ("felt," "realized," "watched") appear frequently but remain voice-coherent. The prose modulates rhythmically with pressure—short beats during the climb, longer during the sprouting—though some lines ("intangibly tangible, a paradox that allowed feelings to be stored in clay") approach exposition mid-scene. No dialogue present; interior voice is distinct if occasionally self-explaining.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; opening long breath gives way to shorter clauses at the trellis. Information density is high (every line advances world, character, or atmosphere), and sensory specificity avoids stock metaphors. However, paraphrase loops appear: "The legend among the underground dwellers said…" is restated by "the elder whispered"; "intangibly tangible" is explained immediately rather than shown. Figurative density ("molten gold," "silver thread," "spider's silk," "gilded hush") clusters without always clarifying image relationships, nudging toward purple at peak beats. No major scaffold or typos, but the cumulative ornamental weight slows closure momentum slightly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of claustrophobic-child, inverted-gravity trellis, and silence-collection offers a non-obvious premise, and the "flavors of silence" conceit is specific. The porcelain-doll vessel and sprouting-filament mechanics feel fresh. Yet the emotional arc (fear → expansion via metaphorical harvest) echoes coming-of-age templates without a sharp counter-pressure or moral ambiguity. The ending's tidy closure—bunker corridors now hum with the trellis's lullaby, Lio ready for next inversion—resolves all tension symmetrically, reducing risk and surprise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Lio frames the story, climbs the shaft (one beat), places and retrieves the doll (two beats), and returns underground (closure beat). His choice to limit exposure is signaled but not tested by conflicting pressures. Present across all three gates (setup, middle, payoff) and drives two distinct beats, eligible for mid-band. However, his agency is observational—he watches filaments sprout rather than making a high-cost decision that narrows options. Cost is asserted (fear dissolves) rather than forfeited on the page. Early signal +0.4, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.7, minus ornamental interiority −0.5, minus summary-only transformation −0.4 = ~5.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The porcelain doll appears in setup (mother gives it, explains its paradox), middle (Lio places it on the platform, it trembles and sprouts filaments), and closure (retrieves it warm and pulsing, places it on the bunker table). Three distinct beats, early signal, and closure linkage. Removing it would collapse the silence-capture mechanism. However, the doll's "intangibly tangible" property is told rather than shown through on-page constraint or visible cost tied to its use. Early signal +0.5, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.0, specificity +0.4, minus told-only paradox −0.6, minus no visible cost −0.7 = ~6.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Gilded hush" is named in the legend, echoed at the filament-sprouting ("silver thread"), and reappears at closure ("porcelain pulse with the gilded hush of the heavens, a hush that was both a sound and a taste"). Present in all three gates but functions primarily as atmospheric label rather than constraint that alters tactics. The concept shapes stakes thematically—Lio seeks pure silence—but never tests him with a choice between gilded and ungilded options. Early signal +0.3, closure presence +0.7, minus ornamental/thematic-only use −1.0, minus swappability (could be "sacred quiet" with minor edits) −0.5 = ~4.1.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Intangibly tangible" is introduced as the doll's paradoxical property ("feelings stored in clay without breaking the surface") and visualized when the silver filament unfurls. Present in setup and middle but absent from closure beat—the doll is "warm to the touch" and "pulse[s]," physical traits that do not invoke the intangible/tangible tension. The attribute enables the silence-storage mechanism but never constrains a choice or imposes visible cost. Early signal +0.3, one beat +0.4, minus closure absence −0.8, minus label-only explanation −0.5, minus no cost tied to the paradox −0.6 = ~3.8 (cap at 3.8 for swappability).</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Sprout" appears as both verb (trellis "rose," filaments "sprout delicate branches," doll could "sprout a faint echo") and noun-metaphor, anchoring the middle beat where filaments sing silence-flavors and the final image where "the smallest doll could sprout a universe of silence." Present in setup (the elder's instruction), middle (filament-sprouting dramatized), and closure (asserted in final paragraph). Drives two beats and shapes the central mechanism—without sprouting, no silence-collection. However, the action is passive observation rather than Lio's effortful choice. Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, causal pressure +0.8, minus passivity (Lio watches rather than acts to make it sprout) −0.6 = ~7.1.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Limiting exposure" is explained mid-story ("keeping each silence to a single breath of inverted gravity—prevented the filaments from tangling") and cited at closure ("one learned to stretch the contracted heart"). The method shapes the central tactic (one breath per silence preserves purity) and is present in middle and closure. However, it is told rather than tested—Lio does not face a moment where he must choose to stop or continue exposure at visible cost. Setup absent (introduced after midpoint), middle presence +0.4, closure mention +0.5, causal pressure +0.5, minus late intro (second third) −0.3, minus told-only −0.5, minus no on-page cost −0.4 = ~5.7.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The xenial trellis is introduced early ("slender xenial trellis rose above the clouds, its vines cradling platforms"), provides the spatial constraint for the middle beat (Lio climbs, places doll on platform, filaments grow), and echoes at closure ("corridors echoed…the trellis's lullaby"). Present in all three gates and essential to the inversion-hour window. Removing it would eliminate the middle beat's location. However, "xenial" (hospitable) is ornamental—generic "sky-platform" would function identically. Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure reprise +0.7, spatial constraint +0.6, minus ornamental adjective −0.5, minus postcard vividness without tactical pressure −0.6 = ~6.4.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The one-hour inversion window is signaled in the legend, triggers the climb and doll-placement, and ends with gravity snapping back (filaments dissolve). Present in all three gates and tightens the single beat—Lio must act within the hour. The timeframe directly enables the sprouting (reversed gravity allows the effect) and closes the window (dissolution at hour's end). Removing it would break the story's logic. Early signal +0.6, causal pressure (one-hour ticking constraint) +1.0, closure linkage (hour ends, filaments dissolve) +0.9, specificity (one hour, not vague "a while") +0.4, minus no on-page clock tracking or tactical adjustment mid-beat −0.5 = ~6.9.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Lio's desire to collect silence-flavors is stated early ("wanted to collect the flavors of different silences") and dramatized when he whispers the first silence and watches filaments embody each flavor. Present in all three gates: setup (stated), middle (enacted via doll-placement and filament observation), closure (asserted as ongoing project). Shapes the dominant stake and drives two beats. However, the motivation is never conflicted—no moment where Lio weighs the cost of collecting versus another want. Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.7, causal pressure +0.6, minus no friction or trade-off −0.7, minus told desire without embodied struggle −0.5 = ~6.3.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Stretching contracted" as tone/motif appears in the chest-expansion image ("his heart lift…stretching contracted as if his chest were a rubber band"), the thematic assertion ("stretch the contracted heart"), and the final humming rhythm. Present in setup (chest metaphor), middle (fear dissolving as he inhales silence-aromas), and closure (corridors no longer cramped). Modulates from claustrophobic compression to expansive breath. However, the tone is asserted more than enacted—syntax does not mirror the shift (remains consistently lyric-long throughout), and the final paragraph tells the reader the change rather than charging the image. Early signal +0.5, closure linkage +0.8, coherence across turns +0.4, minus static syntactic rhythm −0.5, minus overt thematic statement at closure −0.6 = ~5.8.</comment>
