<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Amelia remains one-note throughout: "broken-hearted archivist" whose motivation ("magnify small kindnesses") is asserted rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. The button discovery shifts nothing in her stance—she continues her archival work with the same gentle optimism, never facing a cost or trade-off. Interiority relies heavily on therapy-speak ("quiet solidarity," "empathy," "heart still broken but steadier") and label-only emotions. No internal conflict acts simultaneously in scene; her arc is a smooth upward drift without foreclosed options.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The story lacks a legible closure unit with cost. Amelia presents the button to the supervisor, he agrees to display it, and she feels hope—no path is foreclosed, no felt price paid, no option reconfigured. The final morning repeats the opening pattern (dust rises, stories emerge) without tightening or deepening. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, but the ending merely restates the premise rather than reweighting it with undeniable pressure. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly, preventing a larger penalty.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The file room is described vividly ("dim chamber," "high windows," dust patterns) and the button appears in multiple beats, but neither constrains a choice or charges the final image in a way that narrows options. The room functions as backdrop for discovery rather than a spatial pressure that shapes tactics. Micro-setting standard is met (the button as recurring object), but it remains ornamental—Amelia's path would be identical with any small object in any archive.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—honoring forgotten voices—is signaled early but never tested. No tightening occurs: the supervisor agrees without friction, and the next file arrives with the same pattern. Amelia's agency consists of hoping and presenting; she faces no trade-off, no resource limit, no cost that alters tactics. The story moves through accumulation (button → dust → silhouettes → report → display) without a reversal, deepening, or moment where a live option is foreclosed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The theme (forgotten histories deserve care) is stated directly rather than emergent: "her work of magnifying small kindnesses could turn a single button into a beacon for the unknown." The final image (dust rising again) does not reweigh prior material; it confirms the premise without complication. No moral ambiguity or counter-reading is offered—the button simply enables endless kindnesses. The "Thematic Echo" penalty applies: the final lines articulate the thesis in prompt-like language without scene pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, and perceptual filtering is present ("faint pulse of empathy," "soft glow"). However, diction drifts into elevated abstraction under pressure ("choreography," "Acts of Compassion" as a filing label, "beacon for the unknown") that exceeds the archivist's established voice. Sentence stems recur ("She traced," "She placed," "She reached," "She felt") creating template cadence across emotional beats. No dialogue is present to judge.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Pervasive paraphrase loops and synonym churn flatten momentum: "histories that refuse to die" / "histories that never found a hearing"; "dust rose" / "dust settled back into patterns"; "button's weight" recurs four times without added meaning. Template cadence dominates high-pressure beats ("She lifted it… She set… She traced… She wrote… She placed"). Figurative language clusters without coherence ("veil of dust rose, unfurling like a silent flag"; "filament of dust a reminder"). Stock metaphors ("beacon," "bridge," "pulse of hope") replace concrete action. Apply Text-Artifact penalty: −1.4 in Q7 for loops, stems, and metaphor strings touching the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The premise (forgotten foster-care records, magical button) is familiar and not transformed through specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The button's mechanics (dust + light = projected stories) are asserted without cost or constraint—Amelia never struggles to interpret, never misreads, never faces incomplete or contradictory records. The emotional arc (broken-hearted → steadier) follows a predictable template without risk or surprise. Apply Derivative Premise Guardrail: −0.8 for template-driven plot without transformation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Amelia is present throughout but her decisions do not create key turns. She observes the button, traces dust patterns, writes a report, and presents findings—all discovery and documentation without cost or trade-off. The supervisor's agreement is immediate; no tactic changes. She is a vehicle for the button's effect rather than an agent whose choices alter options.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The button appears in four beats (discovery, silhouette projection, lobby proposal, new file) and recurs with evolving function (tarnished relic → light caster → display piece → tool for next file). It shapes two key beats (discovery and projection) and is present in the ending, meeting the three-gate test. However, it could be swapped for any small reflective object (coin, locket) without altering the logic. Late-scene use adds weight, but swappability caps the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Unknown histories" frames the premise and recurs in reflection ("archive of unknown histories," "examined unknown"), but it does not change options on the page—Amelia always intended to honor these records. The concept is echoed thematically rather than forcing a tactical choice or cost. It is present in the ending ("unknown stories would always find a voice") but as thematic summary, not causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Tactfully hopeful" is labeled once ("tactfully hopeful, believing that even the most muted records could bloom") and summarized at the end ("steadier, knowing"), but the trait does not constrain or enable an on-page action with visible cost. Amelia's hopefulness is static; no moment shows it tested against despair or forcing a choice between kindness and efficiency. Label-only use; no development or payoff.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Unfurl" recurs across multiple beats (dust unfurls, silhouettes unfurl, the button's promise to "unfurl another tale," the ending "eager to unfurl") and the action shapes the discovery and projection scenes. However, it is metaphorical—the button projects silhouettes, the dust rises, no literal unfurling occurs. The action is present in the ending and shapes two beats, meeting the gate test, but its mechanics are vague and easily replaceable with "reveal" or "illuminate."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Dust patterns are present throughout (opening description, silhouette projection, final morning) and the method is signaled early ("through accumulated dust patterns the faint outlines… emerged"). The method enables the projection beat and returns in the ending. However, the mechanics are unexplained—how does dust create legible text?—and Amelia never adjusts her approach based on dust behavior. Functional but swappable with any discovery method.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The file room is anchored early, provides the button and records, and recurs in the ending. It shapes the discovery beat (oak desk, high windows enable projection) and the final morning (dust eager to rise). The setting supplies resources but does not constrain—Amelia faces no filing deadline, no supervisor pressure until she chooses to present. Meets the three-gate test but does not alter tactics under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>1.4</grade><comment>"After the emancipation" is mentioned once in the second sentence and never referenced again. Which emancipation (1863? another?) is unclear; no time pressure or historical detail affects choices. The timeframe is ornamental, neither signaled in the ending nor shaping tactics. Missing development and closure gates; intro-only mention.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"To magnify small kindnesses" is stated as Amelia's motivation ("Her motivation to magnify small kindnesses had begun…") and recurs at the end ("her work of magnifying small kindnesses"). The desire drives her report and presentation, meeting setup and payoff gates. However, it is told rather than dramatized through friction—no moment shows her choosing kindness over efficiency, accuracy, or self-protection. No cost or conflicting want; the motivation is smooth and uncontested.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Examined unknown" as tone is present in the opening ("dim chamber," "forgotten paperwork") and ending ("quiet testament to histories that refuse to die"), establishing a contemplative, elegiac mood. The tone remains static—no modulation with pressure, no shift when the supervisor agrees or the new file arrives. The final image maintains the same reverent tone without charging or reweighting prior material. Coherent but unchanging; missing the pressure-driven cadence shift for higher bands.</comment>
