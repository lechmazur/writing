<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Lira remains a conceptual figure throughout, defined by poetic labels ("tide dancer," "elective exile") rather than embodied choices under pressure. Her "ambition" is declared but never contested on the page—no competing desire, no moment of doubt that would reveal internal contradiction. The final "smile" and cosmic integration read as unearned epiphany, a label-only emotional state without the visceral cost or visible struggle required to justify transformation at this scale.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation test: who/where/when anchor by ~120 words, but the piece withholds any conflict or complication; Lira's quest proceeds without obstacle, reversal, or meaningful narrowing of options. The "closure" is a declarative success—ink applied, verse complete, light spreads—with no felt cost, no path foreclosed, no before/after legible in her choices. Under any lens (Causal, Accumulative, Situational), the piece lacks a closure unit: no Decisive Change (she was already a tide dancer performing her art), no Resonant Reconfiguration (no refusal or endurance that costs her something), no Conceptual Repricing (the verse's "success" is asserted, not dramatized as reweighting prior stakes). The ending summarizes aftermath ("word spread," "inviting them to choose") rather than landing cost on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The twilight garden supplies vivid sensory anchors—moonlight "like spilled ink," salt-scented shadows, the deepest pool—and the moonstone speck is handled twice (palm, then forearm). However, setting remains scenic rather than constraining: the garden does not limit Lira's options or shape her tactics; any tranquil, moonlit space would serve. Spatial choreography is clean (pool → palm → forearm), but the environment functions as backdrop rather than pressure or resource.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"to pen a cosmic verse on mortal skin"—is signaled early but never opposed or tested. No reversal, tightening, or complication narrows Lira's path; she finds the speck, learns the method, executes the verse, and succeeds without visible cost or trade-off. The prose declares escalation ("deepening," "final stroke") but plot pressure remains flat: luck and competence align with no friction. Agency at closure is absent; the ink "pulsed like a heartbeat" and "word spread" are outcomes, not choices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The piece gestures toward themes of exile-as-bridge and mortal-versus-celestial art, and the moonstone dust returns in the final image ("settled on the petals"). However, thematic resonance is stated rather than earned: "exile within her dissolve[d]," "universe expand[ed] within her," "gaps...filled with possibilities" are abstract claims unsupported by on-page friction or discovery. The ending summarizes a moral ("inviting them to choose their own gaps") instead of dramatizing a non-literal answer to the central question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The prose maintains a consistent lyric distance and distinct perceptual signature ("moonlight fell like spilled ink," "obsidian grace"), but diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("universal speech," "cosmic stanza") that feels imposed rather than character-particular. No dialogue appears. Filter verbs are minimal, and POV remains stable in third-limited. The voice is legible and coherent, though it does not modulate under pressure—Lira's register at the climax matches her opening calm, flattening urgency.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and figurative language is vivid ("obsidian grace," "tide rose in rhythm with her arms"), but the piece carries synonym loops and paraphrase redundancy: "exile" appears nine times across adjacent paragraphs, often restating the same concept without added pressure ("elective exile," "voluntarily imposed distance," "exile within her dissolve"). Template cadence runs ("She would fledge... She claimed... She found... She traced...") dominate the middle, and the final third summarizes rather than dramatizes. Figurative density is high but occasionally mixed ("spilled ink" moonlight, "obsidian grace" applied to both speck and tapestry). Apply −0.8 in Q7 for loops and template stems; no closure-scene artifact, so non-closure cap applies.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The tide-dancer premise and moonstone-ink ritual offer a fresh surface, but the emotional and plot arc are generic: artist seeks rare material, finds it, completes masterwork, achieves transcendence without obstacle. The "gaps between the tide's rhythm and the garden's sighs" method is poetic but unexplored—Lira "slips through" once, off-page, with no friction or cost. Transformation test fails: swap "tide dancer" for "shadow mage" or "star-weaver," and the structure holds unchanged. No bold risk; the piece retreats into scenic summary rather than pressing its premise toward conflict.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Lira is on the page throughout, but her "skill" is asserted rather than tested. She moves, observes, inhales, traces—actions that describe her art but do not create turns or force choices. No moment where her skill fails, costs her something, or compels a difficult trade-off. Present and functional, but swappable with any competent mystic.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The moonstone speck is found in the pool (beat one), held on her palm (beat two), then melted into ink on her forearm (beat three), and its dust returns in the final image on the night-bloom petals. It shapes two key turns (discovery, application) and charges the ending. However, its "fragment of the night" property is label-only; any rare, luminous dust would serve the same function. Solid integration, not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Elective exile" is declared early and revisited frequently ("chosen pilgrimage," "exile within her dissolve"), but it functions as theme rather than constraint. The piece never dramatizes what Lira gave up by choosing solitude or how isolation narrows her options. It reweights slightly in the final third ("less like banishment"), but the conceptual shift is asserted, not earned by on-page cost. Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Spontaneously anchored" appears once as a label justifying her solitude and patience, but it does not constrain or enable any visible action. No scene where impulsiveness threatens her work or where the anchor costs her flexibility. Ornamental trait mention.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Fledge" is introduced early as her method—"to fledge her own limits" by slipping through gaps—and reappears at the end ("gaps...waiting to be fletched"). It frames her approach, but the action itself is told in summary ("she slipped through, feeling the space fold") rather than dramatized in a beat that alters tactics or stakes. Present in setup and payoff, minimal middle development. Cap 4.6 for missing middle gate.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"By observing gaps between the tide's rhythm and the garden's sighs" is her stated method, signaled early. One line dramatizes it: "When a silence lingered longer than a wave's crest, she slipped through." However, the mechanics do not shape multiple attempts or tactics; it succeeds once, off-page, with no complication. Swappable with "by attuning to moonlight" or similar. Functional, not essential.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The twilight garden under stars anchors every beat, supplies the pool where the speck is found, and its blossoms witness the final verse. Setting is vivid and present throughout (three gates met), but it does not constrain Lira's choices—no resource scarcity, no environmental obstacle. The garden enables but does not pressure. One causal link (pool → speck) lifts it above ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"After the nostalgia ban lifted" appears in the second paragraph as historical context but does not tighten decisions or alter tactics. No on-page clock, no sense that time pressure shapes Lira's moves. The "timeframe" is setting flavor, not a live constraint. Ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Lira's desire "to pen a cosmic verse on mortal skin" is declared early, drives the search for the speck, and anchors the climax when she traces the ink. However, the motivation is never conflicted—no competing want, no cost that makes her hesitate. Functional across setup, middle, and payoff, but dramatized as uncontested goal rather than fraught choice. Lyric reprise in final image (dust on petals echoing the verse) adds small charge.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Obsidian grace" is named four times, describing the speck's surface, the ink's spread, and the final tapestry. Tone is consistent—solemn, luminous, unhurried—but it does not modulate under pressure (no scene where urgency or fear sharpens the voice). The phrase charges the final image slightly, but the static mood keeps it mid-functional. Present in setup and payoff; minimal tonal development in middle.</comment>
