<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The alchemist remains largely opaque: her interior is painted in abstract terms ("factually mystical approach," "invisible mass") without embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. The piece tells us she seeks to understand the weight of names but never dramatizes competing impulses or a hierarchy of values through action. The final restoration feels ordained rather than earned by prior struggle; we see technical success but no visible cost that forecloses a path. Emotional progression is asserted ("luminous regret," "quiet gratitude") rather than shown through degraded perception or irrational layering.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural; orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first paragraph. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the coin's seam sealed, balance restored), but the cost remains atmospheric rather than legible on the page—no tactical choice is foreclosed, no visible price paid. The kintsugi repair completes without complication, and the protagonist walks away with "quiet gratitude," a soft emotional reset that undercuts the promised weight. The because/therefore chain is weak: the gold flows because she whispers the dragon's name, but causality is mystical assertion rather than dramatized constraint.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The rain-washed foundry supplies vivid sensory detail (hot iron, old soot, amber light) filtered through the alchemist's professional gaze. The anvil and coin anchor spatial choreography; the storm modulates from hammering to whisper in step with her work. The setting constrains the repair (idle furnaces, precise temperature noted) and the coin on the anvil charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate for micro-setting involvement. However, some description ("memories refusing to die") leans ornamental, and the foundry's role in shaping choice is more atmospheric than tactical.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding the weight of names via kintsugi repair—is signaled early but never truly tested. The gold flows obediently when she whispers the dragon's name; no reversal or tightening forces a trade-off. The narrative claims redemption is "a continuous negotiation with the limits she set upon herself," yet the on-page action is smooth success. The search party's disbandment is mentioned as context but does not apply pressure; coincidence does not complicate, and agency is minimal. One meaningful escalation is absent under the Accumulative lens, and no visible cost narrows options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the kintsugi metaphor and the weight-of-names motif, avoiding overt statement until the final paragraphs. The gold seam resonates as both repair and self-knowledge, and the coin's "balance restored" offers a non-literal answer. However, the ending edges toward thematic echo: "the names that shaped her world" articulates the thesis rather than letting the image speak. Subtext operates in gesture (the coin trembling, gold snaking), but the piece risks tidy resolution—"quiet gratitude" softens regret without friction or counter-reading.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited; no head-hopping. The perceptual signature is consistent (metallic scent, amber light, precise temperature) but lacks distinct idiosyncrasy—diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("factually mystical," "invisible mass") that feels authorial rather than character-bound. Psychic distance is controlled, and free indirect style is clean. The protagonist's way of noticing (professional, measured) is signaled but not deeply individuated; under peak stress, the voice maintains its formal cadence without compression or rhythmic modulation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Prose is largely clean with varied sentence openings and purposeful paragraph breaks. However, several lines loop conceptually: the weight of names is introduced, then re-stated ("invisible mass," "measured heft"), and the redemption claim appears twice in nearly identical phrasing. Filter verbs ("feeling," "aware," "understood") stack in the final third, dulling immediacy during the closure beat. Figurative density is high ("mirror of storm-slick ripples," "sunrise caught in a river of steel") but some vehicles strain coherence (a sunrise "caught" in steel is spatially unclear). Deduction: −0.6 for loops and filter stacks in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The kintsugi-as-character-repair frame is familiar from contemporary literary templates; the story does not transform it through non-obvious tactics or moral calculus. The alchemist's method (whisper a name, gold flows) rests on mystical assertion rather than specific world logic or earned constraint. The search party and foundry setting supply atmospheric detail but remain ornamental—swapping the foundry for another workshop would not alter the arc. One fresh inflection: the crack widening in response to naming, but this moment is not exploited for tension or cost. Derivative Premise deduction: −0.8 in Q8.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The alchemist is present throughout, but her choices are minimal: she sets the coin on the anvil, whispers a name, watches gold flow, then lifts the coin. No on-page decision alters tactics or narrows options; the repair proceeds smoothly. She is described as "balanced" and seeks understanding, but no dramatized conflict tests these traits. Two gates met (setup, closure presence); missing middle development where a choice constrains later action. Swappable with a generic craftsperson; no irreplaceable specificity. Cap at 4.6 for missing middle choice; score 4.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The zodiac coin appears in all three acts: carried in the satchel (setup), placed on the anvil with crack noted (development), and lifted with balance restored (payoff). It drives two distinct beats (placement, sealing) and the final image hinges on its transformation. However, the coin's specific properties (dragon/phoenix etch) are decorative; a generic cracked medallion would function identically. Closure linkage present but cost is not tied to the coin's unique nature. Score 6.8: essential structure, moderate irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Kintsugi intentions are named early and frame the repair: filling the crack with gold to reveal weight. The concept shapes the dominant stake and the repair method on the page. However, it does not constrain a choice or impose visible cost—the gold flows smoothly, and no tactical friction arises from the kintsugi approach itself. The concept is more thematic label than narrative engine. Two gates (setup, closure echo); missing middle constraint. Score 5.1: purposeful but not causally pressuring.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Factually mystical" is label-only: the text asserts this trait but never dramatizes the tension between fact and mysticism in a way that constrains or enables action. The alchemist measures temperature (factual) and whispers names (mystical), but these operate in parallel without visible trade-off. The attribute could be removed or replaced with "meticulous" with negligible change. Present in setup, absent from development and cost. Cap at 3.8 for swappability; score 3.8.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Redeem" appears twice: "to redeem the coin's hidden promise" and "a redemption of both the coin's broken story and her own." The action frames the alchemist's goal and the kintsugi repair serves as its vehicle. However, redemption is asserted rather than dramatized through sacrifice or foreclosed path—what does she give up to redeem? The search party disbandment is mentioned as regret transformed, but this happens off-page. Two gates (setup, closure); missing on-page cost. Score 5.9: shapes stake but lacks causal teeth.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Exploring limits" is signaled ("push the delicate balance of her craft beyond what any textbook declared possible") but the method is not concretely demonstrated. She notes temperature, whispers a name, and gold flows—no iterative attempt, failure, or boundary crossed on the page. The phrase "continuous negotiation with the limits she set upon herself" is reflective summary, not dramatized mechanics. Setup present, closure echo weak, middle development absent. Cap at 4.6 for missing middle; score 4.7 for setup presence.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The rain-washed foundry anchors all action: idle furnaces supply ambient heat, the anvil serves as workspace, rain modulates from hammer to whisper in parallel with her task. The setting constrains her approach (precise temperature noted) and charges the final image (doors thud shut, rain washes shoulders). Three gates met; the foundry's physical properties enable and frame the repair. Minor swappability: another workshop could serve, but the foundry's scale and metallic resonance enrich tone. Score 7.3: essential across beats, moderate irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the search party disbands" is mentioned in the opening and once more ("luminous regret... after the search party disbanded"), but it does not tighten decisions or create urgency. The disbandment functions as backstory context, not a live clock. The repair proceeds without time pressure; no tactical choice hinges on this temporal marker. Setup present, development and closure absent. Score 2.4: ornamental context without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The motivation "to understand the weight of names" is stated early ("haunted her since childhood") and recurs in the final act ("every syllable bore a measured heft"). It frames her goal and the kintsugi repair is the vehicle. However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choice—what does she risk or sacrifice to gain this understanding? The weight remains metaphorical assertion. Two gates (setup, closure); missing on-page friction between want and cost. Score 5.6: shapes one key turn, but lacks embodied tension.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Luminous regret" is introduced early ("settled in her heart after the search party disbanded") and modulates to "quiet gratitude" by the end. Tone is coherent through the rain's shift from hammer to whisper, and the gold seam's glow echoes the emotional arc. However, the tonal shift is smooth rather than pressured—regret softens without friction or cost. The tone charges the final image but does not meaningfully constrain choice. Three gates met; moderate closure linkage. Score 6.4: coherent modulation, lacking sharp teeth.</comment>
