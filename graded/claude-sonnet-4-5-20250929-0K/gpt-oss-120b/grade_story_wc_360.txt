<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Mara remains a cipher throughout—her "borrowed personalities" are asserted but never dramatized through contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. The interiority consists entirely of abstract philosophical claims ("she believed the mathematics of emotion") without embodied emotion or a single concrete decision that reveals hierarchy of values. No internal conflict appears; she moves through the night in unbroken certainty. The final collection of shards reads as an action without cost or renunciation that would foreclose a path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The piece opens with spatial anchors (topaz workshop, stars) but "who" remains vague past the 120-word mark—Mara's goal and situation emerge only through abstract claims rather than scene pressure, triggering a minor orientation penalty. The dominant stake (understanding emotion's mathematics) is declared but never tested on the page by a decision or reversal. The halo fragment's crack at the end gestures toward closure, but no visible cost or foreclosed option appears; Mara simply collects shards and promises to continue tomorrow, which reads as stasis without the price required for Earned Stasis. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, yet no cadence shift or pattern break reweights the stake with felt consequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The topaz workshop and halo fragment receive vivid sensory treatment (walls pulsing violet, light refracting through dust), and the brass cradle and ink are handled across beats. However, none of these constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome—they function as atmospheric backdrop. The body and tools (press, ink, copper plates) are described but do not shape Mara's tactics or the ending's charge, keeping the score in the functional-but-replaceable band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—mapping emotion into numerical patterns—is signaled early but never faces on-page pressure or a tightening that narrows options. No reversal occurs; the halo fragment simply "approves" and then cracks, releasing shards without agency from Mara. The final act (collecting shards, promising to press them tomorrow) lacks visible cost or trade-off. Escalation is asserted ("the room shivered," "the workshop seemed to breathe") rather than built through causal links that force a choice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The theme of transposed empathy and emotion-as-mathematics emerges through recurring images (borrowed personalities, ink as encoded feeling, numerical patterns). Yet the final paragraph veers into direct thesis statement: "emotion is not a static variable but a transposed function"—a thematic echo that replaces earned resonance. The halo fragment's crack offers a visual climax but does not reweight prior material with non-literal implication; instead, it confirms Mara's quest without ambiguity or cost. The piece avoids sentimentality but also avoids the specificity that would ground abstraction in lived particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and consistent ("cryptic," "lucid turbulence," "transposed function") but occasionally drifts into academic register ("theorem," "cipher," "numerical patterns") that feels more authorial than character-particular. Mara's perceptual signature—filtering the world through letterpress and borrowed voices—is asserted but not enacted in selective, biased noticing. Sentence rhythms are controlled, though several adjacent lines open with "She" or "The," creating minor template cadence. No dialogue appears; interior monologue remains abstract rather than embodied.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear and rhythmically varied, with strong images ("topaz walls…pulse with a faint, violet hue," "vanishing stars…dimmed to pinpricks"). However, paraphrase loops appear: "borrowed personalities" and "transposed empathy" are restated across multiple sentences without added pressure, and "she believed" / "she realized" / "she felt" stems recur. Figurative density is high throughout—nearly every sentence carries metaphor or elevated diction—without pattern-teaching or payoff, reducing propulsion in peak beats. No major clarity breaks, but scaffold phrasing ("a reminder that," "as if") and synonym churn ("shimmered," "whispered," "murmured") dull momentum. The final third remains vivid but does not tighten.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The premise—letterpress operator encoding emotion into print via borrowed personalities and a magical halo fragment—combines several speculative elements, but the execution leans on abstract claims rather than grounded transformation. The "mathematics of emotion" conceit is repeated without a non-obvious angle or earned complication. No turn or intensification feels inevitable in hindsight; the halo simply cracks as an event rather than a consequence of Mara's prior choices. The topaz workshop and vanishing stars provide atmospheric particularity but do not transform familiar tropes. The piece reads more as a lyric meditation on a concept than a synthesis that risks stakes for ingenuity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Mara is present throughout and performs actions (sets up plates, prints a line, steps back, collects shards), but none of these are choices that create turns or narrow options. She observes and executes a process without decision pressure. Missing middle development and closure participation as an agent; the halo fragment drives the climax, not Mara's agency.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The halo fragment appears early (setup gate), is handled in multiple beats (rests on cradle, receives ink, echoes verses, brightens, cracks), and shapes the ending image (releases light, breaks into shards). It constrains Mara's process (she must await it, print onto it, interpret its response) and charges the final moment. Scores in the essential-across-beats band; not quite indispensable because the piece could function with a similar magical catalyst, but strong integration overall.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Transposed empathy is named repeatedly and framed as Mara's goal, but it remains a thematic claim rather than a mechanic that alters on-page options or tactics. No scene shows empathy being successfully transposed or failing with cost. Functional but replaceable; a similar abstract concept (e.g., "encoded memory," "distilled grief") could substitute with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>Mara "habitually borrows personalities from forgotten poets" is stated in the opening and echoed later, but the trait is never dramatized. No scene shows her slipping into a borrowed cadence, no choice is constrained or enabled by this habit, and no cost appears. Label-only mention without action pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>The action "disorient" appears once when Mara prints a deliberately ambiguous line "to disorient the ordinary senses," and later the script is said to "disorient any who tried to decipher without feeling." However, no turn traces to this action; no character (including Mara) is shown disoriented on the page, and it does not redefine options. Ornamental mention that could be removed without structural impact.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Deliberate ambiguity is mentioned as a method (the printed line is "deliberately ambiguous," the script forces readers "to adopt the borrowed personalities"), but the mechanics are never demonstrated. No scene shows ambiguity being wielded, tested, or failing. Present but ornamental; does not shape attempts or constrain choices.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The topaz workshop is anchored early and returns in the ending ("topaz workshop, now a galaxy of murmured feelings"), but it functions as vivid backdrop rather than pressuring choices. The walls pulse and breathe metaphorically, yet no resource or constraint from the setting alters Mara's tactics or outcome. Functional setting with purposeful reprise, but replaceable with another atmospheric space.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Between vanishing stars" appears in the opening and closing, and "as the night deepened" marks progression, but no clock tightens decisions. Mara awaits the fragment, works through the night, and promises to return tomorrow—time is vague and untracked. Missing middle development and closure participation; the timeframe does not alter moves or charge the ending.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Mara's motivation "to understand the mathematics of emotion" is declared early and echoed at the end ("she would chase forever"), but it is never dramatized through conflicted choices or visible friction between want and cost. She pursues the goal without obstacle or trade-off on the page. Functional presence with setup and payoff, but told rather than shown under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Lucid turbulence" is named twice and the prose attempts to balance clarity with metaphorical density throughout. The tone remains elevated and dreamlike without major modulation—calm awaiting, then shimmering climax, then calm collection—missing the charge that would mark a decisive shift. Coherent and consistent, shaping one key turn (the fragment's crack), but static mood prevents higher score.</comment>
