<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The chief is characterized primarily through labels ("gently meticulous") and stock behaviors (noting frequencies "with the precision of a surgeon") rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. Her motivation linking the archive work to "forgotten syllables of her own childhood" arrives as assertion without on-page dramatization of how that memory constrains present choices. The final act—whispering a vow about memory outlasting oblivion—reads as thematic statement rather than a choice with visible cost. Embodied emotion is sparse; most interiority operates as elevated summary.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes a Textural/Accumulative lens through density of image and recursive phrasing ("quartz hush," "luminous vows"). Orientation anchors are present early (frozen library, records chief, lantern slide task). The closure unit reads as Conceptual Repricing: the final whispered vow reweights the premise that memory can be measured and preserved. However, the cost remains conceptual and oblique—no visible forfeiture or decision alters her options on the page, and the slide's awakening feels more like a successful completion than a transformation with felt stakes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The frozen library, glacial marble pedestal, and frequency-measuring device anchor the action and constrain her method (she must measure silence via book-spine hum). The environment charges the final image when clouds part to reveal pale sun and the library "exhales." Sensory hierarchy is consistent (aural focus on frequencies and hush, tactile frost). The setting avoids postcard description and integrates purposefully, meeting the 9+ test of constraining choice and charging closure, though some details (pillars of ice, vaulted ceiling) recur more for texture than tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—retrieve and activate the slide by measuring temperature/frequencies—is signaled early but unfolds without meaningful resistance or tightening. The chief's method works as planned; no reversal, complication, or trade-off narrows her options. The slide "fully awakens" without cost or sacrifice, and the "edge of oblivion receding" declares victory rather than dramatizing a choice that forecloses a path. Under the Textural lens, escalation should manifest as density increase or cadence shift that reweights the stake; here the prose remains uniform in register and the chief's actions face no constraint that alters tactics.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Theme—memory measured gently can outlast oblivion—emerges from images (frequencies, luminous vows, quartz hush) and the chief's ritual of recording. The final whispered vow makes the theme explicit rather than offering a resonant, non-literal answer, lowering thematic subtlety. Recurring motifs (quartz hush, luminous vows) are purposeful but do not constrain choice or deepen ambiguity; they ornament rather than complicate. The piece avoids sermonizing elsewhere and grounds abstraction in concrete acts (placing the slide, tracing patterns), lifting it above mere assertion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and consistent ("quartz hush," "filament of story," "map guiding her through the abyss of silence") but borders on uniform lyricism that does not modulate sharply under pressure peaks. Perceptual signature is auditory-focused (frequencies, hum, whisper) and remains character-appropriate for an archivist. However, key moments rely on abstract constructions ("conjure meaning from the edge of oblivion") rather than embodied perception, and the prose does not compress or shift rhythm when the slide activates—the climactic beat matches the texture of earlier description.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout without escalation or pattern-teaching: "pillars of ice," "quartz hush," "sheet of bruised violet," "crystal veil," "filament of story," "needles of revelation," "constellation of luminous vows" appear in rapid succession without clear payoff at closure. Mixed metaphor: vows are "filaments" that "stretch across the vaulted ceiling" yet also form a "map" and later a "constellation"—three incompatible spatial metaphors for the same phenomenon. Template cadence in the middle third: "She understood... She placed... She lowered... She closed... She stepped... She whispered" stacks identical sentence stems. Paraphrase loop: "quartz hush" recurs six times with near-synonym "silence" and "quiet" without added meaning. Apply −1.2 cumulative for density without payoff, mixed metaphor, and template stems; disallow 9+ globally per artifact rule.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The premise—mystical archivist retrieves enchanted slide in airborne library—leans on familiar quest-retrieval and magical-object templates without transforming them through grounded constraint or non-obvious complication. The slide activates without surprise or cost, and the chief's personal pilgrimage to "forgotten syllables of her own childhood" is asserted late without specific memory detail that would particularize her stakes. The frozen-library-above-clouds setting offers visual novelty but functions as backdrop rather than pressure. Transformation test: plot and arc could transfer to a different enchanted archive with minimal adjustment.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The orderly records chief is present throughout and her role (measuring frequencies to unlock the slide) drives the sequence. However, her choices are procedural—she measures, notes, places, traces, records—without on-page decision points where she must choose between competing options or pay a cost. The character enables the plot but does not create turns through conflicted agency. Present in setup, middle, and closure; functional but swappable with a similar archivist role.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The magic lantern slide is the object of retrieval (setup), is placed on the pedestal and measured (middle), and "fully awakens" to cast luminous vows at closure. It appears in all three beats and its state changes (sealed → measured → awakened). However, it does not constrain the chief's choices—she succeeds without trade-off—and its properties (pulsing with vows, clouded glass, requiring temperature measurement) are described more than dramatized as obstacles. The slide shapes the sequence but does not impose cost or enable a tactic she otherwise lacked.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Luminous vows are seeded early ("magic lantern slide that pulsed with ancient luminous vows"), recur as the measured frequencies produce "a sunrise of promises" forming "filaments of story," and close the piece when the chief whispers "the final luminous vow." The concept charges the ending image and provides thematic texture. However, it operates primarily as metaphor and thematic label; the vows do not create a dilemma, narrow options, or impose a cost on the chief's actions. Present across beats but swappable with similar mystical-promise concepts.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Gently meticulous" is asserted in the opening line and echoed once ("gently meticulous in its motion" when she traces patterns). The trait describes her method but does not create a visible trade-off or constraint—there is no scene where gentle meticulousness costs her time, reveals a blind spot, or conflicts with urgency. Label-only use without on-page cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Measure" anchors the chief's method and recurs across beats: she measures temperature via frequency sampling, notes each shift "with the precision of a surgeon," lets measured frequencies flow through the device, and closes with the assertion that "memory, measured gently, could outlast oblivion." The action is irreplaceable—the plot hinges on measuring the exact conditions to awaken the slide—and it shapes the ritual that produces the ending glow. However, the measuring succeeds without complication or adjustment, limiting causal pressure. Essential to the sequence and closure-linked, but lacks visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Sampling frequencies is signaled early ("a device that measured by sampling frequencies of the faint hum") and executed in the middle ("let the measured frequencies flow through the device, turning invisible vibrations into... glow"). The method is specific and irreplaceable—no other technique is offered. However, it is described rather than dramatized as a constraint; the chief does not troubleshoot failed samples or adjust her approach. Present in setup and middle with a mechanics-matter link to the glow, but does not shape tactics under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The frozen library above clouds frames every beat: aisles whispering, frost under her feet, glacial marble pedestal, vaulted ceiling receiving the projected vows, wind-carved balcony. The setting provides the vault, the silence to measure, and the cosmic scale for the ending image (clouds parting, pale sun). It is indispensable to atmosphere and the chief's task (measuring the library's hum), and it charges the closure when the library "exhales" in gratitude. However, it does not pressure her choices—she moves freely, no environmental obstacle complicates her work—so it functions more as stage than crucible.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.7</grade><comment>"While illusions fade to memory in the waning light" appears once in mid-passage; the phrase evokes a parallel between the dimming sky and the slide's ancient vows but does not create a deadline or tighten decisions. The chief works at her own pace with no time pressure signaled or paid off. Ornamental use without clock-driven tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The motivation "to conjure meaning from the edge of oblivion" is stated explicitly in one sentence and linked to "a personal pilgrimage toward the forgotten syllables of her own childhood." It reappears at closure when "the edge of oblivion receded." However, the desire is told rather than dramatized through on-page friction—no moment shows her weighing the cost of pursuing meaning or risking failure. The motivation frames the theme but does not constrain or complicate her choices. Present in setup and closure with thematic resonance, but lacks embodied conflict.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Quartz hush" recurs six times, anchoring the tone: aisles whisper in it, her thoughts match it, the ledger hums with it, it settles on her shoulders at the end. The tone is stable, cohesive, and charged at closure when the library exhales and the hush becomes snowfall. However, the tone does not modulate under pressure—the slide's awakening and the chief's success are rendered in the same lyric register as the opening—limiting dynamic range. Essential to voice and closure image but lacks tonal escalation or break.</comment>
