<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The protagonist remains abstract throughout, defined by contradictory labels ("arsonist," "guardian") rather than embodied choices under pressure. The supposed redemption arc is told in summary across years rather than dramatized in scene; we never witness a micro-choice that costs him something legible. The "volcanic tenderness" is asserted repeatedly but never enacted through contradictory impulses in a single beat. Internal voice collapses into therapy-speak ("analytical intuition," "fierce love tempered by gentle heat") without the grit of actual thought under stress.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>No identifiable closure unit: the piece summarizes a multi-year transformation without landing a decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing on the page. The orientation anchor arrives late—who he is and where he stands remain vague past the 120-word mark—and the "three years off the grid" functions as a causality gap rather than motivated ellipsis. The drive lens is indeterminate; causal linkage is broken (the fire "guides his mind back" without mechanism), and accumulative design is announced but not executed through pressure or pattern. The final paragraph offers retrospective summary, not a reweighted present image with cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The desert canyon and archive supply vivid visual anchors (murals, alcove, basalt dome), and the bronze box functions as a concrete goal object. Spatial choreography is mostly clear across the trail of stations. However, the setting remains largely decorative: the archive's physical properties do not constrain his choices, and the "hollow basalt dome" and "echoing chambers" appear only in the penultimate paragraph without shaping the peak action. The body and tools (fire, tapestry fragment) are mentioned but not used in ways that alter tactics under pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"rescue a forgotten promise"—is declared but never tested by a live obstacle or trade-off. The vandalized self-portrait is framed as a clue but its discovery requires no decision and the "trail of artistic creations" unfolds as a scavenger hunt without escalation. The tapestry fitting "perfectly" onto the stone eliminates friction rather than forcing a choice. Agency is absent: coincidence (the perfect fit, the sliding stone) resolves the quest, and the final mural-painting is recounted in summary without cost or opposition.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The phoenix motif and redemption arc are stated directly rather than emerging from particulars: "his redemption," "the promise now lived in the walls." The piece announces its theme ("protect the stories") in the scroll rather than dramatizing the collision between preservation and destruction. "Volcanic tenderness" is repeated as a label without concrete correlative in action or image. The final paragraph's "soft heat that invites strangers to linger" offers atmospheric reassurance rather than a resonant, non-literal answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The narrative voice is stable in stance but generic in texture, relying on stock lyricism ("volcanic tenderness," "dust danced like ash," "narratives could melt steel") rather than character-particular perception. Filter verbs ("felt," "understood") dull immediacy at key beats. Psychic distance is inconsistent: the narrator claims omniscient knowledge of future visitors' emotions ("felt the heat of compassion") without dramatization. No dialogue is present to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops cluster throughout: the archive is "lost civilization archive" then "lost civilization archive carved into a hollow basalt dome"; "volcanic tenderness" appears four times without evolving meaning. Template cadence dominates: "He [verb]" openers in six consecutive sentences mid-piece. Metaphors muddle: "lava, bright and tender" contradicts the physical properties of lava, and "dust danced like ash" blurs vehicle and tenor. The final paragraph stacks three summary sentences that restate the redemption without propulsion. High-pressure beats default to elevated diction ("analytically intuitive," "fierce love tempered") that clashes with embodied urgency.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The core premise—arsonist turned archivist—is familiar redemption-arc material executed without fresh synthesis. The vandalized self-portrait as map and the phoenix tapestry are genre-standard clues without transformation. Emotional beats recycle therapeutic language ("volcanic tenderness," "fierce love tempered by gentle heat") rather than discovering character-specific inflection. The piece hedges risk by summarizing the multi-year arc rather than committing to a single high-stakes scene.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>The lending library arsonist is named early but his choices are summarized retrospectively ("he set a controlled blaze," "he followed the trail") without on-page decision points or visible cost. The fire is instrumental convenience, not a choice that forecloses options. Late mention without mid-scene pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The faded tapestry fragment appears in the alcove (early), fits onto the cracked stone at the third station (middle use), and is traced "with his fingertips" in the quiet evenings (reprise). However, its properties are static—"seemed to pulse with old grief," "fit perfectly"—and it does not constrain a choice or impose cost; the perfect fit removes friction. Two functional beats but ornamental treatment caps the score.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The vandalized self-portrait is introduced early as a clue and serves a functional plot role (map to the vaults). However, it does not shape stakes or tactics—he simply follows its implicit directions—and the concept of vandalism is not explored as a constraint or moral friction. Swappable with any "marked map" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Analytically intuitive" is a label applied once ("reading the silent equations of color and pattern") without constraining or enabling an on-page action. It predicts fire spread and story travel in summary but is never tested under pressure or shown to impose a tradeoff. Label-only, no visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Portray" is signaled in the stated purpose ("returned to the library, not to burn, but to portray") and recurs in the final mural action. It drives the ending image but arrives late and is executed in summary ("each stroke a reminder") without dramatized process or friction. One causal beat at closure, but late entry and summary-only treatment limit integration.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The trail of artistic creations is introduced early and spans three stations, shaping the middle sequence. However, its mechanics are generic (sculptures, frescos, tablets) and do not impose constraint—each step is solved by discovery rather than choice. The method is functional but replaceable with any breadcrumb trail.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The lost civilization archive anchors spatial action from the opening and recurs across beats (alcove, vaults, basalt dome). The archive's walls and niche enable the tapestry reveal. However, the setting supplies props more than pressure; it does not constrain tactics or force adaptation. Present in setup, middle, and ending, but largely passive.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"After going off the grid for three years" is mentioned once in the opening but does not function as a timeframe within the narrative window. No clock or temporal pressure shapes decisions; the phrase is backstory context without causal weight.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"To rescue a forgotten promise" is stated explicitly in the opening and fulfilled at closure when the scroll is discovered and the murals painted. However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants or costs. The promise drives goal-direction but lacks friction or visible sacrifice.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"Volcanic tenderness" is repeated as a tonal label four times but remains abstract. The oxymoron is asserted ("fierce love tempered by gentle heat," "warm their hearts") without embodied correlative in syntax, rhythm, or action. Static mood rather than modulation under pressure.</comment>
