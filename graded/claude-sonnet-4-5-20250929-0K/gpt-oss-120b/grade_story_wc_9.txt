<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The cartomancer remains abstract throughout—no embodied contradiction, no micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values under pressure. "Willingly perplexed" is asserted but never dramatized through a moment where incompatible impulses collide. The twins are passive recipients; the protagonist performs ritual gestures (kneel, whisper, unfasten) without internal friction or visible cost that forecloses a path. Interiority relies on stock mystical phrasing ("velvet," "choking beauty") rather than character-particular perception.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation test penalty applies: who/where/when anchors emerge slowly and remain vague past 120 words; "onyx-ink cartomancer" and "midnight glade above clouds" offer no functional grounding. The drive lens is ambiguous—accumulative texture dominates early, but the saucer-crack sequence gestures at causal linkage without delivering motivated consequence. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration via the crystal blossom and droplet, but no felt cost or foreclosed option appears on the page; the twins simply sleep, unchanged by choice. The cartomancer's internal knot-release ("unfastened the last knot of her own heart") is told, not dramatized with a decision that narrows options.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Vivid sensory texture—mist, moonlight, vapor scent—creates atmosphere but remains postcard description. The glade never constrains a choice or supplies a resource that alters tactics; the saucer crack "map of sorrow" is ornamental metaphor without spatial consequence. Micro-setting option: the dolls' tea set could function as constraint, but the cartomancer's handling (unfasten clasp, lid falls) involves no obstacle or trade-off. The "staircase of mist" she follows has no physical stakes—ascending costs nothing and opens no door that was previously closed.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"cloudbound repentance" to "soothe the unborn sighs"—is declared but never tested by an on-page reversal or tightening that narrows options. The cartomancer performs a sequence of gestures (kneel, unfasten, whisper, place droplet) without encountering resistance, trade-off, or a moment where success/failure hinges on her choice. No escalation: the crack widens, then heals itself; the vapor rises; the blossom appears—all without agency-driven turns. The ending grants resolution (twins sleep, world will mend) via environmental magic rather than protagonist decision with visible cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Theme of repentance/healing emerges through recurring images (crack, vapor, blossom, droplet) but the final image offers no non-literal answer to a posed question—problems resolve mechanically. "Choking beauty" and "willingly perplexed" are asserted labels rather than lived contradictions that complicate choice. The family custom of tracing hands appears mid-story as thematic ornament without constraining the cartomancer's tactics. The ending recites cosmic reconciliation ("universe stitched together") in abstract summary rather than a charged particular that reweights prior material.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Third-person narration maintains stable distance and generates distinct lyric texture ("onyx-ink," "nebula cloak"), but the perceptual signature is generic mystical rather than character-specific. Diction elevates uniformly—no modulation under pressure, no compression at crisis. The cartomancer's interiority leans on synonym loops: "choking beauty" recurs unchanged, "willingly perplexed" is told rather than shown through selective noticing. Purposeful compression is attempted (elliptical time, imagistic leaps) but the pattern is not taught early enough to charge the ending; instead it flattens causality.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Heavy overwriting: figurative language (velvet, staircase of mist, nebula, spider silk) saturates most sentences without pattern-teaching or payoff, triggering density penalty. Paraphrase loops abound—"crack was a map," "fissure reflecting fragmented memory"; "whispered their names…believing syllables could stitch" then "each utterance pulled at the crack." Template cadence: "She moved…She knelt…She recalled…She whispered…She followed…She unfastened…She turned…She watched…She rose." Register drift into elevated poetic diction ("luminous hush," "harmonic tide") clashes with the task-oriented present. Artifacts touch the closure beat ("her story becoming a whisper among the winds"), disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The core premise—ritual to soothe newborn twins via cloudbound repentance—combines stock fantasy tropes (cartomancer, sky garden, magical tea-set) without fresh synthesis. Emotional arc and stakes could transfer to any mystical-healer template with minor name swaps. The dolls' tea-set crack and mist-staircase are vivid details but serve as ornament rather than irreplaceable logic. No bold risk: the narrative avoids genuine failure, moral ambiguity, or a non-obvious turn that grows from prior particulars.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Present throughout but observation-dominant. The cartomancer performs gestures (kneel, unfasten, whisper, place droplet) that do not create reversals or foreclose options—events happen to/around her (crack widens, vapor rises, blossom emerges) without her decisions altering tactics. Late arrival of active role in final third (placing droplet) is reactive rather than generative. No setup in first third that frames her stakes; she is summoned and complies.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Appears early (first third) and recurs with evolving significance: initially "shattered," then "crack spider-thin," then unfastened, then widens, then heals. Functions in three beats (discovery, manipulation, resolution). However, the saucer's mechanics are passive—it reacts to vapor and magic rather than being wielded with trade-off. Closure linkage present (heals, replaced by blossom) but the cost is environmental rather than protagonist-driven. Strong lyric reprise charges the ending image, elevating to mid-5s despite swappability (any ritual object could serve).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Cloudbound repentance" labels the premise and echoes in "cloudbound forgiveness" and the glade-as-suspended-time motif, but it does not constrain on-page choices or shape tactics. The cartomancer's gestures (unfasten, whisper) are not repentance acts with visible sacrifice; no guilt or prior wrong is dramatized. Present thematically but not causally—removing it would change flavor, not plot logic. Functional but replaceable with "sky healing" or similar.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"Willingly perplexed" appears once in first paragraph as label, restated in final third ("willingly perplexed no longer"), but never constrains or enables an on-page action. No moment where confusion versus clarity forces a trade-off. The cartomancer moves through the sequence without hesitation or cost tied to this trait. Ornamental mood tag without causal work.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Unfasten" appears twice with functional weight: unfastening the silver clasp on the saucer (triggers vapor release) and unfastening "the last knot of her own heart" (symbolic internal shift). Both beats link to the ending (crack heals, emotional release). Setup in first third (clasp mentioned early), development in middle (physical act), payoff at closure (internal act echoes physical). Elevated by specificity and reprise, though the internal unfastening is told summary rather than dramatized choice. Swappable with "release" or "open" but the recurrence charges the pattern.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The family custom appears mid-story (past first third) as reflective insert: "she recalled the family custom…saw the twins' tiny palms pressed into cloth." It informs her belief that syllables can heal but does not shape on-page tactics—she whispers names without needing the tablecloth method. Late signal (−0.3), ornamental memory without mechanical consequence (−0.5), not present at closure. Functional flavor but easily removed.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The midnight glade is established early (first line) and sustained throughout; sensory details (mist, moonlight, grass) create vivid atmosphere. However, the setting does not pressure choices—no obstacle, resource scarcity, or environmental constraint alters the cartomancer's moves. The glade "seemed to inhale," "pulsed," passively reacting rather than imposing cost. Spatial choreography is vague (she "moves toward clearing," "follows" mist staircase with no distance or difficulty). One causal touch: the glade as repository where "lost minutes settle" justifies the droplet retrieval, lifting score to low-5s.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"After the birth of the sky-borne twins" frames the opening and the twins' cries bookend the piece, but elapsed time and urgency remain untracked. No clock pressure—the cartomancer could perform the ritual over minutes or hours with no visible consequence. The timeframe sets context but does not tighten decisions or alter tactics. Present but non-constraining.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>"To find where lost time accumulates" is named as her task in the opening and drives her journey to the glade, where she retrieves a droplet of time. This desire shapes two beats (arrival at glade, retrieval of droplet) and the ending (droplet placed on twins). However, the motivation is told-only—no on-page friction between this want and a competing fear or cost. She "accepted the task as a promise to herself" without dramatized hesitation. Functional but friction-free, capping mid-4s.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Choking beauty" recurs three times across the piece, modulating from initial description ("air thickening with a choking beauty") to final reflection ("choking beauty of the moment lingered"). The tone coheres through mystical lyricism and sensory density. Closure linkage: the phrase charges the final paragraph's emotional register. However, the tone remains static—no cadence shift under pressure, no ironic tension. Strong reprise and thematic consistency elevate to mid-5s, but lack of modulation prevents higher score.</comment>
