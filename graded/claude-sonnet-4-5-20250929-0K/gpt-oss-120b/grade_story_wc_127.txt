<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation as a counterfeit emotion dealer is declared rather than dramatized through on-page choices that test her commitment. The "affectionate detachment" reads as a label without embodied contradiction—she performs her trade smoothly without internal conflict or a moment where genuine feeling threatens her professional stance. Interiority relies on abstract formulations ("half truths of the grotto—half memory, half myth—begin to coalesce") rather than specific embodied sensation. No visible cost or foreclosed path emerges; the ending finds her planning the next harvest with unchanged options.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when clearly by the opening paragraph. However, the piece lacks a Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with visible cost: Mara begins harvesting emotions and ends planning to harvest more, with no on-page alteration of stakes, options, or stance. The process unfolds as a illustrated procedure rather than a causal chain where choices narrow options or impose felt cost. Under a Causal lens, no because/therefore linkage changes Mara's situation; under an Accumulative lens, no pattern break or cadence shift reweights the dominant stake at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The amber grotto is vividly rendered with sensory specificity (walls "humming with a low, resonant static that seemed to taste of old rain," "vortex of colors"). The setting provides a resource—the stone's static charge—that Mara uses in her method, thus constraining her approach. The final image reprises the grotto's whisper of static, charging the ending slightly. However, the grotto does not force a difficult choice or complicate her harvest; it remains a cooperative backdrop rather than a pressure that alters tactics under stress.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—successfully harvesting and sealing the petal's emotional charge—is signaled early and pursued throughout. However, no reversal, tightening, or deepening occurs: each step (rub petal, inhale fragrance, seal vial) proceeds without obstacle, adaptation, or cost. Mara encounters no resistance, makes no trade-offs, and ends with unchanged options. The process is executed rather than tested, and coincidence does not complicate; the transformation simply "completes" on schedule. Agency is present in her method but does not foreclose a path or impose visible price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The theme of commodified emotion and the boundary between insight/empathy emerges from Mara's trade and the "half truths" she captures. The petal as recurring object shifts meaning slightly from promise to product, and "affectionate detachment" colors the frame. However, the final lines ("promised to return with a new perfume that will gently subsume that sorrow into a comforting illusion") veer toward thematic summary rather than resonant image. The ending articulates the premise rather than reweighting it through a non-literal answer or ambiguity with cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV is stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent—Mara's professional detachment and sensory focus on fragrance and static—and diction remains elevated throughout ("counterfeit emotion dealer," "subsume the ambient sentiment"). However, voice lacks modulation under pressure; the same meditative register persists from opening to close without syntactic or rhythmic shift. Filter verbs ("felt," "seemed," "watched") appear frequently but read voice-motivated given the lyric mode. No dialogue is present to assess.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Prose is polished with vivid figurative language ("walls humming with a low, resonant static that seemed to taste of old rain," "emotions as a gardener tends roses"). However, density issues and loops reduce momentum: "half truths" appears six times, "static" nine times, "petal" fourteen times, often in near-paraphrase constructions ("half truths of the grotto—half memory, half myth" / "half truths she sells"). Template cadence runs appear ("She [verb], [gerund phrase]" across multiple sentences in the middle third). Figurative language is frequent without pattern-teaching or payoff, and some metaphors muddle (static "mapping" currents, petal "dissolving" into ambient sentiment). These artifacts dull the closure beat's charge.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The counterfeit emotion dealer premise and fragrance-as-data conceit offer a speculative angle, and the amber grotto provides atmospheric specificity. However, the core narrative—artisan performs specialized harvest without complication and departs ready for the next job—follows a familiar template of competence fantasy without transformation or risk. The "half truths" and "affectionate detachment" are thematically on-prompt but not dramatized through conflict or choice that would render them non-obvious. Transformation test: swap "emotion dealer" for another artisan role and the arc remains unchanged.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Mara is present throughout and performs all actions. However, her role as counterfeit emotion dealer is declared rather than tested by choices that narrow options or impose cost. She executes her method without complication or adaptation; no decision alters tactics. The character is functional but swappable with any skilled artisan in a speculative setting.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The blotter petal appears early (paragraph 3), is handled in multiple beats (rubbed against stone, inhaled, saturated, sealed in vial), and returns in the final paragraph ("already planning how to harvest another petal"). Its iridescent veins and chemistry anchor Mara's method. However, the petal does not constrain a choice or create friction; it cooperates throughout. Removing it would require a substitute object but the arc would remain unchanged. Present across beats and closure, but lacks causal pressure or visible cost tied to its specific properties.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Half truths" is named six times and frames the product Mara creates, linking the grotto's ambient memories to the synthetic emotion she sells. However, it functions as a thematic label rather than a stake or tactic that shapes on-page choices. Mara does not wrestle with the ethics of selling partial truths, nor does the concept impose a cost or constraint. It echoes throughout but does not change options or drive a turn.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Professionally thorough" is mentioned once in the opening sentence and never dramatized through an on-page action with visible cost or trade-off. Mara's method is described as meticulous, but no moment shows her thoroughness constraining time, enabling success where haste would fail, or conflicting with another value. The attribute is a label without causal work.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Subsume" appears three times and names the process by which Mara absorbs ambient sentiment into the petal. It is enacted on the page ("allowing it to dissolve into the petal until the two were indistinguishable") and tied to her method. However, the action is descriptive rather than causal; no turn or escalation traces to "subsume" specifically. A near-synonym (absorb, infuse, capture) could replace it with minor edits. Present in setup, middle, and closure mention, but lacks unique causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Static electricity is introduced early ("raise a subtle charge on the petal by rubbing it against the grotto's stone, allowing static electricity to sense the emotional residue") and recurs ("faint crackle," "static charge inside," "whisper of static" in final line). The method is signaled and its mechanics shape Mara's approach. However, static is one component among many (fragrance, petal chemistry, grotto ambiance); the story does not hinge on it uniquely. Functional across beats but replaceable with another sensing mechanism.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The amber grotto is anchored early with vivid sensory detail and provides the stone surface whose static Mara uses in her method. It appears in the opening, middle beats, and reprises in the final paragraph ("The amber grotto, now empty, retained a whisper of static"). The setting enables her process but does not pressure a choice or complicate tactics; it is cooperative. Early signal, beat involvement, and closure reprise earn mid-range, but lack of constraint caps score.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"As the transformation completes" frames the timeframe; the piece spans a single harvesting session from dusk through completion ("Just as the final swirl settled, a faint chime echoed"). However, time does not tighten decisions or create urgency; the process unfolds on schedule without clock pressure. The chime marks completion rather than a deadline that alters tactics. Time is tracked but does not constrain.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"To fuse insight with empathy" is stated once as Mara's aim ("simple yet profound: to fuse insight with empathy, turning raw data into a feeling"). The motivation is told rather than dramatized through conflicting desires or a choice where empathy and insight pull in opposite directions. No friction or cost is tied to this fusion on the page. Present as a thematic claim but not enacted as a stake.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Affectionate detachment" is named twice and the tone is maintained through Mara's measured calm and professional distance ("cared for the emotions as a gardener tends roses, yet never let sentiment cloud her measured calculations"). The tone is coherent but static; it does not modulate under pressure or charge the final image with new weight. The ending reprises the same detachment without deepening or complicating it. Consistent presence across the piece but lacks dynamic range or cost.</comment>
