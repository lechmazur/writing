<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Lira remains a vehicle for the concept rather than a person with contradictory impulses acting in scene. Her "desperately jocular" trait is declared but never constrains a choice or creates visible friction—jokes are mentioned but not shown colliding with pressure. The crew of "misfit volunteers" appears mid-story without interior access or embodied tension, functioning as prop-movers. No meaningful change or renunciation is earned; she simply enacts a premise-driven plan without cost or mistake.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors appear within the first 120 words (disused station, Lira). The piece follows a linear plan-execution arc: Lira hears rumor → summons caretaker → assembles crew → retrieves fragment → sends it onward. No meaningful reversal or tightening narrows options; the ivy puzzle is solved in a single beat without complication. The ending delivers Conceptual Repricing (cure = catalyzing connections), but the cost is asserted rather than dramatized—no on-page forfeiture or visible price paid. Lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (density increase toward thematic image), but density remains static throughout; the chime spreading is told, not shown reweighting prior material with felt consequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The disused station overgrown with ivy is vividly established early and returns at closure ("ivy-clad arches"). The hidden compartment and comet imprint provide tactile specificity. However, the setting does not constrain a choice or alter tactics—the puzzle (cut ivy in a pattern) is stated and solved off-page, and spatial choreography remains vague during the crew's work. The fragment's "warm touch" and "soft chime" charge the final image, qualifying the object-as-micro-setting exception, but the environment itself functions as backdrop rather than pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("find the cure for loneliness") is signaled early. No meaningful escalation or tightening occurs: the caretaker's puzzle is mentioned, then solved; the fragment is lifted without complication. Agency is execution of a plan with no visible trade-off, mistake, or forfeiture. The chime spreads outward and "each listener felt a fleeting lift," but this is summary-told, not dramatized through a character resisting, choosing, or paying a price. Cost is conceptual (cure = act of catalyzing) but not legible as a before/after change in options or stance on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Theme (cure for loneliness = catalyzing connections through reciprocity) emerges from the moon fragment's rumored empathy-echo and the final dispatch of the lantern. The ending offers a non-literal answer: "the cure…was not a potion but the act of catalyzing connections." However, the insight is stated rather than earned through specific struggle—Lira never doubts, reconsiders, or confronts friction between her method and a cost. "Polite anarchy" recurs but remains decorative; subtext is thin. The final image (station humming with laughter) asserts rather than dramatizes the thematic payoff, and the reciprocity chain is told via rumor mechanism, not shown through on-page choices.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Diction carries a whimsical, elevated register ("mute witness," "captive star," "coaxing discord into harmony") consistent throughout, but it does not modulate under pressure—the same lyric texture persists whether describing setting or supposed high-stakes retrieval. Filter verbs ("seemed," "felt") appear but are not excessive. No dialogue is present. Perceptual signature is generic: Lira notices ivy, fragment warmth, laughter, but these observations do not reveal character-specific bias or blind spots. The voice reads as authorial rather than inhabited.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Dense figurative language clusters throughout: "platforms swallowed by thick ivy," "glimmered like a captive star," "catalyze a network of empathy," "curtains being drawn," "contract signed in invisible ink." Paragraph 2 loops synonym variants of rumor/chain/echo without advancing pressure. Template cadence: "She believed…She mapped…She sent…She gathered…She lifted…She recorded…She sent." The phrase "polite anarchy" recurs four times without evolving meaning. Key beats (ivy-cutting, fragment retrieval) are summarized rather than shown in real-time action. Sentence rhythm is monotone; no propulsion variation aligns with scene urgency. Multiple scaffold phrases ("the rumor claimed," "the moment…") dull momentum. Paraphrase loops across adjacent lines in paragraphs 2 and 3; mixed register drift into abstract thesis-speak ("catalyze a network of empathy") in peak beats; filter-verb stacks and summary compression of the climax touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Core premise (moon rock cures loneliness via empathy-echo) echoes familiar "magical object solves human problem" templates without fresh transformation. "Polite anarchy" and "desperately jocular" traits are declared but remain labels without specific, grounded behavioral cost. The ivy-puzzle and caretaker's grin could be from stock fairy-tale logic. The ending's insight ("cure…was…the act of catalyzing connections") is a prompt-summary restatement rather than a hard-won particular. No bold structural or perspectival risk; execution is safe and ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Lira is the POV character and drives the plan from summons to retrieval to dispatch. Present across all beats but makes no on-page choice that narrows options or costs her something—she enacts premise, doesn't test it. "Elusive" and "disaster-relief logistician" are labels without scene pressure. Swappable role; any quest-driver could execute this arc.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Fragment appears in setup (paragraph 2 rumor), is retrieved mid-story (lifted from cavity, pulsed warmth, chimed), and is dispatched in the ending (packaged in lantern, sent onward). Three beats; early signal; closure linkage (chime spreads, lantern dispatch). However, the fragment's properties (echo thoughts, catalyze empathy) are told, not dramatically tested—no character resists, doubts, or pays a visible price tied to handling it. Specificity (warm, pulsed, comet imprint) is vivid but the fragment does not narrow options or impose cost. Functional but closer to key-quest-object than indispensable pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"Bound by reciprocity" is stated in paragraph 2 ("chain reaction…reciprocity, each giving a smile to receive one") and echoed in the ending ("completing the circle of reciprocity"). Present as theme claim but does not shape on-page tactics or choices. No character trades, negotiates, or sacrifices under a reciprocity rule. Ornamental thematic label.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"Desperately jocular" is declared in paragraph 1 ("scattering jokes about broken signals") and mentioned again ("With a laugh that sounded like a rusted hinge"). No on-page joke is dramatized, no cost or constraint shown—desperation and humor do not collide in a choice. Label-only.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Catalyze" appears in paragraph 2 ("catalyze a network of empathy") and the ending ("the cure…was…the act of catalyzing connections"). The fragment's chime is the catalytic moment, and Lira's dispatch continues the chain. Two beats; early signal; closure participation. However, the act is summary-told (chime "traveled…each listener felt") rather than shown through a character's changed choice, and the mechanism is generic (magic spreads feeling). Functional but swappable with "initiate," "trigger," or "activate."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Improbable rumor chains" is signaled early (paragraph 2: "traveled through improbable rumor chains") and reappears at the chime moment ("traveling along the rumor chains that had carried the story"). Setup and closure presence, but the mechanics are vague—how do rumors travel? Who are the links? The rumor is backdrop, not a method that shapes Lira's attempts or forces trade-offs. Functional mention but replaceable with any backstory-delivery device.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Station is established in paragraph 1, returns in every beat (ivy, ticket booth, signal lights, arches), and is named in the ending ("the station hummed"). Early signal, multi-beat presence, closure participation. The hidden compartment supplies the fragment (enables retrieval), and the station becomes "a hub of polite anarchy." However, the station does not pressure a choice or impose a spatial cost—the ivy puzzle is solved off-page, the crew's work is summarized. Micro-setting element (comet imprint, cavity) charges tactile specificity. Approaches higher band but lacks the constraint or tactical alteration typical of ≥7.0.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"When the story changes, as it always does at the moment a decision is made" (paragraph 3) declares the timeframe but does not track a ticking clock or urgent window. The retrieval unfolds in summary without time pressure narrowing Lira's moves. The phrase is meta-commentary rather than dramatized constraint. Present as concept, absent as pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"To find the cure for loneliness" is stated in paragraph 3 ("modest goal: to find the cure") and returns in the ending ("the cure…was not a potion but the act"). Early signal and closure participation. However, the desire is declared, not dramatized through conflicting wants or visible cost—Lira never doubts, sacrifices a competing need, or endures friction. The ending's insight is told summary. Functional setup and thematic payoff, but no on-page friction between want and obstacle.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Polite anarchy" is named in paragraph 2, repeated in paragraphs 4, 5, and 7 ("polite rebellion," "polite anarchy," "absurdly polite request"). The tone is consistent (whimsical paradox: ordering chaos, demanding with courtesy) but static—no modulation under pressure, no moment where politeness costs her or anarchy wins. The phrase recurs as label without charging the final image with tonal shift or cost. Present, coherent, but ornamental.</comment>
