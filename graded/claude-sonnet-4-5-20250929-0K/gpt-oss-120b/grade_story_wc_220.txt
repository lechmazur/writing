<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Rook's motivation to "carry these voices across the cracked plains" emerges but lacks contradictory impulses under pressure. The transition from body-finder to memory-keeper is declared rather than earned through on-page choice with visible cost. Interiority relies on abstract labels ("heart thumped," "purpose rekindle") instead of embodied, character-particular perception. The final choice to reseal the leaf feels unmotivated—no dramatized internal conflict shapes the decision.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the opening paragraph, meeting the test. The closure unit—Rook resealing the leaf and promising to carry voices—reads as Charged Poise, but the cost remains abstract and unfelt on the page; the phrase "translate distance into closeness" is repeated without reweighting. The drive lens appears Accumulative/Textural (lyric density, recurring motifs), yet the ending does not achieve a cadence shift or pattern break that reconfigures the dominant stake. No visible price forecloses a path; the leaf's return to wax reverses the discovery without dramatized consequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The scrapyard setting is vivid and filtered through Rook's perception ("metallic dust that sang under his weight," "rusted towers"). Spatial choreography remains clear across moves (phonograph cylinder, market square, steel chest). The waxed leaf and prism function as micro-setting objects that enable the revelation, reaching the first gate. However, environment does not constrain a choice or charge the final image; the setting serves as backdrop rather than pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—connecting separated souls via the waxed leaf—is signaled early. However, no on-page reversal or tightening narrows options; Rook finds the cylinder, decodes it, retrieves the leaf, and reseals it in a linear sequence without complication or trade-off. The leaf's promise is fulfilled immediately with no dramatized cost or failed attempt. Agency is observational rather than decisional; coincidence (the leaf lying ready in an open chest) solves the quest without protagonist struggle.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Theme of memory, connection, and loss emerges through the waxed leaf and phonograph grooves. The phrase "translate distance into closeness" recurs but functions as a label rather than dramatized through particulars. The ending whispers a promise to the wind, approaching Resonant Reconfiguration, yet the thematic answer remains stated rather than shown through a non-literal final image. Subtext in "wild hush" and "violet-tinted sky" adds texture, but the closure reverts to direct declaration.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Rook throughout; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present ("nose retained an intuitively descriptive keenness for the past"), but diction drifts into elevated register inconsistent with a canine focalizer ("mythic device," "palpable closeness," "tapestry stitched from whispered myths"). Free indirect style is attempted but undercut by phrases that read as narrator commentary rather than Rook's interior lexicon. Rhythmic control is present in longer sentences, yet repeated template stems ("his [noun]," "the [noun]") flatten momentum in mid-beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Overwriting is pervasive: figurative language appears in nearly every sentence without pattern-teaching or payoff ("veins glinting like veins of copper," "letters trembling like fireflies in a storm"). Multiple mixed metaphors ("leaf's cold surface pulse," "choir of distant voices...streamed like tinted revelations") violate physical logic. Paraphrase loops are present ("translate distance into closeness" appears three times with minimal variation; "wild hush" recurs as filler). Filter-verb stacks ("felt," "seemed," "knew") cluster in high-pressure beats, dulling immediacy. Template cadence runs: "He [verb]...he [verb]" across multiple sentences without variation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>The core premise—decoding a phonograph cylinder to find a mythic leaf—combines familiar post-apocalyptic elements (scrapyard, resource war) with a canine protagonist, but the synthesis feels surface-level. The leaf's power to "translate distance into closeness" is declared rather than demonstrated through fresh particulars. Emotional beats follow predictable arcs (discovery, revelation, renewed purpose) without non-obvious turns. The story could function unchanged with a human protagonist and standard artifact, suggesting insufficient transformation of its tropes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Rook (bloodhound retired from finding bodies) is present throughout and his past role is mentioned early. However, his choices are observational rather than decisive; he follows the riddle's instructions without on-page conflict or cost. The retirement detail does not constrain or enable a key turn—his nose's keenness is noted but not tested. Two beats (approaching cylinder, retrieving leaf) involve him, but neither requires a choice that alters tactics. Swappable with a generic seeker.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The autumn leaf preserved in wax is seeded early (cylinder text references it), handled in two beats (discovery in chest, resealing), and present at closure. It enables the memory-connection moment ("voices...converging within his mind") and returns with reweighted meaning when Rook reseals it. However, the leaf does not constrain a choice or impose visible cost; its use is linear discovery without complication. Closure participation is present but passive—Rook places it back without friction.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Tinted revelations" appears as a phrase describing the prism's colored light revealing grooves ("violet and emerald hues...each color peeled back a layer"). It is ornamental description rather than a stake or tactical constraint. The concept is not tested under pressure or used to narrow options. The ending references "tinted revelations" once more as summary of past events, not as an active force shaping closure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Intuitively descriptive" is applied to Rook's nose in the opening paragraph as a label. It does not constrain or enable an on-page action with cost. His tracking of the leaf follows explicit riddle instructions rather than intuitive leaps. The trait is told, not shown through a choice that demonstrates its tradeoff or unique mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The riddle (from the phonograph grooves) is introduced early and drives Rook's journey to the market square. It shapes two beats: decoding via prism and following the instruction to "seek the waxen leaf where rust meets sky." However, the riddle is solved without complication or wrong turns; its mechanics are passive guidance rather than a constraint that alters tactics under pressure. Swappable with a map or direct instruction.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Reading grooves with light refracted through a prism is seeded early ("old lore: the cylinder held secret texts, readable only by tracing the shadows...with light"). The method is enacted on-page (Rook positions prism, casts colored bands, illuminates text). It appears in two beats (initial decoding, final scarlet band) and its mechanics matter to the revelation. However, the method does not impose cost or fail; it works immediately without adjustment or tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The scrapyard settlement spanning a cracked wasteland is described early and throughout (rusted towers, metallic dust, collapsed kiosk). It provides vivid backdrop and supplies the steel chest and market square. However, the setting does not pressure a choice or alter tactics; Rook moves through it without environmental obstacle or resource constraint. The wasteland is postcard description rather than a force shaping outcome.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"After the last resource war" anchors the backstory but does not tighten present decisions or impose a deadline. The timeframe is static historical context; no live clock or urgency alters Rook's moves. The ending ("waning light," "violet-tinted sky") notes time of day but does not use it to constrain action.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"To translate distance into closeness" is stated as Rook's motivation (recalled from his handler) and repeated at the leaf discovery and ending. However, the desire is declared, not dramatized through conflicted choice. No on-page friction between this want and a competing cost or fear is shown. The motivation guides linear action without visible tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>"Wild hush" appears in the opening ("wind whispered...silent sprawl") and closing ("wild hush enveloped him," "settlement breathed a sigh of wild hush"). Tone is quiet and elegiac throughout, coherent across beats. However, it does not modulate with pressure or shift cadence at closure; the mood remains static. The final image repeats the opening's tone without reweighting it.</comment>
