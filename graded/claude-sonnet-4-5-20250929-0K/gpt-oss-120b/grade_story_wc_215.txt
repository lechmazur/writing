<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The recluse's motivation to preserve the weight of unspoken words is stated but never dramatized through concrete choices under pressure. His gazing and tracing are purely observational acts with no visible cost or internal contradiction. The character remains static throughout, performing contemplative gestures rather than making decisions that foreclose paths. No embodied emotion or micro-choices under competing pressures emerge.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The story lacks clear causality; events accumulate as lyric description without a dramatized change in options or knowledge. The ending shows the recluse placing the box on a pedestal and light fracturing—no decisive change, no visible cost that forecloses a path. The lens appears Accumulative/Textural, yet no meaningful tightening or cadence shift reweights the dominant stake. Orientation (who, where, when) arrives late and remains abstract ("the world had turned to ash") without concrete anchors by ~120 words, triggering the Orientation Test penalty of −0.4.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The abandoned beekeeping oasis and scorched wasteland are evocatively described but remain postcard backdrops. The stained glass box and hives are mentioned repeatedly yet never constrain a choice or alter tactics. Spatial choreography is vague—where exactly is the pedestal, the house, the hives in relation to one another? The setting provides atmosphere but does not pressure the character's actions at any key beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>No on-page escalation or tightening occurs. The dominant stake—preserving the weight of unspoken words—is declared but never tested by a choice that narrows options. The recluse performs the same contemplative gazing throughout with no reversal, no complication that forces a trade-off, and no visible cost. The final act of placing the box and aligning it with the sun is ceremonial, not a decision under pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The theme of silence, memory, and covenant emerges through recurring images (bees, ghosts, stained glass, honey) and the piece resists overt moralizing. However, the final paragraph edges toward thematic summary ("the astonished recluse who had become a guardian of silence") rather than letting the image speak. The covenant motif is introduced and reiterated but never concretely tested, so the thematic weight remains abstract rather than earned through specific on-page struggle.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The prose maintains a consistent lyric register with elevated diction ("mute eloquence," "tangled covenant," "kaleidoscope of colors") that fits the tone but becomes rhythmically repetitive. Sentence stems recur ("He would gaze," "He understood," "He remained") and the syntactic pattern flattens under its own weight. The voice is singular and stable, but POV distance is oddly detached—events unfold as tableau rather than lived perception. No dialogue is present to judge.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Template cadence pervades: "The box…," "He…," "The ghosts…" cycle in predictable patterns across the piece. Paraphrase loops appear ("the weight of unspoken words" echoed in "mute eloquence," "silent conversation," "unspoken," "never spoken"). Stock metaphors accumulate without fresh particulars: "calm of a stone lake," "veil," "dust on his palms." Filter verbs stack in contemplative beats ("believed," "understood," "felt," "seemed"). These artifacts dull momentum and disallow 9+ globally. Deduction: −1.2 in Q7 for pervasive template cadence and loop density.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The premise—a recluse guarding a covenant through silence in a post-apocalyptic oasis—combines familiar elements (guardian, sacred object, wasteland) without transformation. The ghost-visibility hook is ornamental, not integral to the character's choices. The emotional arc could transfer to any guardian-and-relic setup with minimal edits. The lyric style is competent but the synthesis lacks a non-obvious angle or risk that would elevate originality.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The "astonished recluse" is named early and present throughout but makes no key decision. His gazing and tracing are observation without cost. He places the box on the pedestal at the end, a ceremonial gesture rather than a choice that alters tactics. Label-only trait with minimal causal work; caps at 3.8 for swappability and −0.3 for ornamental use.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The stained glass box appears early, is gazed at repeatedly, traced in a middle beat, lifted gently, placed on a pedestal at closure, and sheds a tear of amber that seals the covenant. Present in setup, development, and payoff—three gates met. However, the box is never used to constrain a choice or enable a tactic under pressure; it is described and handled but does not drive causality. Score ~6.1 for all-gate presence and closure participation without causal pressure or visible cost tied to its use.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The "tangled covenant" is mentioned early, explained as a pact between man, bee, and spirit, and referenced at closure when the amber tear seals it anew. It frames the thematic question but never shapes an on-page choice or tactic. The protagonist does not wrestle with breaking versus keeping the covenant; he simply honors it throughout. Present in setup and payoff, but missing development constraint. Score ~4.3 for functional presence without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Tranquilly perceptive" is labeled early ("his eyes held the calm of a stone lake," "tranquilly perceptive, noting each ripple") and reiterated at the end ("eyes still tranquilly perceptive") but never constrains or enables an action. It describes his manner without cost or trade-off. Label-only; no visible mechanics. Score 2.8 for ornamental use.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Gaze" recurs throughout: he gazes at the box each dawn, his gaze lingers on the stained glass, and he is described as "ready to gaze through clues." Present early and at closure. However, gazing is passive observation; no major turn traces to the act of gazing as a choice under pressure. The final placement and alignment of the box is a distinct action from gazing. Score ~5.9 for pervasive presence and closure linkage without driving a key turn.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Through contextual clues" is signaled early ("searching for meaning through contextual clues hidden in its colors") and demonstrated when he traces a ruby line that matches a beekeeper symbol. Present in setup and one middle beat; method matters to his discovery of the covenant's meaning. Missing strong closure participation—the final act is alignment, not clue-reading. Score ~4.7 for functional mid-scene use without closure pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The abandoned beekeeping oasis in a scorched wasteland is established in the opening lines and revisited throughout (cracked hives, withered melons, ash). It provides vivid atmosphere and the covenant's origin (beekeepers' promise). At closure, "the oasis breathed" and "the scorched wasteland seemed to soften," a lyric reprise that reweights the setting. Setup and payoff present; development weak—setting does not constrain a middle choice. Score ~5.5 for early seed and final reprise with cost implied in the image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"After ghosts become visible" is stated in the opening and ghosts appear throughout, drifting and swirling. The timeframe marker is present but does not tighten decisions or tactics. The ghosts are passive observers; their visibility does not create urgency or a live clock. Score ~3.6 for functional presence without pressure or escalation tied to the time-state.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The motivation "to preserve the weight of unspoken words" is stated early ("his motivation was to preserve that weight") and guides his contemplative stance. It appears at closure ("his role was not to speak the words, but to hold them"). Setup and payoff present; however, the motivation is never dramatized through a conflicted choice where preserving silence costs him something tangible. Told rather than tested. Score ~5.3 for clear presence and closure linkage without on-page friction or cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Mute eloquence" is named explicitly twice and enacted throughout via the silent conversation, unspoken words, and the recluse's wordless gestures. The tone is coherent and modulates subtly as pressure accumulates toward the final image where "mute eloquence of the desert's breath" charges the closure. Setup, development (consistent application), and payoff all present. The tone does essential thematic work. Score ~6.4 for strong integration across the arc and closure charge, held back by lack of a visible cost tied specifically to the tone's constraint.</comment>
