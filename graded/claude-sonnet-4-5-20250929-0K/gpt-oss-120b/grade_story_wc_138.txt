<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The immortal's boredom is declared but never dramatized through contradictory impulses or embodied micro-choices under pressure. Interiority remains abstract ("eyes heavy with centuries of ennui," "quiet awe") without character-particular texture or visible struggle. The final "goodbye to his former emptiness" reads as label-only transformation rather than earned change through prior causality. The twin encounter offers potential for internal conflict but dissolves into exposition rather than dramatized friction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within acceptable range. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with the amulet fragment threading through beats, but the closure effect—"goodbye to his former emptiness"—is told rather than shown with legible cost on the page. The spatial mutiny and corridor sequence provide pressure, but the resolution ("no longer bored") asserts change without a decisive image or action that makes the before/after felt. Cost remains conceptual and oblique rather than undeniable.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The prismatic escondite and magnetic fields supply vivid, voice-consistent detail throughout. The amulet fragment constrains the immortal's choice to follow it, and the spatial reconfiguration shapes the journey. However, setting functions more as atmosphere than as a resource that directly alters tactics at closure; the final "serene vista" is outcome rather than constraint. Micro-setting (the fragment against throat, magnetic seam) charges mid-beats but not the ending image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—escaping boredom by discovering what lies after goodbye—is signaled early. The corridor sequence provides accumulative pressure, but escalation remains textural rather than tightening options with visible cost. The twin's whispered insight offers deepening, yet the immortal's final "quiet resolve" and forward step lack a trade-off or foreclosed path. Pressure coheres but does not force a choice with legible price on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The theme of goodbye as transition rather than ending emerges through image and event. The amulet dissolving into dust and the immortal's farewell to emptiness attempt resonance, but the twin's on-page articulation—"When we say goodbye, the world does not end; it folds into another plane"—approaches Thematic Echo by stating the thesis directly. The final image gestures toward transformation but relies on summary ("newfound purpose") rather than non-literal reweighting.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Voice maintains a lyric, elevated register throughout with purposeful compression and rhythmic control. However, diction frequently drifts into stock poetic constructions ("lover's sigh," "silent witness") and template phrasing ("eyes heavy with," "hushed yet promising") that flatten the perceptual signature. The immortal's interior texture remains generic rather than character-particular. Dialogue (the soft voice and twin) is minimal and serves thematic articulation more than character distinction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The prose carries momentum with varied syntax and clear action sequencing, but pervasive figurative density ("magnetic eddies, as if the fragment itself were a heart," "colors shifting from sapphire to amber in a cascade of prismatic echoes") layers metaphor in most sentences of high-pressure beats without pattern-teaching or payoff. Stock constructions ("eyes heavy with," "a lover's sigh," "silent witness") and paraphrase loops ("goodbye," "farewell," "parting" cycle without added pressure) dull line-level propulsion. Template cadence appears in repeated "The [noun] [verb]" stems across consecutive sentences. Deduct −0.8 for density and coherence issues in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The premise—immortal seeks meaning through a cursed fragment during a solar storm—combines familiar elements (bored immortal, magical artifact, dimensional travel) without fresh synthesis or transformation. The spatial mutiny and magnetic corridors offer conceptual novelty, but execution remains abstract and ornamental. Emotional beats (boredom → curiosity → purpose) follow a predictable arc without non-obvious inflection. The twin reflection and dissolution of the amulet gesture toward originality but land as symbolic convenience rather than earned inevitability.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The immortal initiates pursuit of the fragment and steps through the doorway, shaping two turns. However, the twin encounter and final step forward feel passive; the immortal observes and receives insight rather than making choices that narrow options. Early signal and beat involvement present, but agency and cost remain weak.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The amulet fragment appears early, pulses in rhythm with magnetic fields, clings to the throat, and dissolves at closure, reweighting meaning. It enables the doorway and pulls the immortal forward, shaping at least two distinct beats. However, specificity is limited—its cursed properties remain vague—and it resolves a journey it helped create without visible tradeoff tied directly to its use.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Spatial mutiny is named and visualized through walls rippling, rooms rearranging, and corridors forming. It creates the lattice the immortal navigates and ceases at closure. Present across setup, middle, and ending, it shapes the journey but does not constrain a choice with cost; the immortal follows rather than wrestling with spatial instability.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>Dimensionally aware is mentioned once ("though dimensionally aware, felt a tug") without on-page demonstration or cost. It does not enable a tactic, constrain an action, or return at closure. Label-only trait with no causal work.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Intrigue is declared as the immortal's purpose and drives him to reach for the fragment and step through the doorway. Present in setup and propelling the journey, but the concept remains abstract; no specific act of puzzle-solving or discovery shapes a turn with visible cost. Swappable with "curiosity" or "desire."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Magnetic fields are signaled early (humming, eddies, resonance), wrap around the immortal's skin, form the doorway, and translate his curiosity at a key beat. They shape the journey's mechanics and appear in the closure sequence. However, their function is atmospheric; the immortal does not manipulate or struggle against them, and the method does not constrain a choice with cost.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The prismatic escondite is vividly rendered with violet and sapphire walls that shift to amber and glow at closure. It frames the opening and reappears as "silent witness" at the end, creating lyric resonance. However, it supplies atmosphere rather than resources or constraints; the immortal drifts through it without the setting altering tactics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The solar storm is present in setup (battering the outer world, spilling the fragment), mentioned mid-story (ozone scent, low thunder), and reaches zenith at closure. It provides ambient pressure and thematic charge but does not tighten a decision or impose a ticking clock that alters the immortal's moves.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The desire to discover what happens after goodbye is named early, whispered by the amulet, and drives the immortal to step forward. It appears across setup, middle pursuit, and ending ("learning what lies after goodbye"). However, it is told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants or visible cost; the immortal follows curiosity without friction or sacrifice tied to this specific motivation.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Hushed thunder recurs throughout (low rumble, hushed yet promising, quiet awe, soft voice, whispered goodbye) and modulates with pressure, intensifying at the storm's zenith and settling into serenity at closure. Tone coheres and charges the final image. However, the pairing of "hushed" and "thunder" risks oxymoron without clear perceptual grounding; the effect is more decorative than functionally constraining.</comment>
