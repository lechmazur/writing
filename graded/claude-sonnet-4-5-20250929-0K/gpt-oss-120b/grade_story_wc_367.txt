<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Mira remains abstract despite her centuries-old backstory claim; no contradictory impulses or embodied emotion appear in scene. The storm herald is a cipher whose laughter is asserted but never dramatized through micro-choices. Both characters operate as symbols executing ritual steps rather than individuals under pressure, and the final vow "I will guide the dawn" reads as a label rather than an earned stance with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The Orientation Test fails: who Mira is, her relationship to the herald, and the stakes of the ritual remain vague past 120 words, never anchored in concrete causality. The "otherworldly routine" is declared but never dramatized as a problem or constraint that narrows options. The ending gesture—raising the lantern and whispering a vow—offers no legible before/after change in Mira's situation or knowledge; the "new dawn" and "shadowed brilliance" are asserted themes, not a Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with visible cost on the page. The drive lens remains ambiguous throughout: events accumulate without causal linkage or a situational stance crystallization.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The emerald lighthouse, basalt steps, and sapphire currents supply vivid color but remain postcard description; none constrains a choice or alters tactics. The glass lantern wick and prism are handled across beats, but spatial choreography is vague—where the cairn sits relative to the lighthouse, how the beam physically travels underwater, and the mechanics of "total internal reflection" are never grounded in action. The setting supplies atmosphere but does not pressure the ritual or outcome.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"to shape a new dawn using ancient shadows"—is declared but never tested by opposition or cost. No reversal narrows options; Mira and the herald perform their ritual without friction, and the storm obligingly steers itself. The newspaper-falling condition is met off-page with no dramatized consequence, and the final vow carries no legible trade-off or forfeited path. Escalation is ornamental: beams splitting, waves turning silver, constellations rearranging—all spectacle without pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Theme is stated rather than earned: "the world would not end, but would be reborn in shadowed brilliance" is meta-commentary, not a resonant answer emerging from concrete action. The "Shadowed elation" tone and "ancient shadows" motif are repeated as labels without accruing new meaning. The final image—"strange, joyous melancholy"—is asserted rather than felt, and the philosophical claim about prophecy and renewal floats above the events instead of growing from Mira's specific struggle.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Third-person narration maintains stable distance, but voice lacks perceptual signature: Mira's centuries of experience never shape her diction or noticing. Dialogue is minimal and functional; the herald's laughter is told, not shown in rhythm or word choice. Register drifts into elevated abstraction ("phosphorescent pulse," "living serpent of light") that does not anchor in Mira's specific mind, and the final paragraph's "strange, joyous melancholy" reads as narrator commentary rather than filtered perception.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops appear throughout: "green stone walls humming" and "green walls humming a chorus of renewal" restate without pressure; "the lighthouse beam" is repeated in template cadence across multiple paragraphs. Stock metaphors ("living serpent of light," "chorus of silver syllables") pile up without clarity, and the prism mechanics—"total internal reflection"—are named but never shown in concrete action. Filter-verb stacks ("seemed," "felt") dull immediacy in key beats. Information density is low; many lines offer color without advancing causality or choice.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>The lighthouse ritual, storm-steering, and dawn-shaping combine familiar fantasy tropes without transformation. The "last print newspaper" condition is a quirky detail but does not grow from world logic or character need. Emotional specificity is absent; Mira's purpose and the herald's paradox of "joy and mourning" are declared, not dramatized through lived detail or a non-obvious moral calculus. The ending recycles its own imagery ("Emerald lighthouse under stars") without fresh inflection.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>The Laughing storm herald appears in the opening, participates in the ritual, and nods at the end, but his choices never create a turn. He arrives, collaborates without friction, and validates Mira's vow. His laughter is asserted repeatedly but never embodied in dialogue or a decision with cost. Introduced early but remains ornamental; swappable with any assistant figure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The Glass lantern wick is carried, lifted, cradled, and feeds the prism across multiple beats. It appears early, recurs in the middle ritual, and is raised in the final vow. However, its evolving state or unique properties never constrain a choice or alter tactics; it functions as a light source without causal pressure or a reweighted return. Present in all three gates but remains a tool rather than a stake.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Otherworldly routine is named in the opening third ("a pattern that only the storm could unlock") but the steps are performed without friction or dramatized constraint. The ritual's mechanics—redirecting the beam inward—do not shape Mira's tactics or force a trade-off. The concept echoes thematically but does not create a middle choice or closure consequence; the routine is executed, not tested.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Accidentally prophetic appears once in the middle: Mira realizes the symbols "were Accidentally prophetic, predicting storms that had not yet formed." This realization prompts urgency ("We must act now") but does not constrain an on-page action or force a visible trade-off. The trait is told, not shown through a choice with cost, and does not return at closure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Steer is the ritual's core action: Mira and the herald redirect the lighthouse beam inward, the beam becomes a "living serpent," and they steer the storm toward the hidden reef. The action spans setup, middle, and ending, shaping at least two beats. However, steering is unopposed and costless; removing the verb "steer" would not break the logic if replaced with "guide" or "direct." Present in all gates but lacks specificity and causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>Through total internal reflection is named once in the middle ("Using a crystal prism, they redirected light through total internal reflection") but the mechanics are never shown or tested. The method does not shape an attempt, fail, or force a tactical adjustment. It appears as a technical label rather than a dramatized means; easily omitted without structural impact.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Emerald lighthouse under stars is the opening anchor and closing image, framing the story. The green walls "hum" in both instances, recharging the initial motif. However, the lighthouse's physical layout—basalt steps, the hidden heart of the ocean, the cairn on the cliffs—never constrains a choice or alters Mira's tactics. Setting is vivid but does not pressure the ritual or supply a resource that affects outcome. Early setup and closure reprise lift the score above mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>After the last print newspaper appears as a condition in the middle: "The ritual could only be performed After the last print newspaper fell into the sea." The newspaper drifts and dissolves into phosphorescent algae, but the moment is ornamental; no on-page choice or tactic hinges on whether the paper has fallen. The timeframe is declared rather than dramatized as a tightening constraint. Present in middle and ending mentions but functionally inert.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>To shape a new dawn using ancient shadows is Mira's stated purpose, repeated in the opening third and the final vow. However, the desire is never conflicted or tested by a competing want or cost. Mira's choices—performing the ritual, lifting the lantern, whispering the vow—align seamlessly with the goal without friction. The motivation is told and affirmed rather than dramatized through a trade-off or renunciation with visible price.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Shadowed elation is named twice: the herald's eyes glow with it, and the final paragraph declares "a strange, joyous melancholy—a Shadowed elation that would never fade." The tone label is asserted but not embodied in syntax, rhythm, or image. The prose alternates between elevated lyricism and summary without modulating under pressure. The final image restates the phrase rather than charging it with earned weight. Present early and at closure but lacks coherence through beats.</comment>
