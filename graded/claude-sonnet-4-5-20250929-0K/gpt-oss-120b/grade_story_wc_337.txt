<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara's interior life is painted entirely in abstract-poetic language ("interlaced hush," "lucid unrest") rather than concrete, embodied emotion or contradiction. The piece tells us she feels "calm resolve" and "lucid unrest" but never dramatizes a choice under competing pressures or shows her wrestle with a live dilemma. Her actions proceed mechanically—locate knot, pierce, release spirit—without visible cost, hesitation, or trade-off. The final "promise" and her decision to tuck the mask away read as summary rather than earned transformation rooted in prior struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural by design, but the piece never teaches a clear pattern or offers a meaningful tightening. The "closure" is Elara placing the mask on the altar and feeling settled—no decisive change in her options, no visible cost paid, no genuine before/after in her external situation or internal stance. The Orientation Test passes (who/where/when arrive early), but causality is absent: spirits are released in sequence without resistance, complication, or escalation. The final image ("lucid unrest that was, paradoxically, the purest peace") is an abstract claim rather than a charged reconfiguration earned by prior particulars.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The prism sanctuary, starlight, and altar are vividly described with consistent sensory detail (refracted colors, echoing water, hush). However, setting remains scenic backdrop rather than constraint: Elara could perform this ritual in any mystical space with minimal rewrite. The tapestry needle and fisherman's net do charge the final image by returning in the closure paragraph, lifting the score modestly. Spatial choreography is clean, but no environmental feature narrows her options or shapes a key choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The stated stake—grounding restless spirits—is clear and signaled early, but pressure never escalates or tightens. Each knot loosens without resistance; no spirit refuses to depart, no thread resists the needle, no memory demands more than Elara is willing to give. The lone "micro turn" is spirits rising and sinking back, which does not narrow options or alter her tactics. No on-page cost appears: her months-long restoration is told in summary, and the final act (placing the mask) requires no sacrifice or difficult choice. Under an Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening or cadence shift is required—this piece offers only linear repetition.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Theme of silence as sanctuary emerges through recurring "hush" imagery and the contrast between noise and stillness, but the final paragraph states the theme directly ("silence, when tended, can become a sanctuary itself") rather than earning it through image or reweighted action. The "interlaced hush" and "lucid unrest" are invoked repeatedly as labels without dramatized tension or cost. No genuine ambiguity or counter-reading is invited; the piece declares that Elara's work "holds for generations" and "the purest peace" without complication. The thematic echo in the penultimate paragraph ("reminder that even the loudest grief can be tamed") feels sermonizing rather than emergent.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Elara with consistent psychic distance and no head-hopping. Voice carries a lyric, elevated register ("interlaced hush," "exhume," "lucid unrest") that remains internally consistent but drifts into thesaurus-itis and abstract diction unsuited to moment-by-moment perception under pressure. Perceptual signature is generic mystical rather than character-specific: Elara notices prism colors and pulse but offers no idiosyncratic filtering. No dialogue is present. The prose reads as committee lyric—beautifully textured in places but lacking a singular, grounded perspective.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Figurative language ("dark river," "pale fish," "muted hymn") is consistent and mostly coherent, but density is high across nearly every sentence without variation in pressure or payoff. Paraphrase loops abound: "hush that accumulates silence" is restated as "weight that pressed gently," "invisible weight," "veil of calm," and "lucid unrest...purest peace" with minimal added meaning. Template cadence appears in mid-section beats: "As she loosened...," "One by one...," "As the last knot...." Stock metaphors (prism refracting light, spirits as fish) and elevated diction ("exhume," "interlaced," "lucid unrest") clash with the lack of concrete action. Information density is low; many sentences restate atmosphere rather than advancing event or choice.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>The broken-mask restorer premise and prism sanctuary offer a fresh surface, but the emotional and plot arc (solitary artisan completes ritual task, feels peace) is a familiar template executed without transformation. The "interlaced hush" and "lucid unrest" phrases feel inventive on first encounter but are repeated as labels rather than explored through contradiction or cost. No turn or inflection surprises; every beat unfolds as the opening promises. The piece prioritizes aesthetic texture over narrative risk: the restoration succeeds without complication, and the final image restates rather than reweights prior material.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her occupation (broken mask restorer) frames the premise, satisfying setup. Her action—loosening knots with the needle—shapes multiple beats, satisfying development. She places the mask on the altar at closure, satisfying payoff. However, her choices do not create turns; she executes a predetermined ritual without hesitation, adaptation, or visible cost. Her "promise" and "resolve" are told rather than dramatized through a difficult decision. Swappable with any solitary mystical artisan; the specific "broken mask restorer" detail is cosmetic. Base 3.0 + early signal +0.5 + closure presence +0.4 − ornamental role −0.7 = 3.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The tapestry needle appears in the opening paragraph (setup), is used to loosen knots across the middle section (development in multiple beats), and "rests beside" the mask at closure (payoff). Its "runes that promised to accumulate silence" and pulsing heartbeat add specificity. However, its mechanics are not tested or constrained—any magical tool could perform the same function with minor edits. It does not narrow Elara's options or face a challenge; it works perfectly every time. Base 3.0 + early signal +0.6 + two beats +0.9 + closure mention +0.5 + specificity +0.4 − swappability −0.6 = 5.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Interlaced hush" is named in the opening paragraph, recurs as a label throughout, and is sealed "in a veil of calm" at closure (three-gate present). It is described as a quality that "stitches the night" and "accumulated" by the needle, giving it thematic presence. However, it never constrains a choice or alters Elara's tactics on the page; it remains atmospheric rather than causal. The concept is repeated often but functions as tone rather than stake-shaping mechanism. Base 3.0 + three gates +0.8 + closure mention +0.4 + specificity +0.3 − ornamental use −0.7 − label-only −0.3 = 4.1 (capped at 4.6 for missing middle development of causal constraint).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>The needle's ability to "accumulate silence" is stated early and described as a "pulse" and "weight" throughout. It is mentioned at closure when the sanctuary is "sealed in a veil of calm." However, the attribute is never dramatized as a constraint or enabler with cost—Elara never struggles to gather enough silence, never risks losing it, never trades one silence for another. It is purely descriptive, not causal. Base 3.0 + early mention +0.4 + closure reference +0.3 − label-only −0.6 − no on-page cost −0.5 = 3.4 (capped at 3.4 for missing middle development).</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Exhume" appears in the opening as Elara's summoned task and recurs when she works to "exhume the grief tangled in the net." The word is specific and thematically charged. It frames the middle action (loosening knots to release spirits) and is referenced at closure ("exhume the hush once more"). However, the act of exhumation is not tested or resisted; spirits emerge without struggle. Swappable with "release" or "free" with minor tonal shift. Base 3.0 + early signal +0.6 + two beats +0.9 + closure echo +0.5 + specificity +0.5 − swappability −0.6 − no dramatized cost −0.7 = 5.6 (capped at 4.6 for introduced concept but treated as present due to early verbal cue; rounding 5.6).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The fisherman's net is introduced early, stretched across the altar, and described with specificity ("tangled fibers whispering stories"). Elara unravels its knots throughout the middle section—this is the method by which she releases spirits. At closure, the net "collapsed into a single thread" wound around the mask. The method is irreplaceable in the story's logic and drives multiple beats. However, no knot resists or complicates her work; the mechanics are frictionless. Base 3.0 + early signal +0.7 + multiple beats +1.4 + closure linkage +1.2 + specificity +0.6 − no friction/cost −0.7 = 6.2.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The prism sanctuary under starlight is vividly rendered (refracted colors, echoing water, walls that "breathe") and present in all three gates. It provides consistent atmosphere and charges the final image with "muted colors" and "soft gradient." However, it never constrains Elara's choices or supplies a resource that alters outcome—any mystical chamber would serve the same function. The setting is postcard-like rather than pressure-creating. Base 3.0 + early anchor +0.7 + closure image +0.9 + vivid detail +0.6 − postcard/ornamental −1.0 − no tactical constraint −0.3 = 4.9.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Sharing a secret" appears in the opening ("a secret across the space, a promise made long ago") and at closure ("a secret shared across time, a promise kept"). The timeframe is thematic rather than mechanical: no clock, no urgent deadline, no tightening window that alters Elara's tactics. The "secret" is exposition—every mask holds a fragment of a soul—not a temporally constrained action. Setup and payoff present, but middle development absent. Base 3.0 + early mention +0.4 + closure reprise +0.5 − no temporal pressure −0.8 − thematic only −0.5 = 2.6.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The motivation "to ground restless spirits" is stated early and repeated: spirits "tugging at the edges," then "found a place to rest" at closure. Elara's task is clear and her actions align with this desire. However, the motivation is never conflicted or tested—no spirit resists, no cost is dramatized, no alternative tempts her. She wants this, does it, succeeds, feels peace. No friction between want and obstacle. Base 3.0 + early signal +0.7 + closure satisfaction +0.8 + coherent alignment +0.5 − told-only, no dramatized conflict −1.0 − no cost −0.3 = 4.7.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Lucid unrest" is named explicitly in the text ("a lucid unrest, a calm yet uneasy feeling") and recurs at closure ("settled into a lucid unrest that was...the purest peace"). The oxymoron is sustained across the piece through descriptions of stillness and vibration, calm and yearning. Tone modulates gently from echoing unrest to "veil of calm." However, pressure never truly shifts the tone; it remains a single static aesthetic rather than dynamically charging the final image through contrast. Base 3.0 + early signal +0.6 + closure reprise +0.9 + coherence +0.7 + specificity +0.5 − static mood −0.8 − label rather than felt shift −0.6 = 5.3.</comment>
