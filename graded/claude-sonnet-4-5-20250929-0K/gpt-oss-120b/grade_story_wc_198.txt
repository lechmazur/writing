<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The saxophonist remains an abstraction throughout—his actions are stated but never embodied through contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. The backstory fragment about his father teaching "the language of fog" offers decoration rather than a micro-choice that alters present tactics. Interior experience is largely absent; we never feel him weigh options or register the cost of his act. The ending renunciation ("his eyes reflecting the softly shimmering colors") reads as label-only rather than a forfeiture earned by prior on-page struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Orientation Test: who/where/when anchors arrive within tolerance. The piece signals an accumulative/textural lens—imagery and pattern rather than causal linkage—but the closure unit remains ambiguous: is the prophecy dissolved on the page, or only declared dissolved? The final image ("disappeared into legend, his whispered lullaby keeping the prophecy forever quiet") asserts closure rather than demonstrating it with visible cost. Cost Proof Test fails: no exact on-page sentence shows what was forfeited or what tactical option narrowed. Apply −0.6 for cost legibility and cap at mid-band.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The prism atrium, radiant grotto, and fog are vividly rendered and recur across beats, reweighting the atmosphere as the piece progresses. The micro-setting (saxophone, stone, dewdrops) constrains the protagonist's method—whispering rather than roaring—and the final image charges the grotto's hum. Spatial choreography is clean. The setting shapes the dominant stake (preventing the prophecy through place-specific acoustics) and thus clears the 9+ gate test, but the stake itself is abstract, limiting the setting's tactical pressure to a felt rather than decisive constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—hush the prophecy to prevent a storm—is signaled early but remains abstract throughout. No on-page reversal or tightening alters the protagonist's options; he plays, the code dissolves, the valley sleeps. The prophesied storm never materializes as a live threat, so the resolution lacks felt cost. Agency is present (he chooses to whisper, not roar) but the trade-off is declared, not dramatized. The piece never forces a choice between competing goods or shows a visible price paid after a turn that alters later tactics.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through imagery—silence as preservation, music as erasure, fog as mediation—without overt statement. The final image (saxophonist disappearing into legend) offers a resonant but somewhat stock resolution: the solitary artist fading after his work is done. The piece resists platitudes and invites reflection on language, prophecy, and quiet power. However, the thematic question (can silence prevent catastrophe?) is answered tidily rather than reweighted with ambiguity, and the ending leans toward sermonizing ("his whispered lullaby keeping the prophecy forever quiet") in its final assertion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Voice is consistent and carries a distinct lyric register ("each breath a filament of color stretched taut over the silence"), though diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("vested hush," "negative space") that feels imposed rather than character-particular. POV distance is stable third-limited. No dialogue. Perceptual signature is present but generic—many lyric narrators notice dewdrops and mist in similar ways. The piece sustains its register under pressure but does not modulate rhythm or syntax in response to escalation, reading as uniform lyricism throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Overwriting is pervasive: "radiant grotto in mist," "prism atrium in mist," "quietly vivid," "vested hush," and "negative space" recur as ornamental phrases without functional variation, creating a template cadence. Paraphrase loops appear: "He played, not to announce, but to dissolve" restates "to hush a prophecy" without added pressure. Mixed metaphor: "prophecy spoken in code" vs. "hidden in the cadence of ancient drums"—code and cadence are contradictory vehicles. Register drifts into pseudo-philosophical abstraction ("negative space," "vested hush") that clashes with the saxophonist's embodied act. Apply −1.2 for density + coherence + template cadence, disallow 9+ globally, and cap high-band entries at 8.8 per artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The core premise—musician prevents apocalypse through silent music—echoes familiar wizard/artist-as-savior templates without transformation through specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The grotto, prism, fog, and dewdrops are vividly rendered but function as interchangeable lyric ornaments rather than irreplaceable particulars. The prophecy itself is generic ("storm that would drown the valley in a river of fire") and resolved off-page. The transformation test fails: swap "saxophonist" for "flutist" or "grotto" for "temple" and the arc remains unchanged. Derivative Premise Guardrail: apply −0.8 within Q8 for template reliance without earned specificity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The morning fog saxophonist is present throughout and his decision to whisper rather than roar is stated, but the choice does not create a key turn or narrow options with visible cost. He observes, plays, and departs without on-page friction or tactical adjustment. The character appears in the setup, middle, and closure but functions as a vessel for lyric description rather than an agent whose choices drive reversals. Swappable with "morning fog flutist" with minor edits. Late penalties do not apply (present early), but causal pressure and closure linkage are weak. Score in functional-but-replaceable band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The prism atrium in mist appears in setup, middle (refracting the whisper), and closure (fading into horizon), clearing two gates but not three—it is not causally active in the final image, only scenically present. It is handled twice (entrance, refraction) but does not return with reweighted meaning or constrain a choice. Visually vivid yet swappable with "crystal hall" or "glass pavilion" without structural impact. No specific cost tied to the prism itself. Score in functional band, capped by swappability and ornamental closure presence.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Vested hush is introduced mid-story as a thematic label ("each breath became a vested hush") and echoed at closure ("the vested hush settled like a thin veil"), but it never shapes an on-page stake or tactic. The term reads as ornamental rather than a constraint or method that alters options. No specific cost tied to it. Missing setup gate (not present in first third). Decorative mention −0.3, label-only use −0.3, late appearance −0.4. Cap at 2.8 per missing closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>Quietly vivid appears as a descriptor ("the air was quietly vivid," "a quietly vivid hymn," "the softly vivid imprint") but never constrains or enables an on-page action with cost. It functions as a repeated aesthetic label rather than a trait that shapes a choice or trade-off. Missing middle development and closure participation gates. Label-only −0.3, ornamental −0.3, missing closure cap at 2.8. Score 2.6.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Whisper is the protagonist's chosen method, signaled early ("instead of a roar he chose to whisper") and sustained through the middle beats ("his saxophone speak without words, a whisper"). It appears in the closure image ("his whispered lullaby keeping the prophecy forever quiet") and drives the central tactic. However, the choice between whisper and roar is stated rather than tested under pressure; no on-page reversal or cost demonstrates why whispering succeeds where roaring would fail. Clears all three gates but lacks causal pressure that narrows options. Early signal +0.5, closure linkage +0.9, but swappability (hum, murmur) and summary-only resolution −0.6. Score 5.8.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>Through negative space is introduced as lyric phrasing ("the note slipped through negative space," "threaded through the negative space") but never explained or mechanically differentiated from ordinary playing. It appears in middle beats but does not shape attempts or constrain tactics; the protagonist plays, and the prophecy dissolves, with no on-page demonstration of how negative space functions. Missing setup and closure participation gates. Ornamental −0.5, missing closure cap at 2.8, swappability −0.4. Score 2.3.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Radiant grotto in mist is the primary setting, present in setup, middle (glowing with eerie nostalgia, stones humming), and closure (seeming to sigh as he departs). It provides atmospheric pressure and a micro-setting that reflects the protagonist's action. However, it does not supply a resource or constraint that alters a tactical choice; the grotto functions as backdrop rather than obstacle or enabler. Clears all three gates. Early signal +0.6, closure linkage +0.8, but ornamental closure presence (postcard image rather than tactical constraint) −0.5. Score 5.4.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>As dewdrops form appears in the middle ("As dewdrops form, the cold air trembles") and again near closure ("as dewdrops formed like tiny lanterns on the stone"), plus a late micro-image ("A single dewdrop fell from a leaf"). Time is poetic rather than tracked; no tightening clock alters decisions or tactics. The timeframe is vague and untracked, functioning as lyric decoration rather than a pressure mechanism. Missing setup gate (not present in first third), missing middle development (no choice constrained by time), ornamental use −0.5, late first appearance −0.4. Cap at 4.6 per missing setup, apply ornamental and swappability frictions. Score 3.7.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>To hush a prophecy spoken in code is the stated motivation, signaled early ("his motivation was simple yet grave") and sustained through middle beats ("each note an eraser wiping the code from stone"). It appears in closure ("keeping the prophecy forever quiet"). However, the desire is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choices; no on-page friction between want and cost is visible. The prophecy itself remains abstract and off-page (the storm never materializes as a live threat). Clears all three gates. Early signal +0.6, closure linkage +0.8, but summary-only dramatization −0.6, abstract stake −0.4. Score 4.9.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Eerie nostalgia is introduced early ("the radiant grotto glowed with an eerie nostalgia") and recurs in closure ("feeling the eerie nostalgia of all the mornings he had spent hunting silence among fog"). Tone is coherent and modulates subtly from anticipation (opening) to quiet satisfaction (ending), though it remains largely static across turns. The tone charges the final image with a sense of longing and completion. Clears all three gates. Early signal +0.5, closure linkage +0.9, but single static mood (mid-low per guidance) and ornamental reprise (label repeated without reweighting cost) −0.6. Score 5.2.</comment>
