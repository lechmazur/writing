<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The historian's motivation is presented through label-only interiority ("sensitively perceptive," "believing," "reasoning") without contradictory impulses or embodied struggle. His movements remain essentially observation—lifting, pressing, recording—with no decision that forecloses a path or costs him anything visible. The final moment ("feeling that the stories walls have heard are finally being gathered") offers summary satisfaction rather than a choice under pressure. No micro-choices alter present options; the character drifts through a preordained discovery sequence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (historian collecting fragments toward a pattern). Orientation anchors arrive late: "odd historian" and "reclaimed silo library" lack spatial grounding until the tapestry and fire pit appear mid-paragraph; who/where remains hazy past 120 words (−0.4 in Q2, cap Q3 at 7.0 per Orientation Test). Closure unit attempts Resonant Reconfiguration ("displaced axis is not a fracture but a realignment"), but the cost is conceptual assertion only—no visible forfeiture, no tactic change, no felt price on the page. The humming and vibration are atmospheric touches that do not narrow options or charge the final image with undeniable pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Orientation debt applied in Q2 caps this category at 7.0. The silo's vaulted chamber, glyphs, and tapestry fragment are vivid and purposeful, constraining the historian's descent and shaping his final placement of the fragment. Sensory detail (soot, dust, metallic taste, bronze lamplight) is consistent and filtered through the POV. However, spatial choreography in the library level remains vague—shelf layout, fire pit proximity, and stairwell access are not clearly mapped—preventing the micro-setting from fully driving a choice at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("collect the stories walls have heard") is signaled early but never tested. The historian encounters no opposition, makes no trade-off, faces no cost. The descent, the vibration, the glyphs—all comply passively; he simply records. The "realignment" insight is delivered as summary epiphany without a reversal or tightening that forecloses a live option. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure should deepen through pattern-break or cadence shift; here the tone and method remain uniform from opening to close, offering atmospheric drift rather than escalation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Theme (memory, axis, realignment) emerges through repeated images—tapestry, diaries, humming—but remains abstract. The "displaced axis is not a fracture but a realignment" reads as on-the-nose philosophical summary rather than insight earned through struggle. The final image ("stories walls have heard are finally being gathered") recapitulates the opening premise without reweighting it; no new cost or irony charges the closure. The bronze-quiet atmosphere is coherent but does not modulate with pressure, flattening thematic resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Diction is consistent—elevated, slightly archaic ("moth," "gilt thread," "bronze quiet")—and matches the post-apocalyptic scholar milieu. However, perceptual signature is generic: "feeling the weight of each stone," "breathing in the smell of soot" could apply to any sensitive observer. Psychic distance remains static across all beats; no modulation under stress. The prose leans on filter verbs ("he believes," "he reasons," "he feels") that dull immediacy, and repeated template stems ("He lifts," "He writes," "He records") flatten rhythm.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Template cadence pervades: runs of "He [verb]" and "The [noun]" structures across ten consecutive sentences in the middle third (−0.6). Paraphrase loops appear: "the displaced axis" is restated three times within four lines without added pressure (−0.2). Stock metaphors ("flickers like dying embers," "like scorched leaves," "like a low tide") cluster without fresh vehicle logic (−0.4). Information density is low—many sentences do one job only, and several restate the historian's method without advancing situation. Artifacts touch the closure beat ("he records the moment… he adds the new entry"), disallowing 9+ globally and escalating penalty to −1.2 total in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Core premise (post-dream scholar decoding axis via medieval tapestry and burnt diaries) is architecturally interesting but executed through familiar beats: lone archivist, cryptic artifact, vaulted discovery chamber, epiphany-by-fragment. The "displaced axis" remains a label without on-page consequence—no tactic shifts, no world-rule test. The ending retreats to summary satisfaction ("finally being gathered") rather than risking an open or costly image. Transformation test fails: swap "silo" for "tower," "tapestry" for "manuscript," and the arc persists unchanged.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Present throughout but all actions are observational (lift, breathe, match, write, descend, place, record). No decision alters tactics or forecloses a path; the historian is a vessel for discovery rather than an agent under pressure. Swappable with "archivist" or "scholar" with no structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Appears early (setup gate), handled in two beats (unfurling causes humming; pressed against brick yields vibration; placed on central stone triggers chamber shiver—development and payoff gates met). Drives the descent and final placement. However, any medieval artifact with visual markers (scales, curves) could serve the same function; the dragons themselves are ornamental. Score eligible for mid-6s but not higher without irreplaceability or visible cost tied specifically to this tapestry fragment.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Mentioned throughout but remains abstract theme-claim. The "displaced axis" is described (moon slippage, grain spinning, tilt) but never constrains a choice or changes an option on the page. The historian's realization ("not a fracture but a realignment") is summary insight, not a tactical shift. Conceptual presence without causal pressure; swappable with "hidden pattern" or "lost resonance."</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Sensitively perceptive" appears as label only in the opening line. No on-page action demonstrates the trait constraining or enabling a choice with cost. The historian's ability to "feel the weight of each stone" and detect vibrations could be generic scholarly attention. No visible tradeoff between heightened perception and another capacity.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Setup clear ("to probe that mystery"), development present (he probes diaries, presses tapestry, descends, places fragment—two distinct beats), closure linkage via final recording. However, "probe" is broadly enacted through multiple verbs (turn, match, press, descend, place) without a signature method that makes this action irreplaceable. Swappable with "investigate" or "decode" with minor edits. Eligible for low-6s based on beat involvement and closure presence, but lacks the specificity or cost connection for higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Setup early (diaries introduced paragraph three), development (he extracts fragments, discovers pattern, reads axis-mention—two beats), payoff (diaries guide his descent and chamber discovery). The half-burnt state matters: "pages curled like scorched leaves," "line of ink survives"—scarcity shapes what he can learn. However, the mechanics are passive; any fragmentary record could serve. The method enables but does not constrain with felt cost. Eligible for mid-6s on three-gate presence and beat involvement.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Setup clear (silo library introduced early), development (shelves, fire pit, stairwell, vaulted chamber guide his movement—two beats), payoff (final line: "reclaimed silo library breathes"). The vertical structure (descent to hidden chamber) organizes the arc. However, any repurposed vertical ruin could serve; the silo's grain-storage function is mentioned once ("grain… spun like a compass rose") without affecting tactics. Micro-setting (tapestry cradle, central stone) does pressure the placement beat. Eligible for mid-5s on presence and modest causal role.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Appears in opening clause ("after the last human dream is dreamt") and once mid-story ("collective dream"). Does not tighten decisions or create urgency; no clock, no competing demand. The post-apocalyptic frame is atmospheric context only. Swappable with "after the collapse" or "in the final days" with no structural change. Present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Stated early ("to collect the stories walls have heard") and echoed in final line ("stories… are finally being gathered"). Setup and payoff gates met. However, the desire is never conflicted or tested—no competing pull, no cost, no moment where he must choose between collecting and another want. The motivation frames the arc but does not drive a decision under pressure. Told-only with no friction between want and cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Bronze quiet" appears three times (opening metaphor, mid-story cadence, final paragraph), creating a lyric reprise. The tone is coherent and matches the contemplative, post-collapse milieu. However, it does not modulate with pressure—the historian's discovery of the vibrating chamber carries the same hushed register as his initial shelf-browsing. A single static mood that reappears at closure without reweighting prior material. Eligible for low-5s on purposeful recurrence but lacks the charge or cost connection for higher bands.</comment>
