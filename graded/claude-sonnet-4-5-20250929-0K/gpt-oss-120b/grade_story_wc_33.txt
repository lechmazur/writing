<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Milo's interiority is abstract and label-driven throughout ("respectfully rebellious gait," "quiet purpose"), never embodied through contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. The mission to "foster a fragile peace by linking absences" remains a telling assertion with no dramatized internal conflict or visible cost that forecloses a path. His actions—slipping the envelope, lifting the bottle—read as moves in service of the concept rather than character-specific decisions shaped by fear or want. The ending claims weight lifted ("the weight of his respectful rebellion ease into a quiet purpose") but offers no on-page renunciation or alteration earned by prior causality.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed: "disputed territory mailman" and "smuggling drone border" land without spatial anchors (who controls what, where the line runs) until the arcade interior emerges mid-paragraph, costing ~−0.4. The drive lens oscillates between Accumulative (storm-as-motif, neon texture) and Causal (storm blinds drone, envelope delivered) without a taught pattern, forcing Hybrid inference but the ending dissolves into abstract claim ("broken promises could heal") rather than a decisive image that reweights prior material. Closure reads as Conceptual Repricing in intent—the storm "sealed" becomes "calm sky," voids honored—but the cost is asserted ("dust of old grudges" washed away) not legibly paid on the page; no option is foreclosed, no tactic visibly altered by what Milo surrenders. The two-drone salute and rival nod gesture toward a change, but the rival's arrival is coincidental (not forced by Milo's prior choice) and the peace remains offstage promise rather than on-page consequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The cobalt arcade is vivid in texture—neon, rows of machines, cracked floor tiles—but remains postcard backdrop until the storm's rain "seeped into the cracked floor tiles" in the final third, a moment that gestures toward environment shaping outcome but arrives too late and too abstractly to constrain a prior choice. Spatial choreography is vague: the "central console," drone hatch, and Milo's position relative to the border are never anchored, making the climax (bottle set, drone retreats, envelope slipped) float rather than land with tactile specificity. The "day's lone mail drop" timeframe is mentioned twice but never tightens a decision; the twilight setting modulates atmosphere without pressing Milo's window of action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—fostering peace between factions—is declared early but never tested by an on-page obstacle that Milo's choice narrows or trades off. The storm blinds the drone's sensors, forcing retreat, but this is the bottle's effect, not Milo's agency under pressure; he lifts and sets it without visible cost or a competing fear. The rival drone's arrival and nod read as coincidental validation rather than a reversal earned by Milo's risk. No price is paid: the bottle remains "a calm sky" in his coat, absences are "linked" by assertion, and the ending claims hope delivered without showing what Milo forfeited to cross the border or what tactic the storm's use foreclosed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The theme of "linking absences" and "broken promises heal[ing]" recurs in dialogue-free narration and the envelope's vow, but emerges through prompt-label repetition ("We honor the voids, we mend the cracks") rather than dramatized particulars that reweight prior material. The storm-in-a-bottle shifts from "roiling clouds" to "calm sky," a purposeful image arc, but its thematic charge—hope, fragile peace—is asserted in the final paragraph ("even a storm confined can still rain hope") rather than earned by a non-literal callback that makes the reader feel the cost. The piece gestures toward complexity (voids acknowledged, grudges washed away) but resolves into tidy mutual recognition without friction or counter-reading.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Milo with consistent psychic distance and no head-hopping. Voice carries a lyric, elevated register throughout ("banner of surrender," "metallic bird," "muted silver") that remains coherent but does not modulate under peak pressure; the storm-climax and rival-salute beats maintain the same ornate diction as the opening, flattening urgency. Perceptual signature is generic: Milo notices neon, hush, and horizon in ways that could belong to any contemplative observer. The prose is clean and grammatical but syntactically uniform, with many long sentences that embed multiple clauses in parallel cadence, creating a drumbeat rhythm that never shifts for action or stakes.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade: "respectfully rebellious gait" / "respectful rebellion"; "brittle hush" recurs three times without evolving; "cobalt arcade" / "cobalt light" / "cobalt lights" cycles mechanically. Template cadence dominates the middle third—"The bottle pulsed... Milo lifted... He set... When the drone hovered... In that fleeting silence"—with identical subject-verb stems across seven consecutive sentences, triggering −0.6. Figurative density is high without pattern-teaching: "banner of surrender," "metallic bird," "halo that pulsed," "frightened sparrow," "quiet thunder" stack within two paragraphs, mixing vehicles (banner, bird, halo) without coherence, costing another −0.4 for register drift and metaphor muddle. Information density is low; scaffolding like "He knew that broken promises could only heal where the voids between them were acknowledged, a truth he pursued to find where broken promises heal" restates the mission without advancing it, and the final paragraph summarizes theme rather than trusting the image. Artifacts touch the closure beat ("a reminder that every frontier... can be crossed with care"), disallowing 9+ globally and capping Q7 at 8.7 before deductions.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>The mailman-as-peacemaker premise and storm-in-a-bottle conceit gesture toward freshness, but the execution leans on stock metaphor (storm = hope, arcade = neutral ground, drone = border enforcement) without a non-obvious synthesis or turn. The ending's mutual salute and calm sky resolve the conflict through convenient timing (rival arrives exactly when truce is sealed) rather than a risky choice that grows from Milo's flaw or fear. Emotional specificity is absent; Milo's "quiet purpose" and "fragile bridge" remain abstract universals that could transfer unchanged to any mediator in any disputed zone, failing the transformation test.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Milo is present throughout and his occupation (mailman) frames the mission, but his choices are passive execution of a pre-set plan rather than decisions that create turns. He slips through doors, lifts the bottle, sets it, steps back—actions that follow the concept's script without visible cost or a competing want that he must trade off. The rival's nod validates him but is not earned by a mid-scene choice that altered tactics. Present and functional but swappable with any neutral mediator; the "disputed territory" modifier adds flavor without constraining a key choice.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The bottle appears early (paragraph one), is handled in two beats (lifted to blind the drone, rain seeps into tiles), and returns in the final image ("now a calm sky" in his coat), satisfying the gate model's three touches. Its specific property—storm sealed by glass—enables the tactic (flash blinds optics) and the thematic payoff (confined storm rains hope). However, the mechanics are vague (how does setting it on a console produce targeted rain on tiles?), and the cost is absent: Milo retrieves the bottle intact, nothing foreclosed. Strong lyric reprise but mid-band causal work; irreplaceability is moderate (any disabling device could blind the drone).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The smuggling drone border is named early and the drone's approach creates the story's single pressure beat, but the concept remains backdrop rather than shaping tactics. We never learn what is smuggled, why the factions fight, or how the border's rules constrain Milo's choices. The storm disables one drone's sensors, but this is the bottle's work, not Milo navigating border protocol with visible cost. The concept anchors setting and nominal stakes but could be replaced with any contested boundary without altering the plot or character work; functional but generic.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Respectfully rebellious" is declared in paragraph one ("respectfully rebellious gait") and echoed at the end ("the weight of his respectful rebellion ease"), but remains a label without on-page demonstration. No beat shows Milo balancing respect (obeying a rule, deferring to authority) against rebellion (breaking a norm with cost). His coat "flapping like a banner of surrender" and his walk as "a quiet contest" are metaphors for the trait, not actions it enables or constrains. Label-only use across two mentions, no visible tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Foster" (foster a fragile peace) is stated as mission in paragraph one and executed when Milo slips the truce envelope into the hatch, a move that precipitates the rival's arrival and nod. This action drives the ending's handshake closure and could not be easily swapped (delivering a threat or goods would invert the arc). However, the fostering is assertion-driven—the envelope's vow "linked the absent promises"—rather than demonstrated through a sequence where Milo's tactic visibly brings both sides to the table. One causal beat at closure, moderate irreplaceability, but the mechanics (why does one envelope foster peace?) remain offstage.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"Linking absences" is named twice (paragraph one mission statement, envelope vow "We honor the voids") but its mechanics are never dramatized. The method does not shape an attempt or constrain a choice; it arrives as thematic claim in the final third without prior use. The rain washing "dust of old grudges" gestures toward the method's effect, but this is metaphor, not a legible process Milo employs on the page. Summary-only, late, and swappable with any reconciliation language; ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The cobalt arcade is anchored early (paragraph one), its neon and machines supply vivid atmosphere, and the cracked floor tiles receive the storm's rain in a climactic beat, creating one setting-as-resource moment that charges the thematic payoff. The arcade's status as neutral ground between factions is implied but never tested (no faction member enters to challenge Milo). Spatial specifics—where the console sits, how close the border hovers—remain vague, weakening the drone encounter's choreography. Early signal, one causal beat (tiles/rain), closure linkage via final image ("cobalt lights fading"), but lacks the persistent constraint or tactical pressure that would push it higher.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"At the day's lone mail drop" bookends the story (paragraph one and final paragraph) but does not function as a ticking clock. No deadline pressures Milo's choices; the twilight setting is atmospheric rather than urgent. The phrase recurs as lyric frame without reweighting the dominant stake or altering tactics. Functional lyric reprise but does not tighten decisions; time is backdrop, not driver.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The motivation "to find where broken promises heal" is declared in paragraph one and restated in the final paragraph ("broken promises could heal when people dared to link the absences"), framing the mission. However, it is never dramatized as a conflicted want competing with fear or cost. Milo pursues the goal without visible friction—no moment where healing risks his safety, reputation, or a personal attachment. The motivation is told and executed but not embodied through micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. Present across setup and ending, but frictionless; trends functional but not high.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Brittle hush" is named three times (paragraph one arcade atmosphere, rain's quality, final image of quiet purpose) and coheres as the story's dominant register: muted, fragile, contemplative. The tone modulates minimally—remaining elegiac even during the drone flash—but the final image ("quiet thunder reminding him") successfully charges the hush with lingering tension, reweighting the opening's brittle quality into earned calm. Coherent through turns, purposeful reprise at closure, and contributes to thematic resonance; lacks only the dynamic range that would elevate it further.</comment>
