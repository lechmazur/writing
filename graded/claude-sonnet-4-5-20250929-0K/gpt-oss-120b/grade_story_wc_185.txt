<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The mapkeeper's motivation is clear and consistent, but his interiority remains abstract—"feeling vibrations settle into a rhythm" offers sensory texture without contradictory impulses or embodied cost. The final choice to place the stone is enacted without internal friction; no competing desire complicates the action. The whispered promise and smile at closure feel declarative rather than earned through visible struggle. Energy beings function as atmospheric pressure but never individuate or apply relational crucible force.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who and where within the opening lines; the timeline "after the energy beings arrive" provides adequate frame. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: the mapkeeper traces ice patterns, retrieves the stone, and deploys it to quiet the caves. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): the mapkeeper commits to guard the "bloom of hush" and the caves settle into repose. Cost is implied—he returns to vigilance—but the final image does not unmistakably foreclose a path or reveal a felt price; the smile and whispered promise soften rather than charge the ending.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The harmonic caves are anchored early with "low, reverberating tones" and "deepest chamber," and sensory detail (sapphire light tunnel, basalt pedestal, crack patterns in ice) is vivid and selective. The ice fissures directly enable the mapkeeper's discovery—he traces them to find the hidden panel—meeting the 9+ gate of constraint on choice. However, spatial choreography after retrieval is vague (the "center of the cavern" and "main fissure" lack concrete position), and the caves themselves do not evolve or resist; they remain a passive theater for the mapkeeper's work.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—restore quiet to the caves—is signaled early and remains coherent. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure builds through the search and the stone's deployment; the energy beings' retreat and the ice smoothing mark a tightening. However, the mapkeeper encounters no setback, alternate tactic, or live trade-off; he moves from observation to retrieval to placement without friction. The cost at closure (ongoing vigilance) is told rather than dramatized, and no prior option is visibly foreclosed by the final act.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme—balance between echo and silence, not absence of sound—emerges through the mapkeeper's realization and the echo chamber stone's action rather than explicit moralizing. The ice patterns and "bloom of hush" recur with shifting weight, and the final image of the mapkeeper continuing his vigil offers a resonant answer to "finding quiet in the storm." However, the closing lines drift toward abstract thesis ("purpose was clear") and the promise whispered to silence edges into declaration. The piece avoids heavy-handed morals but does not fully resist thematic summary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable throughout with consistent psychic distance. The mapkeeper's perceptual signature—noticing vibrations, reading fissures as notes—is character-specific and maintained under pressure. Diction is controlled: "ripple-mark skin," "hammered repose," and "sapphire light" feel purposeful. However, no dialogue appears (acceptable per policy), and some phrases ("feeling the vibrations settle into a rhythm") lean toward abstraction. Register remains steady; no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks mar the flow.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Sentence openings repeat template structures: "He began… He approached… He placed… He whispered… He returned… He understood…" across the second half, creating monotonous cadence (−0.5). Paraphrase loops appear: "gently luminous" recurs five times without functional variation, "bloom of hush" four times, "crack patterns in ice" three times as identical anchor phrases (−0.4). Figurative language ("living auroras," "sapphire light," "calm tide") clusters densely in the middle third without pattern-teaching or causal payoff (−0.3). The loops and template stems dull momentum in the retrieval and placement sequence, obscuring propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The premise—a sound-sensitive mapkeeper restoring quiet with an artifact—synthesizes fantasy elements but reads as template-adjacent (keeper + quest object + restoring balance). The ice-crack navigation and "bloom of hush" phrase offer mild specificity, yet the emotional arc and resolution follow a predictable retrieve-deploy-restore path without a sharp turn or non-obvious consequence. The energy beings arrive, disrupt, and leave without complication; no risk heightens stakes. Transformation test: swapping "harmonic caves" for another resonant site and "echo chamber stone" for another artifact would leave structure intact.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The ripple-mark mapkeeper appears throughout, driving the search, retrieval, and placement. His choice to examine the ice (early), lift the stone (middle), and align it with the fissure (end) creates three distinct beats. Setup and closure gates are met; his decision to continue vigilance shapes the final stance. However, the decisions feel procedural rather than conflicted—no live trade-off or cost surfaces on the page to elevate irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The echo chamber stone is introduced at ~20% ("artifact rumored"), retrieved at midpoint behind the crystal veil, and deployed at closure where it emits the glow that quiets the beings. It appears in three beats (discovery, retrieval, placement) and its "muted resonance" and rune patterns provide tactile specificity. The final image charges it with consequence (the mapkeeper's smile "beneath the gently luminous stone"). Strong setup, development, and payoff; causal role is clear. Slight swappability friction (another calming artifact could function similarly) prevents higher score.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Bloom of hush" is named four times but functions primarily as thematic label rather than stake-shaping force. It describes the desired outcome (quiet) without altering on-page tactics or introducing cost; the mapkeeper could pursue "silence" or "calm" with identical action. The phrase recurs at closure ("true bloom of hush filling the cavern") but as atmospheric descriptor, not causal participant. Setup in title/concept; closure mention present; no middle development that narrows options.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Gently luminous" is applied five times (echo chamber stone, aura, glow, stone again, stone at closure) but remains decorative: the glow "spread like a calm tide" and "coaxed the storm… into a softer cadence," yet no tradeoff or constraint emerges. The attribute does not enable or restrict a choice—brightness level never matters tactically. Setup met (stone "rumored to absorb"), closure met (mapkeeper smiles "beneath the gently luminous stone"), but no middle cost or causal use.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Conjure" appears in motivation frame ("he would conjure a gently luminous echo chamber stone") and at closure ("He had conjured the quiet"). The mapkeeper's actions read as retrieval and placement rather than creation or invocation; "conjure" labels rather than defines the method. The stone exists independently, hidden behind crystal; he does not make it. The verb could swap for "retrieve" or "deploy" without rewriting structure. Setup and closure present; swappability and method-mismatch friction lower the score.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Examining crack patterns in ice" is introduced early ("He began his work by examining…"), occupies a full beat where each fissure "sang a low chord" guiding his fingertips, and the method succeeds: a hidden panel slides aside. The ice patterns later melt and smooth under the stone's influence, completing the arc. Setup, development (the tracing beat), and closure echo all present. Causal role is clear—without this method, no discovery. Specificity (ice-as-map) distinguishes it from generic puzzle-solving.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The harmonic caves are named in the opening line, provide resonant pressure throughout (amplifying every echo, shaking calm), and supply the ice fissures that enable the mapkeeper's search. The "sapphire light" tunnel and basalt pedestal add textural specificity. At closure, the caves "settled into a hammered repose," and travelers feel unexpected calm in the corridors. Setup, development (ice navigation), and payoff all present. The setting constrains the search method and charges the final image, meeting the high-band threshold.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"After the energy beings arrive" anchors the inciting condition in the opening paragraph and their departure marks closure. However, no ticking clock or time pressure shapes tactics; the mapkeeper works at his own pace without urgency. The beings "had stirred the caves" (past perfect) suggests elapsed time, but duration and deadline remain vague. Setup present, closure present (beings drift away), but no middle beat where the timeframe narrows options or raises cost.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"To find the quiet in the storm" is stated explicitly ("The mapkeeper's motivation was simple") and reprised at closure ("His purpose was clear, to find the quiet in the storm"). The desire drives the search, retrieval, and placement across all beats. However, it is told rather than shown through conflicting impulses—no moment where the mapkeeper weighs abandoning the task or pays a visible personal cost for the pursuit. Setup, development (all actions serve this want), and closure present; lack of on-page friction or felt sacrifice prevents higher score.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Hammered repose" appears in the motivation paragraph ("the hammered repose that once soothed"), at the climax ("the hammered repose settle over him like a warm blanket"), and in the closing summary ("the harmonic caves settled into a hammered repose"). The phrase evokes stillness forged under pressure, fitting the acoustic setting. Tone remains meditative and measured throughout, modulating slightly (urgency during search, calm at resolution). Setup, development (tone consistent across beats), and payoff present. However, the repeated phrase functions more as thematic marker than tone-shaping force; the story could convey similar mood without this exact term.</comment>
