<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Harel's interiority is carried largely through abstract vocabulary ("velvet disquiet," "covenant") rather than embodied emotion under pressure. His micro-choices—lifting the cylinder, whispering in Sumerian—exist on the page but lack contradictory impulses or visible cost that would foreclose a path. The emotional arc from unease to "faint smile" reads as declared rather than dramatized through competing desires. The final sealing feels more like ceremony than a decision with stakes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed: who Harel is (oath scribe/archivist) and his purpose emerge gradually through dense, ornamental phrasing rather than early anchoring (−0.4 per Orientation Test; Q3 capped at 7.0). The piece accumulates atmospheric detail but the closure—recording the prophecy into vellum—does not reweight prior material or foreclose a live option with legible cost; the act is described as completion rather than transformation. Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural, yet no pattern breaks or cadence shifts create closure pressure. No meaningful before/after is legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The orchard atop a skyscraper is vividly rendered through sensory specifics (pomegranates, plum that sings, rusted phonograph) and the setting accumulates atmospheric weight. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; it functions as backdrop and symbolic tapestry rather than as pressure. Spatial choreography is clear, and the micro-setting (wax cylinder, orchard roots) is textured but ornamental. Cap at 7.0 per the Orientation Test penalty applied in Q2.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—archiving emotional patterns—is signaled but remains abstract and does not tighten on the page. The prophecy arrives accidentally via the phonograph, yet Harel's response is contemplation rather than a choice that narrows options or raises cost. No meaningful escalation occurs: the scribe's realization that the child will be a future archivist loops back to his existing mission without altering tactics or foreclosing a path. The ending records the prophecy with no visible price paid or option sacrificed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Theme—memory, prophecy as preservation, dead languages bridging past and future—is coherent and surfaces through image and motif (wax cylinders, dead tongues, children's questions). However, the final vellum-sealing does not reweight the question non-literally; it restates the premise as a loop ("preservation became a promise") without tension or surprise. The piece offers atmospheric resonance but no earned insight that challenges or deepens the initial premise. Subtext operates in image but closure is stated rather than embodied.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Harel, but the prose drifts into elevated, ornamental register ("velvet disquiet," "tapestry of sorrow and hope") that feels authorial rather than character-particular. Perceptual signature is vague: the scribe notices in generalized poetic terms rather than through a specific, biased lens. Diction remains uniform across calm and peak beats, lacking modulation under pressure. The narrative voice is controlled but reads as committee lyricism rather than a singular mind.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The prose is dense with figurative language and elevated diction throughout ("velvet disquiet," "tapestry of sorrow," "loop of prophecy and preservation"), creating a uniform lyric texture that does not modulate with scene pressure (−0.5 for overwriting density). Paraphrase loops appear: the prophecy's weight and Harel's mission are restated in adjacent lines without added information (−0.2). Template cadence is present in parallel structures ("whispered," "exhale," "humming") across multiple sentences without taught pattern (−0.4). Information density is low; many sentences ornament rather than advance. Artifacts touch the closure beat, so high-band entry is disallowed and 9+ globally capped at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The premise—ancient orchard atop skyscraper, oath scribe archiving emotions via wax cylinders and dead languages—combines familiar "memory keeper" and "prophecy" tropes without fresh synthesis. The emotional arc and thematic loop (preservation → future archivist → preservation) are predictable, and the ending restates rather than transforms. Specific details (phonograph, Akkadian, third-grade memory) are vivid but do not cohere into a non-obvious turn or risky stance. The piece favors atmospheric accumulation over ingenuity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Harel is present throughout and his role (oath scribe/archivist) frames the piece, but his choices do not create key turns. He listens, lifts the cylinder, realizes the prophecy's meaning, and records it—acts of observation and completion rather than decisions that alter tactics or foreclose paths. Setup is clear, but no middle or closure beat depends on a choice only he could make. The character is functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The wax cylinder phonograph shaving appears in setup (spins lullabies, cracked groove releases prophecy) and at the ending (Harel shaves a layer to release tone, then records into vellum). It is handled across multiple beats and its sound triggers the prophecy, but the shaving itself does not constrain choice or accumulate reweighted meaning—it functions as a magical device rather than an object with evolving stakes. The final use (shaving wax to release tone) is ornamental rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The accidental prophecy is central to the setup (phonograph's cracked groove recites it) and frames the closure (Harel records it into vellum). However, the prophecy does not alter Harel's tactics or present a dilemma; he receives it, interprets it, and archives it without conflict. The "accidental" nature is mentioned but not dramatized as surprise or cost. The concept is present and thematically relevant but does not shape on-page choices or narrow options.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Harel's ability to speak dead languages (Akkadian, Old Persian, Sumerian) is mentioned and label-demonstrated (he whispers lines that affect wind and orchard). However, the trait does not constrain or enable a choice with visible cost; it functions as credential and atmospheric color rather than as a skill that trades off against other options or forces a sacrifice. The trait is ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"Immerse" appears three times: Harel comes to immerse in the orchard's perfume (setup), he immerses further into whispers via the children's memory (middle), and the final line mentions "a single scribe's careful immersion." The action is told rather than shown—no on-page dramatization of what immersion entails or costs. The term functions as thematic label rather than as a decisive physical or mental act that changes tactics. Easily swappable with "listen" or "absorb."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The third-grade field trip memory surfaces in the middle third (children pressed hands into soil, Harel whispered Old Persian, wind paused) and is said to allow him to "immerse further" and "decode the prophecy's deeper resonance." It is signaled and participates in the middle, but the mechanics are vague—how the memory unlocks understanding is asserted, not shown. The memory shapes one beat but does not constrain later choice or return at closure. Functional but thin.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The ancient orchard atop a skyscraper is established early and provides vivid sensory anchors (pomegranates, olives, figs, rusted steel, lanterns). The setting frames the entire piece and the orchard's "roots humming" and "lanterns glowing amber" charge the ending image. However, the setting does not constrain Harel's actions or alter his tactics; it functions as symbolic container rather than as pressure. Strong atmospheric presence but no causal leverage.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"After the foghorn falls silent" appears in the opening line and is echoed at closure ("the foghorn's silence lingered like a held breath"). The timeframe establishes a post-event stillness but does not tighten decisions or create a ticking clock—no urgency or deadline shapes Harel's actions. The element is a poetic frame rather than a tactical constraint. Ornamental reprise.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Harel's duty to archive emotional patterns is stated early and drives his presence in the orchard. The motivation is told and revisited ("his purpose—to archive emotional patterns—suddenly seemed intertwined with the orchard's fate"), and the closure shows him recording the prophecy. However, no on-page friction or competing want complicates this desire; he simply fulfills his role. The motivation is coherent and shapes the frame but lacks dramatized cost or internal conflict.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Velvet disquiet" is named in the opening ("the air thicken with a velvet disquiet") and echoed in the penultimate paragraph ("In that velvet disquiet, the city below breathed a little easier"). The tone is atmospheric and consistent but does not modulate with scene pressure—the prose remains uniformly elevated and ornamental throughout. The final reprise reweights slightly (disquiet → relief) but the shift is asserted rather than felt. Static mood with a declared resolution.</comment>
