<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The guardian's internal life consists almost entirely of abstract labels ("dimensionally homesick," "yearning to make friends with uncertainty") rather than embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. The shift from "feral" to "curator" is told rather than earned through dramatized cost; no on-page renunciation or stance crystallization occurs. Interiority reads generic and therapy-adjacent ("interiorizing exteriors," "foggy lucidity") without character-particular texture. The pendant is approached with "tentative reverence" but no conflicting impulse acts in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural, but the closure unit—opening a "new wing" and welcoming travelers—lands as summary rather than a decisive image with visible cost. The garden setting and pendant are established early, but the causal chain dissolves into abstract philosophizing ("boundaries of light," "veil of sleep") without a legible tightening or deepening that forecloses a path. Orientation is delayed: "she—if the term could fit" and "it spent" create pronoun ambiguity, and the spatial relationship between garden, library, and "new wing" remains vague past the 120-word mark, triggering the Orientation Test penalty (−0.4).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The frozen garden and mist are vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (frost-bitten volumes, skeletal birches, amber glow). However, the environment functions primarily as symbolic backdrop rather than constraining choice or altering tactics; the guardian's actions (stalking, waiting, approaching the pendant) would play identically in any setting. The pendant's placement "half-buried in the snow" is the sole moment where setting intersects with plot. Spatial choreography of the "new wing" and visitor traffic is gestured at but not grounded.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether to engage with uncertainty via the pendant—is signaled but never tested with a visible trade-off. The guardian "chose to wait" midway, then immediately reverses to open the wing without dramatized cost or escalation. No on-page tightening narrows options; the cult's warning that removal "could awaken that slumbering breach" is introduced and ignored without consequence. Agency reads as passive observation dressed in elevated diction rather than decision under pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The theme of "making friends with uncertainty" emerges through recurring images (mist, veil, boundaries of light) and the guardian's stated longing. However, the final tableau—opening the wing, greeting travelers—offers no non-literal answer or reweighting; it resolves into a tidy moral ("learned to wait," "foggy lucidity") without friction or cost. The pendant's cult origin and the breach threat are dropped rather than integrated thematically. Subtext is minimal; the prose states rather than implies.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Narrative distance is stable third-limited with purposeful uncertainty ("she—if the term could fit"), and the perceptual signature leans toward abstraction ("lattice of interiorized exteriors"). However, register drifts into academic-philosophical phrasing ("delineating the shifting boundaries," "foggy lucidity") that exceeds the focalizer's plausible lexicon, especially in peak beats. Pronoun inconsistency ("she" / "it") within paragraphs reads unintentional rather than thematically motivated. No dialogue to assess.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: "wait… waiting… wait" across three paragraphs; "boundaries of light" appears five times with synonym churn ("porous," "delineating," "no longer confined"). Template cadence in the middle third: "The guardian felt… The guardian, aware… The pendant now…" Filter-verb stacks ("seemed to hum," "felt the moment," "understood that") dull immediacy. Figurative density is high but often mixed ("wings of mist-woven verses"). Penalty pack: −1.2 for loops, template stems, and filter stacks touching multiple beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The core premise—feral library guardian in a frozen garden archive—offers a fresh synthesis, but execution leans on stock poetic abstractions ("veil of sleep," "echo of a home," "dance on the edge") without grounding them in specific, non-obvious choices. The pendant's cult origin and dimensional breach are introduced as stakes then abandoned, suggesting a checklist approach. The transformation from feral to curator is asserted rather than earned through risk or cost. Proximity check: "petal stored a story" echoes common metaphor.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>The guardian stalks, waits, approaches the pendant, and opens the wing—four touches across setup, middle, and ending. However, only the pendant approach reads as a choice under pressure; the rest are observations or summary declarations. No visible cost ties to these actions; the shift to "curator" is told. Swappable with any guardian figure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The pendant appears in three beats: discovery, approach, and resting against the chest at closure. It enables the guardian's choice to "wait" then "open a new wing," supplying causal pressure. However, the cult threat attached to it is never paid off; the pendant's "warmth seeping into sinews" is told rather than shown altering tactics. Mid-band for beat involvement and closure linkage, but cost connection is weak.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"Boundaries of light" recurs five times but functions as thematic decoration rather than shaping stakes or tactics. The phrase is never concretely defined or tested on the page; the guardian does not navigate or breach a boundary in dramatized action. Summary-only: "no longer confined the stories" tells the outcome without showing the mechanism. Late integration (primarily final third) and ornamental use.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"Dimensionally homesick" is mentioned once in the opening paragraph as a label for the guardian's longing, then never constrains or enables an action. No on-page cost or trade-off stems from this attribute; it could be cut without altering the plot. Present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Wait" is signaled early, drives the midpoint choice ("chose to wait"), and recurs in the closing paragraph ("forever making friends with uncertainty… learned to wait"). The action shapes two beats and contributes to the thematic closure. However, the mechanics of waiting—what is sacrificed, what tactics change—remain abstract. Strong reprise but moderate causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Interiorizing exteriors" is introduced mid-story ("folding the cold wind into the warm folds of memory") with a backstory gloss ("taught by whispers of librarians") but never shown shaping an attempt or choice. Mentioned again in the final paragraph as a settled state ("lattice of interiorized exteriors") without dramatized cost. Summary-only; swappable with any ritual.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The frozen garden frames the entire narrative, supplies the pendant discovery, and returns in the ending image (roses unfurling, mist-woven verses). Spatial choreography is vague ("new wing," visitor paths) but the setting's atmospheric pressure—mist, frost, silence—modulates with the guardian's stance and charges the final tableau. Strong closure linkage; moderate causal constraint (pendant placement).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"Through the veil of sleep" appears in three moments (opening, midpoint "midnight," and "dawn of the veil lifted") but does not function as a live clock. Time passes ("endless nights," "one midnight") without tightening decisions or altering tactics; the guardian's waiting is not bounded by urgency. Present across beats but untracked and non-pressuring. Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The desire "to make friends with uncertainty" is stated early and recurs four times, shaping the thematic frame. However, it is never dramatized as a conflicted choice with visible cost; the guardian moves from avoidance ("long avoided") to acceptance ("shimmering as a possible companion") via summary rather than on-page friction. Told-only motivation; no trade-off between want and fear. Mid-low band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Foggy lucidity" is named once near the end and implied throughout via mist imagery and abstract-philosophical diction ("lattice," "porous boundaries"). The tone is consistent and modulates slightly (from "feral" intensity to "curator" calm) to support the arc. However, it does not charge the final image with additional meaning; the tone is stable rather than dynamically reweighted. Functional reprise; moderate coherence.</comment>
