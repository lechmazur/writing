<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Mara's interiority remains abstract and declarative rather than embodied. Her motivation to "harvest insights from failure" is told in conceptual language without micro-choices that reveal internal contradiction or cost. The ending gesture—walking to the cliff—reads as symbolic closure rather than a character-driven foreclosure with visible emotional price. No on-page struggle between competing impulses materializes during key beats.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes who/where/when by the opening and follows an Accumulative lens: Mara arranges markers, plays the flute, enters the seam, retrieves insight, returns. The closure reconfigures her mission statement ("guardianship is woven from quiet failures"), but the cost remains conceptual—no visible forfeiture or tactical shift ties the insight to an on-page sacrifice. The seam-crossing moment feels resolved by the flute's mechanics rather than Mara's earned struggle, softening the Resonant Reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Thunder-echo range, canyon hush, and driftwood markers are vivid and recur with purpose. The gilded flute constrains the seam-opening action, charging the final image when placed at the fire's edge. Spatial choreography (stone shelter, ridge, outcrop, cliff) tracks clearly. Sensory detail is selective and voice-filtered, though some phrasing ("avalanchingly quiet," "texture of possibility") leans abstract rather than concrete.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—bringing back insights from failure—is signaled early but never tests Mara with a live trade-off or reversal. The seam widens on cue; no on-page complication arises from the world beyond or her choice to enter. The ending promise ("listen to every failure") reweights her mission conceptually, but the escalation path lacks a meaningful tightening where Mara must forfeit one path to secure another.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The theme—learning from failure rather than clinging to one path—emerges organically from Mara's journey and the closure insight about "quiet failures." The gilded flute and driftwood markers recur with shifting meaning, and the final image (flute at fire's edge, song into stars) resonates without overt moralizing. However, the thesis is articulated in near-prompt language ("harvest insights from failure," "guardianship is woven from quiet failures"), reducing subtext and pulling the theme toward statement rather than embodied discovery.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Focalization is stable; no head-hopping. Diction leans elevated and abstract ("avalanchingly quiet," "texture of possibility," "tapestry of echoes") in ways that drift from embodied perception under pressure. Perceptual signature is present (canyon hush, gilded surfaces, quiet vibration) but the syntax is rhythmically uniform, with many sentences opening on subject-verb stems. No dialogue appears. The voice reads coherent but lacks the grounded immediacy that would distinguish high-stress beats from reflective ones.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and synonym cycles appear: "canyon hush" recurs seven times with minor variation; "avalanchingly quiet" and "hush" are restated adjacently without added pressure. Template cadence runs ("She [verb]… She [verb]…") appear across multiple paragraphs. Several metaphors are mixed or abstract ("breath was avalanchingly quiet," "weaving of worlds," "tapestry of echoes"). Information density is moderate; beats advance but scaffold phrases ("she felt," "she knew," "she understood") dull immediacy. Final-paragraph repetition of "canyon hush" and "quiet" weakens the closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The premise—inter-world travel via a musical instrument to harvest lessons from failure—synthesizes familiar tropes (portal fantasy, relic keeper, learning from loss) with specific anchors (gilded reed flute, driftwood markers, thunder-echo range). The emotional arc (accepting that guardianship requires failure's wisdom) is earnest but not deeply particularized; the lesson feels close to a writing-prompt thesis. The seam-opening mechanics and the silent flute's vibration offer fresh detail, lifting the piece above generic execution.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Mara is present throughout and her choices frame the sequence: uncasing relics, arranging markers, playing the flute, entering the seam, returning. However, her decisions are enacted without visible friction or cost. The key turn—understanding why guardianship ended—occurs as realization rather than a choice that alters tactics. Setup and closure presence secure mid-band; lack of on-page trade-off or constraint caps higher.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The gilded reed flute appears in three beats: initial description, seam-opening, and final placement at the fire. Its "silence louder than any trumpet" and the vibration that opens the seam are specific and irreplaceable. The flute enables the crossing and charges the closure image. However, the mechanics remain abstract ("not sound but vibration"), and no visible cost or tactical constraint is tied to its use. Setup, development, and closure presence secure mid-high band; lack of felt cost on the page caps higher.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Weaving between worlds is the core concept. Mara enters a seam, experiences "the weaving of worlds," and brings back insights. The concept shapes the stakes (accessing lessons from failure) and the method (flute-opened fissure). It appears in setup, mid-story action, and informs closure. However, the world-weaving remains thematic and abstract; no on-page tactics or constraints arise from the act of crossing. Functional across beats but not indispensable in its exact form.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Avalanchingly quiet" appears twice as a label for Mara's breath and the flute's silence. The trait does not constrain or enable an on-page action with visible cost. It functions as mood descriptor rather than a character attribute that alters choice. Ornamental use trends low.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Uncase" appears twice: Mara uncases relics from the stone chest and later returns them. The action frames the ritual but is not causally central to the seam-opening or the insight retrieval. The flute-playing and marker-arranging drive the key turn. Uncase is present in setup and closure but easily swappable with "retrieve" or "lay out" without structural loss. Mid-band for framing presence.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Arranging driftwood as directional markers is signaled early and used: markers form a map, Mara follows them to the outcrop where the seam appears. The method shapes the approach and is specific. However, the mechanics remain summary-level ("each piece turned to catch the echo"), and the markers do not return at closure or impose cost. Setup and development presence secure mid-band; lack of closure participation and visible constraint cap higher.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Thunder-echo range is named in the opening and closing beats and provides the canyon hush that defines the valley. The setting supplies the acoustic environment for the flute's vibration and the seam's location. The final beat ("thunder echo range resonated a low chord") charges the ending. The setting pressures Mara's method (listening for wind's subtle notes) and recurs with purpose. Solid setup, development, and closure presence lift the score; lack of a sharper tactical constraint keeps it from high band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"After the guardianship of the ancient seals had ended" frames the timeframe and motivates Mara's quest. The phrase recurs at closure ("In that silent expanse she understood why the guardianship had ended"). However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions or impose a live deadline. It provides backstory context rather than on-page pressure. Setup and thematic closure link secure low-mid band; lack of tactical urgency caps higher.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Harvesting insights from failure is Mara's stated motivation, named early and restated at closure ("bring back the insights that only a broken attempt can teach"). It drives the world-crossing and shapes the thematic resolution. However, the desire is declared rather than dramatized through conflicted choice or visible cost. No on-page friction tests her commitment to this goal. Functional across beats but lacks embodied struggle.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Canyon hush recurs seven times, anchoring tone from opening to closure. The tone modulates subtly: quiet expectation (opening), held breath (flute moment), silent expanse (world beyond), velvet night (closure). The hush constrains Mara's method (listening, muffled footfalls) and charges the final image ("canyon hush held its breath"). Coherent through turns and present at closure; slight over-reliance on the phrase itself and abstract phrasing keep it from top band.</comment>
