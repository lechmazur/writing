<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The chronicler remains a passive observer throughout, with no contradictory impulses or genuine internal conflict. Her motivation ("to discover the texture of time") is told rather than dramatized through difficult choices. The jade cicada's "sensing" and the water's "brightening" do the work while she simply watches and records. No visible cost or meaningful renunciation occurs; she exits satisfied, having risked nothing.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed—who she is and why she's there emerges slowly across the opening third. The "foretelling" of the clan meeting is set up but never dramatized; the two leaders appear suddenly in one sentence without prior spatial grounding or causal build. The closure substitutes atmospheric description ("water brightened," "stars watching") for a legible change in options or knowledge. No visible cost: she simply closes her notebook and leaves, pleased.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The grotto's sensory detail is vivid and sustained—moonlight on water, basalt slab, cool breeze, stone walls pulsing—and the jade cicada's glow provides a recurring visual anchor. However, the environment never constrains a choice or alters tactics; it remains picturesque backdrop. The two clan leaders materialize without spatial choreography, and the chronicler's position relative to them is unclear.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—foreseeing the outcome of a dawn meeting—is declared but never tested on the page. No reversal or tightening occurs; the chronicler simply observes ripples and hears an owl, then the leaders soften their tones off-stage. She makes no decision that narrows options or incurs a trade-off. The "transition period" unfolds passively, resolved by the jade cicada's vibration rather than protagonist agency.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The theme of transition periods and time's texture is stated repeatedly in lyric language ("time is not a line but a sea," "invisible lines that bind transition periods"). However, it remains abstract—no particular event or choice embodies the discovery. The final image offers mood but no conceptual repricing or non-literal answer that reweights prior material. The proverb about tides is generic; the jade cicada's silence is ornamental.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains a consistent lyric register with purposeful cadence ("her script curling like the tide's own handwriting"). However, perceptual signature is thin—the chronicler's way of noticing lacks character-specific bias. The two clan leaders speak in a single sentence with no distinct idiom. Psychic distance remains stable, but the elevated diction ("tangential approach," "embodied") occasionally drifts from immediate perception into essayistic summary.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and synonym churn appear throughout: "pause," "thin breath," "held breath," and "veil" all describe the same concept within a few paragraphs; "texture of time" recurs five times without added meaning. Figurative density is high in non-crisis moments ("every ripple a clue, each shimmer a sentence"). Template cadence is mild but present ("She noted," "She recalled," "She realized," "She smiled"). Clarity remains intact, but propulsion stalls under decorative layering.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The tidal-pool chronicler and jade cicada offer a fresh surface, but the core plot—observer foresees peaceful resolution through mystical means—follows a familiar template without transformation. The "tangential approach" of reading ripples and owl calls is asserted but not dramatized through specific, grounded choices. Emotional stakes remain abstract; the chronicler's satisfaction at the end is unearned. No bold risk or non-obvious moral calculus emerges.</comment>
