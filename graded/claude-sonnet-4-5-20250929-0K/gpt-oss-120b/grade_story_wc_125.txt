<question>1</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The poet remains abstract and unchanging throughout—"passionate subtlety," "ethically playful grin" are labels never dramatized through contradiction or embodied choice. No internal conflict appears; he moves through dilemmas (free fireflies vs. trade rope) without visible struggle or cost that would reveal character. The final binding of the rope reads as declaration rather than earned renunciation, because no prior beat established what he would forfeit by choosing one path over another. Interiority consists of stock poeticism ("texture of time") rather than character-particular perception under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed and vague: who, where, and when remain hazy past 120 words (−0.4). The lens reads Accumulative/Textural, but no meaningful tightening occurs—the poet explores, traces patterns, and weaves the rope without facing a narrowed choice or cost that forecloses a path. The final binding is declared rather than earned causally; the prose asserts resonance ("walls seemed to breathe") without showing what the poet lost or risked. Closure lacks visible or felt cost, reducing the ending to atmospheric summary.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The grotto is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (terra-cotta, amber veins, mineral glaze, electric scent) and the rope's physical handling across multiple beats supplies tactile grounding. However, the setting never constrains a choice or alters tactics—the poet moves freely through forks and tunnels without spatial friction. The environment functions as backdrop rather than pressure, preventing entry to higher bands.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The dominant stake ("discover the texture of time") remains abstract and untested. Impossible choices are declared at forks (fireflies vs. lantern, release vs. tether) but never dramatized with visible tradeoffs or consequences. No escalation occurs under the Accumulative lens—each beat repeats exploration and tracing without narrowing options or raising cost. The final choice to bind the rope carries no legible price because prior beats established no competing want or forfeited path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Theme is asserted rather than earned: "texture of time," "passionate weave," and "collective longing of all wanderers" are stated in the final paragraph as summary rather than resonating from prior particulars. The rope's shift from prison escape to cosmic binding is declared symbolically but lacks on-page friction that would charge the transformation. The piece tells its thematic conclusion ("dare to untangle the delicate pattern of existence") instead of dramatizing insight through concrete choice and cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable and third-person limited, but the perceptual signature is generic: "faint pulse of the stones," "whispered of centuries" could apply to any wanderer-poet archetype. Diction drifts into elevated, abstract register ("residual energy," "marrow of the universe") that lacks character specificity. No dialogue appears. The voice offers lyric atmosphere but no distinct idiom or filter that would mark this narrator's particular way of noticing under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Pervasive overwriting and template cadence: runs of "He [verb]" and "the [noun] [verb]" across most sentences (−0.6). Mixed and strained metaphors accumulate (rope as compass rose, time woven into rope, walls breathing, stars applauding) without coherent vehicle logic (−0.5). Paraphrase loops recur (discovering texture of time restated four times; impossible choices declared thrice without variation). Stock phrases ("terra-cotta grotto," "passionate subtlety," "ethically playful") function as ornament rather than propulsion. Information density is low—most sentences repeat atmosphere without advancing situation or knowledge. Artifacts touch the closure beat (final paragraph loops thematic claims), triggering −1.7 total and disqualifying 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>The core premise (wandering poet interprets alien arrival via ancient grotto) borrows from familiar mystical-encounter and artist-as-interpreter templates without transformation. The rope's shift from prison artifact to cosmic thread is declared symbolically but not grounded in lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. Impossible choices and texture of time function as prompt labels rather than specific, irreplaceable synthesis. The ending's thematic summary ("dare to untangle the delicate pattern") reads as generic wisdom rather than a fresh inflection earned in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>The drifting roadside poet is present throughout and performs the central actions (tracing, weaving, binding), satisfying setup and development. However, his choices are declarative rather than causal—he "chose, with a smile" to bind the rope without prior dramatization of competing wants or visible cost. Observation dominates; decision without pressure or tradeoff trends low.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The frayed coil of rope appears early (setup), is handled in multiple beats (tracing patterns, curling around stone, weaving into walls—development), and anchors the final binding (payoff). It shifts from prison artifact to cosmic thread, reweighting meaning. However, the rope's properties remain abstract (frays "echo sighs") rather than constraining choice through physical limits, and its use feels interchangeable with any symbolic object. Two-gate presence with lyric reprise but moderate causal pressure places it mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>Impossible choices are declared at forks (fireflies vs. lantern, release vs. tether) but never dramatized with on-page cost or tradeoffs that alter tactics. The concept functions as thematic label rather than shaping stakes or narrowing options. Mentioned repeatedly but ornamental, fitting low band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>Ethically playful appears twice as label ("ethically playful grin," "playful ethic") but never constrains or enables action with visible cost. The poet's decisions show no tension between ethics and desire, no tradeoff where playfulness alters stakes. Label-only mention trends low.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Pattern (tracing light/shadow, arranging rope as compass, uncovering concentric tunnels) appears early, recurs across beats, and culminates in the final weaving that "mapped his inner journey." The action drives exploration and supplies the closure image. However, the pattern's mechanics remain vague—what the poet discovers by tracing is asserted rather than shown to change options. Strong presence and closure linkage lift it to mid-upper band, but swappability (could be "song" or "map" with minor edits) prevents higher.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Uncovering layers (mineral glaze, concentric tunnels, amber veins) is signaled early and recurs across beats, shaping the poet's path. The method matters to the middle exploration but does not constrain the final choice or alter tactics under pressure. Functional across beats but not indispensable to closure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Terra-cotta grotto under starlight is anchored early (setup), supplies vivid sensory detail (walls, tunnels, amber veins) across beats (development), and houses the final binding (payoff). However, the setting never pressures a choice or alters tactics—the poet explores freely without spatial friction. Atmosphere is strong, but lack of constraint on decision or outcome caps it at mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>After the energy beings arrive frames the opening and their "shimmering" presence recurs as backdrop, satisfying setup and background development. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions, impose a deadline, or alter tactics. The beings remain atmospheric rather than causal. Present but ornamental, fitting low-mid band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>To discover the texture of time is declared as motivation early and restated four times, but never dramatized through conflicting wants or costs. The poet pursues it without friction, obstacle, or tradeoff. The final "tasted the texture of time" is assertion rather than earned realization. Told-only trends low.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Passionate subtlety is signaled early and sustained through lyric diction and reflective pacing. The tone modulates slightly (from arrival wonder to final reverence) but remains static across most beats—no cadence shift under pressure. Coherent and purposeful but does not charge the final image with tonal contrast or intensification, placing it functional but mid-band.</comment>
