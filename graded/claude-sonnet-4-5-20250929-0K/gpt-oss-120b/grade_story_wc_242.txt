<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mara's interiority is consistently abstract and label-dependent ("cultivated estrangement," "teaching endings how to begin") rather than embodied through contradictory impulses in scene. The "Thank you" voice at the end delivers closure through external validation rather than Mara's own earned choice or renunciation with visible cost. Lena's grief fragments are summarized rather than dramatized, and the final step out of the booth reads as symbolic gesture without foreclosing a path or revealing what Mara sacrifices. Internal conflict is told through philosophical claims rather than simultaneous opposing desires acting in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed—who Mara is and what she's doing remains abstract until Lena's call provides functional context past the 120-word mark; apply −0.4 per the Orientation Test, and cap Q3 at 7.0. The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: voices layer onto the disc, building a chorus. However, the closure unit—Mara stepping out after hearing "Thank you"—lacks legible cost: what option does she foreclose, what does she lose by leaving the booth, or how does the tunnel's pulse reweight her prior isolation? The conceptual claim ("cultivated estrangement dissolved") is asserted rather than shown through a decisive image or action with felt price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The tunnel setting is vividly rendered with selective detail (rusted conduits, groundwater drip, neon glow) and the brass booth anchors spatial choreography. The glass harmonica disc charges the final image as voices accumulate, meeting the 9+ gate requirement that an object or environment constrain choice or charge closure. However, the tunnel itself does not constrain Mara's choices—she could operate anywhere—and the streetlamps-through-grates image recurs decoratively without altering tactics. The orientation penalty in Q2 caps this category at 7.0 per the global rule.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—transforming endings into beginnings through collected voices—is signaled early but remains abstract and never faces on-page testing or cost. No reversal or tightening narrows Mara's options: each call simply adds another layer to the disc without complication, refusal, or trade-off. The "Thank you" voice serves as external confirmation rather than a choice Mara must make under pressure. Escalation is conceptual (more voices accumulate) but does not deepen or constrain her agency, and the final step out carries no visible price—what does she forfeit by leaving, and why now?</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The theme—endings as beginnings, isolation dissolving into communion—emerges through the disc's loop and the accumulation of voices, avoiding direct statement. The glass harmonica as recursive pattern supports the theme through concrete action. However, the final paragraph moralizes explicitly: "the core concept of cultivated estrangement dissolved, replaced by a quiet communion" and "a promise etched into the very walls" are thematic summaries rather than resonant images. The story invites reflection but the closure articulates the thesis rather than letting the loop and Mara's step speak for themselves, triggering −0.5 for terminal theme statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Voice is stable, lyric, and atmospheric with a consistent elevated register ("melodically haunted," "ghostly arpeggios," "deliberate practice to sharpen the thin line"). Psychic distance remains controlled in third-person close. However, the diction is uniform across all moments—philosophical cadence persists even during Lena's call, where urgency might compress syntax—and Lena's voice is summarized rather than heard, missing an opportunity for dialogue distinction. The prose reads as singular and purposeful but lacks modulation under pressure and avoids on-page speech that could test voice variety.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Sentence openings repeat patterns: "Mara had cultivated," "Mara listened," "Mara watched," "Mara lowered," creating template cadence across the protagonist's beats (−0.5). Stock metaphors cluster without transformation: "forgotten vein," "fireflies trapped in glass," "pulse with the same rhythm," "etched into the very walls" (−0.4 for stock metaphor strings). Paraphrase loops appear: "teach endings how to begin" / "endings are merely the start of another cycle" and "the loop was not a trap but a teaching tool" restates the premise without added pressure (−0.2). Cumulative line-level debt totals approximately −1.1, and these artifacts touch the closure beat ("promise etched into the very walls"), which disallows 9+ globally and caps high-band entries at 8.8 per the artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The glass harmonica disc as communication medium and the wrong-number-friendships method offer fresh angles on connection and grief. However, the premise—isolated operator collecting voices to teach transformation—closely matches therapeutic-redemption templates common in lyric shorts, and the story does not transform it through non-obvious moral calculus or lived detail that challenges the reader's expectations (−0.8 derivative premise adjustment). The tunnel setting and brass booth add specificity, but the emotional arc (estrangement → communion via grateful strangers) follows a predictable path. Risk is present in the lyric mode but the closure stays safe, delivering the expected resonance without complication.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Mara is present throughout and her role (operator) frames the premise. She listens, records, and offers one question to Lena—functional involvement in two beats (listen, question). However, her choices do not create key turns: each call simply adds to the disc without Mara facing a decision that alters tactics or costs her something. The final step out of the booth is a symbolic gesture rather than a choice with visible consequence. Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, but no causal pressure (choosing does not narrow options) and closure linkage is weak (she observes the pulse, then steps out)—total ~4.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The glass harmonica disc appears in setup (connected to the handset, spins with calls), development (records Lena's fragments, loops them), and closure (spins as Mara steps out, its surface catching streetlamp light). It enables the core mechanic (voice recording/looping) and charges the final image. Three-gate presence, early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, closure linkage strong +1.3, specificity (translucent wheel, arpeggios) +0.5, minus minor swappability (any recording device could serve the function, though the harmonica adds lyric texture) −0.3. Total ~7.1.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Cultivated estrangement is named explicitly and motivates Mara's tunnel isolation. However, it functions as thematic backdrop rather than shaping on-page stakes: Mara never faces a choice between maintaining estrangement and accepting connection; the dissolution is declared ("the core concept...dissolved") rather than dramatized through a trade-off. Early signal (explicit) +0.5, but ornamental use (label without pressure) −0.8, swappability (could be "solitude" or "withdrawal" with minor edits) −0.5. Total ~3.8, capped at 3.8 per swappability rule.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>Melodically haunted describes the disc's tone and recurs in the phrase "melodically haunted design." It colors atmosphere but never constrains or enables an action with cost—Mara does not choose differently because the tone is haunted versus joyful, and no on-page choice hinges on this quality. Early mention +0.4, but label-only (no causal work) −0.8, ornamental (description without pressure) −0.7. Total ~3.1.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The loop is central: the disc spins continuously, voices loop back, and the narrative structure itself circles the theme of recursion. It appears in setup (disc loops), development (Lena's fragments loop, added layers loop), and closure (disc continues its cycle as Mara steps out). However, major turns do not trace to the loop—nothing decisively changes because of the looping mechanic; it accumulates rather than reverses. Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.2, causal pressure moderate (enables accumulation but does not narrow options) +0.8, specificity +0.5, minus swappability (could be "record" or "echo" with edits) −0.4. Total ~6.8, shy of 7.0 gate because it does not drive a turn with felt cost.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Wrong number friendships is introduced in the first third, demonstrated through Lena's call (she mistakes the booth for a cab service), and shapes the collection mechanic across multiple stranger calls. It appears in setup, development, and is implied at closure (the chorus of misplaced connections). Early signal +0.6, two beats (Lena's call, the ensuing nightly pattern) +0.9, closure presence (the symphony of misplaced connections) +0.9, causal enabling (the method gathers voices) +0.7, but the mechanics are thin—why do wrong numbers reach an underground booth, and how does Mara answer calls "meant for the surface"?—minor implausibility −0.3. Total ~5.9.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The subway utility tunnel frames the isolation and provides vivid anchoring detail (rusted conduits, drip, neon). It appears throughout and charges the final image ("concrete pulse," "tunnel seemed to breathe"). Early signal +0.7, present across all beats +1.4, closure linkage (walls, tunnel breath, subterranean heartbeat) +1.0, but it does not constrain Mara's choices—she could cultivate estrangement anywhere—and no tactic shifts because of tunnel features (no access issue, no resource from the setting alters her moves). Ornamental depth −0.6, no causal constraint −0.7. Total ~5.4, capped at mid-band per the postcard-description diagnostic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"Between the hum of streetlamps" recurs as a time anchor but remains atmospheric rather than functional. No on-page clock tightens decisions—calls could arrive at any moment, and Mara's step out is not driven by time pressure. The timeframe is mentioned (nightly pattern, "every night thereafter") but vague and untracked; no deadline alters tactics. Present +0.3, but ornamental (no tactic change from time constraint) −0.8, vague tracking −0.5. Total ~2.9.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>To teach endings how to begin is stated as Mara's belief and motivates her nightly practice. However, the desire is never dramatized through conflicting choices or friction—she never faces a test where teaching costs her something or where an ending resists transformation. The motivation is told and asserted but not enacted under pressure. Early signal +0.5, thematic presence throughout +0.8, closure echo ("each ending she helped begin would someday loop back") +0.6, but told-only without on-page choice friction −1.0, no visible cost tied to pursuing this want −0.5. Total ~4.7.</comment>
