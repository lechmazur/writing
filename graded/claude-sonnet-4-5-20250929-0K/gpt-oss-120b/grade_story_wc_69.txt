<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The harmonious choir teacher lacks interiority and micro-choices under pressure; she remains a vessel for the prompt rather than a complex agent. Her "expectantly resigned" state is declared but never shown in contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The townspeople are sketch figures carrying "old grudges like heavy books," a label without dramatized friction or embodied emotion. The ending declares transformation ("faces transform," "hatred…rusting away") rather than earning it through specific, conflicted choices.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation is severely delayed—who, where, and when remain vague past 120 words; the library is described but not anchored in a town, season grounding is atmospheric only, and the teacher has no name or clear timeline. The closure unit attempts Resonant Reconfiguration (community reconciliation via art), but the cost is asserted ("hatred…rusting away") rather than legible on the page; no specific choice or forfeiture is shown. Causality is weak: the zither's first chord immediately loosens tension without earned resistance. Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (art layering toward harmony), but the final weeks-later summary dilutes the ending image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The velvet library is vividly textured (old paper, rain, marble, autumn leaves) and anchors the reconciliation spatially. The zither's rosette recurs with charged specificity and shapes the final image when children trace its design. However, spatial choreography is vague (podium/desk confusion, townspeople's positions unclear), and the weeks-later coda shifts setting without clear transition. Sensory detail is rich but not filtered through distinct POV priorities—every image receives equal poetic weight regardless of urgency.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake (rekindling vanishing arts, bridging community grudges) is signaled early but lacks a meaningful tightening under pressure. The first chord instantly dissolves tension without resistance or complication; no reversal or deepening occurs. The ending summarizes weeks of teaching rather than dramatizing a peak choice or visible cost. Agency is passive: the teacher performs, others listen and transform, but no difficult tradeoff or foreclosed path is shown on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Theme (art as reconciliation, silence as canvas) emerges from imagery but is over-articulated in lines like "by subtracting noise, silence could be sharpened into a canvas" and "art could survive even as the world tried to erase it." The rosette motif recurs purposefully and charges the final image when children trace it, lifting the score. However, the ending's summary ("denoted a new beginning," "vanishing arts would never truly disappear") states theme rather than letting the particulars resonate. No counter-reading or ambiguity is offered; the reconciliation is complete and tidy.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on the teacher, and the perceptual signature is consistent (poetic, elevated diction). However, psychic distance is too far for a 600-800 word piece; we never access her specific fears or contradictory impulses, only abstract mood ("expectantly resigned," "quiet thrill"). Diction is uniform and elevated throughout—no modulation under pressure, no syntactic compression during the performance. The rosette "glowed brighter…as if the wood itself approved" shifts into light omniscience, asserting sentience outside the teacher's perception.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Severe overwriting and template artifacts pervade the text: "Her mission, to braid diverse voices into harmony, felt as delicate as threading golden threads through a tapestry of silence" stacks metaphors without clarity. Paraphrase loops abound ("Each note denoted a memory…a thread connecting…" immediately followed by "the chords faded…hatred…rusting away"). Synonym churn on "denote" (used four times) and recycled stems ("She inhaled…She invited…She understood…She watched…She closed") create monotony. Stock metaphors ("iron chains rusting away," "dust on ancient tomes") and elevated register ("crucible," "syncing," "carry-through") do not match the scene's immediacy. Figurative density in every sentence—"breath that seemed to pull autumn leaves," "rosette glowed brighter," "velvet ambience breathed"—obscures causal linkage and dulls momentum. Artifacts touch the closure beat ("denoted a new beginning"), triggering the −1.7 penalty and disallowing 9+ globally per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The premise (teacher uses music to heal community grudges in a library) is a familiar template—art-heals-division, complete with symbolic instrument and transformative performance. The zither's rosette is specific, but the arc follows a predictable path: tension declared, single performance, instant reconciliation, summary of lasting change. No fresh inflection or non-obvious moral calculus; the teacher faces no meaningful resistance or tradeoff. The velvet library and autumn setting are atmospheric but not causally tied to the outcome. Transformation test fails: the same arc would work with a painter, a storyteller, or a different venue.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The harmonious choir teacher is present throughout and performs the central action (playing zither, inviting others to sing), but her choices do not create key turns—she executes a plan without on-page friction or adaptation. Setup is early, middle shows her performing, ending shows weeks later. However, she is more facilitator than decision-maker; the transformation happens to the townspeople, not through her contested choices. Swappable with "compassionate music teacher" or similar archetype.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The zither soundhole rosette appears in three beats: lifted from desk, glows during performance, traced by children in the ending. It recurs with reweighted meaning (from static ornament to symbol of reclaimed melodies to teaching tool). However, it is not handled or used in a way that constrains tactics—it is observed and described, not a tool that alters the teacher's approach. Lyric reprise is present (first → final), but causal pressure is weak; it could be replaced with another decorative element.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Vanishing arts frames the premise and is stated repeatedly ("the world outside was losing its songs," "each a fragment of a vanishing art," "the vanishing arts resurfaced"). However, it functions as thematic backdrop rather than shaping on-page tactics or stakes. No choice is shown between preserving one art form over another, no visible resource constraint tied to the vanishing condition. Present throughout but remains abstract; the teacher's method (play zither, invite voices) is not causally tied to the arts' vanishing status. Summary at end restates it but does not dramatize cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Expectantly resigned" is declared in the second sentence ("She was expectantly resigned") but never constrains or enables an on-page action. It is a mood label without visible tradeoff or contradictory impulse. The teacher proceeds with her mission without friction; no moment shows resignation foreclosing an option or expectation driving her forward against resistance. Ornamental trait, swappable with "cautiously hopeful" or similar.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Denote" appears four times but in varied contexts: the rosette's pattern "seemed to denote the lost melodies," each note "denoted a memory," and she "denoted a new beginning." Only the final use ties to a turn (new beginning for community), but that turn is summarized rather than dramatized. The action is not a physical deed but a conceptual claim; easily swappable with "signify," "mark," or "represent." Present across beats but does not redefine options or drive causal change.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"By subtracting noise" is stated twice: mid-story ("her fingers poised to strike the strings by subtracting noise") and again ("by subtracting noise, silence could be sharpened into a canvas"). The method is asserted but not shown in mechanics—no scene dramatizes how she removes noise or what noise she targets. It does not shape her attempts or tactics; the zither simply plays and transforms listeners. Present in setup and middle reflection, but mechanics remain abstract and closure does not depend on it.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The velvet library in autumn is established early and recurs throughout (velvet curtains, shelves, vaulted ceiling, autumn leaves, wind). It supplies atmosphere and the rosette as a charged object. However, it does not pressure choices—no access constraint, no environmental hazard, no social rule tied to the library. The setting enables the gathering but is replaceable with any quiet, resonant space. Autumn is decorative; no seasonal constraint alters tactics. Present across all three gates (setup, middle, ending) but functions as backdrop rather than active constraint.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Across unlearning hatred" appears three times, framing the timeframe as a process of community transformation. However, no specific duration or live clock is tracked; the story offers one scene (the performance) followed by a weeks-later summary. Time does not tighten decisions or alter tactics; the transformation is asserted across an unspecified span. The phrase is thematic rather than temporal, and the ending's "weeks that followed" is told, not shown. Missing middle development and closure participation; ornamental use.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The motivation "to braid diverse voices into harmony" is stated early ("Her mission, to braid diverse voices into harmony") and dramatized when she invites a child and veteran to sing. It shapes the middle action and is echoed in the ending ("continued her quiet crusade"). However, no friction between this want and a competing cost is shown—she executes the plan without sacrifice or difficult tradeoff. Present in all three gates but lacks conflicted choice; the desire is pursued smoothly. Functional but not deeply pressured.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Traveled stillness" appears twice: describing the townspeople's faces ("eyes reflecting the traveled stillness of journeys") and the ending ("feeling the traveled stillness settle like snow"). The tone is poetic and elegiac throughout, coherent but static—no modulation under pressure, no rhythmic shift at climax. The phrase itself is more metaphor than tone descriptor; it does not charge the final image in a way that reweights prior material. Present at setup and ending (lyric reprise) but does not constrain or elevate the closure moment causally.</comment>
