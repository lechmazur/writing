<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Mara's interior is entirely abstract—"quiet revolution," "gift," "humble rebellion"—with no embodied emotion or contradictory impulse visible in scene. Her motivation to plant "forests of second thoughts" is declared but never tested by a single on-page choice with visible cost. The students, neighbors, mayor, and townsfolk remain interchangeable labels; no relationship pressure or status dynamic appears. The final smile and cradling gesture are performed states, not lived friction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural (mist, lights, reflections accumulate toward a collective shift), but no single beat narrows Mara's options or forecloses a path with felt cost. The synchronized windows happen off-page; the mayor's forum and saplings appear without prior setup. Closure is a summary assertion—"The quiet has spoken"—rather than an on-page image that reweights prior material. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) drift across the library, town streets, vacant lots, and multiple weeks without clear transitions, violating the Orientation Test; apply −0.4 and cap Q3 at 7.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The cobalt library and mist recur frequently, but function as atmosphere rather than constraint; no choice depends on a locked door, cracked pane, or marble surface. The magnetic grotto is cradled twice but never used to alter a tactic. Sensory detail—dust, amber glow, pine scent—is vivid but static, cycling without progression. Spatial choreography across town, library, streets, and vacant lots remains unclear; the reader cannot track who is where when.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—spreading "second thoughts" via chess—is declared but never tested by resistance, cost, or a competing want. No on-page reversal or tightening choice appears; the windows succeed without friction, and the mayor's reversal is summarized. Coincidence (neighbors "drawn," citizens "aware") drives all turns. The ending claims irreversibility but shows no price paid or path foreclosed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Theme—quiet rebellion, unspoken words, second thoughts—is stated repeatedly in nearly identical phrasing ("quiet revolution," "humble rebellion," "chorus of second thoughts") rather than emerging from image or event. The final line, "The quiet has spoken," is explicit moralizing. The grotto's magnetism and chess metaphors remain ornamental; no particular action reweights them. No thematic tension or counter-reading exists.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, but Mara's perceptual signature is absent—no character-specific noticing or idiom. Diction drifts into elevated register ("palpable hum," "nascent rebellion," "cognitive gardens") inconsistent with an after-school coach's immediate thought. Dialogue is absent. No psychic distance modulation under pressure occurs; tone remains uniform across weeks and beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: "quiet revolution" / "humble rebellion," "unspoken words" / "unvoiced dialogue," "forests of second thoughts" / "inner forests." Template cadence clusters: "She believed… She lifted… She watched… She whispered." Stock metaphors ("dust danced like fireflies," "seeds of reflection") and therapy-speak ("plant forests of second thoughts") appear in peak beats. Register drift into academic diction ("cognitive smoothness," "nascent rebellion") clashes with POV. Apply −1.4 for density of artifacts; disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band entries at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Core premise—teacher uses chess to inspire critical thinking—is a familiar template without transformation. The synchronized windows, magnetic grotto, and mist remain decorative rather than necessary; swapping them for other symbols would not alter the arc. No risky structural choice or non-obvious synthesis appears. The ending's collective awakening follows a predictable path with no friction or surprise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>Mara is present throughout but makes no on-page decision that alters tactics or forecloses a path. Her role is declarative—she "began organizing," "believed," "watched"—without a single choice under pressure. Late first mention of chess coaching (implicit setup) and no middle or closure participation in a causal beat. Cap 2.8 for missing closure participation; further reduce for summary-only use.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The grotto appears in paragraph one (setup) and is cradled twice (paragraphs four and twenty-three), but its magnetic property never constrains or enables a choice. It vibrates once as a "reminder" but does not alter Mara's action. Three beats (setup, mid-scene mention, closure cameo) earn some credit, but all are ornamental. Cap 4.6 for no causal pressure; reduce for swappability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.0</grade><comment>"Humble rebellion" is named five times but never dramatized as a stake with cost. The windows succeed without friction; no establishment resists, no student doubts, no personal price appears. The concept is a thematic label rather than a tactical constraint. Setup present, no middle development, closure cameo only. Cap 3.4 for missing middle; reduce for label-only use.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.5</grade><comment>"Hears unspoken words" is introduced in paragraph one (setup) and echoed once in paragraph nine ("unvoiced dialogue"), but never enables or constrains an on-page action. No choice depends on this perception; no cost or tradeoff appears. Cap 2.8 for missing closure participation; reduce for label-only status.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Cradle" appears three times (paragraphs one, fourteen, twenty-three), framing the piece and returning at closure with shifted meaning (newborn rebellion → humble rebellion as established fact). The action is gentle and consistent with tone, but does not drive a turn or narrow options. Lyric-resonance allowance applies; early seed and final reprise reweight the stake mildly. No causal pressure or middle development; score in lyric-allowance range.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Synchronized window displays are introduced in paragraph seven (past the first third) and summarized as successful without shown mechanics or friction. No choice depends on coordinating the displays; the method resolves a problem (spreading the message) it did not help create. Cap 3.0 for late resolution without setup; slight lift for closure presence (windows "continued nightly"). Reduce for summary-only dramatization.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The cobalt library in mist anchors paragraphs one, ten, twenty, twenty-five, providing setup and closure presence. Mist "swirled tighter," "seemed less like fog," and "finally settled," offering mild progression. No choice depends on library access, layout, or atmospheric condition; the setting remains postcard. Two gates (setup, closure) met; no middle constraint. Score in functional range without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"During the hush where past meets prophecy" appears once in paragraph one as lyric atmosphere, never tracked or used to tighten a decision. Time spans "weeks" and "nightly" and "after school" without a live clock. The phrase is ornamental. Setup only; no development or closure participation. Cap 2.8; reduce for vague, single mention.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>"Plant forests of second thoughts" is stated in paragraph five and echoed in paragraphs eighteen and twenty-four, but never dramatized as a want in friction with cost or fear. Mara acts without doubt, resistance, or tradeoff. The motivation is a thematic declaration rather than a lived stake. Setup and closure presence; no middle friction. Cap for told-only status and lack of on-page conflict.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Amplified quiet" and variants ("quiet revolution," "collective hush," "louder in its stillness") recur throughout, establishing a coherent tonal throughline. Tone modulates mildly from "hushed chamber" to "palpable hum" to final "calm that whispered," supporting the accumulative lens. No abrupt breaks, but also no charge escalation under pressure. The final image ("The quiet has spoken") restates rather than reweights. Score in mid-band for coherence without deepening.</comment>
