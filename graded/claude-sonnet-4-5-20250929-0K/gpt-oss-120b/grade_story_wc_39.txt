<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The poet remains largely static, moving through wistful observation without internal contradiction or difficult choice. His mission is declared ("translator between generations") rather than earned through pressure, and the glass-jar method emerges fully formed without struggle or cost. The child's appearance feels convenient rather than causally prepared, and the poet's arc from lonesome to redeemed reads as summary rather than dramatized transformation. Embodied emotion is sparse; labels like "positively wistful" and "redemption gleaned" replace concrete, contradictory impulses.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed—who, where, and when remain vague past 120 words (−0.4). The piece reads as Accumulative/Textural, layering images of sounds captured in jars, but no meaningful tightening or choice narrows options; the poet's method succeeds without friction. The child's arrival at the end gestures toward closure but lacks visible cost: the poet feels redemption without forfeiting anything on the page. The final image offers resonance but no legible price paid, so the Resonant Reconfiguration remains incomplete.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The loft, dunes, and music box supply vivid sensory anchors—"sand-torn wood," "rose-gold sunrise," "brass key tarnished but still humming"—and the setting modulates from "feral" to "chapel of resonance." However, the environment does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; it serves as backdrop. The music box appears early and returns at closure, but its role is symbolic rather than tactical, so the 9+ gate (environment/object constrains choice or charges final image) is not met.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—becoming a translator of ancestral music—is declared but never tested. The poet invents the glass-jar method without friction, fills jars without obstacle, and the child appears to validate the mission without prior complication. No reversal or tightening narrows options; coincidence (the child's arrival) provides resolution. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening or cadence shift is required, but pressure remains flat and the final moment carries no visible cost or trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Theme—the transmission of ancestral memory—emerges clearly from the glass jars and music box, and the final image (child hearing grandmother's lullaby) offers a concrete, non-literal answer. However, the poet articulates the theme directly ("translator between generations," "redemption gleaned") in near-prompt language, which dilutes emergence (−0.4). The ending avoids moralizing but also sidesteps complexity: no counter-reading or ambiguity complicates the redemption, so resonance remains tidy rather than layered.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited, and diction carries a lyric, elevated register ("lonesome splendor," "luminous ribbons," "fragile gold"). Yet the voice feels generic-literary rather than character-particular; the poet's perceptual signature does not sharply distinguish him. Figurative density is high but uniform across beats, and elevated diction ("gleaned redemption," "positively wistful") occasionally drifts from the vagrant's plausible lexicon without ironic framing. No dialogue appears, so those bullets are waived.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and imagery is vivid, but scaffold and paraphrase loops recur: "sweetened" appears three times in similar constructions, "redemption" echoes across multiple beats without added pressure, and the final third repeats "the vagrant penny poet" and thematic phrases ("translator," "bridge," "chorus"). Filter-verb reliance ("felt," "seemed," "believed") in reflective beats dulls immediacy (−0.5). Mixed metaphor: "dust motes…dance like tiny planets" conflates scale incoherently. These artifacts touch the closure paragraph, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8 per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The vagrant-poet and sound-preservation premise echo familiar fabulist templates (artist redeems self through symbolic craft). The glass-jar method and music-box motif are executed with care but lack a non-obvious angle: no twist or friction transforms the archetype. The child's arrival feels anticipated rather than earned from prior particulars. Specificity in setting (dunes, loft) and sensory detail (amber hymn, tarnished brass) add texture but do not synthesize into a bold, memorable synthesis.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The vagrant penny poet is named early and present across all beats, but his choices are minimal: he lifts the music box, begins the glass-jar method without friction, and offers a jar to the child. These actions feel observational or procedural rather than decisions that narrow options or incur cost. Present and functional but not causally essential.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The forgotten music box appears in the first third, is wound by the poet's "trembling fingers," and its refrain modulates ("softer," "faded into a gentle hum") across beats. It seeds the lullaby the child later hears. Present in three beats (discovery, winding, fade) and contributes to closure via the child's recognition, but its mechanics do not constrain a choice or impose visible cost, so 7.0+ is not reached.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Gleaned redemption" is stated twice and thematically present in the poet's arc from lonesome to fulfilled, but it operates as label rather than dramatized stake. The concept does not shape tactics on the page—no choice trades one form of redemption for another, and the final moment declares rather than tests redemption. Functional theme but swappable with "earned peace" or similar.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Positively wistful" appears once in the opening as a descriptor ("listened, positively wistful") and again in the final paragraph ("positively wistful gaze fixed on the horizon"). It reads as tonal label without constraining action or creating visible cost. Ornamental mention that could be cut without altering plot or closure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Sweeten" appears three times: "hoping the wind would sweeten his…notebook," "seemed to sweeten the stale air," and "to sweeten the cold emptiness of the world." The action frames the poet's mission but remains metaphorical; no on-page beat turns on a literal act of sweetening. Present across beats but swappable with "enrich" or "enliven" without structural change.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The method of capturing sounds in glass jars is signaled in the first third ("began the method of capturing sounds"), deployed across multiple beats (music box waltz, child's laughter, dune shifts, gull call), and shapes the final moment when the child uncorks a jar. It drives repeated beats and appears at closure, but the mechanics are frictionless—no jar fails, no sound escapes—so the method does not impose cost or narrow options. Essential presence but lacks causal pressure for 7.0+.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The feral loft beneath the dunes is anchored early, described across beats ("cracked shutters," "cracked wooden shelf," "walls humming"), and transforms from hideaway to "chapel of resonance." It houses the poet's work and the child's visit. Present in setup, middle, and ending, but it does not constrain a choice—no spatial limit or resource scarcity alters tactics. Functional setting with lyric reprise but not tactically indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"At dawn's earliest whistle" appears in the opening line, and "sunrise painted the sand" recurs twice, but the timeframe does not tighten decisions. No clock pressure; events unfold in a timeless sequence. The dawn setting supplies atmosphere but could shift to dusk or midday without structural impact. Present in framing but not causally active.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The motivation "to become the translator between generations" is declared early ("His mission…was to become the translator") and frames the glass-jar project and the child's instruction. It drives the poet's actions across beats and appears at closure ("now a link, a translator"). However, it is told rather than tested—no competing want or cost forces a choice. Present and shaping but not conflicted, so friction is low.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Lonesome splendor" appears in the opening third and final third, modulating from solitary ("lonesome splendor of the loft") to shared ("lonesome splendor turn into a shared hymn"). The tone is consistent—elegiac, lyric, wistful—and charges the final image when solitude transforms into communion. The shift reweights the opening mood with cost (solitude relinquished), qualifying for lyric-resonance allowance and pushing toward mid-6s.</comment>
