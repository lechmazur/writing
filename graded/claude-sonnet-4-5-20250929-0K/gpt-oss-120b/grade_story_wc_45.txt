<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Mara is labeled a "forgiving skeptic" with "shrewdly innocent eyes," but these attributes function as decorative tags rather than drivers of contradictory impulses in scene. Her interiority consists almost entirely of abstract philosophizing ("mistakes are stars," "dark matter binds the universe") delivered in elevated register that flattens urgency. The bone-setting action feels procedural rather than revealing character under pressure—no genuine struggle, blind spots, or embodied emotion complicates the repair. The ending grants her a "quiet triumph" without visible cost or foreclosed path, failing the Earned Stasis test.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed well past 120 words; "garden behind the hedge maze" and "substitute body" appear early but Mara's goal, the scholar's situation, and the changeling tooth's function remain vague until mid-text, triggering the −0.3 to −0.5 penalty. Drive lens is ambiguous—accumulative texture competes with a quasi-causal repair sequence—and neither holds cleanly at closure. The ending offers no decisive change or visible cost: Mara "laughs softly," gathers the tooth as a keepsake, and returns to map stars, delivering summary satisfaction rather than on-page reconfiguration. No foreclosed path, no felt price, no legible RR or CR—closure validity fails.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The secret garden is introduced early and supplies moss, roots, vines, and hedges, meeting setup. Sensory detail ("midnight perfume," "cleft in ribs") is vivid but often abstract or decorative. The tooth and vertebrae constrain one middle beat (the repair), satisfying minimal development, but the garden does not pressure Mara's choices or alter tactics—it functions as backdrop. The final image ("garden glimmered") is passive description rather than a charged reconfiguration tied to spatial constraint, missing full payoff. No 9+ gate met; cap at 8.8 even if description were stronger.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—restore the scholar's body/truth—is signaled early but remains abstract and off-page (the scholar's soul "wanders," we never see him or feel urgency). Mara encounters no opposition, setback, or tradeoff during the repair; vertebrae "click" into place and the tooth "glows brighter" without friction or cost. The ending grants resolution without agency-driven escalation: she laughs, leaves, and writes in her study. No reversal, no tightening that narrows options, no visible price—pressure flatlines rather than escalates.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The theme "mistakes are constellations" is stated repeatedly in abstract language ("dark matter binds the universe," "gateway," "embryonic galaxy") rather than emerging from concrete scene work. The baby tooth and vertebrae repair could yield resonance, but the piece tells us the meaning ("not failures...") in the margins instead of letting image and action imply it. The final sky of new patterns is asserted, not dramatized, and the ending moralizes ("forgiving skeptic's quiet triumph") rather than offering a non-literal answer. Thematic Echo penalty (−0.5) applied for the explicit margin note that articulates thesis in prompt-like language.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Third-person POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is weak—Mara's noticing (bone-setting hands, mapping errors) is generic rather than character-specific. Register drifts into elevated, abstract diction ("tapestry of theories," "embryonic galaxy," "nostalgic innovation") that exceeds plausible focalization for a bone-setter in crisis, especially during the repair beat. Sentence openings vary somewhat, but voice lacks distinct texture; it reads as narrator assistance rather than character-bound perception. No dialogue present to judge.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Heavy overwriting throughout: nearly every sentence in the repair sequence carries figurative language ("marrow stitching a new map," "click resonated like a note," "lattice of vines...glowing points"), violating density without pattern-teaching (−0.6). Multiple paraphrase loops: "cleft in certainty" / "cleft echoing doubt" / "cleft narrowing" and "shrewdly innocent" repeated three times without added meaning (−0.4). Template cadence in the middle third ("She knelt...feeling," "She whispered...recalling," "She recalled...") flattens rhythm (−0.5). Stock metaphors ("symphony," "constellations," "embryonic galaxy") cluster without fresh specificity. Combined artifact penalties total approximately −1.5; artifacts touch the closure image ("garden glimmered"), disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Core premise—mystical garden repair with a changeling tooth—leans on familiar fantasy-redemption templates without transformative specificity. The "forgiving skeptic who believes in redemption" and "mistakes into constellations" are generic thematic packaging. Bone-setting as mystical practice is a mildly fresh inflection, but the execution (vertebrae align, tooth glows, problem solved) follows convenience logic rather than earned causality. Transformation test fails: swap names and the garden for any other enchanted setting and the arc is unchanged. No bold risk or non-obvious synthesis evident; the piece hedges toward safe, abstract reassurance.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Mara is labeled "forgiving skeptic" but the trait never constrains or enables a choice with visible cost. She observes, reflects, performs the repair without internal friction or trade-off. Descriptor-only use; swappable with "determined healer" or similar. Late penalty (appears at start but acts only in final third repair) and ornamental use (−0.8 combined). No causal pressure, no closure linkage beyond presence.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Tooth appears early (setup), handled in two beats (discovery, repair use—development), and glows in the final image (payoff). All three gates met. It enables the vertebrae alignment (causal pressure +0.6) and returns charged in the ending (+0.5). Specificity moderate—"glassy relic," "smooth curve"—but the tooth could be any magical healing object without breaking logic (swappability −0.5). Total adjustments lift it into mid-6s; strong beat involvement but moderate irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Cleft in certainty" is stated as theme (Mara's doubt, the hollow ribs metaphor) but does not constrain stakes or alter tactics on the page. It functions as poetic echo rather than operative concept—label-only (−0.6). Present across beats but never drives a decision. Moderate swappability: "fracture in belief" would work identically. Setup and thematic payoff present but no development pressure; two gates yield eligibility to ~6.0, but ornamental use and lack of choice impact pull it lower.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Shrewdly innocent" is repeated three times as descriptor without enabling or constraining action. Mara's hands are "trained in bone setting" yet she navigates bones "as if guiding stars"—the attribute adds poetic color but no visible cost or tactical friction. Ornamental (−0.8), swappable (−0.5), label-only (−0.3). No demonstrated tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Yearn" appears as motivation ("came to yearn for resolution") and in the substitute body's "hollow eyes reflecting yearning." Present in setup and final image (two gates), but yearning does not drive a turn—it is backdrop mood. Swappable with "seek" or "hope" without structural change (−0.6). Lyric reprise adds some resonance (+0.4), but lack of causal pressure or cost linkage keeps it mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Bone setting is Mara's skill (setup), used in the repair middle beat (development), and referenced obliquely at closure ("the curvature of the baby tooth"). Three gates met. It shapes the one on-page attempt (causal pressure +0.7) and differentiates the method from generic magic. Specificity moderate—vertebrae clicks, alignment—but mechanics remain vague (could be acupuncture or crystal work with minor edits, swappability −0.4). Closure linkage weak (mentioned but not reweighted, +0.3 only). Band sits around 5.9.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Secret garden behind hedge maze is named early (setup) and Mara returns through the maze at closure (payoff). Middle beat occurs in the garden (repair), meeting development gate. The garden supplies moss, roots, vines as stage props but does not pressure Mara's choices—she could perform the repair anywhere with the tooth (swappability −0.6). Spatial choreography vague (no micro-setting constraint on action). Lyric reprise ("garden glimmered") adds minor charge (+0.4). Total near mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"After the substitute body is found" anchors the timeframe at the start (setup gate met). The body is present in the repair beat (middle gate), and implicitly remains at closure (weak payoff). However, time does not tighten decisions—no clock pressure, no urgency, Mara proceeds at leisure. Swappable: "after receiving a vision" would work identically (−0.5). Static rather than escalating; minimal causal role (−0.4). Low-mid band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Motivation "turn mistakes into constellations" is stated early ("spent years turning mistakes into constellations") and returned in the margin note and final star-mapping (setup and payoff gates met). Mara's repair attempt is framed as enacting this motivation (development). However, the desire is told rather than dramatized—no on-page friction between yearning and cost, no visible sacrifice (told-only −0.6). Thematic echo rather than choice driver. Lyric reprise adds resonance (+0.5). Mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Nostalgic innovation" is gestured at ("blend of memory and invention," hedges "approving her nostalgic innovation") but tone is abstract rather than modulated. The piece maintains a single elevated, dreamy register throughout without shift under pressure—static mood (−0.5). The label appears late (second half) and does not charge the final image beyond mention (weak closure linkage +0.2). Ornamental descriptor (−0.5). Low-mid band.</comment>
