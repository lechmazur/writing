<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The vendor's motivation ("to find the place where stories begin") is declared but never tested or complicated by on-page pressure. His smile and fulfilled purpose arrive without any visible struggle, foreclosure, or cost—he achieves his goal by placing a bottle and watching. The child appears late and remains generic (no distinct voice, no contradictory impulses), functioning as a recipient rather than a pressure source. Interiority consists of abstract philosophical claims ("understood now that the place where stories begin is not a location but a moment") that read as unearned epiphany rather than embodied realization.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation Test: who (vendor), where (glass orchard library), and when (opening day lull) are named early, so no penalty. However, no meaningful causal linkage or pressure tightening occurs—the vendor's act of placing the bottle triggers atmospheric description but no resistance, complication, or cost. The "closure" (handing the bottle to the child, moonlight streaming) is a tableau rather than a Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with felt cost; the vendor's quest dissolves "into the very air" without forfeiting anything on the page. The piece reads as a lyric catalog of images under an Accumulative lens, but no density increase, pattern break, or cadence shift reweights the dominant stake at the end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The glass orchard library, swirling clouds, translucent bark, and vapor notebook are vivid and sensory, establishing a dreamlike register. However, setting remains ornamental: no environmental constraint shapes a choice, no spatial detail alters tactics, and the final image does not depend on a specific property of the world. The 9+ gate (environment constrains choice or charges closure) is not met, capping the score at 8.8; execution stays in the mid-band because description is atmospheric but does not pressure the vendor's path.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake (finding the place where stories begin) is signaled but never tested by resistance or cost. No on-page reversal, tightening, or deepening narrows the vendor's options—he places the bottle, it glows, the library responds, and he smiles. The child's arrival adds no complication; together they pour moonlight in a frictionless gesture. Under any lens (Causal, Accumulative, Situational), escalation requires a meaningful pressure point or choice that forecloses a path; here none appears.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Theme (the origin of stories, silence quantified into light) is declared overtly ("He understood now that the place where stories begin is not a location but a moment when absence is quantified and turned into light") rather than emerging from concrete action. The bottled moonlight and "glimmering parole" recur as motifs but do not accumulate new meaning through the vendor's choices—they illustrate the premise without reweighting it. The final chord and new story announcement are assertions, not earned resonance, and the ending summarizes the thesis instead of offering a non-literal answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Single third-person POV anchored to the vendor; no head-hopping. However, perceptual signature is generic—elevated diction ("vapor‑woven aisles," "fragmentary tone," "integrated fragmentation") remains constant rather than modulating under pressure, and the vendor's interiority consists of abstract philosophical observations without character-specific idiom. The child's brief dialogue ("whispering that the moonlight could fill the gaps") reads as thematic summary rather than embodied speech. Distance and tense are stable, but the prose lacks a distinct texture that separates this narrator from any other contemplative observer.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Patterned overwriting pervades high-pressure beats: nearly every sentence in the bottle-placement sequence layers figurative language ("pulsed like a shy sunrise," "glass skin catching the reflected sunrise of clouds," "liquid glow fracturing into shards," "scripts like fireflies awakening") without a taught pattern or payoff, triggering −0.5 for density and coherence (mixed metaphor: "shy sunrise" then "reflected sunrise"). Paraphrase loops appear ("to find the place where stories begin, a seed of origin"; "the place where stories begin is not a location but a moment") and template cadence runs through the middle third (repeated "The vendor [verb]" and "Each [noun] [verb]" stems), adding −0.6. The final-paragraph artifacts ("the library sang a single chord, a glimmering parole resonating through the clouds, announcing that a new story had been born") touch closure, escalating the deduction to −1.0 total. The Non-closure Accumulation Cap limits non-closure penalties to −0.8, but closure-touch artifacts add another −0.2, yielding a cumulative −1.0 penalty from a mid-5 baseline.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The core premise (a vendor seeking the origin of stories in a floating library) synthesizes fantasy-of-manners and meta-fiction tropes but does not transform them through specific conflict or non-obvious stakes. The bottled moonlight, "glimmering parole," and quantified absence function as elegant symbols without undergirding a fresh dramatic question—the vendor's quest resolves by contemplation rather than earned friction. Proximity check: no close echoes of famous lines, but the tone and structure recall workshop lyric-fantasy templates (catalog of wondrous objects, vague quest, declarative epiphany) without a bold risk or surprise that reweights prior material.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>The vendor is named early (setup gate met) but makes no on-page choice that narrows options or alters tactics. His actions (placing the bottle, raising the knife, smiling, handing the bottle to the child) are gestures that advance description rather than decision under pressure. Development and payoff gates are missed: his arc is contemplation → fulfillment with no visible cost. Caps: missing middle development (3.4), ornamental use (−0.7), swappability (a seeker or wanderer could replace him with minor edits, −0.5). Final score: 2.4.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The bottled moonlight appears early (setup), drives the central sequence (brightens as the vendor counts voids, fractures into shards, ignites scripts—two distinct beats), and returns in the ending when handed to the child and poured. Three gates met (setup, development, payoff). Integration signals: +0.9 (two beats), +0.8 (closure linkage), +0.4 (specificity—liquid glow that fractures). Frictions: the bottle enables the resolution without having constrained prior choices (−0.5), and its mechanics ("pulsed like a shy sunrise," "catching the reflected sunrise") lean ornamental in early description (−0.3). Net: 6.1.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"Glimmering parole" is mentioned in the opening paragraph (setup) and reprised in the final sentence but never shapes an on-page tactic or choice—it functions as a thematic label. The vendor does not pursue, test, or dramatize what "glimmering parole" means through action; it is described ("a promise that every story starts with a silent breath") but not used. Caps: missing middle development (3.4), ornamental (−0.7), label-only (−0.3). Final score: 1.8.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Mindfully scattered" appears twice: once as "mindfully scattered whispers of ancient tomes" (description) and once as "mindfully scattered like seeds on wind" (simile). Neither instance constrains a choice or enables a tactic with cost—the phrase colors tone but does not alter the vendor's path. Caps: missing all three gates (setup is descriptive mention, no development, no payoff), ornamental (−0.7), label-only trait (−0.3). Final score: 2.1.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Incise" is signaled early ("to incise a new narrative," setup) and enacted at the midpoint ("he incised the first line of the map, cutting through the void"). The action releases the pulse that ignites scripts, meeting the development gate. However, the incision does not narrow options or carry a visible cost—it triggers atmospheric response without friction. Payoff gate is weak: the ending focuses on pouring moonlight rather than cutting. Signals: +0.4 (one beat), +0.5 (causal pressure to ignite scripts). Frictions: swappable with "inscribe" or "draw" (−0.5), no closure linkage (−0.4). Net: 5.2.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.3</grade><comment>"By quantifying absence" is seeded early ("quantifying the absence of stories that had never been told," setup), used once in the middle ("by quantifying the absence of narrative weight"), and explained in the vendor's epiphany ("measuring nothingness"). The method enables the bottle's brightening but is described rather than dramatized—we do not see the vendor count or calculate on the page, only the result. Two gates met (setup, development via description); payoff is thematic summary. Signals: +0.4 (one beat involvement). Frictions: summary-only (−0.6), swappable with "measuring silence" (−0.5). Net: 3.3.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The glass orchard library and swirling clouds anchor the setting from the opening line (setup) and persist through the final image (payoff). However, the setting does not pressure a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome—it is a backdrop for the vendor's gestures. Spatial choreography (central podium, floating aisles, edges veiled by mist) is clear but static. Signals: +0.3 (early), +0.7 (closure present in final image). Frictions: postcard description without tactical constraint (−0.8), swappable with any fantastical library (−0.4). Net: 4.8.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>1.2</grade><comment>"During the lull on a store's very first opening day" is mentioned in the opening paragraph (setup) but never tracked or used to tighten a decision. No clock pressure, no urgency tied to the lull ending, and the vendor's actions unfold in a timeless sequence. Missing development and payoff gates. Caps: missing middle and closure (2.8), ornamental (−0.6). Net: 1.2.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The motivation "to find the place where stories begin" is declared early (setup) and summarized at the end ("his purpose fulfilled"), but never dramatized through friction, conflicting wants, or cost. The vendor's desire drives his journey to the library but does not complicate his choices once there—he places the bottle, watches, and succeeds without trade-off. Development gate is weak (the quest is pursued but not tested); payoff is told resolution. Signals: +0.3 (early). Frictions: told-only motivation (−0.7), no friction between wants and costs (−0.6). Net: 3.7.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Integrated fragmentation" as tone is signaled through phrasing ("fragmentary tone that stitched the library together in integrated fragmentation") and reflected in the mosaic of images and the prose's elevated, disjunctive rhythm. The tone is coherent across beats and does not flatten under pressure. However, it remains a static register rather than modulating to charge the final image—the closing chord and announcement maintain the same lyric distance as the opening. Signals: +0.8 (coherent, purposeful). Frictions: single static mood (−0.4), does not intensify at closure (−0.3). Net: 4.3.</comment>
