<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The "root-bound visionary" is labeled purposefully curious but never faces a choice that tests or contradicts that trait with cost. Interiority consists of abstract claims ("anxious elation," "steady resolve") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The protagonist experiences no genuine internal conflict; every impulse aligns conveniently with the next beat, and the final "smile" declares satisfaction without forfeiting anything on the page. Diagnostic label-speak ("anxious elation") appears repeatedly without dramatized tension.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed: who the visionary is, where exactly she stands, and what timeline constraint applies remain vague past 120 words, triggering the Orientation Test penalty (−0.4). The "eclipsed covenant" is declared but never dramatized as a live choice or obstacle; she reaches for the clipping and immediately receives the beacon with no reversal or cost. The ending claims transformation ("the world outside would soon awaken") but offers no on-page change in her options or knowledge—she steps back through the portal with no visible price paid or path foreclosed. No coherent drive lens emerges: the piece oscillates between causal promises (maze responds, portal opens) and accumulative texture (spirals, scars, filaments) without teaching a pattern or landing a decisive shift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The cobalt glade is mentioned in the opening and closing but does not constrain a single choice; it functions as backdrop. The maze topiary is described extensively yet never blocks, redirects, or alters her path—hedges "part like a living key" on command. Spatial choreography is generic: "center," "nearest hedge," "hidden alcove" provide no layout clarity or tactical consequence. The "perfectly cut maze topiary clipping" is introduced late and handled once without physical or mechanical detail.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>One dominant stake is signaled ("to find the intersection of dreams"), but no tightening or trade-off occurs. The maze parts, the clipping is grasped, the portal opens, and the beacon ignites in smooth sequence with no resistance, failure, or price. The protagonist's agency is passive reception: the world responds to her touch and whisper without her forfeiting time, safety, or relationship. Coincidence resolves every step—no decision narrows her options or costs her a live alternative.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Theme is asserted ("purpose thrives on curiosity's fire," "dreams dictate destiny") rather than earned through scene pressure. The "eclipsed covenant" is explained in the text ("not a contract of power, but a promise to bind dream to duty") instead of discovered through action. The final image recycles prompt language ("intersection of dreams," "root-bound visionary would become the bridge") without reweighting prior material or offering a non-literal answer. No thematic complexity emerges; the resolution is tidy and declarative.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distant third with stable focalization, but diction drifts into elevated register inconsistent with the character's perceptual signature ("pliant ribbon," "filament of color weaving a tapestry"). Sentence openings repeat stems: "She [verb]" appears in nine consecutive beats without variation. No distinct perceptual bias shapes what the visionary notices; descriptions read as authorial catalog rather than character filter. Psychic distance remains constant with no modulation under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Template cadence dominates: "She [verb], and [noun] [verb]" runs through the middle third without pattern-teaching or payoff, triggering −0.5. Paraphrase loops appear: "anxious elation" is restated three times across the piece without added pressure. Stock metaphors cluster: "ancient vines that whispered histories," "drum announcing a long‑awaited battle," "tapestry of collective desire." Figurative density in nearly every sentence of the climax obscures rather than sharpens the action. Information density is low; many sentences restate mood or reiterate setting without advancing situation or choice.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The premise—mystic enters maze, touches object, receives vision, gains power—follows a standard quest template without transformation. The "eclipsed covenant," "linking through scars," and "intersection of dreams" are prompt labels stacked without fresh synthesis or internal logic. No turn or intensification arises from the protagonist's blind spots or mistakes; every element cooperates on first attempt. The final image ("heart a compass pointing toward endless horizons") is abstract wish-fulfillment that could apply to any chosen-one arc.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The root-bound visionary is named early and present in every beat, but her choices do not create turns. She observes, recalls legend, places her palm, reaches, whispers, and steps—each action receives immediate cooperation from the world. No decision narrows her options or costs her a live alternative. Present throughout but causally passive; swappable with any mystic archetype.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The maze topiary clipping appears late (final third), is grasped once, and triggers the beacon. No second beat involvement; no evolving use or reweighted meaning. It resolves a problem (igniting the beacon) it did not help create. Late arrival and single-beat use cap the score despite closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>The eclipsed covenant is mentioned early and explained mid-story ("a promise to bind dream to duty"), but it does not constrain tactics or alter her choices on the page. It functions as thematic label rather than a live stake she must negotiate or pay for. Ornamental setup without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Purposefully curious" is labeled in the opening paragraph but never constrains or enables an on-page action. No moment shows her curiosity costing her safety, time, or certainty, nor does it drive a trade-off. Label-only mention without dramatized consequence.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Heed" appears early ("heed the silence of the old stones") and recurs in the penultimate line ("heed the silent call of the hedges"), framing her approach and the final broadcast. It shapes one key turn—her decision to listen to the hedges—and charges the ending's directive. Two-beat involvement with lyric reprise, but her "heeding" does not cost her an alternative or force a trade-off; progression is smooth.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Linking through scars" is introduced early as method ("mapping each wound of the hedgerows to the pulsing veins of the earth") and recurs at closure ("linking through scars of history to a future"). It appears in two beats and contributes to thematic framing, but the mechanics remain abstract—no on-page demonstration of how scars constrain or enable her actions. Present and signaled, but swappable with any mystic-connection metaphor.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The cobalt glade at dusk is named in the opening line, recurs at the climax ("the cobalt glade at dusk seemed to inhale"), and closes the piece ("The glade's cobalt hue deepened"). It supplies the alcove and the hedges, but does not pressure her choices—the maze parts on command. Early signal, three-beat presence, and closure participation earn mid-band, but it does not constrain tactics or alter outcome.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"After the future arrives early" is mentioned once in the opening third ("after the future arrives early, bending time into a pliant ribbon") and again near the end ("The future, arriving early, now unfolded"). It does not tighten decisions, create urgency, or alter her moves. Ornamental time-motif without mechanical consequence.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"To find the intersection of dreams" is stated early and becomes her declared goal. It appears in the middle ("Her motivation became clear") and at closure ("she had found the intersection of dreams"). Present in three beats and frames her quest, but no friction between this want and another desire is dramatized—she pursues it without cost or competing pull. Told motivation without on-page conflict.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>"Anxious elation" is named early, repeated at the portal crossing ("anxious elation rise to a roar"), and resolved in the final third ("anxious elation settle into a steady resolve"). The tone is asserted rather than embodied through contradictory sensory detail or syntax modulation. Present across beats but static in its claim; no tonal shift charges the final image.</comment>
