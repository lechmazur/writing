<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Selene's motivation ("trading doubts for beauty") is declared but never dramatized through contradictory impulses in scene. Her "innocently cunning" trait remains label-only; no on-page micro-choice reveals a cost or hierarchy of values. The glassblower appears as audience in a single beat without applying pressure. Interiority relies on abstract phrasing ("fractured palette of her own sight") rather than embodied perception under stress.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural, but the pattern of "bartered awakenings" is asserted in every paragraph without a single causal tightening that narrows options or changes knowledge. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within the first sentence, so no penalty there. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration via the glass-flower garden, but no visible cost or foreclosed path is legible on the page; the courtyard simply "awakens fully" without resistance or trade-off. The piece teaches a lyric accumulation pattern early, but the ending does not reweight prior material—it extends the same declarative mode.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The glassblower's courtyard, phoenix, furnace, and concertina reed are named and described, establishing a vivid symbolic environment. However, the courtyard functions as backdrop rather than constraint; no choice is shaped by access, proximity, or material properties. The phoenix's "bruised sky" and glass walls "humming with spectrum" remain ornamental. Spatial choreography is loose—potted ferns, ivy, lotus, and cereus appear without clear positioning or causal interaction with Selene's movement.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Selene's quest to perceive beauty in imperfection—is signaled early but never tested by a reversal or tightening. Each "bartered awakening" is performed identically (arrange plants → reed sings → new hue perceived) with no escalation, resistance, or cost. The glassblower's arrival and the final glass-flower garden are additions, not consequences of prior pressure. No visible price alters later tactics; Selene's plan succeeds without friction.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The theme of beauty-in-imperfection is stated overtly ("imperfection was the truest melody," "celebrates the story each fissure tells") rather than emerging from enacted particulars. The concertina reed and phoenix function as symbolic tokens recurred mechanically without reweighting meaning. The glassblower's closing wisdom is a thematic echo—moralizing in place of scene pressure. One small credit: the colorblind protagonist's sensory substitution (perceiving "through cadence of shadows and whisper of metal") offers a specific inflection, though underexploited.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present (synesthetic color perception, attention to cracked tiles and uneven brushstrokes) but diction drifts into elevated register ("asymmetrical grace," "luminous cadence," "Conceptual Repricing") incongruous with a painter's embodied experience. Dialogue with the glassblower is brief and functional but lacks subtext or goal pursuit. Filter verbs ("felt the courtyard awaken," "perceived the world") stack in high-pressure beats, dulling immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Pervasive paraphrase loops: "bartered awakenings" and "innocently cunning" appear in nine paragraphs, often rephrased without advancing pressure. Template cadence dominates: "She [verb], [result]" structure recurs in seven sentences. Figurative language ("phoenix's ember," "breathing spine," "living canvas") appears in most sentences of the courtyard-awakening beat without pattern-taught payoff. Mixed metaphor: the concertina reed "tongue" both "speaks" and "sings" while also functioning as a "breathing spine." These artifacts cluster throughout, including the closure beat. Apply cumulative artifact penalty (−1.7 per patterned-artifact pack) and disallow 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The premise—colorblind painter gains synesthetic perception through plant-language-music interface—is conceptually inventive but executed via stock moves: magical object, immediate success, wise mentor validates work. The phoenix framing device is ornamental; removing it would not alter Selene's arc. "Bartered awakenings" as a phrase is recurred for texture rather than transformed through specific choices. No bold risk-taking; the courtyard-as-canvas ending is telegraphed and delivers symmetric satisfaction without cost.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Selene is present throughout but makes no choice that alters tactics or forecloses a path. Her colorblindness is mentioned twice but does not constrain action; she perceives synesthetic hues without friction. She arranges plants repeatedly, but each iteration is identical—no reversal or cost. The glassblower validates her at the end without Selene having to defend or revise. Present but passive.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The concertina reed tongue appears in six beats: corner discovery, jade spider plant vibration, furnace warming, ivy-lotus finale, promised sunrise return. It enables the plant-to-color translation throughout, so it drives repeated moves. However, its mechanics are static—no evolution, constraint, or reweighted meaning at closure. Setup, development, and closure presence met, but no causal pressure or visible cost tied to the object itself. Swappable with "magic flute" or similar device.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Bartered awakenings" is a thematic label recurred in ten paragraphs but never dramatized as a transaction with cost. Selene offers "a splash of sunrise pigment" once, but no stakes hinge on the exchange—she never runs out, faces refusal, or sacrifices anything else. The concept echoes across the text without shaping options or altering tactics. Ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"Innocently cunning" is declared three times ("innocently cunning," "innocent scheme," "innocently cunning plan") without a single on-page action demonstrating the trait's constraint or tradeoff. The attribute is label-only; no choice reveals how innocence and cunning coexist or create friction. Does not enable or constrain.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Awaken" drives the central action: Selene arranges plants to awaken the reed's translations, she feels the courtyard awaken at the jade spider plant beat, and the courtyard "awoke fully" at the ivy-lotus finale. Three distinct uses across setup, middle, and closure. However, each awakening is additive rather than turning—removing "awaken" and substituting "activate" or "connect" would not break structure. Causal role in multiple beats but replaceable verb.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plant arrangement appears in four beats: secret patterns with ferns, rosemary-cactus pairing, ivy-lotus coaxing, night-blooming cereus circle. The method is signaled early and recurs, shaping repeated attempts. Yet the mechanics are vague—no pattern is specified, no failed arrangement forces revision. The method enables action but imposes no cost or constraint; any arrangement succeeds. Functional but low specificity.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The glassblower's courtyard is named in the opening and closing, anchoring location. Props (shards, furnace, glass walls, vines, potted ferns) are mentioned but do not constrain movement or choice—Selene moves freely among them. The glass walls "humming" and glass flowers sprouting at the end are effects, not resources. Setup and closure participation met, but no middle development beat where the setting alters tactics. Postcard description.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"After the phoenix rises" frames the opening; "phoenix's ember would still linger" at the promised sunrise return closes the piece. The timeframe is poetic rather than pressuring—no clock tightens Selene's decisions, and the phoenix rebirth is past tense throughout. Two-touch lyric reprise without causal work. Ornamental frame.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.3</grade><comment>"To find beauty in imperfection" is declared as motivation in paragraph one and restated at closure ("quest to find beauty in imperfection was itself a gentle bargain"). Selene enacts the desire by painting cracked vases and courtyard fragments, so it drives subject choice. However, no friction arises—she never doubts, fears failure, or sacrifices a competing want. The motivation is told and illustrated but not conflicted. Functional, low tension.</comment>
