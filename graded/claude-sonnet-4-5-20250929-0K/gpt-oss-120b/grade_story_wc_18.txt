<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Arlen's motives are declared ("capture a runaway dream") but never tested by a competing want or internal friction. His actions—aligning the sextant, breathing with the orchard—feel like ritual steps performed without struggle or cost that forecloses a path. The piece tells us he "believed" and "understood" but no embodied contradiction or micro-choice under pressure appears on the page. The final smile and promise arrive without visible sacrifice or renunciation that would earn a change.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The story provides who (Arlen), where (orchard), and what (capture the dream) within tolerance, so no orientation penalty applies. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers images (fog, sextant, mirror, frost) in a ritual cadence. However, the closure unit—the dream entering the mirror and Arlen's promise to guard it—lands without dramatized cost or a clear before/after in options or stance. The dream's "capture" is asserted by description ("the mirror's surface rippled, catching the dream's flicker"), not earned through a choice that narrows possibilities or a reversal that reweights prior material. No visible price is paid; the world simply grants success.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The orchard fog and twilight frost are vivid and recur purposefully, and the sextant and mirror function as micro-setting objects. The fog "thinning to silver ribbons" and the final "glass-mountain hush" provide sensory specificity. The environment does not, however, constrain a choice or meaningfully limit Arlen's ritual—he performs each step successfully. Spatial choreography is clean (stump, horizon, trees) and the idiom ("glass-mountain tone of silence") is consistent, but the setting remains a backdrop rather than a pressure that shapes tactics or the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—capture the runaway dream—is signaled early, but no reversal or complication appears. Each step of Arlen's ritual (alignment, synchronized breathing, chanting) succeeds without adjustment or cost. The dream "slipped from the horizon" and was "pulling…into the glass" by authorial fiat, not protagonist agency or a forced trade-off. The resolution grants success without a visible price, narrowing of options, or an earned turn. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure should deepen through density or cadence shift; here the rhythm remains uniform and no tightening occurs.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The theme of "erasing boundaries" is stated directly ("boundaries are merely shadows of fear"; "not the removal of lines, but the weaving together of separate songs") rather than emerging from concrete action and cost. The final image—Arlen resting, the dream's heartbeat matching the orchard's pulse—gestures toward unity but lacks an earned non-literal answer that reweights prior material. The piece leans on abstractions ("renewal," "expand," "erasing the space between") instead of letting particulars generate thematic resonance. The closing tone is serene and summative, typical of a prompt-driven moral rather than a lived discovery.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable in close third, and the diction ("coaxing silvered glass," "glass-mountain tone of silence") carries a consistent lyric register. However, perceptual signature is thin—Arlen's way of noticing does not reveal character-specific priorities or biases. Under pressure, the narrator does not compress or shift rhythm; each beat maintains the same ornate cadence regardless of stakes. Filter verbs ("felt," "understood," "believed") appear frequently without voice motivation, dulling immediacy. The prose reads as a single textured voice rather than a mind under stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>High figurative density pervades without pattern-teaching or payoff: "glass-mountain tone of silence," "fog curl into his lungs," "needles aligning with the captured light as if a compass for hope," "veins of silver," "tiny mirror" leaves. Many adjacent sentences restate the same event in elevated synonyms (e.g., "the sextant's broken arm seemed to straighten" followed by "the fog…sealing the cracks with vapor"). Template cadence runs appear: "He set…Then he placed…He began…With each cycle…" Loops and scaffold trigger cumulative penalties. Stock metaphors ("boundaries are merely shadows," "portal that hummed") and elevated diction ("coiling like ivy," "forged in fog") cluster in peak beats, reducing clarity and propulsion. Total deductions exceed −1.4 and the artifacts touch the closure beat, disqualifying 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>The core premise—a mirror maker captures an escaped dream through ritual breath-work—reads as a generic fantasy template: artisan + mystical object + poetic quest. The ritual steps (align, breathe, chant, succeed) follow predictable beats without friction or transformation. Figurative language ("glass mountains," "luminous thread," "fog as breath") recurs from common metaphor banks. No turn, intensification, or final image grows from unexpected causality or character-specific choice; the ending grants symmetric satisfaction (dream captured, orchard renewed, Arlen smiles) without a bold or non-obvious synthesis. The derivative premise is not transformed by lived detail or an earned moral calculus, warranting a −1.0 adjustment within Q8.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Arlen is present throughout and performs ritual actions (sets sextant, places palms, inhales, whispers verses, exhales). Setup and development gates are met. However, his actions are procedural steps without decision points that alter tactics. No competing want or cost-driven choice appears; he succeeds at each beat by narrative fiat. He does not appear causally in the closure—he "lowered his hands" and "rested," passive observation rather than a turn. Swappable with any ritual artisan. Late development penalty −0.5, ornamental closure −0.6, swappability −0.6, cumulative cap at −1.0 applied.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The sextant appears in setup (broken, carried, "sang of distant stars"), development (set on stump, aligned toward moon, "broken arm seemed to straighten"), and closure ("repaired by breath and fog, pointed toward the heart of the orchard"). Three distinct beats; causal pressure (Arlen's ritual targets it); closure linkage (it becomes "a silent sentinel"). Specificity moderate—its broken state and astronomer origin matter. However, it does not constrain a choice or impose cost; Arlen simply succeeds. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.2, minus swappability −0.5 (any broken mystical tool would fit), lands mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The concept "erasing boundaries" is stated three times as thematic claim ("boundaries are merely shadows of fear," "weaving together of separate songs," "erasing the space between") but does not shape stakes or constrain tactics on the page. Arlen's actions—synchronized breathing, chanting—are ritual steps, not boundary-crossing choices with visible cost. The concept functions as abstract theme rather than a pressure that alters options. Present in all three gates as idea but not as dramatized cost. Ornamental −0.8, theme-only use −0.6, cumulative cap −1.0 applied.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Firmly grounded" appears twice ("hands…firmly grounded in the ancient craft"; "his feet anchor into the earth, his presence firmly grounded") as description, not as a trait that enables or constrains action with cost. It does not alter a choice or create friction; Arlen succeeds at grounding without struggle. Label-only mentions trend low. Setup gate met (first paragraph), absent from middle choices, closure gate weak (static reprise). Ornamental −0.8, label-only −0.5, cumulative cap −1.0 applied.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Recreate" is Arlen's stated goal ("recreate the sextant's lost precision") and frames the middle ritual (breathing, fog "sealing the cracks"). Setup and development gates met. However, the action succeeds without complication or cost—each exhale "seemed to straighten" the arm until "repaired." No turn traces to this action; it is a successful procedure rather than a choice that redefines options. Closure participation is passive (result declared). Early signal +0.5, one beat +0.4, minus swappability −0.7 (any mystical repair would fit), ornamental closure −0.6, cumulative cap −1.0 applied.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The method "synchronized breathing" is signaled early ("a rhythm, a synchronized breathing with the orchard's sighs"), developed across multiple beats ("each exhale matching the rustle," "Arlen inhaled deeper…syncing with the dream's pulse," "exhaled, and the mirror's surface rippled"), and present at closure ("the same synchronized breathing that had birthed it"). Three distinct beats; mechanics matter (breath "welding unseen filaments," "pulling [the dream] into the glass"). However, it does not constrain—Arlen succeeds at each attempt without adjustment. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +0.8, closure linkage +1.0, minus no-cost −0.8, swappability −0.6 (any mystical breathing rite), cumulative cap −1.0 applied.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The orchard and fog are vividly described throughout ("cracked paths," "thick fog," "dead leaves," "ghostly silhouettes," "roots like veins of silver," "scent of ripened apples") and frame the entire scene. Setup and closure gates strong. However, the setting does not constrain Arlen's choices or supply resources that affect outcome; it is a backdrop for ritual rather than a pressure. The fog responds to Arlen's will ("thinning to silver ribbons") without resistance. Early signal +0.7, closure linkage +1.2, minus postcard use −0.8, no constraint −1.0, cumulative cap −1.0 applied.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"Upon the shimmer of twilight frost" anchors the opening mood and recurs in closure ("twilight frost lingered, casting a silver glow"). Setup and closure gates met. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions or impose a deadline; Arlen's ritual proceeds at his own pace with no urgency. Night falls at the end by narrative convenience, not causal pressure. Time is atmospheric rather than a tactical constraint. Setup +0.5, closure reprise +0.8, minus vague tracking −0.7, no pressure −0.9, cumulative cap −1.0 applied.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The motivation "to capture a runaway dream" is stated early ("He had come…to capture a runaway dream") and drives Arlen's ritual. Present in setup, development, and closure (dream enters the mirror, Arlen promises to guard it). However, the desire is told without friction—no competing want or cost that dramatizes the choice. Arlen succeeds without sacrifice or a moment where the dream's capture forces a trade-off. Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, minus told-only −0.8, no friction −0.9, cumulative cap −1.0 applied.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The tone "glass mountains" appears as recurring idiom ("glass-mountain tone of silence," "glass mountains of twilight," "glass-mountain hush") establishing a lyric, crystalline register. Present in setup and closure. The tone remains static—no modulation with pressure; each beat maintains the same ornate, elevated cadence regardless of stakes. It does not charge the final image with new meaning, only repeats. Setup +0.6, closure reprise +0.9, coherence +0.4, minus static mood −0.8, no charge −0.9, cumulative cap −1.0 applied.</comment>
