<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Lira's personality-molting trait is declared but never shown constraining a choice or creating visible cost on the page. The partnership with Rook is asserted through summary ("their friendship sparked") rather than dramatized through embodied interaction. Interiority consists almost entirely of lyric declaration ("wore the world's wandering scars like a coat") without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final stance—"We have rebuilt a garden in stone"—arrives as statement rather than earned through prior micro-choices under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation remains vague past 120 words: "prison library" is not anchored spatially or temporally until well into the piece, and the relationship between the opening vagrant scene and the prison setting is never clarified (−0.4 for orientation debt; Q3 capped at 7.0). No on-page decisive change occurs; the piece summarizes a year-long transformation in pure tell, then adds more summary of travelers arriving. The inferred lens is Accumulative, but no closure unit lands with cost—the final image is a declarative summary ("the blooming resistance lived on") without a visible constraint, forfeiture, or reweighted image. Causality is replaced by and-then sequencing: coffee tin appears, seeds are planted, library glows, travelers arrive, all without because/therefore linkage or motivated ellipsis.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The "rusted library under stars" is invoked repeatedly but never grounds spatial choreography or constrains a choice. Sensory detail defaults to stock imagery: "moon cleared the skyline," "silver glaze turning the rusted iron into veins of light." The setting functions as backdrop rather than pressure; no on-page action depends on proximity, access, or environmental friction. The wildflowers sprouting in stone cracks are described but do not alter tactics or charge the ending.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>The declared stake—"to forge beauty from anarchy"—is abstract and never tested on the page through a choice that forecloses a live option. No reversal or meaningful tightening occurs; the piece summarizes a year of work without depicting a moment where success is in doubt or a price must be paid. The resolution is convenience summary: "the library glowed with lanterns," "travelers arrived," with no protagonist agency driving the turn. Pressure is absent; escalation is replaced by declarative accretion.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Theme ("beauty from chaos") is stated explicitly in dialogue—"We have rebuilt a garden in stone, and the world will hear its song"—and repeated in near-identical phrasing throughout, replacing earned resonance with assertion (−0.6 for final-paragraph moralizing). Motifs (coffee tin, wildflowers, moon) are introduced and recycled without constraining choice or reweighting meaning at closure. The piece offers no ambiguity or counter-reading; every element announces its symbolic function. The final image is a thematic echo rather than a concrete particular that invites reflection.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>POV is nominally third-person limited to Lira but frequently drifts into omniscient summary ("Word of the luminous fracture spread beyond the prison walls"). Diction toggles between lyric elevation ("trembling candle against night") and flat exposition ("arranged books by theme rather than code") without voice-motivated reason. Lira and Rook speak in identical register: both produce perfectly articulated thematic statements. No perceptual signature distinguishes the focalizer's way of noticing. The single line of dialogue ("What rebellion hides in a cup?") carries no subtext or goal pursuit.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: "rusted library under stars" / "prison library, rusted yet stubborn" / "beneath the rusted library under stars." Template cadence dominates the final third: "Each night Lira shed... / Rook, in turn, offered... / The coffee tin's false bottom... / Lira planted..." (−0.8 for clustered stem runs; 9+ disallowed globally). Stock metaphors stack without tension: "trembling candle," "veins of light," "mosaic of green light." Synonym churn for "rebuild" / "reconstruction" / "rebuilt" across adjacent lines adds −0.2. Nearly every sentence in the second half restates prior content without added pressure, momentum collapses into summary, and the final paragraph is pure scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Core premise—resistance through storytelling in a prison library—maps closely to widely used "books as rebellion" templates without transformation through specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus (−0.8 for derivative premise within Q8). Turns are predictable: seeds sprout, light spreads, travelers gather. The wildflower-as-hope symbol and the "false bottom" device are stock choices. No risk-taking or unconventional structure; the piece executes a checklist without surprise or synthesis.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Lira is present throughout but makes no on-page decision that alters tactics or outcome; she is described planting seeds and welcoming travelers in pure summary. The personality-molting trait is label-only. Late closure cameo ("stood beside Rook and whispered") does not count as causal participation. Swappable with "activist poet" or similar.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Coffee tin appears in one beat (handed by guard), its false bottom is opened once (revealing seed packets), then it is mentioned as "now a beacon" in summary. Two touches across the text but no evolving use or charged reprise at closure; the ending does not return to the tin with reweighted meaning. Functional but replaceable with any container.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Blooming resistance" is named explicitly and used as a theme label ("the blooming resistance they vowed to nurture," "the blooming resistance lived on") but does not shape on-page stakes or constrain a choice. The wildflowers are planted off-page (summarized) and their growth is described rather than shown affecting tactics. Present as concept, not dramatized pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>1.9</grade><comment>The trait "molts personalities monthly" is declared twice ("each month she molted a new personality," "Each night Lira shed the skin of her current persona") but never shown on the page. No visible cost, no choice enabled or constrained by the molting. Ornamental label without action pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.3</grade><comment>"Rebuild" is the verb throughout ("to rebuild the shattered world," "act of rebuilding," "We have rebuilt a garden") but every instance is summary. No single on-page beat dramatizes the act of rebuilding with stakes or friction. Easily swappable with "restore" or "repair" without structural change.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.2</grade><comment>Friendship "sparked" while sorting books is mentioned once in the middle ("Their friendship sparked, ignited while she and a quiet inmate named Rook sorted forgotten tomes") but the sorting itself is not shown; it is backdrop to a dialogue exchange about the tin. The method does not shape any beat or tactic. Ornamental mention.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The "rusted library under stars" is named in the opening and closing and invoked in nearly every paragraph, but it never supplies a resource or constraint that alters a choice. Spatial choreography is absent. The setting frames mood but does not pressure tactics. Early signal and closure reprise lift it above ornamental, but swappable with any institutional refuge.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"As the moon cleared the skyline" appears twice as a time marker but does not tighten decisions or impose a clock. Time is vague (one night stretches into a year in summary) and untracked. The timeframe does not shape tactics or escalation. Decorative rather than functional.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>"To forge beauty from anarchy" is stated explicitly in dialogue and narration but never dramatized as a conflicted desire. Lira and Rook execute the goal without friction, cost, or want-versus-fear tension. Told-only motivation without on-page struggle. Present in closure (the whispered line) but as theme claim, not felt pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Luminous fracture" is named twice and echoed in images of light breaking through rust and darkness. Tone attempts lyric elevation but is inconsistent: toggles between poetic compression ("trembling candle against night") and flat exposition ("arranged books by theme rather than code"). The fracture metaphor is present in the final image ("a luminous fracture stitched into the night forever") but does not modulate with pressure or charge the ending with earned cost. Static mood with forced closure reprise.</comment>
