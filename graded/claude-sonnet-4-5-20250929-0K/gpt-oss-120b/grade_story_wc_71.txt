<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The narrator remains passive throughout, observing rather than making choices under pressure. Interiority consists largely of abstract aesthetic claims ("inadvertently profound," "hushed blaze") without embodied emotion or contradiction. The single micro-choice—buying the shard—lacks visible cost or foreclosed alternatives. The ending declares sanctification and alignment but never dramatizes the weight of silence or any genuine struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>No clear closure unit. The story circles through a series of observations and atmosphere-building without a decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing that lands with cost. The narrator walks, buys a shard, places it on a bench, and walks away feeling aligned—no path is foreclosed, no option narrowed, no felt price paid. The Orientation Test passes (who/where/when anchored early), but the ending offers only asserted transformation without on-page consequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The bay, pier, and perfumer's shop are vividly rendered with purposeful sensory detail (brine, amber halos, milky shard). However, the setting never constrains a choice or charges the final image—it remains atmospheric backdrop. The shard's placement on a bench and the houses' synchronized sigh are described but do not alter tactics or stakes, keeping this functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding why houses feel alive—is declared but never tested on the page. No opposition, no tightening, no reversal. The shard radiates hush without resistance, the elderly woman affirms the narrator's experience, and the ending grants sanctification without cost. Coincidence (finding the shard, its perfect effect) resolves the question the narrator never struggled to answer.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Theme is stated rather than earned: "silence can be as vivid as any color," "we have learned to hear the hush." The orris root shard functions as symbolic convenience, introduced and immediately harvested for meaning. The final paragraph moralizes directly ("I will continue to notice the creeping normality...") instead of letting image and action create resonance. No thematic tension or counter-reading emerges.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The voice is consistent and lyrical, but diction drifts into elevated abstraction disconnected from the narrator's stated role ("sanctify," "inadvertently profound," "hushed blaze"). Perceptual signature is generic aesthetic appreciation rather than character-specific noticing. No dialogue. Psychic distance remains stable, but the prose texture feels more committee-poetic than individually grounded, especially in peak beats where specificity would anchor the voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Pervasive paraphrase loops and thesaurus churn: "quiet bay" / "calm," "hush" / "silence" / "quiet" recycled across adjacent lines without pressure. Template cadence dominates ("I was there not for... but to," "I felt the... not as... but as"). Stock metaphors cluster in the final third ("pulse like a heart," "warm ember," "lights the path"). Mixed vehicle: streetlights both daydream and are "fully awake." Figurative density in most sentences without clear payoff. Apply −1.4 for patterned artifacts touching closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The premise—silence as perfume, houses that breathe—echoes familiar lyric-essay templates without transformation. The narrator's passivity and the shard's convenient power feel median-safe rather than risky. The "creeping normality noticer" frame promises insight but delivers generic aesthetic touring. No bold structural or perspectival choice heightens stakes; the story opts for prettiness over pressure.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>The "creeping normality noticer" observes throughout but makes no key turn. The single choice—buying the shard—is frictionless and does not alter tactics or foreclose a path.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The orris root shard appears in three beats (shop, bench, pocket) and is described with specificity. However, it resolves a problem (understanding houses) it did not help create, and its use is static—place and feel—without evolving pressure or visible cost tied to it.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"A shard of hush" is labeled and described but does not shape tactics or narrow options on the page. It functions as atmospheric metaphor without causal pressure or tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>1.9</grade><comment>"Inadvertently profound" is attributed to the shard in one line without constraining or enabling any action. Label-only.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Sanctify" appears twice (narrator's hope, final paragraph claim) but is never dramatized as an action with cost. Easily swappable with "bless" or "hallow" without structural impact.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Through displaced objects" is mentioned once (coffee cup, bottle, flower) in a single descriptive passage without shaping attempts or altering tactics. Ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The "quiet bay in spring" is signaled early, shapes the opening atmosphere, and returns in the final reflection. It provides locale but does not pressure choices or supply resources that affect outcome. Lyric reprise reweights the setting's importance but without causal force.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"While the streetlights daydream" appears in the opening and closing as metaphor. Time is dawn-to-day but remains vague and does not tighten decisions or alter tactics. Present but not functional.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"To understand why some houses feel alive" is stated early and returned to at the end. The narrator pursues this desire by walking and buying the shard, but no friction or conflicting cost tests the motivation. Told more than dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Hushed blaze" appears as metaphor throughout (ember, glow, hush) and modulates with the dawn-to-day progression. Tone remains coherent but does not charge the final image with undeniable pressure; it stays lyrical and static rather than escalating.</comment>
