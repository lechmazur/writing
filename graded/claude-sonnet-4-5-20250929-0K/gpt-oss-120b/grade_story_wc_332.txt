<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mara's interiority is highly abstract and lacks embodied contradiction under pressure. Her motivation ("to capture a runaway dream") is told through backstory rather than tested through on-page choices with visible cost. The merchant's tale and the pearl function as exposition rather than dramatic friction. Lio appears briefly but applies no relational pressure; his sudden attunement reads as authorial convenience rather than earned connection.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Orientation Test: who (Mara), where (lighthouse library/archipelago), and when (sunrise ritual) arrive within the first 120 words, but the spatial and temporal frame remains vague throughout—no clear before/after or stakes test. The ending offers a thematic statement ("longing, when shared, becomes a light") but no decisive change, cost, or reconfiguration; Mara's actions do not foreclose a path or alter her stance. The lens reads as Accumulative/Textural, but no density increase or cadence shift reweights the stake with legible cost. Closure is asserted rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The whispering archipelago, lighthouse library, and sunrise setting provide vivid sensory anchors (sea breezes, crumbling stairwell, soft blues and amber). The watercolor palette and camera function as micro-setting that constrains Mara's ritual. However, spatial choreography is fuzzy—Lio's boat, the cliff, and the water lack clear distances or sightlines. The setting enables atmosphere but does not pressure a choice at closure, capping the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake (capturing the runaway dream) is signaled early but remains abstract and unchanging. No on-page reversal or tightening narrows options; Mara's sunrise ritual succeeds without obstacle, and Lio's net "filled with a shimmering filament" resolves the quest via coincidence rather than protagonist agency. The ending declares success ("the islands glowed with a soft, endless sunrise") without visible cost or trade-off. Escalation is absent under any lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Theme (longing as shared light, the cipher as bridge) emerges from recurring images—jasmine, luminous absence, the pearl—but the final paragraph states the theme overtly: "longing, when shared, becomes a light that never truly fades." This moralizing replaces scene pressure and violates the "non-literal answer" test. The watercolor palette and sunrise photography recur but do not reweight meaning through dramatized cost; they remain decorative motifs. Subtext is thin; most meaning is asserted rather than implied.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Mara until the brief shift to Lio, which occurs at a clear paragraph break and does not head-hop. Diction is elevated and lyrical but uniform throughout—"luminous absence," "cipher of longing," "hush of improbable beginnings"—creating a drone rather than modulating with pressure. Perceptual signature is vague; Mara's way of noticing reads generic rather than character-specific. No dialogue appears. Register remains consistent but lacks the embodied texture or micro-choices that would anchor voice to Mara's particular consciousness.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Density of figurative language is high without pattern-teaching or payoff: "fragments of forgotten songs," "books themselves seemed to breathe," "luminous absence," "cipher of longing," "runaway dream," "sea holding a secret lantern" appear in nearly every sentence. Multiple paraphrase loops: "translate the palette's glow into tangible images" / "The resulting photographs became a cipher"; "vitalize these images" / "vitalizing the photograph with a pulse"; "whispered the cipher into the wind" / "the archipelago would carry it across the islands." Template cadence with "She [verb]" stems across four consecutive sentences mid-passage. Filter-verb stack: "She believed," "She recalled," "She sensed," "She recognized," "She realized" in close proximity. Apply cumulative artifact penalty of −1.4 and disallow 9+ globally per Q7 guidance.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The core premise—librarian uses light-painting to capture dreams—offers a fresh surface, but the story does not transform it through specific lived detail or grounded choice. The merchant's pearl, jasmine scent, and luminous filament read as stock magical-realism symbols without irreplaceability; swap "pearl" for "star" or "song" and the emotional arc remains unchanged. The ending's declaration ("the islands glowed with a soft, endless sunrise") is tidy and abstract rather than offering a non-obvious synthesis. No bold structural risk; the lyric mode smooths over rather than heightens stakes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Mara is present throughout and her role (odd-hour librarian tending the lighthouse library) is signaled early. However, her choices do not create key turns; she performs a ritual (climb, set up camera, paint with light) that succeeds without obstacle or tactical shift. The ending describes her watching and feeling "quiet joy" but no decision alters her stance or the outcome. She is the focalizer but not an active agent in the plot's escalation. Cap at 3.4 per missing middle development that constrains choice.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The watercolor palette appears in the opening ("weather-worn watercolor palette, its pigments faded") and returns in the closing line ("rested the watercolor palette beside the lantern"). Mara uses it to "paint with light" in the middle passage, mixing "soft blues with the amber of sunrise." However, its mechanics are vague—how light-painting works or constrains her process is never shown—and it does not alter tactics or impose cost. Setup and closure participation are present; middle development is weak. Swappability is moderate; a generic "brush" or "lens" could substitute with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The "cipher of longing" is named five times and defined as "a secret language that whispered the islanders' unspoken wishes back to the sea" and "encoded in the sky, waiting for a librarian who could read its silent script." It shapes Mara's goal (decode and share the cipher) and appears in the ending ("the cipher of longing was not a puzzle to be solved but a bridge"). Setup and payoff are clear. However, it does not constrain a middle choice or impose visible cost; Mara's decoding succeeds without friction. The concept functions as theme marker rather than story engine.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Paints with light" is described early ("the uncanny ability to paint with light") and demonstrated when Mara mixes palette colors "allowing the colors to bleed into the glass of her camera." The trait enables her sunrise photography but does not impose cost or constrain her tactically; she succeeds without trade-off or failure. The phrase "vitalize" (related action) appears four times but remains abstract. Label-only use trends low; no visible price or alternative foreclosed on the page.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Vitalize" appears as the key action: "vitalize these images with her palette's light," "vitalizing the photograph with a pulse," "the light Mara had vitalized," "vitalizing each other's work." Setup is early; the action recurs. However, its mechanics are opaque—what does "vitalize" mean concretely?—and it does not create a turn or impose cost. Mara's vitalization succeeds without obstacle; Lio's net rises filled with light but no choice or trade-off precedes it. The action is thematically central but swappable with "charge," "infuse," or "animate" with no structural impact.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Sunrise photography" is signaled early ("through sunrise photography translate the palette's glow into tangible images") and demonstrated in the middle passage when Mara sets up the camera, mixes colors, and presses the shutter. The method enables her core ritual. However, the mechanics are vague—how the camera interacts with the palette's light is asserted, not shown—and it does not constrain her attempts or impose cost. The method shapes one beat but is not tested or reweighted at closure. Setup and middle development are present; payoff is weak.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>The "whispering archipelago" is named in the opening and provides spatial anchors (sea breezes, lighthouse, reef, islands, cliff, water). Mara's lighthouse library and Lio's boat establish separate locations within the archipelago. However, the setting does not pressure Mara's choices or supply resources that affect outcome; it functions as backdrop. The wind carries the cipher "across the islands" at the end, but this is passive conveyance rather than constraint. Setup and closure mention are present; middle development that alters tactics is absent. Cap at 4.6 per missing middle constraint.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"The hush of improbable beginnings" appears twice, framing Mara's sunrise ritual as a moment when "the world holding its breath for her next revelation" and later "a bridge, formed whenever light, memory, and desire met in the hush of impossible beginnings." The timeframe is lyric and abstract rather than a live clock. It establishes tone but does not tighten decisions or tactics; Mara's ritual occurs at her own pace without urgency. Setup and thematic payoff are present; no middle beat uses the timeframe to narrow options or raise cost.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Mara's motivation "to capture a runaway dream that had once danced on the lips of a wandering merchant" is stated early and drives her ritual. The dream is linked to the luminous pearl and the cipher. Her desire is consistent and shapes her actions (climbing, photographing, whispering the cipher). However, the motivation is told through backstory ("She recalled the merchant's tale") rather than tested through conflicting choices. No friction between wants and costs appears; Mara's pursuit succeeds without sacrifice or doubt. Setup and plot alignment are strong; dramatized conflict is absent. One turn shaped, no visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Luminous absence" is named three times and permeates the diction: "books themselves seemed to breathe in the luminous absence of daylight," "In that luminous absence, Mara recognized the runaway dream," "a quiet joy blossom within the luminous absence." The tone is coherent and purposeful, establishing a lyric register of longing and light. It modulates slightly—wonder at the opening, recognition in the middle, quiet joy at the end—but remains a single static mood rather than tensioning with pressure. The tone charges the final image by framing the ending's "soft, endless sunrise" within the established "luminous absence." Setup, development, and payoff are present; modulation under pressure is limited.</comment>
