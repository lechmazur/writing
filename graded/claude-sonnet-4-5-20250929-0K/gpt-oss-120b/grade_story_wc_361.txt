<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The courier remains jittery throughout without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; his motivation to spread wonder is declared but never tested against a competing want or cost. The shepherd and girl receive wonder passively with no agency that pressures the courier's choices. The absent mentor functions as thematic decoration rather than a constraint that forces a difficult trade-off. Interior voice relies on stock phrasing ("tiny miracle," "spark of wonder") and the final triumph arrives without visible forfeit.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: recurring images (pendant glow, aurora, vibration) accumulate toward a thematic statement about myth-making. Closure attempts Conceptual Repricing—the ridgeway becomes pilgrimage site, wonder spreads across generations—but the cost is asserted rather than dramatized; no on-page action forecloses a path or reweights prior material with felt pressure. The courier vanishes into glow without agency or sacrifice, and the coda tells us legend has germinated rather than showing a decisive image. Orientation is clean (aurora-lit ridgeway, jittery courier, pendant established early). The sequence proceeds by accretion rather than because/therefore linkage, which fits the lens, but the ending delivers theme summary instead of a charged final image with undeniable cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The aurora-lit ridgeway is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (ribbons of light, shifting greens and violets, natural cathedral). The pendant functions as micro-setting object, handled across multiple beats and physically present in key moments. However, neither environment nor object constrains a choice at closure; the ridgeway serves as backdrop and the pendant operates frictionlessly. Spatial choreography is clear (firepit, hill, mist) and idiom fits the mythic register.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—spreading wonder via the pendant—is signaled early but never faces opposition or cost. Each encounter (shepherd, girl) succeeds instantly with no tightening or trade-off; the courier's jitteriness never escalates into a choice that narrows options. The pendant's power is unlimited, no resource is spent, and no path is foreclosed. Pressure remains static across the ridgeway journey, and coincidence (convenient shepherd, convenient girl with tablet) supplies complications without the courier's agency driving turns.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Theme—brief encounters stretched into lasting wonder—emerges clearly from recurring images (vibration, germination, fade from memory to myth) rather than direct statement. The mentor's lesson about hidden music and shared memory is articulated multiple times, reducing subtext. The final image attempts resonance (caravan merchants, pilgrimage site) but delivers it as summary rather than a non-literal, particular answer. Recurrence of "germinate," "vibration," "echo" functions as motif checklist without constraining choice or charging closure with new meaning.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature—jittery, task-focused, attuned to vibration and glow—is consistent but generic. Diction drifts into elevated register ("cathedral," "mythic wonder," "testament") that reads above the courier's embodied voice. No dialogue on the page. Psychic distance remains uniform without intentional modulation. The prose carries a faint template cadence with repeated "he [verb]" stems and stock metaphors (sunrise-kissed leaves, night flowers).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops appear frequently: "vibration synced with pulse" → "pulse of objects"; "tiny miracle" → "spark of wonder"; "germinate curiosity" → "seed of myth" → "stories to germinate." Template cadence runs across multiple sentences ("He believed... He stopped... He lifted... He continued... He remembered... He felt... He recalled... He vanished"). Stock metaphors (sunrise-kissed leaves, night flowers, liquid glass) cluster without fresh synthesis. Figurative density is high but coherence slips (pendant "hums a song" then "maps currents"). Apply −0.8 for loops/stems, −0.4 for mixed metaphors, total ~−1.2 in this category.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The core premise—magic pendant spreads wonder along a mythic ridgeway—follows a familiar template (lone traveler with mentor's lesson and mystical object transforms mundane into myth). Execution does not transform the material through lived complication or non-obvious moral calculus; each beat repeats the same pattern (courier offers pendant, wonder blooms, no cost paid). The aurora and vibration imagery are vivid but do not yield a fresh synthesis. No risk-taking that heightens stakes or challenges the courier's method.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Jittery relic courier is present throughout and performs the central actions (offers pendant, explains its use, moves along ridgeway). However, his choices do not create key turns; he enacts the same pattern without adaptation or cost. Setup clear, beats involve him, but no causal pressure or closure cost tied specifically to his jitteriness or courier role. Swappable with "wandering mentor figure" with minor edits. Cap at 3.8 for swappability.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dragonfly-wing pendant appears in setup (first paragraph), is handled in three distinct beats (shepherd firepit, girl's tablet, final vanishing), and returns in the coda as the element merchants speak of. It enables the wonder-spreading but does not constrain or impose cost; its vibration works frictionlessly. Early signal +0.5, three beats +1.4, closure linkage (merchants' legend) +0.7, but no causal pressure or cost −0.8, ornamental final mention −0.3. Total ~6.2.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Absent mentor is mentioned in opening paragraph, echoed twice (lessons about vibration, final lesson about music), and invoked at closure ("unseen hand"). Shapes the courier's worldview but does not alter on-page choices or impose cost; the courier never struggles with the mentor's absence or tests the lessons under pressure. Thematic echo only. Setup +0.3, closure cameo +0.2, ornamental use −0.8, cap at 2.8 for missing middle development, round to 2.4.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Extends brief encounters" is the pendant's declared function, demonstrated in two beats (shepherd, girl). However, it operates as description rather than constraint; no on-page cost or trade-off tied to extension versus brevity. The attribute does not force a choice or limit the courier's tactics. Setup +0.5, two beats +0.9, label-only trait −0.6, swappable with "enhances moments" −0.5. Total ~4.1.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Germinate" appears as verb and metaphor across multiple beats (curiosity germinates, stories germinate, seed of myth germinates, night flowers bloom, map blooms). Drives the thematic arc but does not create a major turn where options narrow or cost becomes visible. The action is illustrative rather than decisive. Early +0.5, three mentions +1.4, closure linkage +0.7, thematic only (no causal pressure) −0.8, synonym churn (bloom/germinate) −0.3. Total ~5.9.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Vibrating sympathetically" is introduced early (pendant vibrates with heartbeat), demonstrated in two beats (syncs with shepherd's pulse, helps tablet's symbols bloom), and invoked at closure (merchants speak of vibration). Mechanics are consistent but impose no cost or constraint; vibration always succeeds. Setup +0.6, two beats +0.9, closure +0.5, no pressure or cost −0.8, ornamental coda −0.3. Total ~5.3.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Aurora-lit ridgeway is established early, described vividly across beats (ribbons of light, shifting colors, tunnel of greens and violets), and persists to closure (vanishes into aurora's glow, pilgrimage site). Provides atmosphere but does not constrain movement, supply resources, or pressure choices; the courier moves freely without environmental cost. Setup +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +0.7, postcard description (no tactical constraint) −0.9. Total ~5.7.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Across the fade from memory to legend" appears once in the ridgeway description and returns in the coda ("legends that stretched across generations"). Time remains vague (night deepens, years follow) with no tracked clock or deadline that tightens decisions. The phrase is thematic decoration rather than a constraint. Setup +0.3, closure echo +0.4, ornamental use −0.7, vague timeframe (no urgency) −0.6, cap at 3.4 for missing middle development. Total ~3.2.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Coax wonder from the routine" is the courier's stated goal, demonstrated in two encounters (shepherd's glazed routine, weary merchants' routes become marvel). Motivation is clear but never conflicted; the courier pursues it without cost, hesitation, or competing desire. Setup +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure (pilgrimage proves success) +0.7, told-only (no friction or trade-off) −0.8, label phrasing ("coax wonder," "spark of wonder") −0.3. Total ~5.6.</comment>
