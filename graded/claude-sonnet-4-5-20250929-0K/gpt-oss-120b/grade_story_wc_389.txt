<question>1</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The "lonely visionary" remains abstract and label-driven throughout, never embodied through contradictory impulses or micro-choices under genuine pressure. Interiority consists of grandiose declarations ("to shape a new dawn using ancient shadows") without internal conflict or embodied emotion. The character observes, arranges mirrors, and commissions drones but no decision forecloses a path with visible cost; the ending grants success without struggle. Selene exists only as radio static, never pressuring the protagonist's choices on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Orientation remains vague past 120 words (who is this visionary? when? why now?), triggering the −0.3 to −0.5 penalty. The piece declares a quest and its success without causal linkage: mirrors "sing," coils "hum," drones are commissioned off-page, and dawn arrives as gift rather than earned consequence. No meaningful tightening occurs—the visionary's early goal ("forge variant allegiance") is simply achieved in the final paragraph without on-page reversal or cost. The inferred lens (Accumulative/Textural) requires density increase or cadence shift that reweights stakes with cost; instead, the text loops ornamental descriptions without pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The cobalt glass portico, copper coils, and stormlit clouds provide vivid sensory anchors and recur across beats, shaping the visual field. Spatial choreography is legible (observatory above clouds, mirrors on portico, coils draped over glass) and the storm-versus-dawn contrast charges the final image. However, setting details remain decorative; no environmental constraint forces a tactical choice or alters the protagonist's approach. The observatory functions as backdrop rather than crucible.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake ("forge variant allegiance / shape a new dawn") is declared early but never tested or tightened on the page. No live opposition appears; the scattered clans are rallied off-stage, Selene's prophecy arrives as static, and the storm never complicates tactics. The ending grants success ("the world below saw the first true sunrise") without visible cost or trade-off. Coincidence (the lightning converging, the drones singing, the sunrise blooming) resolves rather than complicates, violating the lens requirement.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Theme ("ancient shadows forge hope," "variant allegiance to night not sun") is stated repeatedly in prompt-like language rather than emerging from particulars. The final paragraph moralizes directly: "they swore a variant allegiance not to any ruler but to the promise that ancient shadows could forge hope," violating the no-sermon rule and triggering −0.5 to −0.8. Recurrent images (mirrors, coils, cobalt glass) are present but used decoratively; no motif constrains choice or reweights prior material at closure. The piece asserts resonance instead of earning it through scene pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, but perceptual signature is generic and elevated throughout without character-specific idiom. Diction ("lyrically prophetic," "gritty whimsy," "variant allegiance") repeatedly drifts into prompt vocabulary that no character would naturally use, especially in peak beats. Psychic distance remains uniform; no modulation under pressure. The prose reads as committee voice—ornate but interchangeable—rather than a singular perspective. No dialogue appears, so those bullets are not assessed.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Pervasive paraphrase loops and template cadence: "Each night, the lonely visionary would arrange… When the lightning converged… Night after night, the coils hummed…" recycles structure without adding pressure. Stacked filter constructions and elevated register ("the air hummed with fragmented radio frequencies," "the observatory's brass telescopes turned inward, mapping the pulse of hope") obscure rather than propel. Mixed metaphors appear ("mirrors sang," "ancient shadows wielded as lanterns," "hearts throbbed with hopeful cadence"). Stock phrasing ("the storm feel like a drumroll," "promised a covenant") and synonym churn ("stormlit," "fragmented," "lyrically prophetic" repeated without reweighting) trigger cumulative −0.6 to −1.4 in Q7 per the artifact pack. At least three template-stem runs and one paraphrase loop are present, touching the closure paragraph.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Core premise (lone inventor uses storm + old tech to unite tribes) follows workshop-template beats without transformation. Tropes (prophecy, scattered clans, mystical frequencies, darkness-into-light) are invoked but not personalized through specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The "gritty whimsy" tone label is asserted but not demonstrated; the prose remains ornate and abstract rather than tactile or ironically grounded. The ending's inevitability feels unearned—no prior particulars constrain the sunrise—triggering the derivative premise guardrail (−0.5 to −1.5).</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>The "lonely visionary" is named in the opening and closing paragraphs but makes no on-page decision that narrows options or alters tactics. Observations (staring through portico, arranging mirrors, commissioning drones) are presented as completed acts without visible deliberation or cost. The character's choices do not create key turns; success is declared rather than earned. Late closure mention does not count as causal participation.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The cobalt glass portico appears in five beats (opening, mirror arrangement, copper coils draped over it, shimmering during drone chorus, glittering at dawn), satisfying the ≥2 beats threshold. However, its function remains static description; it never constrains a choice or shifts meaning. The portico is backdrop rather than tool or pressure. Early signal (+0.3) and beat involvement (+0.9) are offset by ornamental use (−0.5 to −1.0) and swappability (any transparent surface would serve).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Variant allegiance" is declared three times (tribes forging allegiance, people pledging allegiance to night, final oath "not to any ruler but to the promise") but never dramatized as a tactical choice or trade-off on the page. The concept functions as theme label rather than stake that shapes options. Late in the text, it remains abstract rather than pressuring protagonist decisions. Ornamental use and label-only treatment (−0.6 cumulative) cap the score low.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Lyrically prophetic" appears twice as descriptor (radio frequencies, verses) but never constrains or enables action. No on-page moment shows the visionary choosing a course because the prophecy is lyrical or prophetic; it is label-only. The attribute does not create a trade-off or visible cost. Late first clear use (mid-text) and ornamental treatment (−0.8 cumulative) hold the score low.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>"Unfold" appears in three forms: radio frequencies "unfold a story of rebellion," frequencies "unfold into a chorus," and frequencies "unfolded like a puzzle." Each instance is passive description of the broadcast rather than protagonist action. The visionary listens but does not unfold anything through decision; the action is credited to the frequencies themselves. Swappability (−0.4 to −0.8: "reveal," "deliver," or "transmit" would serve identically) and summary-only use (−0.4 to −0.8) limit the score. No causal turn traces to this verb.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Fragmented radio frequencies" are signaled early (second sentence) and recur in six beats, satisfying setup and development. The method shapes tactics (visionary listens, arranges mirrors to amplify, commissions drones to harmonize with frequencies). However, the mechanics remain vague (how do mirrors "catch" radio? how do coils "bind darkness"?), and the frequencies deliver prophecy rather than imposing cost or friction. Early signal (+0.3 to +0.8), beat involvement (+1.4 for three or more), and mild causal pressure (+0.5 baseline) are offset by ornamental moments and lack of specificity (−0.3 to −0.5).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The stormlit observatory above clouds is anchored in the opening line and recurs in seven beats (portico, telescopes, roof, floor, inside/outside contrast). It supplies resources (mirrors, coils, elevation to catch storm) and frames all action. The observatory's height enables the dawn to be seen first, and the final image ("observatory's roof glittered") charges closure. However, no micro-setting detail constrains a protagonist choice or alters tactics under pressure. Early signal (+0.8), beat involvement (+1.4), and closure linkage (+0.7 baseline) are offset by static function (−0.5 ornamental); it is stage rather than crucible.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>1.9</grade><comment>"Across the rise of a prophet named Selene" anchors time vaguely (past prophecy → present action → future dawn) but imposes no deadline or ticking clock. "Each night" and "night after night" loop without cumulative pressure or visible passage. The timeframe does not tighten decisions; success arrives when the text declares "dawn finally brushed the clouds" without cost or race. Late meaningful use (−0.6 to −1.0), ornamental treatment (−0.5 to −1.0), and swappability (any vague span would serve) keep the score very low.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"To shape a new dawn using ancient shadows" is stated twice (early and at closure) but never dramatized as conflicted desire. The visionary's motivation is told-only; no on-page moment shows friction between this want and a competing need or fear. The motivation does not force a trade-off or visible cost; the ending grants the goal without struggle. Lyric early–final reprise (+0.3 to +0.8 for resonance path) is offset by summary-only use (−0.4 to −0.8) and lack of friction (no dramatized cost tied to the desire).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Gritty whimsy" is declared in one sentence ("gritty whimsy, a cracked fable that smelled of oil and ozone") but the prose remains ornate, elevated, and abstract throughout, never demonstrating tactile grit or ironic whimsy. Tone does not modulate with pressure (the register stays uniform from storm to sunrise) and does not charge the final image. Label-only use (−0.3), late first clear mention (mid-text, −0.2 to −0.5), and failure to manifest in diction or rhythm (−0.5 ornamental) hold the score low.</comment>
