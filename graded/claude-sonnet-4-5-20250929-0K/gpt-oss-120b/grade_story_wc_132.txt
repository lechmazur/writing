<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Marlowe's motivation to study plant behavior is stated but never conflicts with a competing desire or resource constraint; he observes without making a difficult choice. The "circuitously sincere" attribute is mentioned twice as a label without dramatizing a tradeoff it enables or blocks. Interior voice leans toward elevated nature-essay register ("apologetic unfurling of chlorophyll") that reads more like lyric summary than embodied thought under pressure. The leaf's transformation is witnessed rather than earned through Marlowe's agency risking something concrete.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation is anchored (Marlowe, nursery, post-rain, storm season) within the opening lines. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers observations and minor interventions (copper coil, mycelium, greenhouse) without clear because/therefore linkage. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration via the lesson "sustainable growth thrives on letting nature reconstruct by releasing control," but this thesis is told rather than demonstrated with visible cost—Marlowe builds more infrastructure (greenhouse, bowls of rainwater) in the final paragraph, which contradicts "releasing control." No on-page moment shows a path foreclosed or a price paid; the leaf simply greens and the story summarizes the moral.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The mossy trellis, droplets as prisms, copper coil, and mycelium filament supply vivid micro-setting that anchors action. The trellis and rain recur across beats and charge the final greenhouse image. Spatial choreography is clear: trellis → coil placement → leaf observation → greenhouse construction. The nursery environment enables Marlowe's method (release control via conduit) and the storm/rain cycle functions as a temporal pressure that shapes his window of observation, lifting the setting above postcard description.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding reluctant metamorphosis—is signaled early but never opposed or tested. Marlowe's interventions succeed without friction: the copper coil works, the mycelium arrives, the leaf greens, the saplings thrive. No reversal, no tightening that forecloses an option. The "reluctant" label promises resistance but the leaf's change is smooth and "apologetic," a passive unfolding rather than a contested transformation. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening or cadence shift is required; here the final paragraph expands his practice without raising cost or narrowing tactical options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Theme—sustainable change via release of control—is articulated directly in exposition ("the most sustainable change was always sustained by releasing control," "reconstruct by releasing control") rather than arising from dramatized conflict. The linden leaf functions as a recurring image that shifts from amber to green, and the mycelium bridge offers a concrete particular. However, the ending paragraph tells the lesson ("a reminder that sustainable growth thrives on letting nature reconstruct") instead of allowing the final image to reweight prior material without a stated moral. The paradox of control/release is asserted more than embodied in choice with cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization is stable with no head-hopping. Narrative distance is consistent third-limited, tracking Marlowe's perceptions and thoughts. Perceptual signature leans scientific-lyric: "fine silver filament," "data point," "equation," "tiny rivers reshaping a landscape." The elevated register ("circuitously sincere," "apologetic unfurling of chlorophyll") reads more essayistic than character-particular under peak observation moments. Psychic distance stays controlled, but the voice does not degrade or shift texture under pressure—storm and leaf-turn receive the same meditative cadence as setup, flattening urgency.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops appear in adjacent sentences: "The nursery…seemed to breathe in time with the world outside, sustaining transformation in every leaf and root" directly restates the prior theme summary without adding pressure. Template cadence: multiple sentences open with "He + verb" or "The + noun" constructions across the middle third. Elevated diction ("circuitously sincere," "metronome," "orchestrate their own healing") clashes with the grounded POV of a working nursery owner. Stock metaphor: "veins had reorganized like tiny rivers reshaping a landscape." The final paragraph's exposition ("a reminder that sustainable growth thrives…") is scaffolding that should have been cut. These artifacts cluster but do not obscure causality, so penalty stays in Q7 per routing rules.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The core premise—plant transformation via intentional non-intervention—is present but lacks a non-obvious turn or complication that forces a tradeoff. The copper coil as "conduit, not trap" and mycelium bridge are specific details, yet the emotional and thematic arc follows a familiar template: mentor's paradoxical lesson → protagonist applies lesson → nature validates lesson. No fresh inflection disrupts the expected path. The "reluctant metamorphosis" attribute promises internal conflict in the plant or Marlowe's method, but both unfold smoothly without resistance, defaulting to a median execution of a nature-patience parable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Marlowe (plant nursery owner) is present throughout and his occupation frames the setting and method. He makes on-page micro-choices: places the copper coil, documents the shift, builds the greenhouse. However, these actions do not create a key turn or alter stakes—each move confirms his prior thesis without friction. Observation dominates over decision under pressure. He is essential to the premise but his choices do not drive reversals, placing him in the functional-but-replaceable band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The linden leaf appears in setup (amber, reluctant), development (droplets, mycelium contact, chlorophyll unfurling), and closure (deep verdant green, veins reorganized, lesson documented). It is handled across three beats and its state change (amber → green) mirrors the thematic arc. The leaf's transformation is the story's anchor event. However, its change is observed rather than contested, and it does not constrain Marlowe's choices or impose cost—he watches and documents, so it remains essential but not indispensable to choice-pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Reluctant metamorphosis" is named in the opening and closing thirds and describes the leaf's resistance to greening. The concept shapes the story's thematic question: how to encourage change without force. It appears in middle beats (leaf "quivered," "slow, almost apologetic unfurling") and the ending ("each future reluctant metamorphosis would be welcomed"). However, the reluctance is told more than dramatized—no on-page moment shows the leaf resisting a tactic or Marlowe adjusting method in response to failure. The concept frames but does not constrain tactics, placing it in the one-turn band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Circuitously sincere" is mentioned twice (opening: "his smile bending like a willow branch yet his eyes sharp," and mid-story: "a circuitously sincere method of influence") as labels. The attribute does not constrain or enable a specific choice with visible cost; it describes his general approach but is not tested or traded off. Removing this exact phrase would not alter any beat's logic. Ornamental label-only use.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Reconstruct" appears in multiple forms: "reconstruct the leaf's environment," "let the leaf rebuild itself," "plants…could orchestrate their own healing," and the closing frame "letting nature reconstruct by releasing control." The action shapes Marlowe's method (loose coil, not forcing) and drives the thematic payoff. However, swapping "reconstruct" for "restore," "renew," or "regenerate" would not break the story's logic—the action is present across beats but its specific mechanics (what reconstruction entails beyond non-interference) are not detailed enough to make it irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"By releasing control" is signaled early ("not by forcing it, but by releasing control"), enacted in the middle (copper coil as "gentle surrender," "step back"), and restated at closure ("sustained by releasing control," "by releasing control"). The method appears in three beats and defines Marlowe's tactics. However, the final paragraph shows him building new infrastructure (greenhouse, bowls, introducing more saplings), which reads as additional control rather than release, muddying the method's execution at closure. The concept drives two clear beats but wobbles at the ending, capping it just above the one-turn threshold.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The "mossy trellis after rain" is named in the title-like opening, returns mid-story ("The mossy trellis after rain became a laboratory"), and anchors the setup and observation beats. Droplets on the trellis provide sensory detail and the moss/moisture enable the mycelium's appearance, which is causally relevant to the leaf's transformation. The trellis also houses the final greenhouse ("beside the mossy trellis"). It appears in setup, middle, and closure, supplies a resource (moisture for fungal exchange), and its post-rain state matters to the plot, placing it solidly in the essential-across-beats band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"During storm season" is stated in the opening ("During storm season, he found himself compelled to study") and recurs in the middle ("As the storm season intensified, thunder rolled") and closing ("Even as the next storm gathered on the horizon"). The timeframe creates urgency (thunder as metronome, repeated rain cycles) and shapes Marlowe's window of study, but the narrative clock is loose—no specific deadline tightens his decisions. The storms complicate observation (forcing post-rain timing) but do not impose a cost or narrow his options. Present across beats with mild causal pressure, one clear turn.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"To study plant behaviors" is stated as Marlowe's motivation in the opening ("compelled to study plant behaviors that rose to the surface only after thunder") and reappears in his documentation ("He documented the shift in his journal") and expansion of the study (introducing more linden saplings). The desire frames his actions but never conflicts with a competing want or resource limit—he pursues it smoothly without friction. Functional but swappable with "to understand," "to observe," or "to document" without structural change. No on-page moment where the study costs him something else he values.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Sustaining transformation" as tone/concept appears explicitly in the penultimate paragraph ("sustaining transformation in every leaf and root") and implicitly throughout via repeated references to "sustainable change" and the nursery's "renewed vigor." The tone is meditative and patient, matching the theme of gradual, non-forced growth. It modulates slightly (storm intensifies, thunder rolls) but returns to the same reflective register by the ending. The tone is coherent and charges the final image of ongoing cycles, but it remains static rather than shifting with narrative pressure—calm throughout, even during the leaf's peak transformation. One clear lyric reprise with thematic weight, placing it in the one-turn band.</comment>
