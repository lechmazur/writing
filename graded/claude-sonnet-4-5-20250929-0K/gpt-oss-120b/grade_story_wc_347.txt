<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The caretaker protagonist exists primarily as a vessel to execute the ritual rather than a mind under pressure. Interiority consists of observation and description ("I watch," "I approach") without internal contradiction or embodied emotion at key turns. The bargain and reluctance are declared but never tested on the page; no micro-choice reveals hierarchy of values or forces a trade-off between duty and self-preservation. The final withdrawal reads more like procedural completion than earned stance crystallization.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed—who, where, and mechanical birds arrive with context scattered across the first third, though the cliffside orchard frame becomes clear by midpoint. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: density and symbolic layering build toward the nut-placement ritual, and the closure image (light spilling, travelers emerging) reweights the premise with visible cost—the orchard "still cursed" and the caretaker's role cyclic. However, the cost remains conceptual rather than felt; the protagonist's emotional or relational price is asserted ("bitter sweetness... like ash") but not dramatized through forfeited options or visible struggle at the closure beat. Under the accumulative lens one meaningful deepening suffices, and the ritual completes that arc, but the lack of on-page felt cost in the final image holds this below high-band entry.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The cliffside labyrinth, mechanical birds, and frost timeline create purposeful constraint: the night-frost deadline tightens the ritual window, and the altar stump anchors the climax spatially. Sensory detail (humming gears, amber eyes, frost threat) is selective and pressure-driven. The nut's glow and root-light charge the final image, meeting the 9+ gate test (object constrains choice and charges closure). Spatial choreography remains clear across the maze walk to the stump, and the environment evolves causally (frost retreats, light blooms).</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—completing the ritual before frost to guide travelers—is signaled early and governs all moves. Pressure accumulates through the frost deadline and circling birds, and the nut placement delivers one meaningful tightening under the accumulative lens. However, protagonist agency is minimal: the caretaker executes a predetermined sequence without on-page reversals, trade-offs, or forced choices. The ritual succeeds without visible cost to the protagonist's options or tactics; travelers emerge, but no live alternative was foreclosed. Escalation reads as atmospheric buildup rather than decision-driven narrowing.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme of graceless beauty and cyclical redemption emerges through concrete images (wound, ash, reluctant approval) without overt moralizing. The final image—travelers' safety glowing "brighter than any curse," yet the orchard unmoved and demanding a new caretaker—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the cost of iterative care. Subtext operates in the mechanical birds' "indifferent precision" and the orchard's sigh, avoiding label-speak. However, the thematic recurrence of "graceless" and "wound" risks becoming a motif checklist rather than accumulating pressure, and the caretaker's internal arc is thin, limiting thematic charge.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with consistent narrative distance and perceptual filter (orchard as patient surgeon, wind-traced patterns). Diction sustains a lyric, archaic register ("whispered rain," "latent heat," "bitter sweetness") that matches the cursed-orchard frame. However, perceptual signature is generic rather than character-specific; the caretaker's noticing lacks idiosyncratic bias or selective attention shaped by personal stakes. No dialogue on the page. Purposeful compression (wind impressions "only the birds can see") is legible, though some lines ("offhandedly exact," "jagged elegance") veer toward decorative metaphor without clear purpose-driven control.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is moderate, though several beats engage in synonym churn ("graceless beauty," "jagged elegance," "bitter sweetness") and paraphrase loops (the curse's persistence is restated across multiple paragraphs without added pressure). Stock metaphors—"wound that will never fully heal," "dying dragon"—dull specificity in peak beats. Template cadence appears in the mid-section with repetitive "I [verb]" and "The [noun] [verb]" openers across adjacent sentences. Figurative density is high without pattern-teaching or payoff, and some metaphors clash (orchard as patient surgeon, then as sighing entity). Apply −0.6 for paraphrase loops and template runs, and −0.4 for mixed metaphors in closure proximity, totaling −1.0 within Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The cursed-orchard premise and reluctant-caretaker frame are familiar, and the piece does not transform them through specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The mechanical birds and wind-impression method offer surface novelty but remain ornamental; the ritual could proceed unchanged with organic birds and direct touch. The "forgotten blueprint in a nut" conceit is clever but not grounded in earned particulars—its mechanics and history are declared rather than discovered through character choice. The ending's cyclic futility ("the orchard will sigh again tomorrow") gestures toward complexity but lacks the specific trade-offs or insights that would elevate the frame. Apply derivative-premise adjustment of −0.8 within Q8 for template execution without transformation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The caretaker protagonist is present throughout and frames the narrative voice, satisfying setup. However, agency is minimal: the character executes a ritual without on-page choices that alter tactics or stakes. The reluctance is declared ("chosen not for love but for a bargain") but never tested; no beat shows the caretaker weighing withdrawal, resisting the orchard's demand, or paying visible personal cost. The final retreat is procedural rather than a decision that forecloses a path. Middle development is weak (observation without choice), and closure participation is passive (watching travelers depart). Cap at 4.6 for missing middle-choice development, then subtract −0.4 for swappability (any reluctant figure could perform this role with minor edits).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The nut appears early (setup: "small nut that fell from the highest branch"), is handled and described across multiple beats (assembly clues, glow emerging, surface etchings, placement on stump), and its final placement triggers the light that guides travelers (closure participation). The nut's warmth and etched pattern constrain the ritual timing (frost would lock it away) and directly shape the ending's charge. However, the nut's role is somewhat passive—it is carried and placed rather than wielded with visible cost or tactical adaptation. Two-beat involvement and closure linkage support high-7s, but lack of protagonist trade-off tied specifically to the nut (as opposed to the ritual generally) and some ornamental description ("cradled only in the memory of its latent heat") cap below 8.5.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The forgotten blueprint is present throughout as premise (setup: "whispered the name of a forgotten blueprint," "blueprint's purpose has been fulfilled"), but it remains abstract and thematic rather than shaping on-page tactics. The protagonist does not search for, decode, or activate the blueprint through specific choices; instead, the blueprint is said to "become visible" as impressions are laid, and the nut's surface "mirrors" it. Middle development is weak (summary-only, no beat where the blueprint constrains or enables an action with cost), and closure participation is declarative ("blueprint's purpose has been fulfilled") without causal pressure. The element could be removed or replaced with "ancient pattern" or "lost knowledge" with minimal structural impact, indicating swappability. Cap at 4.6 for missing middle development, then subtract −0.8 for ornamental use and −0.2 for late/summary involvement.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Offhandedly exact" appears once in the text ("each piece fitting offhandedly exact, as if the orchard itself were a patient surgeon") as descriptive color rather than a character trait or constraint. It does not shape a choice, enable or constrain an action, or return with reweighted meaning. No setup as a protagonist attribute, no middle development, no closure participation. Cap at 2.8 for missing closure participation, and the label-only mention without action pressure confirms ornamental use.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Assemble" is signaled early ("I have spent the past months assembling clues") and frames the protagonist's preparatory work, but the on-page action is ritual execution (walking, placing the nut) rather than assembly itself. The clue-gathering is summary-only; no beat dramatizes a moment of assembly that narrows options or forces a trade-off. The ritual's success hinges on placement timing and the nut's readiness, not on assembly skill or choices made during that process. Middle development is weak (assembly is backstory), and closure turns on placement rather than assembly. The element is present but functionally replaced by the placement action. Cap at 4.6 for missing middle development, then subtract −0.5 for summary-only use and −0.2 for swappability with "prepare" or "gather."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The method "leaving impressions without touching, tracing patterns in the wind with a slender reed that only the birds can see" is signaled early (setup), described across two beats (method explanation, wind impressions becoming visible blueprint), and tied to the ritual's mechanics. However, the method is ornamental: the impressions are said to guide the protagonist's steps, but no beat shows the method constraining a choice, failing under pressure, or requiring tactical adaptation. The ritual could proceed via direct touch or simple placement with minimal edits. Middle development is weak (description without constraint), and closure participation is indirect (the nut's pattern "mirrors" the impressions, but the impressions themselves do not charge the final image). Cap at 4.6 for missing middle-choice constraint, then add +0.2 for two-beat presence.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The cliffside labyrinth and mechanical birds are present throughout: setup (introduced in first third), middle (birds patrol and watch, maze navigation described), and closure (birds pause and watch departure, light illuminates passages). The setting supplies spatial constraint (maze, passages, cliff's edge) and atmospheric pressure (birds' humming, amber eyes), and the final light-bloom transforms the labyrinth from trap to guide. However, the labyrinth does not force a tactical choice—the protagonist walks unimpeded to the stump, and the birds observe without intervening. The setting constrains mood and frames the ritual but does not alter the protagonist's options or tactics under pressure. Strong closure participation (light through passages) supports mid-6s, but lack of middle-choice constraint limits higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The frost deadline is signaled early ("I must finish before the night frost forms") and tightens the ritual window, creating urgency that governs the protagonist's moves. The frost's threat is concrete (would lock the nut's warmth away), and the ending confirms success (frost retreats). However, the clock is not tracked on the page—no beat shows time running short, forcing faster movement, or creating a near-miss. The deadline functions as premise rather than live ticking pressure that alters tactics mid-scene. Setup and closure participation are strong, but middle development (time tightening choice) is weak. Two gates met, solid causal pressure at premise level, but no mid-scene tightening.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The motivation "to guide lost travelers to safety" is stated early ("The purpose of this grim ritual is not selfish; I aim to guide lost travelers to safety") and governs the ritual's goal. The ending dramatizes success—travelers emerge and follow the glow to the ridge. However, the motivation is told rather than tested: no beat shows the protagonist weighing personal cost against travelers' need, resisting the ritual's burden, or facing friction between this goal and another want. The motivation frames the action but does not create internal conflict or visible trade-off. Setup and closure participation are strong, but middle development (motivation under friction) is missing. Two gates met, functional role, but lack of dramatized cost or conflicting want caps at mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The tone "graceless beauty" is announced explicitly ("the beauty of this act is graceless, a jagged elegance") and reinforced at closure ("feeling the graceless beauty of this redemption, a bitter sweetness"). The orchard's shuddering sigh, the "wound that will never fully heal," and the mechanical birds' indifference sustain the tone across beats. The tone modulates minimally—atmospheric throughout—but it charges the final image by juxtaposing travelers' safety with the orchard's persistent curse. However, the explicit labeling ("graceless beauty," "jagged elegance," "bitter sweetness") risks tell-only execution rather than emergent texture. The tone is coherent and present in closure, meeting two gates and contributing to the ending's charge, supporting low-6s, but the label-heavy delivery and static mood (no tonal shift under pressure) limit higher bands.</comment>
