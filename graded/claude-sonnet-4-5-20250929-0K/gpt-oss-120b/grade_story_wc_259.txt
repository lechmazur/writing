<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The historian remains a cipher throughout; motivation is asserted ("sole motivation was to pursue forbidden knowledge") rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. Interior experience consists of label-only emotions ("anguished joy," "bittersweet surge") without embodied contradiction or character-particular texture. The protagonist's "steadily unpredictable" mind is told, not shown through decisions that foreclose paths with visible cost. No meaningful choice alters tactics; the historian walks, reads, and exits without agency that narrows options.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed: who (historian), where (archive), and the nature of the quest emerge slowly across the first third without clear spatial grounding. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (density increase via layered images), but no meaningful tightening or cadence shift reweights the dominant stake with cost. The ending offers only summary assertion ("his legend becoming one more atom of nostalgia") rather than an on-page Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with visible price. The pagoda "purifies" via light cascade, but no prior choice or constraint shaped this outcome; the result feels convenient rather than earned.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The archive's vaulted chambers, bronze prism pagoda, and night-fall exterior provide vivid sensory anchors, and the floor's variable echo constrains the historian's steps. However, spatial choreography remains vague (how far to the pagoda? what specific route?), and the setting does not force a pivotal choice or charge the final image with undeniable cost. Details read as atmospheric catalog rather than tactical constraint. The "atoms of nostalgia" motif recurs but does not bind a decision to the environment's particulars.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—accessing forbidden knowledge—is signaled early but never tested by a tightening choice that narrows options or forces a trade-off. The historian approaches, steps irregularly, and succeeds without visible price; no reversal, no failed attempt, no on-page cost that alters later tactics. Coincidence (the pagoda responds to his steps) resolves the conflict. Under any lens, escalation is absent; the story moves from desire to fulfillment in a straight line with no meaningful pressure point.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Theme—transformation via unpredictability, reclaiming fragmented heritage—emerges through images and motifs, but the final paragraph explicitly states the thesis ("true purification comes not from erasing the past, but from embracing its fragmented atoms"), replacing scene pressure with overt moralizing. The ending does not offer a resonant, non-literal answer; it summarizes the lesson. "Atoms of nostalgia" recurs but remains abstract, never anchored in a concrete particular that charges the closure. Subtext is thin; meanings are declared rather than implied.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>POV distance is stable (third limited), and the prose carries elevated diction ("saffron-veil historian," "anguished joy," "vortex of forgotten childhoods"). However, register drifts into abstract academic phrasing ("atoms of nostalgia coalesce," "purposeful misstep, a dance of randomness") that exceeds the focalizer's plausible on-page lexicon during peak moments. Perceptual signature is generic; the historian's way of noticing reads interchangeable with default literary narration. No dialogue present. Narrative certainty remains consistent, but voice lacks character-particular texture or rhythmic control under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade: "atoms of nostalgia" appears seven times without evolving meaning; "anguished joy" is repeated identically three times; "steadily unpredictable" recurs as "steady unpredictability" and "forever steady and yet forever unpredictable." Template cadence runs dominate ("He stepped… He knew… He walked… He smiled"). Purple prose stacks modifiers without clarity ("saffron-veil historian," "bronze prism pagoda at twilight," "vortex of forgotten childhoods"). The final paragraph dissolves into summary rather than propulsive image. Heavy scaffold and figurative muddle in peak beats trigger cumulative −1.4 in Q7 and disallow 9+ globally per artifact caps.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The core premise—unlocking forbidden knowledge by rejecting patterns—echoes common puzzle-quest templates without a fresh synthesis. "Atoms of nostalgia," "anguished joy," and "saffron-veil historian" read as ornamental phrases rather than lived particulars that transform familiar material. The historian's walk succeeds on first attempt with no friction, risk, or cost; no bold structural choice elevates stakes. Emotional truth is obscured by abstraction and label-speak. The story could swap names and setting without altering the arc, failing the transformation test.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>The saffron-veil historian appears throughout but makes no on-page choice that creates a key turn or alters tactics. The protagonist observes, recalls training, and walks; success arrives via the pagoda's response to his steps, not his decision. Present in setup, middle, and closure, but agency is absent. Ornamental presence without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The bronze prism pagoda at twilight is described in the opening third, hums and flickers in the middle, and shimmers in the final image. However, the historian does not handle or use it; the pagoda acts autonomously (light descends, pages flutter). No evolving interaction or charged reprise that reweights prior material. Present across beats but functionally static, meeting setup and closure gates but lacking causal middle development and cost linkage.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Atoms of nostalgia" recur as a phrase across setup, middle ("coalesce," "pulse within the living world"), and closure ("one more atom of nostalgia"). The concept remains abstract; it does not shape on-page stakes or tactics. Mentioned rather than dramatized, with no visible cost tied to pursuing or obtaining these "atoms." Present in all three gates but ornamental, not causal.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"Steadily unpredictable" is attributed to the historian's mind in the setup and echoed in the closing line ("forever steady and yet forever unpredictable"). The trait is told, not shown; no on-page action demonstrates the cost or benefit of this attribute. The irregular steps are a method (avoiding patterns), not an embodied constraint. Label-only, no visible trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Purify" appears as the pagoda's claimed function in the setup and as a realized transformation in the middle ("purification was not a cleansing… but a transformation") and closure ("purified by his erratic pilgrimage"). The action is asserted rather than traced through causal turns; the historian does not make a choice to purify—light touches his skin and the effect occurs. Present in all gates but passive, easily swappable with "transform" or "awaken."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Avoiding patterns" is introduced as the ancient engineers' encoded requirement and dramatized in the middle when the historian breaks stride at irregular intervals. The method matters to the mechanism (the pagoda responds), but the historian's success is immediate with no visible cost or failed attempt. Present in setup and middle, shaping one beat, but not charged in the closure image. Functional but mid-replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The lost civilization archive frames the entire story, provides the vaulted chambers and floor that responds to footfalls, and anchors the final night scene. The setting supplies the pagoda and fluttering pages, affecting outcome. However, the archive does not pressure a difficult choice; the historian enters and succeeds. Present in all gates, causal in one beat (floor echo), and part of the closure frame, but lacks the constraint or tactical friction that would elevate it further.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"Across the end of innocence" appears once in the opening line as backstory context. It does not tighten decisions, create urgency, or reappear to shape the closure. Time within the archive is untracked; no clock alters moves. Setup mention only, ornamental, no causal work.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"To pursue forbidden knowledge" is stated as the historian's sole motivation in the penultimate paragraph and implied throughout (he "chasing whispers," seeks texts, reads star maps). The desire drives the journey but is never dramatized through conflicted choice or visible friction between want and cost. Told motivation present in setup and closure summary, but no on-page trade-off or micro-choice reveals hierarchy of values. Functional but swappable with generic "quest for truth."</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Anguished joy" is named identically three times (middle: "pang of joy mixed with sorrow, an anguished joy"; late middle: "the anguished joy of a soul"; closure: implied in "heavy yet uplifted"). The tone is asserted via label rather than modulated through syntax, image, or rhythm. Present across beats but static and unearned, not charged by pressure. The final image does not embody the oxymoron; it restates it.</comment>
