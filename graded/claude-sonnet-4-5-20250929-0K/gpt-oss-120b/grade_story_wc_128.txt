<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Mara is defined by a string of labels ("shrewd," "whimsically attentive," "cautious exuberance") that never translate into contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. Her decision to deliver the locket feels teleological rather than earned by pressure—no visible cost, no foreclosed path. The lighthouse keeper appears as a one-beat prop with no interiority or resistance. Interiority relies on abstract declarations ("felt a cautious exuberance surge") rather than embodied sensation, and the final ceremony resolve threads mechanically without Mara facing any genuine tradeoff.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation Test applied: who/where/when anchors land by ~120 words, waiving the penalty. However, no meaningful closure unit appears on the page. The locket placement on the balcony is presented as completion, but no before/after change in Mara's options or stance is legible—she begins wanting to share stories and ends sharing stories with no cost, renunciation, or reconfiguration. The misdelivered envelope resolves itself through convenient cooperation (the keeper simply agrees, the photo's backstory is revealed off-stage). Drive lens reads Causal by intent but linkage collapses into and-then sequencing; the keeper's immediate agreement and the town's next-morning gift parade erase friction. The final ceremony is summarized rather than dramatized, and no visible or felt cost attaches to any image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The library, pier, and lighthouse are anchored early and sensory detail is present (brine, old paper, starlight). However, the setting functions as postcard backdrop rather than constraint—no environmental factor pressures Mara's choices or alters tactics. The locket photo is a recurring object but it sits passively; no spatial or tool-based element charges the final image. Micro-setting allowance does not apply because the object does not constrain a choice at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"uplift silent contributors"—is signaled early but never tested on the page. Mara encounters zero resistance: the keeper cooperates, the fishermen volunteer stories the next morning, and the ceremony proceeds without friction. No reversal or tightening narrows options; each beat expands her project smoothly. The resolution lands through summary ("listeners felt a quiet surge of hope") rather than a dramatized choice with visible cost. Coincidence (the misdelivered envelope) initiates action but convenience also resolves it, violating the lens guardrail.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The theme of "cycles of compassion" is stated repeatedly in the text ("cycles of compassion that linked traders, readers, and sailors"; "cycles of compassion are the most reliable cargo") rather than emerging from concrete events. The Compassion Register and the full-moon ceremony are told gestures, not dramatized with friction or cost. The final image (locket glimmering, listeners feeling hope) offers a declared answer rather than a resonant one. Multiple passages slip into thematic echo and sermonizing, especially the penultimate paragraph ("proving that cycles of compassion are the most reliable cargo"), triggering the baseline −0.5 penalty in Q5.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Mara with no head-hopping. However, perceptual signature is generic—diction like "cautious exuberance," "whimsically attentive," and "cycles of compassion" could attach to any character. Register drifts into elevated abstractions ("the flow of kindness across every harbor") that clash with a cargo broker's concrete world. No dialogue appears, so dialogue bullets are not applied. Psychic distance widens into summary mode for the ceremony and fishermen's arrival, flattening immediacy at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade the text: "cautious exuberance" appears three times; "cycles of compassion" recurs in adjacent paragraphs; "silent contributors" is restated without added pressure. Template cadence runs dominate sentence openings ("Mara felt," "Mara placed," "Mara recorded," "Mara left"). Stock metaphors ("starlight like lanterns," "mind swirling like sea breezes") and elevated abstractions ("conduit for love," "the flow of kindness") appear in peak beats without pattern-teaching. Applying the Patterned-artifact penalty pack: paraphrase loops −0.6, template cadence −0.6, stock metaphor strings −0.4, total baseline −1.6. Artifacts touch the closure beat (final paragraph summary), so apply −1.7 and disallow 9+ globally, capping high-band entries at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The core premise—misdelivered letter sparks serendipitous connection—is a widely used template. The story does not transform it through specific moral calculus, lived detail, or world logic: the keeper cooperates instantly, the photo's backstory is convenient, and the town's fishermen arrive the next morning as willing participants. Emotional arc and plot would function unchanged with different names and setting. No bold structural or perspectival risk is attempted. Applying the Derivative Premise Guardrail: −1.0 within Q8.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Mara appears throughout and her role as cargo broker frames her reputation, but her shrewdness never constrains a choice on the page—she negotiates nothing, balances no profit-versus-mercy tradeoff. She decides to deliver the locket and record stories, but these decisions face no resistance and alter no tactics. Setup present, development absent (no middle choice constrained by the trait), closure participation is summary-only (the final ceremony is recounted, not dramatized through her POV pressure). Missing middle development cap: 3.4. Label-only trait deduction −0.2 within band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The locket photo is seeded early (envelope scene), handled in two distinct beats (Mara pockets it, later places it on the balcony), and mentioned in the closure beat (glimmers during the keeper's reading). However, its properties do not evolve—it remains a static symbol. The placement on the balcony is told as a gesture of completion without dramatized cost or consequence that alters Mara's stance. Setup +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure linkage (cameo mention, not causal) +0.3, swappability (another keepsake could serve) −0.5, summary-only final use −0.4. Starting anchor 3.0 + 0.8 net = 3.8, rounded to band: functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.7</grade><comment>The concept "cycles of compassion" is repeatedly stated as theme but never shapes tactics or narrows options on the page. It functions as a label for Mara's intentions rather than a constraint. Setup present (signaled early in backstory), development absent (no middle choice where the cycle concept enables or costs her), closure participation is thematic echo only (the final paragraph declares it rather than demonstrating cost). Missing middle development cap: 3.4. Ornamental use −0.7 (no action pressure). Net: below functional threshold.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Whimsically attentive" is mentioned early as Mara's trait but never enables or constrains an on-page action with cost. She notices the envelope, but any attentive broker would. The trait does not create a visible tradeoff or narrow her options. Setup present (first paragraph), development absent (no middle choice gated by the trait), closure absent (the ceremony does not hinge on whimsy or attentiveness). Missing middle and closure caps: 2.8. Label-only −0.3, ornamental −0.1. Net: ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Initiate" describes Mara's resolve to begin the story-sharing project. This decision appears early and frames her walk to the lighthouse, but the action itself (deciding to share stories) is not a discrete beat—it's an intention that unfolds across multiple summary moves. The major turn (placing the locket, organizing the ceremony) could be reframed as "deliver" or "honor" with minor edits. Setup +0.5, one beat (walk to lighthouse) +0.4, swappability −0.6, summary-only resolution −0.4. Starting 3.0 + (−0.1) net ≈ functional but replaceable, upper 4s.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The "friendship kindled by envelope with mistaken address" is the inciting mechanism: the misdelivered envelope lands on Mara's table and she traces the return address. This method is signaled early and drives the walk to the lighthouse. However, the friendship itself is asserted rather than dramatized—Mara and the keeper open the envelope together and cooperate instantly with no friction. Setup +0.6, one beat (delivery/opening) +0.4, causal pressure (enables the meeting) +0.5, closure absent (the ceremony mentions the photo but not the envelope mechanism), swappability (a direct request or found letter could substitute) −0.5. Net mid-5s: shapes one key turn but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The "breezy library under stars" is the primary setting and appears in the opening, middle (Mara arranges atlases), and closing (ceremony). However, it functions as atmospheric backdrop—no environmental feature (access, weather, spatial constraint) pressures Mara's choices or alters tactics. The skylight and breezy curtains are descriptive touches, not constraints. Setup +0.6, three mentions +0.6, closure linkage (ceremony location) +0.4, postcard description −0.8, no choice constraint −0.6. Starting 3.0 + (−0.8) net ≈ mid-4s: present and consistent but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"After the symphony ends" anchors the opening and establishes night as the timeframe, but time does not tighten decisions or tactics. The walk, the keeper meeting, the next morning's fishermen arrival, and the full-moon ceremony all occur in untracked elapsed time with no clock pressure. Setup present (first sentence), development absent (no middle timed constraint), closure absent (the ceremony is scheduled "next full moon" but the timing does not shape the final image). Missing middle and closure caps: 2.8. Vague/untracked time −0.5, ornamental −0.2. Net: ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation "to uplift silent contributors" is stated explicitly mid-story and frames her ledger-keeping and ceremony plans. However, the desire is never conflicted—no friction between cost and want appears. She encounters zero resistance from the keeper or fishermen. Setup +0.5 (signaled by paragraph 9), two beats (ledger, ceremony) +0.9, told-only (no on-page friction or tradeoff) −0.7, swappability (generic altruism could replace) −0.4. Starting 3.0 + 0.3 net ≈ upper 3s: functional but not charged by cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Cautious exuberance" is named three times (paragraphs 7, 12, and closure area) but remains a static label rather than a modulating tone. The prose does not shift cadence or diction to reflect caution versus exuberance under pressure—sentences remain uniformly declarative and elevated. The final image does not charge this tone with cost. Setup +0.5, three mentions +0.6, static mood (no modulation) −0.6, label-only (not embodied in rhythm) −0.4, closure absent (tone does not inflect the final image). Starting 3.0 + (−0.9) net ≈ mid-3s: present but ornamental.</comment>
