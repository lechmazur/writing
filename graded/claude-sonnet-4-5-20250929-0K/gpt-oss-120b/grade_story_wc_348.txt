<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Mara's professional identity is established, but her interiority remains abstract and label-driven ("symphonically minded," "loosened grief"). The failed experiment and atonement motive are told rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. Her leap from observing foam to designing a polymer bridge lacks on-page struggle or embodied cost—the insight arrives too cleanly. The final choice to return each spring feels declarative rather than earned through prior causal pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural, but the piece never teaches a clear pattern or escalates density toward closure. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive early enough. The closure unit—Mara's return to the ravine and the child's chrysalis shell—gestures toward Resonant Reconfiguration but lacks visible cost: no path is foreclosed, no prior option reweighted with felt consequences. The ending recycles the opening metaphor without deepening it causally or emotionally.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The braided ravine is vividly rendered with foam lattice and sensory detail filtered through Mara's scientific lens. The setting constrains her initial insight and supplies the reeds for the scaffold, pushing into the 6-band. However, occupational verisimilitude is thin—polymer self-assembly guided by "natural flow" reads implausible without mechanism. Spatial choreography is clean throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—translating separation into connection—is signaled early but never tested on the page. No reversal or tightening narrows Mara's options; the foam insight resolves her problem without friction or trade-off. The months-later summary of polymer curing fractures tells rather than dramatizes cost. Agency is passive observation rather than a choice that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The separation/connection theme is asserted repeatedly rather than emerging from particulars. The empty chrysalis recurs but remains a static symbol—its final return in the child's hand does not reweight prior material with new cost. The ending's "cycle of separation and reconnection" is a thesis statement, not a resonant image. Some subtlety in the foam-as-lattice metaphor rescues the score from the mid-4s.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature ("symphonically minded") is asserted but manifests unevenly—wind as "movements in a grand score" feels imposed rather than woven through her choices. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("translucent bridge... conduit of light") that clashes with on-page action. No dialogue to evaluate. Psychic distance remains controlled.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade: "empty chrysalis" repeats five times with minimal reweighting; "pieces fall into place" appears twice as metaphor and once as prompt element. Template cadence in the lab-return sequence: "She placed... Colleagues stared... They listened... Months later." Stock metaphors ("translucent bridge," "seed of a fresh composition") dull peak beats. Clarity is adequate, but information density is low—many lines restate prior material without advancing pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The core synthesis—scientist finds insight in nature, applies it to lab problem—is a widely used template executed without fresh inflection. The foam-lattice observation could generate originality, but the leap to functional polymer lacks specificity or occupational verisimilitude. Emotional arc (atonement → healing) follows predictable stages. The child's final chrysalis gift recycles the opening image without transformation. No bold risk heightens stakes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Mara is present throughout and her professional lens filters observation, satisfying setup and development gates. However, her key choice—designing the polymer—occurs off-page between paragraphs; the on-page beats are observation and declaration rather than decision under pressure. Closure participation is a passive return, not a causal action. Swappable with another scientist archetype.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The empty chrysalis appears in the opening (setup), is mentioned twice in the middle as symbol of failure (development), returns in the lab as "relic of redemption," and reappears in the child's hand at closure (payoff). Three gates present. However, it remains ornamental—a metaphor vehicle that does not constrain choice or enable tactics. The final reprise does not reweight prior stakes with visible cost, capping the score near 6.0.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>The divergent path is mentioned once in paragraph two and once near the end as retrospective theme. It does not shape on-page tactics or narrow options. Introduced early but remains abstract—no dramatized fork, no visible cost of choosing one path over another. Functional as theme echo, but replaceable with "unexpected journey" or similar.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Symphonically minded" is asserted in the opening and manifests in two metaphors (wind as movements, foam as score). It does not constrain or enable a choice—Mara could trace the foam patterns without this trait. Label-only; no visible tradeoff or cost tied to this way of thinking. Late arrival as embodied detail (final third) and ornamental use limit integration.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Atone" appears in the opening as stated motive and is referenced once near the end ("redemption"). The atonement does not drive on-page turns—Mara observes, then summarizes success months later. No middle development beats show her wrestling with failure or choosing to atone through specific sacrifice. Setup present, but development and payoff are summary-only, capping near the two-gate ceiling.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The insight (tracing foam patterns) is signaled in paragraph six, shapes the scaffold construction in paragraph twelve, and informs "future polymer designs" recorded on-page. Three gates present. It enables the central solution and appears in the closure paragraph as recorded data. However, the mechanics remain vague—"allowing the natural flow to pull it into the gaps"—limiting irreplaceability. Strong causal role but modest specificity.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The braided ravine is established early (setup), supplies the foam lattice that guides Mara's insight (development), provides reeds for the scaffold, and glows in the final twilight image (payoff). All three gates met. It constrains her method—she cannot test the idea without the natural flow—and charges the ending when she returns each spring. Environment shapes tactics and recurs with purpose, entering the 7-band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"As the pieces fall into place" appears twice: once as metaphor in paragraph five and once in paragraph twenty-four. It does not function as a lived timeframe that tightens decisions. The months-later summary bypasses temporal pressure. Present as phrase, but does not track elapsed time or create urgency. Missing middle development as a time constraint; closure mention is retrospective theme.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The motivation (translate separation into connection) is stated in paragraph seven, drives the scaffold construction, and is whispered as a promise in paragraph seventeen. Three gates present. However, it is declared rather than dramatized through conflicted choice—no on-page moment where connection costs her separation or vice versa. Functional causally but lacks visible friction or tradeoff, capping near 6.0.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Loosened grief is named in paragraph fifteen ("loosened grief rise... gentle release") and echoed in paragraph nineteen ("their own grief loosening") and the final laugh ("loose and bright"). Setup arrives late (second third), reducing integration. The tone modulates from weight to release, supporting the arc, but remains static rather than charging the final image with undeniable pressure. Two gates (development, payoff) with late setup cap near the two-gate ceiling.</comment>
