<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Mara's interiority is almost entirely absent; her "scheming" is told rather than shown through micro-choices under pressure. The monks are interchangeable and lack embodied emotion—their transformation is summarized ("his clenched jaw slowly unfurled") rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. The wanderer arrives too late to earn depth, and his blood-stained hands plus instant lullaby memory read as label-only backstory without present friction. Motivation remains abstract ("gentle twist of hidden gears") with no visible cost or genuine struggle on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The Orientation Test fails: who Mara is, where precisely she kneels, and when this occurs remain vague past 120 words, triggering −0.4. The dominant lens is unclear—events accumulate without causal linkage or a legible tightening (Kovan's touch → instant conversion, then the monks repeat the beat in summary). Closure is a summary statement ("carried its memory in every cell") rather than an on-page Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost; the wanderer's conversion duplicates the monks' beat without deepening. The story reads as outline rather than dramatized causality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The "soundless sanctuary" and "obsidian stone" are mentioned but never constrain a choice or alter tactics. Spatial choreography is vague—Mara "slips" the box into the circle without clear positioning. The setting absorbs echoes but this attribute does not pressure the monks' decisions. The micro-setting (music box) does charge the final wanderer beat slightly, lifting the score above ornamental, but the sanctuary itself remains postcard description.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake (releasing resentment) is declared but never tested. No reversal or tightening occurs; Kovan touches the box and immediately softens, then the monks repeat in lockstep summary. The wanderer's conversion duplicates the pattern without escalation. Mara faces no opposition, risk, or trade-off—her scheme succeeds without friction. Pressure is static, and the resolution is delivered by the music box's convenience rather than protagonist agency or cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Cellular memory" and "shifting grace" are prompt labels repeated without scene embodiment or thematic friction. The final image ("carried its memory in every cell, a quiet anthem of peace") states the theme rather than earning it through particulars. The wanderer's lullaby is a stock epiphany—told not discovered. The piece lacks a resonant, non-literal answer; instead it delivers a moral summary in the final paragraph ("Thus the sanctuary remained a beacon..."). Subtext is absent; all meaning is directly stated.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>POV distance is stable and third-person limited to Mara, with brief windows into Kovan and the wanderer that do not constitute head-hopping. However, perceptual signature is generic—Mara's way of noticing reads like neutral camera rather than character-specific bias. Dialogue ("Feel the rhythm of your own cells") is stiff, expository, and tonally flat. Register drifts into pseudoscientific abstraction ("cellular memory," "nervous pathways") without grounding in Mara's lived idiom. The prose lacks rhythmic control under pressure; the wanderer's climax uses the same template cadence as the monks'.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: "scheming pacifist" / "non-violent subterfuge," "shifting grace" used five times without reweighting, "cellular memory" repeated as decoration. Template cadence runs ("She recalled... she sensed... she plotted...") and filter-verb stacks ("seemed to recognize," "felt the weight") dull immediacy. Stock metaphors ("gentle twist of hidden gears," "thin veil of mist") and therapy-speak ("rewrite emotional pathways") cluster in peak beats, triggering −1.0 in Q7 and disallowing 9+ globally. The final paragraph summarizes rather than advancing image or action.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>The premise—mystical object reforms bitter monks through touch—is a widely used template without fresh transformation. "Cellular memory" and "shifting grace" read as prompt-insertion rather than lived-in world logic. The wanderer's arrival duplicates the monks' beat with no fresh inflection. Emotional beats (clenched jaw unfurls, weight dissolves) are stock gestures. The sanctuary's "soundless" attribute and the music box's reappearing pin are decorative rather than integral to choice or cost. No risk-taking or unconventional angle elevates the familiar material.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Mara is present throughout but makes no on-page decisions under pressure. Her "scheming" is backstory summary; she places the box and whispers, but these are setups without visible cost or trade-off. The wanderer scene shows her placing the box "unseen," again without choice-point or friction. She observes conversion twice but does not drive turns.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The music box and its broken/reappearing pin appear in setup (altar), middle (monks' circle), and ending (wanderer). However, the pin's mechanics are told rather than shown—it "materializes" and "pulses" without tactile detail or evolving use. The object solves problems it did not help create. Removing the pin's broken state would not fundamentally alter the story; any mystical object could substitute. Cap at 4.6 for late problem-solving; score 4.2 for ornamental deployment.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Shifting grace" is mentioned five times as decoration and once as a phase ("nightly phase when reality shifts") but never shapes tactics or alters on-page options. It is a thematic label rather than a dramatized constraint. The concept is swappable with "mystical energy" or similar; removing it would not break story logic.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The pin "reappears when needed" in three beats (Kovan, monks, wanderer), satisfying setup and development. However, the reappearance is passive—no character must act to trigger it, and it imposes no cost. The attribute is told ("whenever a soul in need pressed their palm") without dramatized friction. It enables but does not constrain. Cap at 4.6 for late resolution; score 3.6 for label-only presence.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>"Convince" occurs twice: Mara convinces the monks (summarized in lockstep), then the wanderer (duplicated beat). The action is present in the ending but delivered by the box's magic rather than Mara's agency or cost. The verb is swappable with "heal" or "transform" without structural change. Score 3.9 for functional but replaceable presence.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"Cellular memory" is mentioned three times as explanation ("rewrite emotional pathways," "memory of every breath," "cells remembering") but its mechanics never shape an attempt or impose cost. It is a thematic claim rather than a dramatized method. The phrase appears in setup (legend) and ending (summary) but does not constrain middle beats. Ornamental integration; cap at 2.8 for missing closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The "soundless sanctuary" frames the story and appears in the wanderer's arrival, satisfying setup and closure. However, it never pressures choices—the walls "become porous" but this does not alter tactics or impose cost. The setting is postcard description rather than micro-setting that shapes outcome. Score 4.3 for lyric resonance without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"While reality shifts" is mentioned once as a nightly phase and once as a condition ("when the night ended") but time does not tighten decisions. The monks' meditation and the wanderer's arrival occur in untracked time without urgency. The timeframe is a setup label with no development or payoff; cap at 2.8 for missing closure participation, score 2.4 for vague presence.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation "to teach resentment to release" is stated in setup and enacted in two beats (monks, wanderer). However, it is never dramatized through conflicted choice or cost—Mara faces no friction, and her desire is told rather than shown in micro-choices. The motivation is functional but replaceable with "heal" or "reform" without altering structure. Score 3.2 for told-only presence across beats.</comment>
