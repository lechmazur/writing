<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear but her interiority reads generic and label-heavy ("tranquilly perceptive," "dappled resolve"). Internal contradiction is absent; she moves through tasks with methodical calm that never fractures under the scale of discovery she claims to experience. The final vault revelation and council presentation feel like competent execution rather than choices that cost her something or foreclose a live path. Embodied emotion and micro-choices under genuine pressure are missing.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Causal with a late Accumulative tilt (repeated stamp imagery). Orientation anchors arrive early (who, where, when by the opening paragraph). The closure unit—pressing the stamp in the vault and the glow confirming the charter—attempts Decisive Change, but the cost is conceptual and asserted rather than dramatically felt on the page. The council scene that follows diffuses the ending rather than sharpening it. One meaningful tightening occurs (vault discovery) but the escalation feels more like a checklist of reveals than causally earned narrowing of options.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The flooded library setting is vivid and purposeful: water seeping through cracks alters ink hue, the vaulted ceiling trembles with currents. The antique ink stamp and scanner gears supply concrete tools that recur across beats. However, spatial choreography in the vault descent and the flooded streets remains gestural; the environment pressures atmosphere more than choice. The setting charges the final image but does not constrain a pivotal decision with visible cost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—tracing honest origins to protect submerged knowledge—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful turn: the vault discovery that confirms the alternative hypothesis. Agency is present but muted; Mara's decisions feel like steps in a research protocol rather than choices that trade off live options. The council agreement and floating-light network arrive as convenient validation rather than hard-won consequence. Cost is declared thematically ("reclaimed stillness") but not dramatized as a visible price paid.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Theme of preserving truth against erasure emerges from the premise and recurs in the stamp's cipher and the architects' vow. The ending attempts a resonant image (the glowing slab, the stamp as "token of hope") but leans on abstract assertions ("truth outshone fear") rather than concrete particulars. The "reclaimed stillness" motif is repeated label-like without accumulating fresh meaning. Subtext is thin; the story states its theme rather than dramatizing it through conflicted choice.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Single-POV distance is stable. However, the prose voice is generic literary rather than character-particular: "mournful sigh," "tangible foundation," "quiet proof" read as committee diction, not Mara's perceptual signature. Psychic distance is mid-close but uniform; no modulation under pressure. Diction occasionally drifts elevated ("sacrificial flood," "lattice cipher") without clear motivation from the focalizer's expertise. No dialogue is present.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and decorative synonyms pervade: "reclaimed stillness" appears four times without changing meaning; "dappled resolve" recurs as ornament; "tranquilly perceptive" is asserted twice without embodiment. Template cadence visible in "She discovered... She pressed... She emerged" sequences. Stock metaphors: "words were weighed with weighty intent," "story was anchored." Figurative density in non-peak beats (lantern painting "dappled resolve") obscures rather than propels. Information density is low; many sentences restate prior content.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The flooded-library-as-archive premise is familiar; the execution does not transform it through specific, non-obvious choices. The stamp-as-cipher and vault discovery feel like template adventure beats. Emotional arc (cataloguer finds validation) is generic. The "alternative hypothesis" framing and council presentation read as prompt compliance rather than organic invention. No bold risk or fresh synthesis evident.</comment>
