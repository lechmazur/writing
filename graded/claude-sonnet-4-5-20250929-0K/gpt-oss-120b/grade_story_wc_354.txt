<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The tutor remains an abstraction; "thoughtfully precise in every move" is declared but never dramatized through on-page micro-choices under pressure. Interiority consists of elevated philosophical musing ("hopeful melancholy," "aching beauty") without embodied contradiction or character-particular texture. The imagined chess board and stone-whispering operate as symbolic gestures rather than decisions with foreclosed paths or visible cost. No meaningful change or endurance is earned—he walks toward dimming light with the same resolve he began with.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation Test penalty: who, where, and when are named but remain vague placeholders (forgotten plateau, twilight, magnetic currents) without concrete spatial or temporal anchors past the ~120-word threshold; apply −0.4 and cap Q3 at 7.0. The ending offers no decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing with visible cost—he simply walks "ready to rewrite the covenant," a stated intention rather than an on-page alteration of options or meaning. The Drive Lens remains ambiguous (oscillates between lyric-accumulative and symbolic-causal without teaching a pattern or landing coherently), triggering an additional −0.4 and capping all categories at 8.0. Causality is replaced by metaphoric declaration; placing imagined chess pieces and speaking a phrase produce a "thin sliver of light" and pattern clarity through narrative assertion rather than earned action.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The "rust-colored dunes," "crimson sky," and "magnetic nexus at twilight" provide vivid color and atmosphere but remain postcard description—no spatial choreography (distances, access, obstacles) constrains the tutor's choices. The basalt stone is handled twice (warms, glows) and the imagined sky-board returns at closure, offering minimal constraint but charging the final image enough to enter mid-band. Sensory selection defaults to visual (sky, star, shadow) without hierarchy shaped by professional or personal priorities.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"to discover beauty in the difficult" and repair the eclipsed covenant—is signaled early but remains abstract. No on-page tightening or deepening narrows options: he arrives seeking, places imagined pieces without resistance, receives a sliver of light as confirmation, and departs with unchanged resolve. Agency is observational and declarative (whispers, lifts, speaks) rather than renunciative or enduring with visible cost. Coincidence (magnetic currents answering his phrase) resolves the pattern without protagonist struggle or trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The theme of covenant-repair through chess-as-cosmos emerges from recurring images (stone, board, twilight, eclipse) but is repeatedly stated rather than dramatized: "eclipsed covenant was not a broken oath but a paused conversation," "sorrow can be a compass," "beauty he sought would finally rise from the difficulty." The final image—stone pulsing, walking toward dimming light—offers a lyric reprise but no non-literal answer or reweighting; it restates the opening posture. Epiphanies ("What is hidden shines when darkness yields") arrive through assertion rather than earned struggle. Thematic Echo penalty (−0.5): the tutor articulates the story's thesis multiple times in prompt-like phrasing ("hopeful melancholy," "discover beauty in the difficult," "eclipsed covenant").</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Register drifts into elevated, poetic diction ("aching beauty," "wan flag," "star-cloaked elders," "hopeful melancholy") that reads more like authorial voice than the tutor's lived interiority under exile's pressure. Perceptual signature is generic rather than character-specific; the tutor notices in consistently lyric metaphor regardless of urgency. Psychic distance remains uniformly close-philosophical without modulation. No dialogue present to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase-loop penalty (−0.6): multiple adjacent sentences restate without added pressure—e.g., paragraphs 10–11 cycle through "eclipsed covenant was not broken/paused," "hidden pattern/beauty," "hopeful melancholy" as synonyms. Template-cadence penalty (−0.5): "He [verb]" stems and "The [noun] [verb]" constructions dominate (twelve instances in final third). Stock metaphor strings ("wan flag," "compass," "canvas," "beacon," "bridge," "brushstrokes") accumulate without fresh grounding. Filter-verb stacks in high-pressure beats ("felt," "realized," "knew," "recalled") dull immediacy, adding −0.5 and disallowing 9+ globally. Figurative density (metaphor in most sentences of the final third) without taught pattern applies −0.4. Artifacts touch the closure beat (final paragraph repeats "hopeful melancholy" three times), escalating cumulative penalty to −1.7 within Q7 and capping high-band entries at 8.8 per the Patterned-artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The exiled-mentor-seeks-cosmic-repair frame and chess-as-metaphysics premise follow widely used templates without transformation through specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus; apply Derivative Premise Guardrail (−0.8). The imagined sky-board, magnetic nexus, and stone-as-beacon are vivid but interchangeable symbolic conveniences rather than irreplaceable particulars that arise from character history. Emotional arc (exile → quest → resolve reaffirmed) is unchanged by the journey, reducing necessity in hindsight. No bold risk heightens stakes; the piece hedges in abstract lyricism rather than committing to concrete human friction or world logic.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>The exiled chess tutor is present throughout but makes no decisions that alter tactics or options—he observes, correlates, whispers, places imagined pieces, and walks. The journey confirms rather than tests his resolve; no choice forecloses a path with cost. Swappable with "exiled scholar" or "wandering mystic" with minimal edits.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The polished basalt worry stone dent is handled in three beats: carried/warmed (early), lifted/spoken to (mid), and glowing as beacon (closure). It returns with reweighted meaning (from "silent reminder of past failures" to "proof that his quest had already altered the world") and charges the final image. Causal pressure is weak—it hums confirmation rather than constraining or enabling a difficult choice—but closure linkage and reprise lift it into mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>The eclipsed covenant is named early and recurs as thematic claim ("not a broken oath but a paused conversation," "waiting for the right question," "rebirth before the next phase") but never shapes on-page tactics or alters options. It remains symbolic backdrop rather than a problem whose mechanics constrain the tutor's approach. Swappable with "forgotten pact" or "lost harmony" with no structural impact.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.2</grade><comment>"Thoughtfully precise" is asserted in the opening ("thoughtfully precise in every move") but not dramatized in on-page action—the tutor's choices (whisper, lift, place) carry no visible tradeoff between precision and other needs. Label-only mention trends low; no cost or enabling tied to this trait is legible.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Correlate" appears mid-story ("sought to correlate the patterns of the night sky," "correlate the silent patterns") as an observational task but does not drive a major turn—the tutor's "correlation" produces a sliver of light through assertion rather than earned method. Functional but swappable with "decipher," "align," or "interpret" with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"Translating silence" is signaled early ("by translating silence into a language of moves") and recurs at closure ("each silent translation"), but its mechanics remain vague—no on-page demonstration of how silence becomes move or how this method shapes attempts versus alternative approaches. Functional thematic claim without causal specificity.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The magnetic nexus at twilight is named early and its "invisible currents" are felt twice (brushing skin, waning at end), providing mild atmospheric pressure and a ticking quality. It supplies the sliver of light in the climax and whispers a final secret, participating in closure. However, it does not constrain choice—the tutor's actions are unaffected by magnetic properties—and "nexus" could be replaced with "sacred site" or "threshold" without altering tactics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.3</grade><comment>"Before the next phase" appears in the opening and twice near closure ("before the next phase of twilight," "rewrite the covenant before the next phase") but no clock is tracked and no decision is tightened by time running out. The tutor's pace is leisurely; twilight deepens but does not force urgency or trade-offs. Thematic echo rather than live constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"To discover beauty in the difficult" is declared early and echoed throughout ("hidden beauty he so dearly sought," "beauty he sought would finally rise from the difficulty") but remains told rather than dramatized—no on-page friction between the desire and competing costs (safety, speed, certainty) shapes a choice. The tutor consistently pursues this motivation without internal conflict or visible sacrifice.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Hopeful melancholy is named six times, creating coherence but also repetitive assertion. Tone modulates slightly (early "wan flag" and "silent reminder of past failures" → closing "hopeful melancholy humming in his veins") and charges the final image through explicit labeling. However, the mood is declared rather than evoked through contradictory embodied emotion, and the label itself trends toward therapy-speak. Closure participation and consistency lift the score into mid-band despite the tell-heavy execution.</comment>
