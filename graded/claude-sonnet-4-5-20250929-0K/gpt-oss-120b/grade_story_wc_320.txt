<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Selin remains thinly characterized throughout, defined primarily by her occupation rather than contradictory impulses or embodied struggle. Her "practical" approach to starlight and her climactic whisper of intention read as label-only traits without micro-choices that reveal competing values under pressure. The piece tells us she "refused to let nostalgia cloud the data" but never dramatizes a moment where nostalgia and pragmatism collide with visible cost. The final smile and confidence feel asserted rather than earned through on-page transformation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The story establishes spatial anchors (tower, gorge, antenna) within the opening paragraph, satisfying basic orientation. However, the closure unit—villagers emerging and thanking Selin—arrives without prior dramatization of their existence or stake in the tower's signal, creating a convenience resolution that undermines causal integrity. The "beginning in every ending" motif is declared repeatedly but never tested or deepened through a meaningful reversal; Selin's success unfolds as a series of affirmations rather than a tightening choice that forecloses options. Cost is conceptually implied but not legibly felt on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The suspended city and gorge setting are vividly rendered with concrete sensory detail (rusted towers, humming cables, silver-tinted beams during lunar perigee). The antenna's spiral stairwell and quantum coil provide tangible props that Selin interacts with across multiple beats. However, the setting functions primarily as atmospheric backdrop rather than constraining her choices or altering tactics; she climbs, places the shard, and succeeds without environmental resistance or spatial complication that charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—tuning the city's transmitter to decode the shard's signal—is signaled early but unfolds without meaningful opposition or tightening. Selin's whispered intention and calibration succeed on first attempt with no failed tactics, resource loss, or conflicting goods. The villagers' gratitude arrives as external validation rather than a pressure point Selin navigated; their sudden appearance feels coincidental rather than earned through her prior agency. The piece lacks a reversal or deepening that narrows options with visible cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The "beginning in every ending" theme is stated multiple times and echoed in the shard's function, the chord matching the city's founding vibration, and Selin's final cataloguing. However, the theme remains a repeated assertion rather than emerging from specific, contradictory action; Selin never confronts a choice where an ending must be embraced at genuine cost to find a beginning. The final image of filing data as "Genesis in Echo" restates the premise rather than reweighting prior material through non-literal resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. However, the narrative voice flattens into a uniform register of elevated diction ("serenely electric," "melodic line of creation," "practical magic") that reads more as authorial commentary than Selin's character-specific perception. Under peak pressure—climbing the antenna, interfacing the shard—the prose maintains the same lyric distance rather than tightening or fragmenting to reflect stress. The lack of dialogue (none on the page) is not penalized, but the single-voice interiority offers little perceptual signature beyond generic fantasy-engineer idiom.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The prose suffers from pervasive scaffold and synonym loops: "serenely electric" appears four times, "hush" recurs without functional variation, and multiple sentences restate the same concept (e.g., "the tower seemed to understand" immediately follows "she whispered her intention"). Template cadence dominates with parallel "she [verb]" constructions across adjacent lines. Figurative language stacks densely ("like a broken harp," "comet's tail," "silver lantern") without pattern-teaching or payoff, and the final third continues this density through the closure beat. Apply −1.2 for loops and template cadence touching closure, plus an additional −0.5 for filter-verb stacks and register drift into abstract diction during peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The core premise—celestial signal interpreter decoding a Hollywood star fragment in a suspended radio tower city—combines familiar genre tropes (ruined future city, mystical tech, signal-as-meaning) without a transforming angle rooted in specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The "practical magic" framing and the shard-as-key resolution follow predictable fantasy-engineer templates. The lunar perigee timing and the "beginning in every ending" motif are stated rather than dramatized through a fresh, inevitable-in-hindsight turn. The piece reads as competent synthesis without a distinctive perspective or risk that heightens stakes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Selin is present throughout and makes the decision to climb the antenna, place the shard, whisper her intention, and calibrate the transmitter. However, these choices unfold without meaningful opposition or cost; she succeeds on first attempt at each step. Her occupation as "celestial signal interpreter" frames the action but does not constrain her tactics or force a tradeoff. She appears in the final beat cataloguing data, but this is aftermath rather than a closure-shaping decision. Present across three beats (climb, interface, broadcast) with causal involvement, but the ease of success and lack of visible cost lower the score.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The "shard of hush" (Hollywood star fragment) is introduced in the opening, handled when Selin places it into the crystal slot, and returned to when she lowers it back into its cradle. Its "serenely electric glow" recurs across beats and its light "thickens" in response to the coil, showing evolving use. However, the shard functions primarily as a passive key that succeeds without resistance; removing it would require rewriting the resolution mechanism, but it does not constrain Selin's choices or impose a cost. Present in setup, middle, and ending with functional involvement, but swappable with any mystical decoder object.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The "shard of hush" phrase anchors the Hollywood star fragment and recurs as "hush" throughout the piece. However, "hush" operates more as a poetic label than a stake-shaping concept; Selin's task is to decode the signal, and "hush" does not constrain her tactics or impose a cost (e.g., she does not struggle with silence, nor does amplifying hush foreclose another path). The final line promises to "tune the next hush," but this is future setup rather than on-page pressure. Present thematically but not causally decisive.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Serenely electric" describes the shard's glow in four separate mentions but remains a static descriptor rather than a trait that constrains or enables action. The serenity does not calm Selin or complicate her approach; the electric quality does not shock, drain, or require special handling. The attribute is ornamental, used for atmospheric texture without altering Selin's choices or imposing a visible tradeoff. Label-only use without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Tune" is the central action: Selin climbs to tune the transmitter, places the shard to tune the coil, and broadcasts the chord to tune the gorge villages. The method recurs across three beats and drives the resolution. However, the tuning succeeds on first attempt without failed calibration or conflicting frequencies; swapping "tune" for "activate" or "align" would require only minor edits to the phrasing. Present in setup, middle, and ending with functional involvement, but the ease of success and lack of specificity in the tuning mechanics lower irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"By discarding assumptions" is stated once in the opening third: "by discarding assumptions about linear time and linear signal" and again "By discarding assumptions that the signal was a simple broadcast." This frames Selin's approach, but the text never dramatizes what assumptions she held or what cost she paid to discard them. The tuning unfolds without a visible shift in tactics or a moment where clinging to an assumption would have failed. Present as thematic framing but not as a method with on-page mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The "abandoned radio tower city suspended over a gorge" is vividly described across the opening and provides the physical stage for all action. The antenna's spiral stairwell, crystal slot, and quantum coil are handled on-page, and the gorge below reflects the chord's luminescence. However, the setting does not constrain Selin's choices (the climb is smooth, the interface works, the suspension does not threaten collapse), nor does the abandonment impose resource scarcity. Present in setup, middle, and ending with sensory detail and spatial involvement, but primarily atmospheric rather than tactically decisive.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Lunar perigee" is introduced in the opening as the night when "the moon pressed close enough to tint the steel beams with silver, amplifying the city's ancient antennae." It recurs in the final line as "the next lunar perigee." However, the timeframe does not impose urgency or tighten decisions; Selin works at her own pace without a ticking clock, and the perigee's amplification effect is stated rather than tested (e.g., she does not race the moon's departure or struggle with fluctuating signal strength). Present in setup and ending with functional setup, but no mid-scene pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"To find the beginning in every ending" is stated as Selin's whispered intention and recurs in her realization that "each ending she had ever recorded now held the seed of a beginning" and in the final archive label "Genesis in Echo." The motivation frames the thematic question and drives her decision to tune the transmitter for the villages' rebirth. However, it is never dramatized as a conflicted desire (e.g., she does not face a choice where preserving an ending would be easier or safer). Present thematically across setup, middle, and ending, but told rather than tested with friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Fantasy practicality" is signaled through phrases like "treated whispers of starlight as practical maps for survival," "practical light of dawn," "pragmatic hands," and "practical magic of the abandoned radio tower city." The tone remains stable across beats, blending lyric fantasy imagery (comet's tail, silver lantern) with grounded action (climbing, calibrating, filing data). However, the tone does not modulate under pressure or charge the final image with a distinct shift; the ending maintains the same measured, declarative register as the opening. Coherent and present throughout, but static rather than dynamically shaping closure.</comment>
