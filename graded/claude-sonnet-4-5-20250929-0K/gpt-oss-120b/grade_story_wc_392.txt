<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Mara's interiority is present but largely consists of abstract emotional claims ("fortified vulnerability," "watchfully calm") rather than contradictory impulses under pressure. The pivot at the rusted valve—deciding to redirect the water—feels unmotivated by prior struggle; we see her record data and trace a pipe, but no trade-off or genuine internal conflict that would make this choice costly. The mentor's warning about data and fear is told rather than dramatized, and Mara's emotions are summarized in therapy-adjacent language ("fortified vulnerability," "controlling influence") without embodied sensation or credible irrationality.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The piece anchors who and where quickly (Mara, tunnel, lantern). A closure effect is visible—the valve turn and water redirection—but the cost remains abstract: "loosen[ing] the controlling influence of the city's old bureaucratic neglect" and a "collective gratitude" are conceptual rather than viscerally felt or concretely forfeited on the page. The cause-effect chain is present (seepage pattern → hidden conduit → valve → redirection), but the final beat reads as logistical success without a visible personal or relational price that would elevate the resonance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The tunnel, lantern, and rusted valve are anchored and spatially coherent; the valve becomes a tactile pivot in the climax. Sensory detail is selective—amber glow, damp stone, water droplets as stars—and filtered through Mara's investigative focus. The lantern's flickering correlation with humidity shifts subtly grounds the discovery. The environment enables the final action (the valve) and thus meets the micro-setting constraint test, pushing the score into the mid-6s despite some reliance on generic underground atmosphere.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—mapping seepage to prevent future deaths—is signaled early. Pressure accumulates through observation and discovery, but the escalation is informational rather than agonistic; Mara encounters no meaningful obstacle or trade-off when she turns the valve. The resolution (water redirected, tunnel "breathing easier") is a logistical win without a visible personal cost or foreclosed option. One tightening occurs (the valve turn), but the absence of friction or sacrifice caps the band below strong.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges around breaking free from systemic neglect and honoring lost lives through action. The lantern's historical symbolism (underground railroad → resistance) is heavily stated rather than allowed to resonate through image alone. The ending offers a resolution—exposing the conduit and redirecting water—but the final lines ("no preventable death would be ignored," "break free from the shadow") moralize rather than trust the image to carry weight. The piece gestures toward complexity but resolves cleanly without ambiguity or lingering cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization is stable; Mara's perceptual signature prioritizes investigative detail (temperature, humidity, symbols). Register remains consistent, but diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("fortified vulnerability," "entangled memories," "collective gratitude") that feels authorial rather than character-particular under stress. Psychic distance is controlled, and no head-hopping occurs. The voice is competent but lacks the rhythmic modulation or idiosyncratic syntax that would distinguish it as singular; it reads more as functional clarity than as memorable texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The prose carries significant pattern debt: "entangled memories," "reverberate/reverberating" (used five times), "controlling influence" (three times), and "fortified vulnerability" recur without evolution, creating synonym loops and conceptual redundancy. Template cadence appears in strings like "I felt… I recalled… I placed… I noted… I traced… I turned." Many sentences restate content—e.g., the tunnel's "low thrum" and "stories reverberate" are paraphrased across adjacent lines. Figurative density is high without always advancing sense ("droplets clung… like memories," "shadows… reminded me of the past's lingering grip"). These artifacts pervade non-closure beats, triggering the patterned-artifact penalty pack baseline and capping high-band entry per the artifact rules.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The premise—investigator in tunnel with historical lantern discovers hidden conduit—assembles familiar elements (underground infrastructure, resistance history, preventable tragedy) without a fresh synthesis. The lantern's thematic role is stated rather than discovered through action, and the valve turn resolves without irony or complication. The piece commits to its premise but follows a median template: problem identification → clue discovery → solution → reflection. No bold structural or perspectival risk elevates the material; the ending satisfies but does not surprise or reweight prior beats in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Mara is present throughout and her role (preventable death investigator) frames the mission. She makes one on-page decision—turning the valve—but the choice is logistical rather than fraught; no visible trade-off or cost shapes the action. Observation dominates; the character's agency at closure feels more procedural than transformative.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The lantern appears in multiple beats: introduced early, placed on the crate, its flicker noted as a data correlation, and its glow illuminates symbols and the valve. It enables discovery (the humidity–flame link) and returns in the pack at the end. However, its meaning does not evolve; it remains a static symbol of resistance rather than accruing pressure or reweighting at closure. Two-gate participation (setup, middle) without a charged reprise caps the score in the mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Entangled memories" is invoked multiple times as a thematic label but does not constrain a choice or alter tactics. The concept is decorative—applied to droplets, the mentor's warning, and the final lullaby—without shaping Mara's decision-making or the story's stakes. It appears ornamentally across beats but remains swappable with any reflective metaphor.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Watchfully calm" is stated twice as a label but never dramatized as a trait that enables or constrains action. No scene shows Mara choosing to remain calm under pressure or paying a cost for that composure. The attribute is told rather than embodied and does not influence the plot or closure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Reverberate" appears five times (screech, cries, heartbeat echo, hope, gratitude) and is functionally tied to the thematic resonance of past and present. It shapes atmosphere and connects the tunnel's sounds to memory and emotion, but the action itself does not drive a major turn or redefine options. The verb is pervasive yet more thematic accent than causal lever; swapping it for "echo" or "resound" would not break the plot.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Through empirical observation" is signaled twice (mission statement, humidity correlation) and demonstrated on the page: Mara uses a sensor, records data, and traces the pipe based on observed patterns. The method enables the discovery of the conduit and thus the valve. It shapes one key turn (the humidity–flame link) and is present at closure preparation, meeting two gates and pushing into the mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The subway maintenance tunnel is anchored early, provides the lantern's glow and the valve's location, and supplies atmospheric pressure (darkness, damp, old symbols). The setting enables the discovery—Mara's movement through it and observation of seepage patterns lead to the valve. The tunnel "breathing easier" at the end reweights the space as a living presence. Three-gate participation (setup, middle, closure) and causal contribution push the score into the 6–7 range.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"After the drought ends" is mentioned in the opening but does not constrain Mara's actions or tighten the timeline. The timeframe is static context rather than a live clock that shapes decisions or adds urgency. No later beat references the drought's end or its consequences, so it remains ornamental setup without development or payoff.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"To break free from a controlling influence" is stated multiple times (city's neglect, bureaucratic overseers, shadow) and frames Mara's mission thematically. However, the desire is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choices or visible friction. The valve turn is presented as straightforward success without a trade-off between freedom and another value. The motivation is present across beats but not tested with cost, capping the score in the mid-4s.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Fortified vulnerability" is invoked twice as a label but not embodied in tone or modulated under pressure. The prose maintains a steady, declarative register throughout; no scene shifts between defensiveness and openness, and the final image ("breathing easier," "soft lullaby") resolves tension without preserving the vulnerability. The tone is stated rather than performed, and the ending's calm does not recharge the vulnerability claim.</comment>
