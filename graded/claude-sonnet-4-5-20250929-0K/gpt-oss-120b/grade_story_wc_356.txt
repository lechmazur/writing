<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Lira's interiority is ornamental rather than embodied—her ambition to "cultivate serenity within motion" is asserted repeatedly but never tested against competing impulses or forced choices. No internal contradiction appears; she plants, waits, and harvests without struggle, doubt, or visible cost that forecloses a path. The villagers serve as passive audience rather than applying pressure. Emotions are labeled ("her heart pulse in rhythm") instead of shown through specific, contradictory action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>No on-page closure: the seed blooms, villagers gather, and the custom continues, but no before/after change in options, knowledge, or stance is legible. The piece is a static chronicle of growth without reversal, cost, or decisive reconfiguration. Drive lens is ambiguous—neither causal linkage, accumulative pattern-break, nor situational crystallization is clear. Orientation Test waived (who/where/when anchored early), but the lack of closure severely limits the score.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The treetop village and birch trunk are vividly rendered, but they do not constrain choice or alter tactics—Lira's cultivation succeeds without spatial friction. Sensory detail ("olfactorily sensitive," "wildflower hush") is repeated but does not shift with urgency or force a micro-decision. The setting decorates rather than pressures; no environmental cost shapes the outcome.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Stakes are declared ("cultivate serenity") but never tested on the page. No reversal, tightening, or visible cost appears; the seed grows without obstacle, the flower blooms, and the village affirms the outcome. Coincidence does not complicate, and protagonist agency does not alter tactics. The resolution is given rather than earned.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Theme ("serenity within motion," "undercurrent of wisdom") is stated overtly in nearly every paragraph, crowding out dramatization. The ending moralizes ("a testament to the power of quiet ambition") rather than offering a non-literal image. Motifs (doodles, wrapping paper, wildflower hush) recur without accumulating pressure or constraining choice. No earned insight emerges from specific struggle.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited, and register is elevated throughout. Diction ("olfactorily sensitive," "tide's thought") is ornamental but consistent; no head-hopping occurs. The prose lacks perceptual signature—Lira's way of noticing does not shift under pressure. Purposeful compression is attempted but reads as lyric decoration rather than taught pattern.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Heavy paraphrase loops and template cadence dominate: "undercurrent of wisdom" appears five times, "olfactorily sensitive" three times, "wildflower hush" four times, each with near-identical framing. Runs of "She [verb]" and "The [noun] [verb]" create drumbeat rhythm. Mixed metaphors ("breath is a step," "tide's thought") muddle clarity. Figurative density in every beat without pattern payoff triggers −0.7; template cadence and loops add −1.0. Artifacts pervade and touch the ending, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The premise (patient herbalist cultivates rare bloom) is familiar, and the story does not transform it through specific conflict or non-obvious moral calculus. The corpse flower, doodling custom, and "undercurrent of wisdom" are ornamental rather than integral. No turn or inflection grows from prior particulars; the outcome is declared rather than earned. Derivative premise adjustment −0.8.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>Lira is present throughout but makes no key choice—she plants, waits, and witnesses. Observation without decision trends low.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The seed is planted early and blooms at the end, bracketing the story, but its growth is passive narration without mid-scene use that alters tactics. Late payoff with no middle development caps at 4.6; lyric reprise lifts slightly to 4.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>The "undercurrent of wisdom" is mentioned five times but never shapes a choice or constrains an option—it remains a thematic echo without on-page causal work.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>Lira's olfactory sensitivity is labeled three times but never enables or constrains an action with cost. No tradeoff is visible; it decorates rather than drives.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Journalizing appears in four mentions but does not turn the plot—entries mark progress rather than alter options. Swappable with "records" or "notes" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The doodling custom is introduced early and reprised at the end, but its mechanics do not shape any attempt or choice. Functional setup and lyric closure push it into mid-band, but swappability and lack of middle development hold it at 3.2.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The treetop village is described early and frames the action, but it does not pressure Lira's choices or supply resources that affect the outcome. Postcard description without tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"Turning of the tide's thought" appears once as a poetic marker; time is untracked and does not tighten decisions. No live clock alters moves.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is stated repeatedly ("cultivate serenity within motion") but never dramatized through conflicting wants or visible cost. Told-only trends low; early signal and thematic reprise lift it slightly.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Wildflower hush" recurs four times and modulates slightly (whisper to veil to breath), creating a coherent tone that charges the final image. Lack of middle development and ornamental mentions cap it at 4.2.</comment>
