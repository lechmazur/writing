<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Corin's motivation to "store wonder" remains abstract and decorative throughout; no contradictory impulses act in scene, only serene problem-solving. The "reflective locksmith" trait functions as a label rather than a constraint that forces tradeoffs. Interiority relies on elevated philosophical phrasing ("the paradox of capturing something as fleeting as an echo") rather than embodied stress or micro-choices with visible cost. The ending posits triumph without genuine struggle or foreclosed paths.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors arrive quickly (who, where, when), satisfying the test. However, no causal escalation appears—Corin observes, fashions a crystal, inserts it, and succeeds without setback or meaningful tightening. The "closure" is a completion of a project rather than a Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with visible cost; the jar fills, travelers later hear it, and Corin continues unchanged. Under a Causal lens (the most generous reading given "reverse-engineer"), because/therefore linkage is present but pressure never narrows options or forces a tradeoff, leaving the ending as summary rather than enacted closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The marble cavern, phosphorescent moss, and bronze plates supply vivid sensory anchors and spatial coherence. However, the environment functions as backdrop rather than constraint—no cavern feature blocks Corin or alters his tactics. The crystal and timer mechanism are handled across beats, but their use is frictionless, preventing the setting from charging the final image or forcing a micro-choice with cost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—capturing echoes—is signaled early but never tested by opposition, scarcity, or failure. Corin's first attempt succeeds immediately ("the timer shivered, and a low hum rose"), removing pressure rather than escalating it. No reversal, tightening, or visible price alters tactics; the story adds more jars without complication. Agency is present (he makes the crystal, inserts it) but carries no felt trade-off or foreclosed path, leaving escalation absent under any lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>A coherent theme—wonder versus reason, ephemerality versus preservation—emerges through imagery of echoes, jars, and reflected light. However, the final paragraph delivers overt thematic summary ("the locksmith had turned broken time into a chorus of stored wonder, a lesson in listening to the periphery") rather than letting the image speak. The "cellar of reason" metaphor is announced and explained rather than discovered through pressure, flattening subtext and risking sermon over resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The prose maintains a consistent elevated register ("the lull of a wounded season," "peripherally aware") that establishes a coherent narrative distance. However, diction drifts into essay-like abstraction during peak beats ("the paradox of capturing something as fleeting as an echo without imprisoning its source") and recycles syntactic stems ("He realized that," "He felt," "He recorded") across adjacent paragraphs, flattening rhythmic variety. POV remains stable with no head-hopping, but the voice lacks a perceptual signature distinct from generic lyric narration.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Multiple paraphrase loops appear: "reflective locksmith" is restated as "The locksmith's mind, always reflective," and "echo-harvest" recurs in summary without new pressure. Template cadence runs dominate mid-story ("He then spent hours studying… Each observation became… He fashioned… When he inserted…"), reducing propulsion. Elevated metaphors ("chorus of whispers," "tide of whispers," "library," "chorus of stored wonder") stack without coherent vehicle, triggering density and register penalties. The final two paragraphs summarize rather than dramatize, dulling the closure image with exposition ("a lesson in listening").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of locksmith, echo-harvesting, and light-reflection mechanics offers specificity and a non-obvious frame. However, the execution remains in the safety middle: no bold risk transforms the premise, and the emotional arc (patient craftsman succeeds) follows a familiar template without friction or surprise. The "wounded season" and "cellar of reason" metaphors gesture toward freshness but are not dramatized through lived cost, leaving the piece competent yet replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Corin appears in every beat and his decisions (fashion crystal, insert it, add jars) drive the sequence. However, these are implementations of a linear plan rather than turns under pressure; no choice alters tactics or forecloses a path. "Reflective" functions as a repeated label without constraining action. The character shapes momentum but does not create reversals or carry visible cost, placing him in the functional-but-replaceable band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The timer appears early (setup), is studied and repaired in the middle (development), and hums in the ending (payoff), satisfying all three gates. Its missing tooth drives Corin's crystal solution, linking two beats causally. However, the mechanism could be swapped for any broken device requiring a resonant component with minor edits, and its final presence is descriptive rather than decisively reweighted, capping the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Echo-harvesting frames the premise and recurs as a label ("echo-harvest," "harvest of echoes") across beats. However, it remains thematic decoration rather than a constraint that narrows options or imposes cost. The concept does not alter Corin's tactics or create friction; he succeeds on the first attempt. Present and functional, but swappable with "sound-capture" or similar terms without breaking story logic.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"Peripherally focused" appears twice as a label ("peripherally focused," "peripherally aware") but never constrains or enables an action with cost. It does not guide Corin's choices, cause him to miss central cues, or create a tradeoff. The attribute is ornamental, mentioned without dramatized pressure or consequence.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Reverse-engineering is signaled early, structures the middle acts (studying angles, fashioning crystal, inserting it), and is named again at closure, satisfying all three gates. The action shapes two distinct beats (observation, crystal insertion) and is causally essential to the echo-capture. However, the process is frictionless and could be replaced with "repair" or "attune" with modest edits, and no cost or failure tests its necessity, preventing a higher score.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Studying reflection angles is introduced early ("hours studying reflection angles at different times"), guides the bronze-plate setup and light observations (middle development), and is noted again in the penultimate paragraph (payoff). It appears in two beats and enables the crystal solution causally. Yet the method is summarized rather than dramatized with specific trial/error, and its mechanics remain vague enough that "light alignment" or "angle calibration" could substitute, capping the score in the mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The marble cavern anchors every scene (setup), supplies props (bronze plates, moss, fissures) that Corin uses (development), and frames the final image of glowing walls (payoff). It provides spatial coherence and sensory texture. However, no cavern feature constrains Corin's choices or imposes cost; he could perform the same actions in any enclosed acoustic space with reflective surfaces, leaving the setting functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"The lull of a wounded season" appears in the opening and recurs as "the wounded season" in closure, establishing a lyric frame. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions or alter tactics; Corin works without urgency, and "across the lull" implies undefined duration rather than a live clock. Time is present as atmosphere but does not pressure the protagonist, landing it in the ornamental band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The motivation to "store wonder in the cellar of reason, for later" is stated early, pursued through Corin's jar-filling, and affirmed at closure ("keep his wonder alive long after the last echo faded"). It appears in three beats and causally justifies his project. However, it is told and philosophized rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses or visible sacrifice; no cost tests the desire. The motivation is functional but lacks friction or lived tradeoff, capping it near the middle of the replaceable band.</comment>
