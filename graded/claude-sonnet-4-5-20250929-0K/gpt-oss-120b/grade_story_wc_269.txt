<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Mara and Eli remain thinly sketched; their interior lives are told rather than embodied. "Periodically eternal" is asserted as a mental state without concrete micro-choices that reveal contradiction or cost. The final "glance" exchange and log entry feel like summary gestures rather than decisions that foreclose paths with visible emotional weight.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Orientation is present but drifts: who is speaking, what specific task is underway, and the spatial relationship between characters remain vague past the opening third. The closure—discovering the canyon coordinate—reads as information retrieval rather than a decisive change with felt cost; the "bridge between past navigation and future restoration" is declared, not dramatized. The drive lens appears Accumulative/Textural, yet the ending does not reweight prior pressure through image or cadence shift, only through exposition.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The monitoring station, steel table, and torn atlas page anchor the scene adequately. The watermark reveal and canyon coordinate function as plot devices but do not constrain a character choice or charge the final image with embodied pressure. Sensory detail is present but generic—"quiet sensors," "measured breaths"—and the reef chemistry exposition arrives late without dramatized spatial or tactile consequence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The stated motivation—"to discover why some paths disappear"—drives curiosity but never faces a meaningful trade-off or complication. The tapping practice and data assembly proceed without resistance; the watermark discovery solves the mystery without protagonist struggle or cost. No reversal or tightening forecloses an option; the ending declares success rather than testing commitment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The piece gestures toward themes of memory, loss, and ecological navigation, but the final paragraph moralizes—"some changes are only visible when we listen long enough"—rather than letting image carry weight. "Periodically eternal" and "delayed revelation" are repeated as labels without concrete particulars that reweight the opening material. The atlas-as-clue insight is told, not earned through scene pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-person limited with Mara as anchor, but interiority is abstract—"her mind was periodically eternal" reads as placeholder rather than character-specific perception. Diction drifts into elevated register ("moored yet drifting," "a testament to listening") that feels imposed rather than voice-motivated. No dialogue appears to test character distinction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>Pervasive template cadence: "The practice of tapping rhythms turned..."; "The watermark's curve corresponded..."; "The torn atlas page, now complete..." recycles identical stems across adjacent paragraphs. Stock metaphors—"floating like kelp in a lazy current," "holding its breath"—cluster without fresh specification. Paraphrase loops summarize the same discovery multiple times in the final third, flattening momentum. Artifacts touch the closure beat, triggering the −1.7 deduction and disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The core premise—reef navigation loss tied to historical trade routes—offers a fresh synthesis of ecology and cartography, but execution leans on exposition and stock eco-fiction tropes. The tapping-as-listening ritual and "periodically eternal" phrasing feel ornamental rather than inevitable. No bold structural or perspectival risk; the ending explains rather than transforms.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>Mara is present throughout and her witnessing frames the story, but she makes no on-page decision that alters tactics or stakes. Her realization about chemical gradients is told, not dramatized as a choice with cost. Functional but replaceable; the discovery could proceed without her agency.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The atlas page appears early, is examined mid-story when the watermark is revealed, and resurfaces in the final log entry. It enables the discovery but does not constrain a choice or carry reweighted meaning at closure; the tear is labeled a "clue, not a loss" rather than charged through image. Two-gate presence (setup, payoff) with moderate causal work.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Delayed revelation" is named repeatedly and governs the watermark discovery, but it functions as plot mechanism rather than shaping on-page stakes or constraining tactics. The delay is told—"memory delayed revelation"—not felt through character friction or cost. Present in closure but not irreplaceable; a simpler discovery arc would serve.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>"Periodically eternal" is asserted as a mental state for Mara and later as a quality of the ocean's echo, but no action or choice hinges on it. The label recurs without embodied consequence or visible trade-off. Ornamental phrasing that could be cut without altering story logic.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Assemble" structures the nightly routine and the final alignment of evidence on the table. The act enables the discovery and is present in the closure image ("assembled a bridge"), but it proceeds without complication or cost. Essential to two beats and the ending, yet lacks the friction that would make it indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The tapping practice is introduced early, used to synchronize data and listen for the canyon echo, and mentioned in the final image ("lights flickered in rhythm with their taps"). It drives the watermark confirmation beat and frames the ending, but the mechanics are vague and the method does not constrain a failed attempt. Two-gate presence with moderate causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The monitoring station anchors location and houses the tools (console, table, instruments), but it supplies resources without pressuring choices. The station is described rather than used; no spatial constraint or access issue alters tactics. Functional backdrop that could be replaced by another research setting with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The fossil fuel ban is mentioned twice as historical context but does not tighten decisions or create urgency. The timeframe is static—no clock or deadline pressures the discovery. Present as backstory but does not shape on-page action or stakes.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The motivation "to discover why some paths disappear" is stated early and drives the data assembly and tapping practice. It governs the central question but is never dramatized through conflicting wants or costs; the characters pursue it without friction. Shapes two beats (assembly, discovery) and closure participation, but lacks visible trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Drifting moored" is named repeatedly and attempts to convey a balanced stasis, but the tone remains uniformly meditative without modulation under pressure. The final image reprises the phrase ("moored yet drifting") as summary rather than charged reconfiguration. Static mood that does not deepen with escalation.</comment>
