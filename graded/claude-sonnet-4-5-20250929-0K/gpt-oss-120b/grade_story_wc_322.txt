<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The "fever dream architect" remains purely label-only throughout; no internal conflict, contradictory impulses, or embodied emotion appears. His "unsettlingly calm" purpose is declared but never tested by pressure—he encounters no obstacle, makes no choice with visible cost, and experiences no change. The piece presents a tourist moving through set-pieces rather than a character whose flaws or desires drive difficult decisions. Motivation is asserted ("to discover the texture of connection") but never dramatized through friction between want and cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>No closure unit is present: the protagonist walks in, performs actions without opposition, and walks out unchanged. The Orientation Test penalty applies (−0.4): "who" is labeled but not anchored in concrete perception, "where" is abstracted into metaphor soup, and "when" never materializes. The piece lacks a dominant stake—no decision narrows options, no reversal alters knowledge, and the ending offers thematic assertion ("the world can be reshaped") rather than a Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with on-page cost. Drive lens is indeterminate; accumulative design is claimed but no cadence shift or pattern break reweights the material.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The "optical illusion gallery" is described in high metaphor but never functions as setting: no object, wall, or spatial constraint shapes a choice or alters the protagonist's options. Orientation debt compounds the harm—by line 120, we still lack clear "where" anchors (a room? corridor? courtyard?). Sensory detail is stacked but generic ("liquid glass," "cascades of color") without POV filter or purpose. The pedestal, courtyard, and bridge appear without spatial logic or causal link to prior moves.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>No dominant stake is signaled or tested. The protagonist faces no opposition, makes no choice with cost, and encounters no reversal—actions succeed without friction. "Erupt" recurs as visual effect but never escalates pressure or forecloses an option. The piece offers a series of tableau descriptions rather than a conflict arc: he weaves, colors burst, walls dissolve, rain falls, he walks, he leaves. No agency, no tightening, no price paid.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>Theme is declared rather than earned: "connections are both material and imagined" and "imagination can be measured" are stated outright in exposition. No specific event dramatizes these claims; the protagonist's "realization" arrives without struggle or cost. The final paragraph moralizes explicitly ("rational enchantment had indeed bridged the gap"), violating the no-sermon rule. Recurrence of "sinew thread" and "rational enchantment" reads as keyword cycling rather than motif that constrains or reweights.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Narrative distance is unstable: free indirect drifts into omniscient aesthetic judgment ("realistically imaginary choreography") that exceeds the focalizer's plausible lexicon. Register veers between elevated metaphor ("liquid glass," "translucent connections") and prompt-speak ("rational enchantment," "texture of connection"). The protagonist's perceptual signature is absent—every image feels like the same authorial voice describing for the reader rather than filtered through character urgency. No dialogue present; mono-POV voice lacks specificity or pressure modulation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Severe overwriting throughout: nearly every sentence stacks metaphor or elevated diction ("walls that bent perspective like liquid glass," "fibers humming with a rational enchantment," "patterns of light and shadow rearranging themselves as memories alter"). Paraphrase loops abound: lines 3–5 restate "illusion shifts" three times; lines 16–18 recycle "pulse/pattern/rhythm." Template cadence runs dominate (15+ sentences begin "He [verb]" or "The [noun]"). Figurative density in high-pressure beats (final paragraph) triggers −0.7; loops and stems add −0.8; total artifact penalty −1.5 routed here. Information density is near-zero—most sentences describe without advancing knowledge or choice.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>Core premise (metaphysical architect explores abstract gallery) is workshop-template familiar with no transformation through specific lived detail or non-obvious choice. Every element is ornamental: "sinew thread," "rational enchantment," "realistically imaginary" serve as prompt labels rather than irreplaceable story logic. No fresh inflection or earned turn—the piece cycles through tableau descriptions and exits with a generic affirming smile. Proximity to countless "dreamlike exploration → epiphany" workshop pieces without distinguishing specificity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>Character is label-only ("fever dream architect") and makes no choices that create turns. He performs scripted actions (weaving, listening, stepping) without friction, cost, or consequence. No decision alters tactics or options; he is purely observational.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Sinew thread appears in multiple beats (pedestal, weaving, wrist coil) but functions identically each time as visual prop. No evolving use, no cost tied to its handling, and easily swappable with "magic thread" or "glowing wire." Late-beat wrist reprise is ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Rational enchantment" is mentioned four times but never shapes a stake or tactic. It appears as theme label rather than a rule or constraint that alters on-page action. Summary-only; no dramatized moment shows what it enables or costs.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>1.9</grade><comment>"Realistically imaginary" is used twice as descriptor for choreography and proof but never constrains or enables an action with cost. Pure label without mechanical consequence; entirely swappable with "surreal" or "dreamlike."</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Erupt" recurs across beats (paintings, courtyard, golden rain, final world pulse) but each instance is cosmetic visual effect without causal link. Swappable with "shimmer" or "unfold" with minor edits; no major turn traces to eruption as unique mechanic.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Weaving patterns" is signaled early and performed on-page (loops, knots, filaments) but the mechanics never matter—every weave succeeds without friction or cost. Method is mentioned but does not shape attempts or constrain choices; ornamental craft description.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"Optical illusion gallery" is described extensively but never pressures a choice or supplies a resource that affects outcome. No corridor, pedestal, or courtyard constrains movement or forces a decision. Postcard description dominates; spatial logic is absent.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>1.2</grade><comment>"As memories alter" appears once in passing metaphor (line 4) and never returns or functions as timeframe constraint. No clock, no tightening pressure tied to memory shift; entirely vague and untracked.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>"To discover the texture of connection" is declared as purpose but never dramatized through conflicted choice. No on-page friction between desire and cost; the protagonist encounters no obstacle to discovery. Told-only motivation without scene pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Unsettling calm" is mentioned twice (opening, near end) and the prose maintains steady, elevated diction throughout. Tone is static rather than modulating with pressure; no coherent intensification or cadence shift. Consistent but inert; does not charge the final image.</comment>
