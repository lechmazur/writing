<question>1</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The pruner is a vessel for poetic action rather than a character with contradictory impulses or embodied stakes. Interiority consists entirely of reverential abstraction ("insatiably creative, dreaming of new flavors") with no micro-choices that reveal competing values under pressure. The traveler arrives late and departs as a convenience device. No agency choice forecloses a path with visible cost; the pruner simply tends, whispers, and gifts without struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Orientation Test: who/where/when arrive early, waived. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural by default (lyric accretion, no causal because/therefore). Closure requires a Resonant Reconfiguration or Conceptual Repricing with cost; the final image ("hope blossomed anew, a radiant hush forever echoing") restates the opening mood without reweighting prior material or making a cost legible. The seed's journey from crack to spore to blossomed sprig unfolds as a sequence of wonders, not a tightening that narrows options. No visible forfeiture, no felt price, no cadence shift that charges the ending.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The waterfall and parapet anchor space early. Sensory detail leans visual and abstract ("liquid amber," "radiant hush," "hues of sunrise and midnight") without micro-setting pressure that constrains a choice. The seed drinks mist, spores settle on branches, the traveler arrives—all occur in a frictionless environment that never limits access or alters tactics. The verdant parapet does not charge the final image; it remains postcard backdrop throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve wonder—is signaled but never tested by a live obstacle or trade-off. The storm scene offers a potential reversal ("threatened to drown"), yet the pruner sings and transmutes it into nourishment without cost; apparent complication becomes instant solution. The traveler's arrival might force a choice (give the sprig or withhold?), but the pruner "smiled" and offered it freely. No agency decision narrows options or deepens pressure under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Theme (wonder, hope, intertwined worlds) is stated rather than earned: "the color of wonder," "hope blossomed anew," "radiant hush forever echoing." The heirloom seed could function as a motif that constrains choice or charges closure, but it appears, cracks, scatters spores, and blooms in a frictionless sequence. The final gift to the traveler ("where the sky meets sea, the world's color would weave anew") articulates the thesis rather than letting concrete action answer the thematic question. No non-literal image reweights prior material with undeniable pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Single third-person POV holds without head-hopping. Diction is uniformly elevated and poetic ("insatiably creative," "verdant parapet," "luminous spores," "harmonic thread") with no variation under stress; the pruner's perceptual signature is indistinguishable from the narrator's lyricism. Register never modulates: storm, seed-crack, and traveler's plea all receive the same ornamental treatment. No distinct interior rhythm or character-specific filter; voice reads as committee consensus rather than a singular mind.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Overwriting pervades: figurative language in nearly every sentence ("liquid amber," "living poem," "veil between worlds thinned," "tiny messenger of the other realms," "crystal beads," "secret glyph") without pattern-teaching or payoff. Paraphrase loops: "radiant hush" recurs five times without evolving meaning; "succor" appears four times in identical function. Template cadence: "He [verb], his [noun] [participial phrase]" and "The [noun] [verb], and as [noun] [verb], its [noun] [verb]" repeat across multiple beats. Mixed metaphor: a seed "drinks" mist, then "absorbed the song," then "answered by scattering spores"—vehicle incoherence. Artifacts touch the closure beat ("radiant hush forever echoing").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>Core premise (magical gardener tends seed that bridges worlds) follows a familiar template: wise guide nurtures wonder-object, spreads hope. The traveler from a distant island with a faded map is stock quest furniture. Specific detail is replaced by lyric placeholder ("essence of each sunrise," "hues of sunrise and midnight," "color of wonder") that could apply to any fantasy garden. No fresh inflection: each turn (seed cracks, spores settle, storm transmutes, traveler departs with sprig) is narratively median and risk-averse. Transformation test fails; swap names/places and the emotional arc is unchanged.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The wise orchard pruner is present throughout and performs key actions (lifts seed, sets it on water, sings to storm, gifts sprig). However, these are not choices that narrow options or alter tactics under pressure; they are steps in a ritual sequence. The pruner never faces a competing want or cost. Introduced early (+0.5), involved in four beats (+1.2), but no causal pressure or visible tradeoff. Swappable with "wise gardener" or "keeper of the grove." Ornamental use −0.8. Final score neighborhood: mid-3s, rounded 3.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The heirloom seed is introduced early (paragraph 1, +0.6), handled in three distinct beats: lifted with reverence, set on water to drink mist, cracks and scatters spores (+1.2). Seed's properties (wrapped in bark, pulse of life, shell cracks, releases glow, scatters spores) are specific and irreplaceable (+0.6). However, it does not constrain a choice or impose cost; the pruner never risks losing it or must choose between competing uses. The traveler receives "a single sprig of the newly blossomed tree," not the seed itself; seed participates indirectly. Lyric reprise (seed → sprig → "lingering glow") without mid-scene friction fits ~5.5–6.3 band. No on-page cost tied to the element. Rounded 5.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Weaving between worlds" is mentioned as metaphor ("thin thread of possibility weaving between worlds," "stitched subtle bridges between realms," "weaving between worlds with the heirloom seed's lingering glow") but never dramatized as a tactic or constraint. The orchard hears "distant songs of other worlds" and the pruner listens "for the faint echo of distant gardens," yet no on-page choice depends on navigating or choosing between realms. Thematic echo without mechanical consequence. Present in final paragraph but ornamental. Ornamental use −0.9, late development −0.3. Rounded 2.6.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Insatiably creative" appears once as a label ("his heart was insatiably creative, dreaming of new flavors") and again near the end ("the pruner, insatiably creative, tended the living chorus"). No on-page action demonstrates this trait constraining or enabling a choice with cost. Does the pruner invent a new method, risk a bold experiment, or struggle with creative excess? No. The trait is asserted, not embodied. Label-only −0.8, swappable −0.6. Rounded 2.1.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Succor" (aid, relief) appears four times: pruner vows "to succor the garden," the glow is "a succor to the weary saplings," visitors feel "the very air offered succor," traveler begs "for succor." Each mention is abstracted assistance without a dramatized turn. The pruner does not withhold succor, ration it, or pay a price to give it; it flows freely. No major turn traces to this action. Swappable with "nurture" or "tend." Present across beats (+0.8) but ornamental use −0.9, no causal pressure −0.7. Rounded 4.3.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"Capturing essence of each sunrise and twilight" is the pruner's stated method (paragraph 1), yet the mechanics are never shown. Does he collect dew, sing at dawn, inscribe light? The seed drinks mist and absorbs song, but the pruner's vow is not enacted on the page. The storm scene ("sang to the wind, his voice a harmonic thread that captured the storm's frantic essence") echoes the method, but "capturing essence" remains metaphor without procedure. Summary-only use −0.7, late closure cameo (not causally active) −0.4. Rounded 2.9.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>The "verdant parapet beside a waterfall" anchors the opening and returns in three mentions ("walked the parapet," "verdant parapet" at visitor scene). It supplies the waterfall's mist (resource) but never limits access or alters tactics. Could the scene occur beside a lake or grove with minor edits? Yes. Swappable −0.7, postcard description −0.6, early signal +0.5, two beats +0.6. Functional but not indispensable. Rounded 3.4.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"Upon the hush of budding hope" is a phrase, not a tracked timeframe. No clock, season progression, or deadline tightens decisions. "At the verdant parapet... the sunrise," "At night, the waterfall's roar softened," "Each dawn he walked"—time cycles without pressure. The traveler arrives "later," but urgency is absent. Vague and untracked. Present in final line ("upon the hush of budding hope") as lyric bookend but does not alter tactics. Ornamental −0.8, no causal pressure −0.9. Rounded 1.8.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"To preserve the color of wonder" is the pruner's stated motivation (paragraph 1, +0.6). It drives the seed-planting sequence and the gift to the traveler (two beats, +0.9). However, the desire is never conflicted or tested by a competing want or cost. Does the pruner risk his own wonder, sacrifice another value, or face a limit? No. The motivation is told and enacted without friction. No visible tradeoff −0.7, told-only without embodied cost −0.6. Rounded 3.7.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Radiant hush" recurs five times as a tonal phrase: opening ("casting a radiant hush"), post-seed-crack ("Guided by a radiant hush"), nightfall ("the garden breathed a radiant hush"), final ("hope blossomed anew, a radiant hush forever echoing"). Tone is static—serene, reverent, luminous—throughout, with no modulation under the storm or traveler's plea. The phrase charges the final image by repetition but does not shift with pressure. Coherent but single-note. Early signal +0.6, closure linkage +0.9, static mood (no modulation) −0.9, template recurrence −0.4. Rounded 4.2.</comment>
