<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The vine dresser remains largely opaque; his motivation is told ("to prove that gardens know their gardeners") but never dramatized through conflicting wants or micro-choices under pressure. Interiority consists almost entirely of abstract assertions ("he felt the paradox of blooming withering settle in his bones") rather than embodied perception. The final "acknowledgment" arrives as gift rather than earned cost, and no on-page sacrifice forecloses a path. Agency is passive throughout—he polishes, listens, and receives rather than choosing between competing goods.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who and where by the second paragraph, but the timeframe "after luck becomes measurable" and "probability as a bright gauge in the sky" remain ornamental abstractions never integrated into causality. The piece offers no meaningful escalation: polishing marbles unlocks pathways and finally a clearing with zero resistance or cost. The garden "responds" and "affirms" without the protagonist earning change through renunciation or trade-off. Closure reads as reward rather than Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing—no visible cost or foreclosed path on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The garden maze supplies vivid images ("vines curling like whispered promises," "bark mottled like parchment") and the marbles function as tactile objects handled across beats. However, spatial choreography remains vague—alcoves, hedges, pathways, oak, and fountain appear without legible distances or navigation logic. The "blooming withering" motif recurs but does not constrain a choice or enable a tactic; it ornaments rather than pressures. At this length, the setting needed to force at least one trade-off (access vs. risk, time vs. thoroughness) to lift the score higher.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake ("to prove that gardens know their gardeners") is declared but never tested by meaningful opposition. The marbles crack but polish effortlessly; the garden "trembles mildly" and grants a fountain; the maze crowns him without extracting cost. No reversal narrows options, no deepening changes knowledge, and coincidence (the garden's awareness) resolves rather than complicates. Under any lens—Causal, Accumulative, or Situational—escalation is absent and the protagonist's labor faces no friction that might foreclose a path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The "blooming withering" duality is named repeatedly but never dramatized as a choice between competing goods or unavoidable harms. The phrase "commemorating small victories elaborately" and "mended deception" appear as prompt labels without specific grounding in the vine dresser's actions or worldview. The ending ("we will tend you as you tend us") states rather than implies reciprocity, foreclosing reflection. Theme remains an imposed thesis rather than an emergent property of conflict, and the final image offers satisfaction without lingering ambiguity or conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>POV distance is stable third-limited, and the perceptual signature ("feeling the cold edges like a reminder," "whispered a promise to the vines") maintains a consistent lyric register. However, the narrative leans heavily on filter verbs ("he sensed," "he felt," "he knew") that dull immediacy, and diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("the dual nature," "the paradox") mismatched to the tactile world. The garden's "mossy voice" and anthropomorphized dialogue flatten the naturalistic texture established earlier. No dialogue among human characters appears, so voice distinction is not tested.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: "a reminder that even truths can fracture" immediately follows "feeling the cold edges like a reminder," and "the maze itself had learned" echoes "the garden had indeed noted his measured steps" within three paragraphs. Template cadence runs stack ("He lifted… He whispered… He knelt… He felt… He bowed") without variation. Stock phrasing ("eyes reflecting the duality," "settle like dew on his skin") and mixed metaphors ("walls breathing," "lattice of truth," "tiny sun," "inner fire") cluster in peak beats, obscuring causal links. Information density is low; many sentences restate prior content without advancing pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The garden-responds-to-care premise is familiar, and the execution does not transform it through specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The "luck becomes measurable" frame is introduced but never integrated, reading as ornamental sci-fi dressing on a pastoral template. The marbles and polishing ritual could swap for seeds and planting with negligible structural change. Risk-taking is minimal; the piece hedges toward safety by granting the protagonist unearned reward and avoiding the cost of genuine struggle or renunciation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The withered vine dresser is present throughout and his polishing action drives the sequence, but his choices are reactive and unopposed. He discovers, lifts, polishes, places, listens, and bows without friction or trade-off. The garden grants pathways and a clearing in response to his labor, but no on-page decision alters tactics or forecloses a competing option. He is the vehicle for action rather than an agent who shapes turns through choice under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The cracked marbles appear early (second major beat), are handled in the polishing ritual (middle), and reappear at the oak and in the final clearing where their "shining pathways" are named. They serve as a tactile anchor and their state evolves (cracked → polished). However, their causal role is passive: they unlock rather than constrain, and removing them would not break the logic if replaced by seeds, stones, or water. No visible cost ties to their specific properties, and the final "tiny sun" image decorates rather than reconfigures prior stakes.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Mended deception" is mentioned in the second paragraph ("a pact that had slipped into mended deception") and gestured at near the oak ("the moment when deception was first whispered"), but it never shapes on-page choices or tactics. The vine dresser's labor is framed as "honest labor" that resolves deception, yet no deception is dramatized—no lie, no misleading act, no conflicting truth. The concept remains thematic wallpaper, invoked but not integrated into causality or cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Wisely pragmatic" appears as a label in the opening ("known throughout the winding paths as a wisely pragmatic gardener, balancing ambition with the inevitable decay of seasons") but does not constrain or enable a single on-page action. The vine dresser never faces a choice between ambition and acceptance, risk and caution, or short-term gain and long-term cost. The trait is told rather than shown, and swapping it for "patient" or "devoted" would leave the plot unchanged.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Polishing drives the middle sequence: he polishes each marble, and each shine unlocks a pathway. The action is specific and recurs across three beats (alcove, oak, clearing). However, the act is effortless and unopposed; no cost, no failed polish, no trade-off between speed and thoroughness. The closure credits polishing ("Your wisely pragmatic heart has turned cracked promises into shining pathways"), but the garden's response is reward rather than consequence of a difficult choice, lowering causal necessity.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Commemorating small victories elaborately" is named once in abstract narration ("a ritual of commemorating small victories elaborately") and later echoed in the fountain's whisper ("each name echoed a tiny triumph, a proof that his method of commemorating small victories elaborately had borne fruit"). The method is label-only; no specific elaboration is shown—no carving, no ceremony, no sacrifice of time or resource. The phrase appears to fulfill a prompt requirement without dramatization or cost, and its mechanics do not shape any choice.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The garden maze provides the setting throughout and its walls, vines, and pathways recur. The maze's spatial structure gates access (alcove, oak, hidden clearing) and the vines physically interact with the protagonist in the final beat. However, spatial choreography is vague—distances, navigation logic, and movement constraints remain unclear—and the maze never forces a tactical choice (which path, what cost to proceed). It functions as backdrop with one charged moment (vines crowning him) rather than persistent pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"After luck becomes measurable" and the "probability gauge in the sky" appear in the opening and once more as a "measurable hum," but the timeframe never tightens decisions, tracks elapsed duration, or alters tactics. The mechanic is ornamental: removing it would leave causality intact. No clock pressure, no narrowing window, no cost of delay. The element reads as sci-fi garnish on a timeless pastoral, introduced to check a box rather than shape the stakes.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The motivation "to prove that gardens know their gardeners" is stated early and revisited at closure ("the garden now recognized its keeper"). However, it is never dramatized as conflicted desire or tested by a competing want. The vine dresser acts without hesitation, and the garden affirms him without requiring sacrifice or renunciation. The proof arrives as gift rather than hard-won validation, and no friction between the want and its cost appears on the page.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Blooming withering" is named repeatedly and recurs as a motif ("The garden responded in a blooming withering symphony," "the paradox of blooming withering settle in his bones," "the blooming withering of his world now sang"). The tone is coherent and the duality modulates slightly as the garden unfurls and dims simultaneously. However, the concept remains abstract ornament rather than pressure that forces choice. The tone decorates rather than charges the closure, and removing the phrase would not alter the emotional arc or stakes.</comment>
