<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Mina's motivation is declared ("must find the stairway") but her choices lack genuine cost or contradiction. The journey unfolds as smooth discovery with no internal conflict; she finds murals, follows sigils, and ascends without hesitation or trade-off. Interiority consists mostly of atmospheric perception rather than embodied stakes. The "wisely adventurous" trait remains label-only, never constraining a choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: imagery and motifs accumulate toward the throne claim. However, the closure lacks felt cost—Mina simply places the flake, the throne "accepts her," and she smiles. No path is foreclosed, no price paid; the ending summarizes satisfaction rather than dramatizing a reconfiguration. Orientation anchors adequately early, but the because/therefore chain is weak; discoveries happen sequentially without motivated resistance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The kaleidoscopic waterfall, neon archives, and holographic vines create vivid sensory texture, and the orchard setting is signaled early. However, environment never constrains a tactical choice—Mina moves through fissures and corridors without spatial friction. The ruby flake pulses but doesn't limit options. Micro-setting (body, tool, object) doesn't charge the final image with consequence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding the stairway before sunrise—is declared but never tested. Mina encounters no meaningful obstacle; each step reveals the next clue without resistance. The sunrise deadline dissolves without urgency; she ascends, claims the throne, and *then* sunrise breaks with no cost for delay. No reversal, no tightening that narrows options. Agency is observation, not decision under pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The futuristic-nostalgia fusion of "analog and digital," "memory and possibility" threads through imagery consistently. Yet theme remains asserted rather than earned—"balance between past and onward dreams" is stated, not dramatized through a choice with visible cost. The final image (greeting the sunrise, vowing to record) summarizes meaning rather than offering a non-literal answer. No complexity or counter-reading emerges.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Voice maintains a consistent lyric-elevated register with phrases like "sallyed," "fermented jasmine and silicon," "blooming data trees." However, diction occasionally drifts into generic fantasy-tech ("polished alloy," "pixelated rain") without POV-specific texture. No dialogue appears. Distance is stable, but perceptual signature lacks character-specific bias—Mina notices everything equally. The voice supports atmosphere but doesn't modulate under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Overwriting pervades: nearly every sentence carries metaphor or figurative language without breath ("boots echoing against mossy bark as holographic dew glimmered," "a cascade of pixelated rain, each drop a memory"). Template cadence appears in the opening third: "She X, feeling Y" structures repeat. Paraphrase loops cluster mid-story: "ascension" and "stairway" recur without added meaning. Closure beat summary—"her journey complete, yet the future stretched"—deflates rather than charges. Line-level density is low; many sentences restate atmosphere.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>The core synthesis—tech-mystic lore keeper claiming a throne through artifact and mural—follows familiar quest-object templates. "Futuristic nostalgia" is signaled but not transformed; neon/holographic descriptors remain ornamental. No turn feels non-obvious in hindsight. The piece hedges toward median aesthetic choices (lyric description, smooth escalation, tidy resolution) without bold stakes or risk. Mina's arc is generic: seek, find, claim, record.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Mina is present throughout and her role (lore keeper) frames the search, but she makes no consequential choice. She observes, follows, and ascends without trade-off. The closure—placing the flake—is passive acceptance rather than decision under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The ruby flake appears early (first paragraph), pulses in at least three beats (palm, mid-journey urging, throne placement), and enables the bridge of fire. However, its properties are static; it never constrains a choice or imposes cost. Closure involvement is mechanical: she places it, light explodes, done.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The unclaimed throne is named early and drives the search goal, appearing at the end as the seat she claims. Yet it remains abstract—no competing claimant, no cost of claiming, no tactical choice shaped by "unclaimed" status. It's a destination, not a pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Wisely adventurous" is declared in paragraph two but never dramatized. No on-page moment shows Mina balancing caution with boldness or making a trade-off between wisdom and risk. Label-only.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Sally" appears twice ("sallyed into the orchard," "sallyed again" at the end) but is swappable with "ventured" or "set out" without structural loss. The action doesn't create a turn or redefine options; it's a synonym for movement.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Peeling paint layers to reveal murals occurs in one extended beat (paragraphs 10–12) and directly yields the sigil/location. The method matters causally—without it, no stairway. However, it's not signaled earlier and doesn't recur or impose cost. Mid-range causal role.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The hidden orchard behind the waterfall is named early and frames the journey. It supplies the murals and fissure, but never constrains a choice or alters tactics. At closure, it "fades" and later "sings," serving as backdrop rather than pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Sunrise is mentioned early ("before sunrise") and at the end ("sunrise finally broke"), but the deadline is never tested. Mina ascends at her own pace; no moment shows time running out or forcing a hurried choice. The clock is ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Finding the stairway of ascension is stated as Mina's motivation and drives the search structure. Yet the desire is never conflicted—no competing want, no friction between cost and goal. It's told, not dramatized through choice under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Futuristic nostalgia is woven throughout via "fermented jasmine and silicon," "neon ruins and blooming data trees," "analog and digital" chorus. Tone is consistent and modulates gently from search to arrival. However, it doesn't intensify under pressure or charge the final image with specific cost; it remains a consistent aesthetic layer.</comment>
