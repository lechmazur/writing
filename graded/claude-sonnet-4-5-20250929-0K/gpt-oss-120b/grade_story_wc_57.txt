<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The seed collector remains a static figure whose "infinite patience" is asserted rather than tested through contradictory impulses. No meaningful internal conflict appears—he kneels, decodes, whispers thanks, and waits without any visible cost or trade-off that would foreclose a path. The mission is declared ("preserve ancient methods") but never faces on-page resistance that forces a difficult choice. Embodied emotion is absent; all interiority reads as placid observation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the opening lines, satisfying the test. However, no decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing with visible cost appears at closure—the final image ("the rope revealed a spiral… ready to be shared") is a declaration of readiness, not an enacted shift that forecloses options or reweights stakes. The piece unfolds as a series of descriptive tableaux without causal linkage; each paragraph could be reordered with minimal impact. Lens reads as Accumulative/Textural by default, but no density increase or cadence shift charges the ending.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The golden dock under snow is vividly rendered and recurs across beats, anchoring the spatial frame. Fog and rope are handled on the page (he kneels, traces knots, coils the rope). However, setting does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; the environment remains postcard backdrop rather than pressure source. The fulgurite glass and wooden chest function as props without meaningful resistance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>One dominant stake is signaled early (preserve ancient methods), but no on-page tightening or reversal tests it. The rope "clicks into place" without complication; the glass warms and he seals it, all frictionless. No live option is foreclosed, no visible price paid. The protagonist's agency is observation and ritual, not decision under pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Theme (preservation, patience, encoded wisdom) emerges through image and motif rather than overt statement, which is a strength. The fulgurite glass and knotwork carry symbolic weight. Yet the final image—"ready to be shared"—resolves into a neat affirmation without ambiguity or cost, and the "master weaver" sign arrives as convenient validation rather than a thematic reckoning earned through prior friction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Voice is consistent and lyric, with a distinct textural signature ("breath held by the sea," "pale spine"). Psychic distance remains stable. However, the prose converges on a single register of elevated metaphor throughout, and the protagonist's perceptual signature does not modulate under pressure—calm observation persists identically across all beats. No dialogue appears.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Overwriting pervades: nearly every sentence deploys figurative language ("muted echo of distant tides," "ripple like water," "sleeping serpent"), creating density without propulsion. Paraphrase loops appear ("He felt infinitely patient" echoes the opening assertion; "oceanic hush" recurs four times with minimal reweighting). Template cadence runs: "He [verb]" structures dominate the middle third. Scaffold phrasing ("each knot a verse," "each visit offered new patterns") accumulates without advancing cause-effect. Final third artifacts (loops, metaphor stacks) disallow 9+ globally and trigger −1.4 in Q7 plus cross-cap at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The premise (philosophical collector decoding ancient knowledge in knotwork) offers a mildly fresh synthesis, but execution relies on stock lyric moves: patient seeker, hidden wisdom, fog-laden threshold, convenient revelation. The master weaver sign arrives as a plot gift rather than an earned turn. Emotional arc and conflict are replaced by aesthetic tableau, trending toward the safety middle.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade>comment>Present throughout and identified early. However, the character observes and performs ritual without making a choice that alters tactics or forecloses an option. His decisions (kneel, decode, seal) are frictionless execution of the mission, not turns. Swappable with "scholar" or "archivist" with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Appears early (opening paragraph) and in three beats: carried, warmed when the knot clicks, lifted to his lips, and sealed in the chest. The glass enables the ritual but does not constrain a choice or evolve in meaning—its function remains static. Present in closure (sealed for tomorrow) but not causally active there.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Introduced early and frames the mission. The weavers are sought, thanked, and imagined at the end. Yet they remain abstract—no on-page encounter or tactical constraint emerges. The concept shapes the premise but not the protagonist's choices under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Asserted four times ("infinitely patient," "felt infinitely patient," "aware that any rush would shatter") but never tested. No scene shows impatience as a temptation or patience as a trade-off that costs him speed, opportunity, or relationship. Label-only mention without visible consequence.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Present across multiple beats: he coaxes meaning from knots, coaxes old songs from rope and storm, and coaxes time into patience. The action is central to the method and recurs. However, "coax" could be replaced with "decode" or "interpret" with minimal structural change; the verb does not impose unique mechanics that redefine options.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Signaled early (second paragraph) and demonstrated on the page: he kneels, traces knots, decodes rhythm, finds the looping figure-eight. The method shapes the middle sequence and its mechanics (matching fulgurite curve to knot pattern) matter to the ritual. Present in closure (rope now untangled, new patterns offered). The method drives at least two beats and contributes to the ending's charge.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Present from the title and opening line, recurring across all beats. The dock provides spatial coherence and sensory detail (wood glinting gold, ribs under snow). Fishermen leave rope at the dock's edge, integrating setting with action. However, the setting does not constrain a choice—any quiet location with rope would serve. Micro-setting (the dock's edge, the rope) anchors action but does not alter tactics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>Introduced early ("as fog rolled") and recurs (fog thickens, lingers, peels back at sunrise). Time progression is vague—"night fell," "one evening," "each fog-laden morning"—without a live clock that tightens decisions. The fog marks atmosphere but does not impose urgency or deadline pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Stated clearly in paragraph six ("to preserve ancient methods before modern tides washed them away") and referenced at closure ("promising to sow their knowledge"). However, the motivation is told, not dramatized through conflicting wants or costs. No friction arises between preservation and another desire; the mission proceeds uncontested.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Established early ("harbor was hushed," "oceanic hush") and sustained across beats through fog, breath imagery, and slow cadence. Tone is coherent and modulates subtly (quiet → vigil → reverence). The final image ("hold its breath in reverence") charges the hush with accumulated weight. However, tone remains static rather than shifting with escalating pressure, as no escalation occurs.</comment>
