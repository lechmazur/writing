<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation arrives late (mid-story realization about "harnessing the ephemeral") and feels declared rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. The choice to let the beacon fade reads unmotivated—no prior interiority establishes why she would trust "the temple's judgment" or what cost that surrender carries personally. Interiority leans on abstract phrasing ("unsnarl the tight coil of panic," "calm resolve") rather than embodied sensation. The final choice lacks visible cost; she rises with the vial intact, releases it ceremonially, then returns repeatedly without friction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed: "distress signal sender" and battery status appear in the HUD, but who Mara is and why she's alone remain vague until the mid-story motivation reveal. The closure unit—releasing the vial on shore—lacks visible cost; Mara keeps the vial, returns with fresh tributes, and suffers no dramatized consequence. Causality is weak: the temple "demands a price," she lets the beacon fade, yet she surfaces safely with the vial and later uncorks it at will. The lens appears accumulative (hush, perfume, memories layering), but the final release doesn't reweight prior material with undeniable pressure—it simply fulfills the stated intention.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The underwater temple provides vivid anchors—kelp, basalt columns, stained glass, bioluminescent fish—and the vial's placement in the column triggers the hush. Spatial choreography is mostly clear, though the vial "slips from her hands" onto the altar yet later "glowed faintly in her satchel" without explanation. The temple's physicality does constrain one choice (placing the vial in the hollow), reaching the lower end of the essential band, but subsequent handling becomes inconsistent.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—retrieve the vial to share its power—is signaled early but never truly tightened. The "price" the temple demands is surrendering the beacon, yet this costs Mara nothing on the page; she surfaces unharmed, keeps the vial, and fulfills her goal. No reversal narrows options; the bioluminescent fish spell "unsnarl" but don't force a trade-off. The resolution is not earned by protagonist sacrifice—luck and temple beneficence solve everything. Coincidence (the temple's generosity) resolves rather than complicates.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Theme of ephemeral beauty and shared wonder emerges through the vial and hush imagery, avoiding overt moralizing. The recurring "gathered hush" and "lonesome splendor" phrases attempt resonance, but the final act—uncorking the vial to share eternity—states the theme rather than reweighting it through a non-literal image. The piece gestures toward complexity (solitude vs. sharing, instinct vs. purpose) but resolves tidily: Mara gets everything, the world inhales eternity, no ambiguity remains. Mid-band for thematic presence without challenging closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, no head-hopping. Diction is lyric and consistent ("violet gloom," "moonlit glass"), though register occasionally drifts into abstraction ("unsnarl thought itself, by overriding instinct"). Perceptual signature is generic—Mara notices in a way any diver might. The phrase "distress signal sender" is used three times, twice as a label for Mara herself, creating odd distancing. No dialogue to assess. Textural specificity is present but not character-particular.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "gathered hush" appears eight times, "touches memories" / "touch memories" / "touching memories" cycles four times, "crystal perfume vial" is repeated eleven times (often in full), "unsnarl" appears five times in similar constructions. Template cadence: "The walls were carved… seemed to touches memories" / "seemed to reach out and touch memories" / "touching memories of every diver." Register drift into elevated abstraction ("ephemeral," "lonesome splendor") clashes with the HUD and beacon framing. Figurative density is high without pattern-teaching. Artifacts touch closure: the final paragraph restates "gathered hush," "lonesome splendor," and "crystal perfume vial" in a summary loop. Applying −1.7 in Q7 for artifact spread touching closure and disallowing 9+ globally per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The underwater-temple-guardian premise and magical-object quest are stock fantasy templates. "Scent of a sunrise never seen by mortal eyes" and "slowed the tide of time itself" are familiar poetic constructions. The turn—giving up hope to gain wisdom—echoes many hero's-journey trials without specific transformation. Emotional specificity is thin; Mara's arc from panic to calm resolve follows a predictable path. No bold structural risk; the piece opts for lush description over fresh synthesis.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Mara ("distress signal sender") is present throughout but makes few choices that alter tactics. Letting the beacon fade is the sole decision-driven turn, yet it's unmotivated and costless. She observes, inhales, remembers, then surfaces successfully. Functional but replaceable; the character could be swapped for any diver-seeker without structural change.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The crystal perfume vial appears in setup (rumor, then placement in column), middle (glows, slips to altar), and closure (glowed in satchel, uncorked on shore, laid as tribute). It drives the middle beat (placement triggers hush) and is present in the ending image (uncorking releases the scent). However, it "slips from her hands" yet later "glowed faintly in her satchel" without explanation, and its properties don't constrain later choices—Mara uses it at will. Two gates met with moderate causal pressure; mid-essential band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Gathered hush" is seeded early ("legends said the vial could conjure a gathered hush"), recurs in the middle (the hush gathers around her, calms the sea), and is mentioned at closure ("gathered hush into the morning air"). It shapes one key turn—the sea calming—but functions mostly as atmospheric label rather than a stake-altering force. Two gates with minimal causal pressure; lower essential band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Touches memories" is introduced mid-story ("seemed to touches memories of an ancient choir," then "seemed to reach out and touch memories"), used passively (the vial does it, not Mara), and recycled at closure ("touching memories of every diver"). Label-only trait with no on-page cost or choice constraint. Present in middle and ending but ornamental; mid-functional band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Unsnarl" appears in setup (inhale "unsnarl the tight coil of panic"), middle (bioluminescent fish spell "unsnarl" in glyphs, "unsnarl of her own fear dissolve"), and closure framing ("chose to unsnarl fear"). It marks two beats (initial calm, fish revelation) and is thematically present at the end. However, it's easily swappable with "dissolve," "release," or "calm" without structural loss. Two gates, thematic reprise, but mid-causal pressure; mid-essential band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"By overriding instinct" is mentioned twice, both times as abstract commentary ("by overriding instinct" with purpose, "came not from instinct but by overriding instinct with purpose"). It's never shown as a method Mara employs; no on-page beat demonstrates her overriding an impulse through a specific tactic. Label-only, no middle development, summary-only at closure; functional but replaceable, capped at 3.8 per swappability.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The "forgotten underwater temple" is anchored early (violet gloom, pillars, kelp), constrains the middle action (vial placement in basalt column triggers the hush, arches frame the fish), and is invoked at closure ("the temple would remain"). It shapes two distinct beats and supplies the mechanism for the vial's effect. Essential across beats; lower end of indispensable band due to strong setup, middle constraint, and closure presence.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"As time runs short" is seeded in setup ("battery waning," "as time runs short, every breath counted") but never tightens decisions. Mara takes her time placing the vial, inhaling memories, drifting back to childhood, rising slowly; no urgency pressures her choices. The battery/beacon is mentioned once more (she lets it fade) without cost. Setup present, no middle or closure participation; ornamental, capped at 2.8 per missing closure gate.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"To harness the ephemeral" is stated mid-story ("Mara realized her true motivation: to harness the ephemeral") and echoed at closure ("lonesome splendor she carried would bridge worlds"). It frames her goal and the ending action (uncorking the vial), shaping one key turn (the realization) and appearing in the final image. However, it's told rather than dramatized through conflicted choices; no on-page friction between cost and desire. Setup weak (arrives mid-story), middle realization functional, closure invocation thematic; two-gate lyric reprise with modest causal work, mid-essential band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Lonesome splendor" appears early (pledge "a lonesome splendor she would carry home"), middle ("replaced by a calm resolve"), and closure (repeated twice: "the lonesome splendor she carried," "lonesome splendor… would never be forgotten"). Tone is lush, melancholic, consistent through turns, and charges the final image (Mara smiling, carrying the splendor, returning at dusk). The phrase itself recurs with reweighted meaning (initial isolation → shared gift). Three gates, coherent modulation, closure linkage; essential band entry.</comment>
