<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The protagonist remains passive throughout, with no contradictory impulses or earned choices under pressure. His "making peace" with the dream is told through abstract declarations ("I will keep you") rather than dramatized through competing wants or visible tradeoffs. Interior life consists of generic meditative statements and label-only emotions (petrichor nostalgia, excruciatingly gentle) recycled across paragraphs without embodied tension. The final "peace" arrives without foreclosing any live option or demonstrating what he gives up to achieve it.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Who/where/when anchor by the first paragraph, no orientation penalty. The piece attempts Accumulative/Textural drive but lacks a decisive tightening or cadence shift that narrows options; the scribe simply completes the numerals without facing any obstacle or cost that changes his tactics. The closure ("made peace") is asserted in summary rather than landing through a final image that reweights prior material. Cost is claimed ("abandoned dream settle into his chest") but not dramatized—no on-page action or forfeiture makes the before/after legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Vivid sensory anchors (petrichor, cracked stained glass, crystal slab) establish atmosphere, but most detail remains decorative postcard description that does not constrain choice. The crystal "whispers" and "pulses" yet these effects guide no decision; the scribe's act of inscribing proceeds identically whether the crystal responds or not. Spatial choreography is clear, and the sanctuary's "soundless" quality is maintained, placing the work in mid-band for functional but non-essential setting use.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reconciling with the abandoned dream) is signaled early but never tested on the page. No reversal, obstacle, or competing pressure forces the scribe to choose between wants or pay a visible price; he begins intending to inscribe and completes the task without friction. The claim that the dream "once haunted him like a bear in winter" remains abstract backstory, and the resolution—whispering gratitude and feeling the rhythm settle—is purely internal summary. Under Accumulative lens, no tightening or deepening alters his options or tactics.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Theme (time, memory, gentle resilience) emerges through recurring images (crystal, rain, gears), and the final clock chime offers a lyric closure gesture. However, the thematic question is never dramatized through conflict or choice; the scribe's reconciliation is declared rather than earned through specific struggle. Multiple phrases approach sermon territory ("excruciatingly gentle resilience, a beacon for any soul willing to bear the weight of forgotten hopes") without grounding the insight in concrete on-page experience. The crystal-as-teacher dynamic relies on mystical hand-waving instead of particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited with consistent psychic distance. Perceptual signature is generic contemplative rather than character-specific; the scribe's way of noticing (petrichor, glacial hush) could belong to any meditative figure. Lexicon drifts between literary register ("excruciatingly gentle," "glacial hush") and straightforward narration without a unifying voice texture. Heavy reliance on abstract modifiers and recycled phrases ("excruciatingly gentle" appears six times, "glacial hush" thrice) flattens rhythmic control and reads as template cadence rather than purposeful compression.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops dominate: two near-identical sentences about imagining the clock on a rainy night appear back-to-back; "excruciatingly gentle" recurs across eight distinct beats without evolving meaning; "glacial hush" and "petrichor nostalgia" are invoked as stock atmosphere rather than earned through fresh detail. Template cadence runs (e.g., "He recalled… He realized… He reached… He imagined… He whispered… He felt… He closed… He whispered… The clock now stood…") across fifteen consecutive beats create mechanical propulsion. Multiple metaphors mix incoherently (crystal "exhales," bears as time-hands, dream as "bear of possibilities," crystal "breathing"). Applying patterned-artifact penalty pack: paraphrase loops −0.6, template cadence −0.6, stock metaphor strings −0.4 = baseline −1.6; artifacts touch closure beat (final paragraph repeats "excruciatingly gentle," "glacial hush," "petrichor") = −1.7 total, plus disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band entries at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>Core premise (artisan reconciles with abandoned creative dream through mystical communion with landscape) follows a widely used contemplative-resolution template without transformation through specific world logic, occupational constraint, or moral calculus. The crystal's "whispering" and "teaching" function as convenient external validation rather than a constraint the scribe must work within or against. Emotional specificity is minimal; the progression from haunted to peaceful could apply to any abandoned hope without the clock-scribe occupation mattering to the beats. No bold structural or tonal risk elevates the familiar arc.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Introduced in the opening line and present across most beats, but the scribe's choices do not create turns—he arrives intending to inscribe and completes the task without obstacle or decision that alters tactics. "Introverted" functions as a label rather than a trait that shapes on-page behavior; he speaks aloud to the crystal and processes thoughts in generic meditative mode indistinguishable from an extroverted contemplative. Setup + ornamental middle use + ornamental closure presence (no causal role in the final peace declaration) = two gates, eligible to ~6.0, but passivity and label-only trait lower to mid-low band. Early signal +0.3, beat involvement (ornamental across many) +0.4, ornamental use −0.8, swappability (could be any artisan) −0.5 = ~2.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Introduced early (paragraph 5) and revisited multiple times (paragraphs 6, 9, 20, 29), but use remains static description—the crystal "whispers" and "pulses" without imposing cost or constraint on the scribe's actions. He inscribes on a "thin sliver of crystal" (paragraph 15) yet this material choice does not narrow his options or differ meaningfully from any other surface. The final whisper of gratitude (paragraph 29) is ornamental callback, not causal reweighting. Setup +0.5, beat involvement (two distinct touches: sliver use, final whisper) +0.9, ornamental use −0.8, summary-only mystical guidance −0.5 = ~4.1.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Glacial hush" appears five times as atmospheric descriptor (paragraphs 4, 10, 16, 22) without shaping stakes or altering tactics; the scribe's work proceeds identically whether the hush is present or absent. The concept functions as thematic label rather than on-page pressure. Setup +0.5, ornamental use −0.8, label-only theme claim −0.3, swappability (any silence term) −0.6 = ~3.6.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"Excruciatingly gentle" recurs eight times (paragraphs 6, 10, 16, 22, 26, 27, 30) as modifier for atmosphere, rhythm, and resilience, but never constrains or enables an on-page action with cost. The trait is asserted as label without visible tradeoff—the scribe's gentleness does not prevent a harsher alternative or cost him speed, precision, or guild approval. Setup +0.3, ornamental use across many beats −0.8, label-only trait −0.3, synonym churn (recycled phrasing) −0.3 = ~2.9.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Bear" appears three times: metaphor for the dream's scale (paragraph 13), imagined clock hands moving like bears (paragraph 18), and the final simile about the dream "like a bear in winter" (paragraph 27). None of these uses drive a turn or redefine options; all are ornamental figurative language. The verb "bear" (to carry) appears twice (paragraphs 7, 24) but does not constitute the required action element—these are passive endurance claims, not decisions that alter tactics. Setup (metaphor introduced mid-story, paragraph 13) −0.3, ornamental use −0.8, swappability (any large/patient metaphor) −0.6 = ~3.2.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>N/A</grade><comment>Required element is "None."</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The sanctuary is anchored early (paragraph 1) and its "soundless" quality recurs across paragraphs (1, 10, 24, 30), pressuring the scribe's solitary work by foreclosing social interaction and amplifying the crystal's whispers as the sole "voice." The walls "humming faintly" (paragraph 24) and final "soft sigh" (paragraph 30) provide micro-constraint (the space responds, reinforcing his isolation and the dream's interiority). The sanctuary does not supply a tool or resource that changes tactics, limiting its causal role. Setup +0.6, beat involvement (soundless quality across three beats) +0.9, causal pressure (isolation as constraint) +0.8, closure linkage (final sigh charges the peace moment) +0.9, swappability (any quiet workspace) −0.5 = ~5.8.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"Hidden sunrise" and "first light" anchor the opening (paragraphs 1, 4, 9, 22, 27) and the sunrise "growing brighter" (paragraph 22) marks the passage toward completion. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions—the scribe works at his own pace with no deadline or pressure to finish before the light fades. Time is scenic backdrop, not live clock. Setup +0.5, beat involvement (sunrise progression across three beats) +0.9, ornamental use (no urgency) −0.8, swappability (any dawn) −0.5 = ~3.4.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The motivation is declared in paragraph 14 and referenced across backstory beats (paragraphs 8, 11–13, 22, 27, 29), but it is told rather than dramatized through friction. The scribe never faces a choice between honoring the dream and another want (guild approval, practicality, rest); he simply decides "I will keep you" (paragraph 20) and proceeds. The guild's dismissal (paragraph 8) is past summary, not present obstacle. Setup +0.6, beat involvement (backstory references) +0.4, summary-only −0.5, no friction between wants and costs −0.8 = ~4.7.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Petrichor nostalgia" appears four times (paragraphs 3, 17, 26, 27) as atmospheric label and modulates slightly (from scent memory to "soothing the lingering petrichor" at the end), but the tone remains static contemplative reverence without pressure-driven shift. The final image includes petrichor as ornamental callback rather than reweighted charge. Setup +0.5, beat involvement (two distinct touches: scent, final soothing) +0.9, ornamental use −0.6, label-only mood −0.3, closure linkage (minor callback) +0.3 = ~4.3.</comment>
