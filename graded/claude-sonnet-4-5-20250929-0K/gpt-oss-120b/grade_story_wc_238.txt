<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The protagonist is established through her occupation and methods, but interiority remains largely abstract—"felt the weight lift" and "hoping the words would find Mara's ears" replace embodied contradiction. The apology is narrated rather than enacted through a costly present choice; the exorcist arranges objects and whispers, but no live decision forecloses a path on the page. Mara exists only as memory; no second character applies pressure. Minor: "gossip-column exorcist" and "induced currents" are label-heavy without grounding the actual struggle that would earn change.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the exorcist gathers relics, arranges pages, and releases vapor to create a resonant apology. Orientation anchors who (the exorcist) and where (archive/orchard edge) by the first paragraph but "when" (the hush before trees are cut) remains atmospheric rather than a ticking pressure. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—weight lifts, apology lingers—but cost is asserted ("I carry the weight of that ash") rather than forfeited on the page; we see no sacrifice or tactical shift that narrows options. The sheet titled 'Apology to Mara' appears conveneniently on cue without prior setup, weakening causality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The archive and orchard are vividly rendered with selective detail (vaulted aisles, weathered piano, amber glass, rusted gate, ancient grief). The perfume bottle constrains the ritual method and charges the final image when its scent merges with pine. Spatial choreography is clear across moves from archive interior to orchard edge. The hush and impending axe create atmospheric pressure, though the trees function more as backdrop than tactical obstacle.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—deliver an overdue apology to Mara—is signaled early. Pressure accumulates texturally (perfume → piano vibrations → sheet descent → wind-carried words) but no reversal or tactical cost narrows options; the exorcist's actions proceed unopposed. The apology's text materializes without friction, and Mara's response remains off-page. One tightening occurs when the orchard's final tree falls and "the echo of her apology lingered," but this reads as atmospheric confirmation rather than a choice that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Theme of imperfect miracles and forgiveness emerges through the perfume ritual and the metaphor "a broken mirror still reflects sunlight, if only the shards are arranged in a circle." The apology's text—"I carry the weight of that ash"—articulates regret concretely. However, the final line's "promise that apologies, like music, can linger beyond the silence" tilts toward overt statement. The story resists false tidiness (Mara's response is absent, the miracle is "imperfect"), but the thematic throughline is more narrated than dramatized through conflicted choice.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited. Voice carries a lyric, slightly elevated register ("gossip‑column exorcist," "gritty, ethereal chorus," "fragrant bridge between apology and absolution") that reads consistent and apt for a ritualistic frame. The prose occasionally drifts into abstraction ("induced currents of memory," "imperfect miracles") without grounding the exorcist's perceptual signature in concrete sensory bias. No dialogue present. Psychic distance holds; no head-hopping. Filter verbs ("felt," "sensed") appear but do not dull immediacy given the reflective mode.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Line-level craft is uneven. Figurative language is dense—nearly every sentence in the opening and closing beats carries metaphor or elevated diction ("conduit for induced currents of memory," "living map of regret," "gritty, ethereal chorus")—without pattern-teaching or payoff that justifies the accumulation, triggering overwriting penalties (−0.5). Paraphrase loops appear: "imperfect miracles" recurs four times with minor variation; "induced currents" appears six times, often in adjacent lines without functional shift (−0.4). Template cadence in the final third: "She whispered… She remembered… She arranged… She lifted… She stepped… She felt… She turned" (−0.5). Clarity remains legible but momentum sags. No major grammar errors.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The "gossip-column exorcist" frame is a fresh synthesis, and the perfume-as-conduit ritual offers specificity. However, the emotional arc—guilt → apology → absolution—follows a familiar template, and key beats (the sheet descending, the apology's text forming in vapor) rely on convenient manifestation rather than earned causality. The metaphor "a broken mirror still reflects sunlight, if only the shards are arranged in a circle" is vivid but does not transform prior material. The orchard's impending destruction and Mara's absence add texture but do not complicate the protagonist's path with cost or counter-pressure.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The gossip-column exorcist is present throughout and her occupation frames the premise, but her choices are preparatory (placing the bottle, arranging pages, whispering verse) rather than turning the plot under pressure. No key reversal traces to a decision where scandal-banishing skill creates a tactical cost. She observes memory and releases apology; the role constrains tone but does not drive beats causally.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The antique perfume bottle appears early (paragraph 4), is placed on the piano to coax vibrations (paragraph 6), pulses with induced currents (paragraphs 10–12), and is lifted and closed in the final beats (paragraphs 18, 22). Its essence shapes the ritual method and charges the closure image when scent merges with orchard pine. However, its mechanics (how scent becomes "induced currents") remain abstract, and it does not constrain a tactical choice with visible cost—removal would weaken atmosphere but not break plot logic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Imperfect miracles" is declared in the title and echoed three times in the text ("imperfect miracles of the world," "The apology was imperfect, a miracle not wholly healed," "even gritty miracles can be sweet"). It names the theme but does not shape on-page stakes or tactics; the exorcist's ritual proceeds without friction that tests the concept's limits. Present as thematic claim, swappable with "flawed grace" or "broken healing" without structural impact.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Advises through metaphors" is signaled in paragraph 7 ("she advised through metaphors, saying that forgiveness was a broken chord") and enacted once more in paragraph 12 (her mother's mirror metaphor). The trait colors voice but does not constrain a tactical choice with cost; the metaphors are offered to the reader, not tested against Mara's resistance or the exorcist's doubt. Functional but replaceable—could be "advises through song" or "through visions" without altering beats.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Reconnect" drives the dominant stake: the exorcist seeks to reach Mara's abandoned cottage with an apology. The action frames setup, middle arranging, and the wind-carried words at closure. However, reconnection itself occurs off-page (no confirmation Mara hears or responds), and the story's turns (sheet descent, vapor text) are ritual steps rather than friction that tests the goal. Essential to premise but not to visible consequence.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Induced currents" appears six times, framing the perfume bottle's ritual function (paragraphs 5, 10, 12, 14, 17, 19). The method is signaled early and recurs across beats, but its mechanics remain abstract—how scent becomes electrical "currents" that "pulse" and create "blue glow" is asserted, not constrained by world rules. The phrase reads as decorative labeling; swapping "induced currents" for "resonant waves" or "conjured echoes" would require only synonym edits.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The sheet music archive anchors the opening and frames the ritual space (vaulted aisles, weathered piano, highest shelf). The setting supplies the torn scores that the exorcist arranges into a spiral and the descending sheet titled 'Apology to Mara.' It exhales "a final chord" at closure. The archive enables the ritual but does not pressure choices—spatial layout does not constrain tactics, and the exorcist moves freely. Shapes atmosphere and one causal beat (sheet descent) but could be replaced by another quiet, resonant space.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The timeframe "during the hush before the orchard's trees are cut down" is established early and the final axe falls in the closing beats, bracketing the ritual. The impending destruction creates atmospheric urgency ("the hush pressing tighter," "ancient grief soften") but does not tighten tactics on the page—the exorcist's ritual proceeds at its own pace without a ticking clock that forces truncation or error. Present across the arc but functions as mood rather than constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The motivation to deliver an overdue apology is signaled in paragraph 8 ("the only way to deliver an overdue apology") and drives the entire ritual sequence. The text of the apology appears in paragraph 15 with embodied regret ("I carry the weight of that ash"). However, the desire is enacted through preparatory gestures (placing, arranging, whispering) rather than a conflicted choice that trades off competing goods. The apology's sending at closure feels atmospheric rather than a forfeiture with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Ethereal grit" is invoked explicitly twice (paragraphs 16, 19: "gritty, ethereal chorus," "ethereal grit") and modulates across the piece—lyric elevated diction ("vaulted aisles," "conduit," "imperfect miracles") layered with tactile grounding ("rusted gate," "burned candles," "ash"). The tone coheres but remains somewhat static; no sharp modulation under pressure tests the balance. The final image ("gritty miracles can be sweet") restates rather than charges the tone with new cost.</comment>
