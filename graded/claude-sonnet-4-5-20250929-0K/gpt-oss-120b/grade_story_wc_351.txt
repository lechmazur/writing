<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Aria's motivation to "become the archeologist of abandoned dreams" is declared but never tested through genuine friction or cost; she proceeds smoothly from setup to triumph without internal contradiction or a moment where her aspiration conflicts with immediate price. The interiority leans heavily on abstract formulations ("chaotically precise," "helix-minded") that function as labels rather than embodied thought under pressure. Emotions are asserted through elevated diction ("quaking reverie," "heart quaked") rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses in scene. A micro-choice to "press on" after a tremor gestures toward struggle but lacks visible consequence that alters her later tactics.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The piece anchors who and where early enough (Aria, canyon, moonlit night) and signals a dominant stake (interfacing the mirror with the canyon's memory). Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the mirror's calibration, the canyon's hum, and the projection of memories build density and charge the final image of dawn and gathered shards. Closure arrives as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—Aria walks away "ready to catalog the next abandoned dream"—but the cost is oblique; no visible forfeiture or foreclosed path is legible on the page, only a faint echo and a promise that "stories…would endure." The tremor mid-scene offers a micro reversal but does not narrow options or raise price in a way that reweights the ending.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Moonlit canyon, basalt column, and the broken mirror provide vivid anchors and sensory detail (silver cliffs, liquid quartz moonlight, humming shards). The mirror's shards align with fissures in stone, creating a micro-setting that constrains Aria's method and charges the final tableau. However, the environment does not force a tactical choice or alter her approach under pressure; the tremor is noted but does not redirect action. Sensory selection is largely atmospheric rather than filtered through Aria's professional or personal priorities, reading closer to travelogue than lived urgency.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>One dominant stake is clear: modify the mirror to interface with the canyon's memory. Pressure accumulates through calibration, the canyon's responsive hum, and the projected tableau, but no tightening choice narrows Aria's options or forces a trade-off with legible cost. The tremor introduces a moment of risk ("the stone could fracture"), yet she steadies herself and presses on without visible consequence or tactical adjustment. The ending reconfigures the mirror from relic to compass, but coincidence (dawn arrives, the tableau fades) drives the resolution more than protagonist agency under duress.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the concrete particulars of abandoned dreams (ship, poem, song) reflected in the mirror, and the central question—can one revive lost ambitions—shapes the arc. Yet the final image offers a promise ("stories…would endure") rather than a resonant, non-literal answer with conceptual cost; Aria's realization that she "must not only record them, but revive them" is stated rather than earned through a choice that forecloses another path. The recurring motif of the helix and synaptic plasticity risks ornamental abstraction when not tied to visible on-page friction. The ending leans toward thematic summary ("ready to catalog the next abandoned dream") instead of an image that reweights prior material without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-person close on Aria, and the prose carries a distinct lyric texture ("liquid quartz," "quaking reverie," "spiraling like DNA"). However, register drifts into elevated, abstracted diction ("entangled memories," "synaptic plasticity," "helix-minded") that sits uneasily with the immediacy of scene pressure, especially in peak beats where embodied perception would sharpen urgency. Psychic distance fluctuates without clear purpose: Aria's interiority alternates between concrete action (pressing palm to mirror) and high-concept formulation (treating mineral veins as brain tissue) in ways that flatten rather than modulate emotional intensity. No dialogue appears, so voice distinction and subtext bullets do not apply.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Overwriting pervades high-pressure beats: nearly every sentence in the calibration and projection sequence stacks metaphor or elevated diction without pattern-teaching or payoff, triggering the density penalty (−0.6). Mixed metaphors appear ("moonlight spilling…like liquid quartz," "heart quaked with reverie") and register drifts into abstract academic lexicon ("synaptic plasticity," "entangled memories," "chaotically precise") outside a plausible POV filter. Template cadence is evident in repeated "She [verb]" and "The [noun] [verb]" stems across adjacent lines. Paraphrase loops occur: "Each shard became a neuron, each fissure a synapse" restates the synaptic-plasticity conceit already introduced two paragraphs earlier. Cumulatively, these artifacts dull immediacy and obscure the closure image (−1.4 total in Q7), disallowing 9+ globally per the artifact-in-final-third rule.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The premise—using a broken mirror to interface with a canyon's memory via synaptic plasticity—offers surface novelty but leans on speculative-science template framing without grounding the mechanism in lived consequence or non-obvious moral calculus. The emotional arc (lone engineer achieves communion with landscape) and the imagery (moonlit canyon, forgotten dreams, dawn departure) follow familiar beats without a fresh inflection that grows from prior particulars. The transformation test suggests moderate swappability: replace mirror with another recording device and canyon with another ruin, and the structure holds. Elevated diction and abstract motifs (helix, entangled memories) gesture toward originality but read as ornamental layering rather than organic synthesis.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Aria is present throughout and her choices (calibrating the mirror, pressing her palm, gathering shards) advance the plot. However, these actions do not create key turns with visible cost; she proceeds smoothly from setup to success without a decision that narrows options or forecloses a path. The tremor offers a moment where she could retreat or adapt, but she "steadies herself…and pressed on" without tactical consequence. Setup is early, beats are plentiful, but causal pressure and closure linkage are weak; her final walk away is a summary rather than a charged choice.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The broken periscope mirror appears early (paragraph 3), is handled across multiple beats (calibration, palm press, projection, gathering shards at dawn), and its state evolves from broken relic to humming compass. It constrains Aria's method (aligning shards with fissures) and charges the final image (each shard "humming softly, a promise"). However, the mirror does not force a trade-off or visible cost; it functions more as a conduit than an object whose specific properties create friction. All three gates are met, supporting mid-high range, but causal pressure and irreplaceability fall short of 7+.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Entangled memories" is introduced early (paragraph 4) and recurs as a thematic accent throughout (memory lattice, stored recollections, cascade of memories). However, it shapes the conceptual backdrop more than it constrains Aria's on-page choices; the memories are projected and observed but do not narrow options or impose cost. The concept functions as a setting detail rather than a stake-altering force. Setup and closure participation are present, but middle development and causal pressure are weak.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"Chaotically precise" appears twice (paragraphs 6 and 23) as a label for Aria's mind and aspirations, but it does not constrain or enable a specific on-page action with visible cost. The trait is asserted rather than dramatized through a choice where chaos and precision conflict. Ornamental use without causal work caps the score low.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Modify" is the central action: Aria modifies the mirror to interface with the canyon. Setup is early (paragraph 9), the action drives multiple beats (calibration, alignment, pressing palm), and the ending hinges on the modification's success (the mirror now "served as a compass"). However, the modification proceeds without friction or visible cost; no failed attempt, no sacrifice of another tool or tactic. All three gates are met, and the action is specific, but the lack of trade-off or reversal limits upward movement.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>"Synaptic plasticity" is introduced as Aria's proposed method (paragraph 10) and is restated when the mirror "began to rewrite the stone's internal pathways" (paragraph 18). The concept shapes her approach but its mechanics remain abstract; the story asserts that neural-like pathways align without showing how that alignment imposes constraint, risk, or cost. Setup and middle presence are clear, but the method does not differentiate this attempt from a generic "interface" or "attunement," and it does not force a tactical adjustment when the tremor arrives.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The moonlit canyon anchors the entire piece (early setup, sustained across beats, present in the final image at dawn). The basalt column provides a physical site for Aria's lab, and the canyon's fissures align with the mirror's shards, enabling the interface. The canyon's hum and tremor offer environmental responses that add atmosphere and one moment of risk. However, the setting does not force a tactical pivot or supply a resource that alters outcome; it functions as a vivid backdrop rather than a pressure that narrows Aria's options. All three gates are met, supporting mid-range, but causal constraint is light.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"During a period of profound transformation" (paragraph 7) is mentioned once and echoed obliquely in the tremor and Aria's "evolution," but the timeframe is vague and does not tighten decisions or tactics. No live clock, no urgency tied to duration; the transformation is declared rather than dramatized as a constraint. Ornamental presence without middle development or closure pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Aria's motivation "to become the archeologist of abandoned dreams" is stated early (paragraph 8) and repeated (paragraph 27), framing her goal throughout. It drives her to modify the mirror and catalog the dreams. However, the desire is told more than dramatized through conflicted choices; no moment where the cost of pursuing this ambition (time, safety, another opportunity) forces a visible trade-off. Setup and closure participation are strong, but friction between want and cost is absent, capping the score in mid-range.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Quaking reverie" appears twice (paragraphs 14 and 23) and the tone maintains a lyric, dreamlike register throughout (silver cliffs, liquid quartz, sighs encoded like DNA). The tone is coherent and modulates slightly when the tremor introduces risk, then returns to reverie at dawn. However, the tone does not charge the final image with undeniable pressure; it remains a steady atmospheric wash rather than a force that tightens or reweights the ending. Purposeful and sustained, but static rather than escalating under closure pressure.</comment>
