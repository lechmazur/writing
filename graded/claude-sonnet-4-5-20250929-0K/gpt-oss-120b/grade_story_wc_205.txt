<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Lira remains a vessel for thematic gestures rather than a character with contradictory impulses acting in scene. Her motivation to "reimagine an entire civilization" is declared but never tested against a competing want or cost; the plan unfolds without visible friction or sacrifice. The elders dissolve their dispute off-stage ("arguments softened," "dissolved into a collaborative chorus") rather than through dramatized choice. Interiority consists of abstract reflection ("burnished sorrow," "heart heavy") with no embodied emotion or micro-choice that reveals hierarchy of values.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within tolerance. The closure unit—Lira's plan succeeds, the factions unite, visitors arrive, the asteroid hums with renewal—reads as summary rather than a Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration with on-page cost. The verse she recites, the storm's timing, and the mirrors' unveiling occur in rapid succession without causal linkage or visible trade-off; the reader cannot identify a moment where an option was foreclosed or a price paid. The drive lens remains ambiguous (accumulative texture vs. causal turns), weakening closure legibility.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The baroque asteroid, copper spires, vaulted gallery, and enormous mirrors supply vivid visual detail, but none constrains a choice or alters tactics. The "seasonal storms" and "translucent cloth" appear only as backdrop; no character navigates spatial obstacles or trades access for outcome. The 9+ gate (environment/body/tool constrains choice or charges final image) is not met; the setting functions as ornament rather than crucible.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—cultural renaissance vs. archaeological dispute—is signaled early but never tightens. Lira devises a plan; the plan works; no reversal or cost appears on the page. The elders' "arguments softened" without dramatized concession or trade-off; visitors arrive as consequence rather than complication. Agency is absent: the storm, mirrors, and shard perform the work while Lira watches. The resolution lacks visible cost scaled to this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges (loss/creation, revolution as cultural synthesis) but remains stated rather than earned through particulars. The final paragraph moralizes directly: "the true revolution was no longer a battle of arms but a symphony of mirrors, storms, and verses"—a thesis announcement rather than resonant image. "Burnished sorrow" recurs as label without shifting meaning. The piece gestures toward complexity but resolves into tidy affirmation without ambiguity or cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited remains stable; no head-hopping. Diction tilts purple ("gilded relic," "luminous veil," "burnished sorrow") and uniform throughout, flattening urgency under pressure. Lira's perceptual signature is generic elevated register without character-specific bias. The verse she recites is paraphrased rather than rendered, missing an opportunity for voice distinction. Psychic distance does not modulate with emotional intensity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Overwriting pervades: nearly every sentence carries stacked metaphor or elevated diction ("baroque," "gilded," "burnished," "luminous veil," "cascade of silver rain") without pattern-teaching or payoff. Paraphrase loops appear ("heart heavy with burnished sorrow, yet alight with the knowledge"; "loss and creation" recurs thrice). Template cadence in the final third ("She smiled," "She whispered," "She slipped") and synonym churn ("verses," "stories," "myths," "frescoes," "tapestry") dull momentum. Filter-verb stacks ("saw," "watched," "seemed") cluster in high-pressure beats. Artifacts touch the closure paragraph, triggering the disallow-9+ rule and capping high-band entries at 8.8 globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>The core premise (art as revolution, fragments rewriting culture) is familiar and executed without fresh inflection. The mirrors-storm-shard mechanism resolves the dispute without earned complication or irony. "Burnished sorrow" and baroque-asteroid aesthetics supply surface texture but no durable insight or non-obvious synthesis. The ending offers symmetric satisfaction: all factions unite, visitors arrive, the revolution succeeds—no visible cost or transformation in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Lira is present throughout and her role as "defunct revolutionary" frames expectation, but her choices do not create turns. She devises the plan and recites a verse; the outcome follows without friction. Setup and payoff gates met; development (middle choice with cost) absent. Swappable with "visionary artist" or "elder mediator" without structural change. Late-scene passivity (watching from balcony) further limits causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The crystal vase shard appears in beat one (unearthed dispute), beat two (glows during storm, projects tapestry), and epilogue (atop altar, piece in pocket). Setup, development, and payoff gates met. It enables the cultural renaissance and charges the final image, but its mechanics (how refracted light resolves an archaeological argument) remain abstract. Swappable with any "artifact" that "projects history" with moderate edits. Specific properties (facets, inner fire) mentioned but do not constrain choice or impose visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The archaeological dispute is present (factions claim different origin stories) and frames the problem Lira solves, but it never constrains on-page action. The elders gather, their arguments soften, the dispute dissolves—all summary. Setup gate met; development and payoff absent (the concept is resolved off-stage rather than through dramatized choice). Swappable with "political schism" or "trade disagreement."</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Poetically inclined" is label-only. Lira recites verses twice (paraphrased, not rendered), but the trait does not constrain or enable a choice with visible cost. No tradeoff between poetic expression and tactical necessity appears. Mentioned in paragraph one; no development or closure participation. Swappable with "philosophically inclined" or "rhetorically gifted."</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Devise" anchors Lira's plan (covering mirrors to refract the shard's light). Setup and development gates met; the plan is enacted and succeeds. Payoff present but abstract: the plan works without complication or visible cost. Swappable with "organize" or "orchestrate" without affecting story logic. No felt price tied to the devising itself.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Covering mirrors with translucent cloth during storms is signaled early ("the method required the most unlikely of tools") and enacted in the climax. Setup and development gates met; the mechanics shape the peak beat. Payoff present but the method resolves without friction or trade-off. Specificity (translucent cloth, seasonal storms) adds detail, but the mechanism could be replaced with "focus lenses" or "prisms" with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The baroque asteroid supplies vivid setting detail (marble arches, copper spires, vaulted gallery, observatory) present throughout. Setup gate met; the setting frames all action. Development and payoff weak: the environment does not pressure choices or supply resources that alter outcome. The observatory's mirrors are used, but any enclosed space with reflective surfaces would serve. Postcard description without tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"After time becomes visible" appears once in the climax ("She timed the covering precisely after time became visible—a rare phenomenon..."). Setup absent (not mentioned in first third); development absent (does not constrain middle choice); payoff present but ornamental (the timeframe coincides with Lira's plan rather than tightening it). Swappable with "during the celestial alignment" or "when the core pulse peaks." No live clock that alters moves.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Lira's desire "to reimagine an entire civilization" is stated early and frames her plan. Setup and development gates met; the motivation drives the plot. Payoff present but told rather than dramatized: "her defunct rebellion had finally birthed a lasting renewal." No on-page friction between this want and a competing cost or fear. The motivation succeeds without visible sacrifice. Swappable with "to unite the factions" or "to restore cultural heritage."</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Burnished sorrow" recurs five times as descriptor (first paragraph, elders' chamber, Lira's heart, final reflection, closing image). Setup and payoff gates met; the tone is consistent. Development weak: the tone does not modulate with pressure or dramatize conflict. Static mood label rather than evolving emotional texture. The phrase charges the final image but remains abstract (what does "burnished" add to "sorrow"?). Swappable with "melancholy beauty" or "noble grief."</comment>
