<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Mara's interiority relies heavily on abstraction and label-speak ("chronologically confused," "eroded ambitions") rather than embodied contradictions acting in scene. The final exchange with the ghost reads as conceptual negotiation without grounded emotional cost or visible micro-choices that foreclose options. Tears at the end are asserted rather than earned through prior contradictory impulses. The ghost remains allegorical convenience rather than a pressure that forces Mara into genuine tradeoffs.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The piece establishes orientation adequately (kinetic lagoon, carousel platform, post-halt timeframe) but causality remains vague throughout. The ghost's appearance, its demands, and the "trade" mechanic are declared rather than dramatized with clear because/therefore linkage. The closure—Mara accepting a memory and the ghost fading—lands as thematic Echo rather than a Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration with legible cost. No visible option is foreclosed; the "pact" feels ornamental.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The kinetic lagoon and rusted carousel provide vivid sensory anchors (metallic heart pulse, cracked brass platform, translucent ghost). Spatial choreography remains coherent. However, the lagoon functions primarily as atmospheric backdrop rather than constraining choices or shaping tactics. The "disposable camera wheel" is handled but does not alter options or charge the final image with tactical cost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—negotiating with the ghost to trade regret for a glimpse of an abandoned path—is signaled early but never tested by a meaningful reversal or tightening. The ghost agrees immediately; no escalation forces Mara to sacrifice a live option. The "stories collected" mechanic operates as texture rather than escalating pressure. Cost remains conceptual and unfelt on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Eroded ambitions and regret are named repeatedly but emerge as thesis rather than from concrete particulars. The carousel memory and "promise to never let go of wonder" function as prompt-like Echo rather than non-literal answer. Thematic material is declared in the final paragraph ("I will carry these stories forward") instead of resonating through image. The ghost's "final smile" and "fresh roots" read as convenient symbolic resolution without earned ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Voice remains stable in psychic distance and maintains a lyric register, but diction frequently drifts into elevated abstractions ("chronologically confused," "fractured stillness," "eroded ambitions") that feel imposed rather than character-specific. Filter verbs ("She heard," "She felt") stack in high-pressure beats without variation. The ghost's dialogue ("Give me a chance…") and Mara's whisper feel thesis-adjacent rather than goal-driven subtext.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade the text: "fractured stillness" recurs without evolving, "eroded ambitions" appears three times as label, "regret" cycles through adjacent lines. Template cadence dominates ("She gathered," "She noted," "She whispered"). Metaphors stack without coherence ("metallic heart," "kinetic churn," "golden ribbons"). The final third doubles down on abstractions ("eternal twilight," "forgotten wheels") that obscure rather than propel. These artifacts touch the closure beat, triggering the elevated penalty and global 9+ disqualification per the patterned-artifact pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The premise—negotiating with one's own ghost via collected story fragments—echoes template "deal with self" arcs without a fresh synthesis. The kinetic lagoon and disposable camera wheel offer surface novelty but remain ornamental. Emotional beats follow predictable stages (regret → negotiation → tearful acceptance → renewed purpose). The carousel memory and "never let go of wonder" resolution read as familiar closure without transformation through specific, non-obvious particulars.</comment>
