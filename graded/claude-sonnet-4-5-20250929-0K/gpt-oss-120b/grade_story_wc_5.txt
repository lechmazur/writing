<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The alchemist remains an abstraction throughout; her actions are described but no contradictory impulses act simultaneously, and choices do not foreclose paths with visible cost. Interiority relies heavily on stock poetic phrasing ("pulse of a heart," "cartography of love and loss") rather than character-particular perception. The ending promise to return each season reads as declaration without dramatized struggle or renunciation that would earn stasis. Embodied emotion is largely absent; the piece tells us she "felt her own heartbeat echo" without showing sensory particulars or micro-choices under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive clearly within the opening lines, satisfying the test. The piece establishes an Accumulative/Textural lens early but closure remains elusive: the final "seal held" and promise to return do not constitute a Decisive Change, and no cost is legible on the page—she simply continues her routine. The covenant declaration in the penultimate section attempts Resonant Reconfiguration but lacks dramatized pressure or a felt price; it reads as summary rather than an earned shift. No meaningful tightening or deepening narrows options; the alchemist arranges debris, whispers a formula, and the light settles without complication or reversal.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The withered orchard and subarctic crater provide vivid atmospheric anchors, and sensory details ("frost-kissed roots," "bark creaking like an old song") are filtered through the alchemist's reverent focus. However, the environment never constrains a choice or alters tactics; it functions as backdrop rather than crucible. The plate, discarded items, and patterns are described repeatedly but remain ornamental—no spatial logic or resource limitation shapes the protagonist's moves. Micro-setting credit is unavailable because no object or bodily constraint charges the final image with cost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—translating heartbeats into maps via safekept starlight—is signaled early but never tested. No reversal or meaningful tightening occurs; the alchemist arranges debris, ignites the flash-paper, and the light settles exactly as intended with no complication. The piece offers escalation through poetic intensifiers ("burst," "cascade," "quiet triumph") but no on-page decision that narrows options or imposes a trade-off. Coincidence does not resolve because there is no conflict to resolve; the protagonist's patience and ritual succeed without friction, leaving no felt cost or visible price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Theme of patience, devotion, and mapping emotional terrain emerges clearly from recurring images (starlight, heartbeat, patterns, orchard as witness). However, the final paragraphs tip into explicit statement: "translating heartbeats into maps was not a task but a covenant" and "translating love into luminous maps" read as thematic summaries rather than non-literal answers earned through scene work. The covenant declaration in the penultimate beat operates as label rather than dramatized insight. Motifs (plate, starlight, discarded items) recur frequently but do not constrain choice or accumulate pressure toward a reweighted closure; they remain ornamental.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping, and the narrative distance is consistent. Diction is elevated and lyric throughout ("moving stillness," "pulse of a heart," "cartography of love and loss"), maintaining a coherent texture. However, perceptual signature is generic poetic register rather than character-specific; the alchemist's way of noticing does not reveal selective bias or occupational idiom. Purposeful compression and patterned repetition ("moving stillness" appears multiple times) suggest lyric intent, but the pattern is not clearly taught early or paid off with cost at closure—repetition feels decorative rather than functional.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: "Each discarded shard she arranged in spirals" / "The pattern grew slowly, each placement a careful breath"; "safekept starlight" appears seven times without variation; "moving stillness" recurs as a motif but also as filler. Template cadence runs: "She [verb]" openings dominate the middle third without purposeful rhythm. Stock metaphors cluster without fresh grounding: "lighthouse," "beacon," "pulse," "cartography of love and loss." Register drift into abstract poetic diction ("covenant," "reverent echo," "tableau of patient reverence") clashes with the concrete task of arranging debris. Figurative language appears in most sentences of high-pressure beats (light settling, seal forming) without clear payoff, triggering density and coherence penalties. Artifacts touch the closure beat ("moving stillness settle like snowfall"), disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8 per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The core premise—alchemist sealing starlight into patterns to create emotional maps—offers a fresh synthesis of craft, magic, and cartography. However, execution leans heavily on familiar poetic templates: patient artisan in isolated setting, devotion as ritual, light as metaphor for hope. The orchard-as-witness and covenant-to-return beats echo stock resolutions. No bold structural or perspectival risk heightens stakes; the piece unfolds as lyric description without friction. Transformation test: swapping "flash-paper alchemist" for "candle-maker" or "starlight" for "moonlight" would leave emotional arc and structure unchanged, signaling insufficient specificity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The flash-paper alchemist is present throughout and performs the central action (sealing starlight), satisfying setup and development gates. However, her choices do not create key turns; she arranges debris, whispers a formula, and the light settles without complication. No decision alters tactics or imposes cost. The covenant promise at the end is declaration, not dramatized choice. The character is ornamental agent rather than decision-maker under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The storybook illustration plate appears in setup ("waited beside a mound of ash"), development (light bursts from it), and payoff ("pulsed softly like a heart"). However, it is not handled across distinct beats—mentions collapse into one continuous ritual. Static description dominates; the plate does not evolve or return with reweighted meaning. No cost or constraint ties to its use. Swappable with "copper disc" or "engraved tablet" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Safekept starlight is named early and drives the central ritual (setup, development, payoff gates met). It shapes the protagonist's goal but does not constrain tactics or impose a trade-off on the page. The concept functions as theme ("beacon," "cartography") rather than stake-altering force. No choice hinges on the starlight's presence or absence; it is ornamental rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Demonstrates patience physically is enacted through slow arrangement of debris ("each placement a careful breath," "moving like glacier ice") and mentioned explicitly ("demonstrate patience physically"). Setup and development gates met; closure involvement is label-only ("patient endurance," "moving stillness"). No on-page cost or enabling trade-off ties to the patience; it functions as trait claim rather than constraint. Visible action present but no tactical consequence.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Seal appears in setup (goal stated), development (flash-paper flares, light settles), and payoff ("the seal held"). The action drives the ritual sequence but no turn or complication hinges on it. The seal succeeds without friction, making it easily swappable with "binding" or "fusing." One distinct beat (sealing moment) with closure mention, but no causal pressure or cost. Mid-band functional use.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Creating patterns with discarded items is signaled early ("collecting discarded items—broken glass, twisted wire, torn vellum"), enacted in the middle ("arranged in spirals"), and referenced at closure ("gathering more cast-away remnants"). The method shapes the protagonist's approach across three beats and is specific to the ritual. However, no choice or cost depends on the discarded nature of the items; "collected items" would function identically. Mechanics matter but are not irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Withered orchard deep in a subarctic crater is anchored immediately and recurs throughout (setup, development, payoff). Atmospheric detail is vivid ("frost-kissed roots," "dead branches shivered") but the setting never constrains choice or supplies resources that alter outcome. The orchard functions as witness rather than crucible. No micro-setting constraint (cold, access, scarcity) shapes tactics. Postcard description without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>While the world holds its breath appears once in the opening paragraph as atmospheric claim, then is absent until a faint echo near the end ("the world outside the crater seemed to exhale"). No ticking clock or time pressure shapes decisions. The timeframe is ornamental metaphor rather than constraint. Missing middle development and closure participation gates; introduced early but not functional.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>To translate heartbeats into maps is stated explicitly multiple times ("translate into maps," "translating heartbeats into maps was not a task but a covenant") and drives the protagonist's ritual. Setup and payoff gates met; middle development is implicit in the pattern-making. However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choice. No friction between want and cost appears on the page; the alchemist's desire is declared and fulfilled without struggle. Functional but label-only.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Moving stillness is named explicitly four times, modulates from opening calm through ritual intensity to closure affirmation, and charges the final image ("moving stillness settle like snowfall"). Tone is coherent across beats and supports the patient, reverent atmosphere. However, the phrase functions as label and motif rather than evolving pressure; repetition is decorative rather than reweighting. Strong setup and closure participation but mid-scene development is static mood rather than modulation under stress.</comment>
