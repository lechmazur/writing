<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The protagonist remains a static observer throughout; she watches, waits, and "lets" events guide her rather than making choices that alter outcomes. Interior experience is heavily abstracted through poetry ("letting the wave guide her thoughts") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The final "turn" is told as accomplished fact ("she held the means to appraise") without on-page struggle or visible cost that forecloses a path. Motivation is declared historically reverent but never tested by a conflicting impulse or tradeoff.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed past 120 words—no clear spatial anchor or present-tense action emerges until well into the piece, warranting −0.4. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, yet no decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing occurs on the page; the protagonist simply declares mastery in summary ("she held the means") without a before/after shift legible in action or image. The Cost Proof Test fails: no exact sentence at closure shows a felt or visible price paid. Causality is intact but the closure unit is missing, capping the score.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The canyon and towers of bone supply vivid atmospheric detail and the arrowhead is handled twice (placement on platform, lifted at end), meeting the micro-setting and object tests. However, environment does not constrain a choice or alter tactics—it remains backdrop. The final image invokes the canyon's "echo" but does not show the setting forcing a decision or providing a resource that changes the outcome, keeping the score in mid-band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—learning to navigate without moving—is signaled early but never tested by opposition or narrowed by a tightening choice. The protagonist waits, watches birds, and then summarizes success without on-page struggle, reversal, or cost. No live option is foreclosed; the resolution is asserted rather than earned through agency under pressure. The escalation required under Accumulative lens (density increase, pattern break, or cadence shift that reweights the stake with cost) is absent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Theme of stillness versus motion and reverence for the past is signaled through concrete images (pulse, arrowhead, birds), but the ending restates rather than reweights: "navigate the world inside her mind" is a direct thematic summary, not a resonant image that answers the question obliquely. The final paragraph tells us she has succeeded without showing cost or tension, drifting into moralizing closure. No counter-reading or ambiguity lingers; the piece resolves into a tidy affirmation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains a consistent lyric register with purposeful compression and sensory specificity ("wings cutting the thin air like knives"). However, perceptual signature is generic—observations could belong to any reverent observer rather than this particular "harmonic stone skimmer." Filter verbs ("feeling," "letting") dull immediacy in peak beats, and the final lines slip into abstract summary ("calm as the echoing canyon") that deflates the established texture. Single-POV with no dialogue; judged on interior coherence alone.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops appear frequently: "the pulse was a faint thrum" / "the pulse left wandering" / "the pulse would wander again" recycle the same content without added pressure, warranting −0.2. Template cadence is pervasive: "She watched... She inhaled... She felt... She knew..." across six consecutive beats, triggering −0.6. Figurative density ("lattice of wind currents," "invisible compass," "living compass") stacks without variation in the middle third, adding −0.4 for overwriting. Register drifts into elevated abstraction ("continuity," "resolve settle into her marrow") that clashes with the embodied POV. Cumulative deductions and artifact presence in the final third disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band entries at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The core premise—navigating through stillness by reading natural patterns—echoes familiar contemplative-mystic templates without a specific twist grounded in character cost or world constraint. The birds-as-compass and arrowhead-as-resonance feel ornamental rather than causally necessary; swapping them for other mystical objects would not alter the emotional or plot arc. No bold structural risk or transformation of the trope through lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus; the piece remains in the safety middle, avoiding specificity that would render it memorable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The harmonic stone skimmer is present throughout but her choices do not create turns—she observes, waits, and summarizes mastery. Setup and closure participation are present but middle development shows no decision that alters tactics. Swappable with "contemplative mystic" or similar archetype. Late first meaningful action (lifting arrowhead) occurs near the end without causal pressure. Cap at 4.6 for missing middle development; score 3.2 for ornamental presence.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The stone arrowhead appears in three beats: found/described, placed on platform, lifted at end. Setup and closure participation are clear; middle beat (placement) is passive observation rather than use that alters tactics. It enables the "map" conceptually but does not narrow options or impose cost. Lyric reprise (early mention → final lift) reweights the stake slightly, reaching mid-band. Not indispensable—other resonant objects could substitute with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The pulse wandering is mentioned repeatedly but functions as atmospheric theme rather than shaping stakes or tactics on the page. It does not constrain a choice or change options; the protagonist simply aligns with it in summary. Setup is present, middle development is ornamental (described not used), closure echoes it without causal work. Functional but replaceable with "ancient rhythm" or similar. Cap at 4.6 for missing middle causal development; score 4.1 for thematic presence without tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Historically reverent" is mentioned once as a label and never constrains or enables an on-page action. No tradeoff or cost tied to this trait appears. Missing setup, middle development, and closure participation as a causal force. Cap at 2.8 for missing closure; score 2.8 for label-only ornamental use.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Appraise" appears once in the text ("to appraise the stone arrowhead") but the action is not dramatized—no process, criteria, or stakes are shown. The protagonist places the arrowhead and waits; the "appraisal" is asserted in exposition rather than enacted. Missing middle development and closure participation as a decisive action. Cap at 4.6 for missing middle; score 4.3 for functional mention without causal work.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The bird patterns are signaled early ("flock of birds surged"), used in the middle to form "a living compass," and reprised at closure ("the birds' patterns replay in her mind"). Three beats and closure linkage present, but the method's mechanics remain abstract—how the patterns translate to navigation is summarized, not shown through constrained choice. Causal pressure is implied but not dramatized with cost. Score 5.6 for purposeful structure without tactical specificity.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The towers of bone and canyon of echoes are established early, shape the middle action (echo carries resonance, canyon "approves"), and charge the final image ("canyon seemed less a trap and more a teacher"). All three gates met; the setting provides atmospheric pressure and a conceptual resource (echoes) that the protagonist uses, though not through a constrained tactical choice. Closure linkage is clear; irreplaceability moderate. Score 6.2 for essential atmospheric role with moderate causal work.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"Through centuries of layered dust" functions as backstory/atmosphere—footsteps of the past are sensed—but does not tighten present decisions or create a live clock. Time remains abstract and untracked; no urgency or deadline alters tactics. Setup is present (centuries mentioned early), but middle development and closure participation as a constraint are missing. Cap at 3.4 for missing middle development; score 3.4 for ornamental temporal frame.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"To learn to navigate without moving" is stated early as the aim, guides middle actions (waiting, aligning with pulse), and is summarized as achieved at closure. Setup, development, and closure participation are present. However, the desire is never conflicted—no cost or friction between this want and another impulse appears. The motivation is told rather than dramatized through contradictory choices. Score 5.9 for structural presence without on-page friction or visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Weathered resolve" is declared twice: once in the middle ("weathered resolve settle into her marrow") and once near the end ("With weathered resolve she turned"). Tone is coherent and modulates slightly from watchful to assured, supporting the closure image of calm mastery. Setup is implicit in early patience, middle and closure beats make it explicit. The tone charges the final stillness but does not shift under pressure—it remains static reassurance. Score 6.4 for coherent presence and closure linkage without dynamic modulation.</comment>
