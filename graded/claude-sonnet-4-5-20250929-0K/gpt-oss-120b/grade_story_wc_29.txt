<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Mara remains a label rather than a lived consciousness; her "cautiously hopeful" stance is stated repeatedly but never tested through contradictory impulses acting in the same beat. The cascade of students, dean, townspeople, and cosmic tricksters dilutes focus without individuating any voice or creating relational pressure. Interior experience consists of abstract declarations ("felt the weight of all the charts") rather than embodied perception under stress, and the final "smile" arrives without visible cost or foreclosed path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The piece strings together declarative moves without because/therefore linkage: Mara sets up a transmitter, the tricksters inject a false alarm, the subsonic pattern deflects it—each beat announced rather than dramatized with narrowing options. Orientation remains vague (we never learn campus layout, console mechanics, or time elapsed), violating the ~120-word anchor test; applying −0.4 here and capping Q3 at 7.0. No legible closure unit: the final paragraph summarizes outcomes and spreads to kitchens and firehouses rather than landing a decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing with visible cost on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>The radio station, campus, and console remain postcard backdrops; no tool, body constraint, or spatial detail alters a single choice. "Dust-touched charts" and "old console" are mentioned but never handled in a way that shapes tactics. The setting functions as interchangeable scenery rather than pressuring decisions or charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The stated stake—"outwit cosmic tricksters"—never materializes as on-page pressure with trade-offs; the subsonic method works frictionlessly, the false alarm is "diverted" off-page, and the community hums in unity without visible resistance or cost. No credible tightening or deepening occurs; instead the narrative expands laterally (dorm rooms, firehouse, valley) in summary. Agency is observation and setup rather than choice under duress, and coincidence (the dean's assembly, the crowd already humming) resolves tension that was never dramatized.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Theme—unity through subtle resistance—is stated overtly in nearly every paragraph ("power plays could be outmaneuvered," "hope, when handled with care, can rewrite even the stars") rather than emerging from concrete images. The final passage moralizes directly instead of offering a resonant non-literal answer. Recurrent motifs (charts, subsonic pulse, ethereal grit) are invoked as talismans without constraining choice or reweighting meaning at closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>Narrative distance drifts between close third and panoramic summary without purposeful modulation; Mara's perceptual signature is generic elevated diction ("restless static, a canvas") that does not reflect an astronomer's trained attention. Diction climbs into abstraction ("ethereal pulse that nudged the minds of students") incongruent with a character under technical pressure. The piece teaches no clear POV pattern, and the final expansion to valley-wide chorus abandons single-POV cohesion without section breaks or a taught mosaic structure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: "cautiously hopeful" appears three times, "power plays" five, and "ethereal grit" recurs without evolving function. Template cadence dominates the final third ("She smiled… She taught… She transmitted…") with identical stems across consecutive sentences, triggering −0.6. Mixed metaphors clutter peak beats ("airwaves split like a mirror shattered," "ethereal grit… steady beat") without coherent vehicle logic. Line-level artifacts touch the closure paragraph; applying the disallow-9+ rule and capping high bands at 8.8 globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The core premise—signal interpreter uses subsonic frequencies to counter cosmic tricksters—closely matches speculative-fiction templates (lone expert vs. invisible threat) without transforming through specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. Turns feel convenient (the crowd already humming, the refrigerator hum) rather than inevitable in hindsight. The expansion to kitchen appliances and firehouse reads as quirk-for-novelty rather than organic escalation, and the story could swap Mara for any protagonist with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Mara is present throughout but her choices are summarized setup (transmitter, algorithm) rather than dramatized decisions that narrow options. She watches outcomes rather than making consequential calls under pressure; late mentions of teaching students occur in summary. Two gates (setup, middle presence) are met, but development is ornamental and closure participation is observation, capping around 3.0–3.5 range.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Charts appear in the opening beat (plotting pulses) and are filed at the end, meeting setup and closure gates, but middle use is absent—"fed the charts into a custom algorithm" is told in one line without tactical constraint. The reprise ("filed the night's data") does not reweight meaning or charge the final image. Two gates yield eligibility to ~6.0, but swappability and lack of middle pressure lower to mid-4s.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Power plays" is mentioned five times as thematic label but never shapes on-page stakes or tactics; the tricksters' injection of a false alarm is deflected off-stage without dramatized resistance. The concept functions as backdrop assertion rather than altering options or methods. Present but ornamental throughout.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Cautiously hopeful" is stated three times without constraining or enabling a single on-page action with visible cost; Mara's hope is declared in narration rather than tested through contradictory impulses or trade-offs. Label-only attribute without embodied consequence.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Interfere" appears in setup (transmitter to interfere with signal) and thematically in the closing reflection ("ready to interfere again"), meeting two gates, but the major turn—deflecting the false alarm—is summarized in one sentence without dramatized attempt or visible method friction. The action is present across beats but easily swappable with "counteract" or "block"; mid-band ceiling applies.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Subsonic frequencies are named early ("set up a low-frequency transmitter… subsonic frequencies") and recur in middle beats (subsonic pattern, subsonic interference), meeting setup and development gates. The method shapes the crowd's humming and the appliance experiments, but mechanics remain abstract—no on-page demonstration of how modulation choices alter outcomes. Functional but mechanics-light; two strong gates lift to low-4s despite summary treatment.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>The university radio station frames the opening and appears in closing reflection but never pressures a choice or supplies a resource that alters outcome; Mara could perform identical actions in any broadcast facility. The console is mentioned but not used tactically. Setting is postcard presence without micro-constraint or closure charge.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"As the community divides" is stated once in summary without on-page clock pressure or tightening effect on decisions; the assembly and healing occur in unspecified elapsed time. Timeframe is asserted thematically rather than tracked or used to narrow options.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The motivation "to outwit cosmic tricksters" is declared early and drives the transmitter setup, meeting setup and partial development gates, but is never dramatized through conflicted choice or visible friction between want and cost. The tricksters remain abstract adversaries; no on-page moment shows Mara weighing risk or sacrifice to achieve the outwitting. Told desire without embodied struggle.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.3</grade><comment>"Ethereal grit" appears as a phrase in the opening and closing but does not modulate with pressure or cohere across turns; the tone oscillates between abstract lyricism ("celestial signal interpreter") and summary declaration ("the valley's night sky… thrummed") without a stable texture that charges the final image. Present as label, not as lived tonal pressure.</comment>
