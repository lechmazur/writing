<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Mara remains a serene vessel throughout with no contradictory impulses or genuine struggle; her "decisively kind grace" and "quiet duty" are asserted labels rather than embodied choices under pressure. The story declares her gratitude-sensing and hymn-perfecting without showing internal conflict or a hierarchy of competing values. Mr. Harlan and the staff are props without distinct interiority, and the final gesture—stepping onto the balcony—carries no visible cost or foreclosed path. Diagnostic label-speak ("decisively kind," "pulsing stillness") and therapy-register phrasing flatten what should be peak emotional moments.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) appear within the opening lines, avoiding the Orientation Test penalty. However, no meaningful causality drives the sequence: Mara enters, places the vinyl, plays her harp, and the patient dies on schedule—each beat is ceremonial rather than motivated by prior pressure or a narrowing of options. The closure offers no decisive change, renunciation with cost, or conceptual repricing; the "scent of hope" and vinyl fragment are declared whole without on-page friction or sacrifice. Under a Causal lens the linkage is missing; under Accumulative/Textural the density does not deepen or break pattern at the end; the piece reads as static ritual.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The "radiant haven above the clouds" supplies vivid atmosphere—gold sunrise, fluttering curtains, cloud-rim glow—but remains postcard description that does not constrain choice or alter tactics. The vinyl fragment and harp are handled in multiple beats, yet their physical properties (jagged edge, crackle, imperfect grooves) do not affect Mara's decisions or the outcome. Spatial choreography is clear (hall, room, balcony), and the "scent of hope" (pine and rain) is specific, but these details ornament rather than pressure the action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The declared stake—"to execute a flawless goodbye"—is never tested by a reversal, complication, or competing need; Mara's ritual proceeds exactly as intended with no friction. The blood work result and Mr. Harlan's fragile heart are delivered as fait accompli rather than discovered or reacted to on the page, eliminating agency. No escalation occurs: each step (placing vinyl, playing harp, whispering reassurance) is additive ceremony without narrowing options or raising cost. Coincidence (the patient's death timing perfectly with the final chord) resolves the moment rather than protagonist choice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The theme of wholeness-from-brokenness is stated explicitly ("the broken song could be reunited," "wholeness can emerge from brokenness," "hope can be stitched together") rather than earned through concrete action and image. The vinyl fragment recurs but its symbolic weight is announced rather than discovered; the final paragraph's "endless hymn of love" and "promise that the scent of hope would travel" tip into direct thematic summary. Some subtextual work appears in the curtains "fluttering like breath" and the room's sigh, but the predominant mode is assertion. The piece avoids false equivalence and gestures toward complexity (broken vinyl completing the song) yet the ending moralizes rather than resonating through image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV anchored in Mara remains stable with no head-hopping, and psychic distance is controlled. However, the prose defaults to elevated, abstract diction ("decisively kind grace," "coalesce," "everlasting hymn") that reads as narrator commentary rather than Mara's lived perception under pressure. No dialogue appears, so those bullets are not applicable. Filter verbs ("felt," "sensed," "imagined") stack in high-pressure moments (vinyl placement, final chord) without voice-motivated purpose, dulling immediacy. The narrative voice is generic rather than character-particular; Mara's perceptual signature is indistinct from the authorial frame.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade the text: the "radiant haven above the clouds" is named four times with minimal variation; "pulsing stillness" appears twice in identical phrasing; "scent of hope" recurs as a label without fresh detail. Template cadence runs appear in the opening third ("She moved… each step… a method she called…" ; "She placed… and whispered…"). Stock metaphors cluster without coherent vehicle logic: "dew on her shoulders," "kite catching the first wind of dawn," "hymn of love that would never truly end." Register drifts into corporate abstraction ("coalesce," "accommodate an orderly goodbye," "execute a flawless goodbye") that clashes with a music therapist's interior lexicon. These artifacts appear throughout, including the closure paragraph, triggering the artifact cap and disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The hospice-music-therapist premise and the broken-vinyl-as-wholeness motif follow familiar template patterns (healing professional, symbolic object, death-as-transformation) without fresh synthesis. The "radiant haven above the clouds" and "scent of hope" read as generic placeholders rather than specific, grounded choices tied to Mara's worldview or the setting's material constraints. The final image—Mara whispering to the sky that lives will "forever hum inside the clouds"—echoes stock sentimentality without earned particularity. No bold structural or perspectival risk heightens stakes; the piece executes a median option safely.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>Mara (serene hospice music therapist) is present throughout but makes no choice that alters tactics or options; she performs her established ritual without friction. Her actions are observational and ceremonial rather than decisional. Missing middle development and closure participation as an agent; swappable with any caregiver archetype.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The broken vinyl record piece appears in setup (placed on table), development (spinning on turntable, producing crackle), and closure (lying still, staff taking pieces as keepsakes). It is handled in multiple beats and its jagged edge and imperfect grooves are noted. However, its presence does not constrain Mara's choices or alter the outcome; it functions as symbolic prop rather than causal lever. The staff's keepsake gesture is ornamental rather than transformative.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>The "scent of hope" (pine and rain) is described and recurs as a label but does not shape stakes or tactics on the page. It is treated as theme rather than actionable concept; Mara does not pursue, create, or lose it through choice. Late thematic closure claim ("the scent of hope would travel beyond this haven") is asserted rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>1.9</grade><comment>"Decisively kind" appears once in the opening as a label ("decisively kind grace") and is echoed in the final smile ("decisive smile") without constraining or enabling an on-page action with cost. No visible tradeoff or choice demonstrates the attribute; it remains descriptor rather than driver.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The action "reunify" appears in setup (whispering that the broken song can be reunited, symbolizing spirit/body reunion) and closure (staff gathering to "reunify" via keepsakes, Mara's final monologue). However, no major turn traces to this action; the reunion is symbolic and declared rather than achieved through struggle. Swappable with "heal" or "restore" with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Hymning the mundane" is named once in setup ("a method she called hymning the mundane, coaxing even the most tired rooms to pulse") but its mechanics are never shown in action. Mara plays a harp and hums, but the specific method is not signaled or leveraged in middle beats. Summary-only use trends low.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>The "radiant haven above the clouds" is established in setup and recurs in closure (final sigh, Mara on balcony, "choir of clouds"). It supplies vivid atmosphere (gold horizon, cloud-rim, breeze) but does not pressure choices or supply resources that affect outcome. The clouds are postcard rather than micro-setting that alters tactics; functional but replaceable with any serene hospice locale.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>1.7</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the blood work comes back" anchors the opening causally (confirming Mr. Harlan's fragile heart) but does not tighten decisions or tactics thereafter. The remainder of the story unfolds in ritualistic, untracked time with no live clock altering moves. Mentioned once and then ignored; vague temporal flow trends low.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The motivation "to execute a flawless goodbye" is stated early ("a quiet duty," "to execute a flawless goodbye") and recurs in closure ("confident that her decisively kind presence had turned a fleeting moment into an everlasting hymn"). However, it is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choices; no friction between want and cost appears. The goodbye proceeds flawlessly without obstacle, reducing the motivation to static goal rather than pressured desire.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The tone phrase "pulsing stillness" appears twice (mid-story: "in that pulsing stillness she sensed his gratitude"; closure: "the patients, now cradled in the pulsing stillness, smiled"). It is coherent and modulates subtly with the harp's rhythm, but remains a static mood label rather than a tone that charges the final image through cadence or density shift. Present in closure but ornamental rather than transformative.</comment>
