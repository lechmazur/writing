<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The protagonist remains a void rather than a contradictory individual—motivations are declared ("driven by a need to discover the texture of memories") but never tested through on-page choice that forecloses a path. No genuine internal conflict arises; the narrator drifts through containers collecting stories without struggle, cost, or embodied emotion beyond vague "tingles." The final stance—becoming "the unnamed keeper"—is asserted without prior causality or visible sacrifice, reading as label-only epiphany.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early and remain stable. Closure attempts a Resonant Reconfiguration (the narrator accepts the role of keeper), but no on-page cost is visible: the label is pocketed, the tide recedes, and the protagonist walks toward the exit with renewed purpose rather than forfeiting a live option. The accumulative lens is signaled (fragments layered, voices stitched), yet the ending offers affirmation without pressure or tradeoff, failing the cost-proof test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The port containers, cracked vents, and rusted forklift anchor spatial detail early. Sensory selection leans heavily visual (glow, shadows, murals) with one tactile beat ("cold filament"). The label functions as a micro-object that filters perception, but beyond this filtering the environment does not constrain a single on-page choice—containers sway, tides turn, yet the narrator moves freely without spatial or material friction altering tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—recovering erased histories—is declared but never endangered or tested through reversal. No on-page tightening narrows options: the label glows, projects stories, and the narrator absorbs them without obstacle, refusal, or trade-off. Coincidence (the tide surge revealing numbers) delivers the payoff rather than protagonist agency. The resolution ("I would keep gathering") restates intent without visible cost or altered capacity.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Theme (memory, erasure, identity) emerges from concrete particulars—death certificate error, poison label, overheard fragments—and avoids overt moralizing until the final beat. The ending offers a thesis statement ("a purpose that no death certificate could erase") that verbalizes rather than images the thematic question. One positive: the layering metaphor recurs with shifting texture (paper, filament, palimpsest), though it does not constrain choice or charge the closure with cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>POV remains stable first-person; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present (filtering metaphors, texture focus) but lacks character-specific bias—diction feels curated rather than voice-driven, with elevated phrasing ("absurdly pristine," "palimpsest of voices") that sits at the edge of the narrator's plausible lexicon. Under peak pressure (murals appearing, realization unfolding) the prose maintains uniform rhythm and register without compression or modulation, flattening urgency.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Heavy paraphrase loops and template cadence pervade: "Each snippet layered onto the next, creating a palimpsest… that filters reality differently" repeats the layering/filtering claim across three adjacent sentences without new information. Figurative density clusters in low-pressure exposition ("rusted bones," "museum of vanished moments," "cold filament") rather than peak beats. Runs of "I [verb]" stems and synonym churn ("fragments," "whispers," "snippets," "voices") create mechanical rhythm. The final paragraph stacks three declarative summary statements that restate rather than propel.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Core premise—death-certificate error survivor collecting erased histories via a glowing poison label—offers a specific synthesis. Execution remains mid-generic: the port labyrinth and layering metaphor feel familiar, the label's mechanics (glowing, projecting murals) read convenientally magical without cost or constraint, and the narrator's passive collection lacks friction or trade-off. No bold structural or moral risk elevates the material; the ending restates premise rather than transforming it.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Present throughout as the narrator's backstory anchor. The death-certificate error grants namelessness and marginal existence, framing the narrator's outsider stance. Does not drive a key turn—choices to follow the label or collect fragments would proceed identically for any socially invisible character. Functional but swappable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The poison-bottle label appears in three beats: discovery under forklift, filtering perception through sepia hue, revealing timestamps that match fragments, and projecting murals when the tide rises. It enables the key middle beat (timestamps indexing histories) and charges the final image (tucked in pocket as promise). However, the label's mechanics are arbitrary (glow, project) and the narrator does not face a cost tied to handling it—no trade-off for using the filter or risk in keeping it.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Erased histories are named repeatedly as the port's thematic backdrop and the object of the quest. They appear as projections (murals on container walls) and are absorbed into the narrator's mind, but they do not constrain a choice or generate conflict—discovery is smooth, costless. The concept frames stakes but does not alter tactics or foreclose an option on the page.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Filtering reality differently is asserted three times: fragments filter reality, the label filters the world through sepia, and the palimpsest of voices filters differently from the narrator's existence. No on-page action demonstrates a tradeoff or constraint arising from this filtering—perception shifts are described, not dramatized as enabling or limiting a move. Label-only trait.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Layering is the story's central metaphor and structural method: fragments stitched like paper, voices layered into palimpsest, murals as layered map. It appears in early, middle, and final beats. Yet the action itself—mentally accumulating snippets—does not shape a turn or create pressure; the narrator layers passively without encountering contradiction, overload, or choice about what to include. Present across the arc but mechanically applied rather than redefining options.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Collecting fragments of overheard stories is signaled early (dockworkers, lovers, traders) and recurs in the middle (radio snippets). The method is procedural rather than dramatic—no friction, selection dilemma, or risk in gathering. At closure the narrator vows to "keep gathering fragments," restating method rather than showing its cost or consequence. Functional but does not shape a key turn.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The towering labyrinth of shipping containers anchors location early and recurs: containers sway with tides, shadows form corridors, walls serve as projection surfaces for murals. The maze imagery supports atmosphere and frames the search, but spatial layout does not constrain a single move—the narrator drifts freely, finds the label easily, and exits without navigational cost. Micro-setting (the cracked box, broken antenna) adds texture but does not alter tactics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Tides are mentioned five times: slow metronome, containers sway, high tide triggers the mural reveal, tide recedes to end the vision, "each tide would bring new voices" in the closing vow. Time pressure is absent—tides mark transitions but do not deadline a choice or force urgency. The high-tide reveal is coincidental enablement rather than a constraint the narrator must work within.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The desire "to discover the texture of memories" is declared once in the opening third and echoed in the closing image ("a texture of memory I could touch"). No on-page beat dramatizes friction between this want and a competing need or cost—the narrator pursues, discovers, and affirms the goal without obstacle. Told motivation without enacted conflict or trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Nameless identity is foregrounded early ("My name is unimportant," "nameless existence") and returns in the final lines as thematic anchor. Tone remains contemplative and distanced throughout, modulating slightly when the murals appear but without sharp contrast or pressure-driven shift. The namelessness charges the ending conceptually (void as conduit) but does not constrain a choice or create felt vulnerability on the page. Coherent but static mood.</comment>
