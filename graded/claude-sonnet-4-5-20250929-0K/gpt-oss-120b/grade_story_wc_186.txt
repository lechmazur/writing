<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The custodian remains a label without interior contradiction or embodied emotion. Motivation is declared ("prove that coincidences have meaning") but never tested by a choice that forecloses a path; the beacon rekindles without visible cost or struggle. The caravan arrival in the final paragraph introduces new stakes too late to complicate the protagonist's stance. No micro-choices reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The Orientation Test fails: who/where/when are established, but the drive lens remains ambiguous throughout—oscillating between causal (rekindle attempt), accumulative/textural (layered images), and situational (waiting for travelers) without a taught pattern. The closure unit is a summary report ("the beacon becomes a beacon of hope") rather than an on-page decisive change or resonant reconfiguration; no felt cost is visible. The caravan pivot in the final lines attempts to shift stakes but lands as exposition, not dramatized pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The glass humming pavilion and broken prism are vividly described and recur across beats, but they function as backdrop rather than constraint. The star-path alignment is asserted, not shown shaping a tactical choice. Spatial choreography (pedestal, alcove, balcony) remains clear, and the sensory texture (glass singing, hush vibrating) is consistent, lifting the score above purely ornamental setting.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake (prove coincidences have meaning) is declared early but never tightened by a reversal or forced choice. The rekindling sequence unfolds without friction: the prism is placed, the shard hums, the beacon lights—each step a success without cost or complication. The caravan arrival introduces a new goal (map the network) that replaces rather than escalates the original stake. No protagonist agency forecloses a live option.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Theme (pattern vs. chance, renewal from brokenness) is stated repeatedly rather than emerging from dramatized conflict. The final paragraph moralizes with "proving that even the smallest coincidence can kindle a future," violating the no-sermonizing rule. "Thistle-blown hope" recurs as a motif but lacks the constraint or reweighting required for earned resonance. The retrocognitive shard's memory of the towers' fall is told, not shown altering present choice.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Narrative distance is consistent and the diction ("tarnished lantern," "thistle-blown hope") carries a distinct lyric texture. However, register drifts into elevated abstraction ("retrocognitively blessed," "fate is a thread they can follow") that exceeds the custodian's plausible on-page idiom during high-pressure beats. Free indirect style is clean, but the voice lacks the perceptual signature of a lived-in mind under stress—no micro-choices in noticing or elision that reveal character-specific bias.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and template cadence dominate: "The shard of hush vibrates, echoing… A thin ribbon of light unfurls… The lantern sputters, then steadies…" in consecutive sentences; "I keep… I step… I track…" in another cluster. Figurative language appears in nearly every sentence without pattern-teaching or payoff ("remembers the night," "whispers that renewal is possible," "fire the hearts"). These artifacts dull the rekindling beat and the closure, triggering the patterned-artifact penalty pack and disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The premise (lone custodian seeks meaning in ruins, rekindles beacon via mystical artifact) follows a familiar post-apocalyptic template without transformation through specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The retrocognitive shard and star-path mechanics are decorative rather than causally surprising. The caravan pivot gestures toward expansion but arrives too late to complicate the core arc. No bold risk-taking heightens stakes; the story hedges into abstraction rather than committing to concrete particulars.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>The custodian performs the rekindling sequence but makes no choice that alters tactics or forecloses a path. Observation ("I watch them from the tower's balcony") and declaration ("I vowed to map each star path") replace decision. The caravan welcome is a hospitable gesture, not a high-stakes turn. The character is present across beats but causally inert.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The broken crystal prism appears in setup (kept in the alcove), drives the rekindling beat (placed on the pedestal, aligning fractured edges), and is mentioned in the caravan scene (devices placed beside it). Its brokenness and the shard it contains constrain the method (alignment required), lifting it above ornamental. However, its use does not evolve or reweight across beats—it functions identically in each touch—and the closure cost is not tied to the prism's properties.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>The "shard of hush" is mentioned in setup, described as muffling old engines and interpreting star paths, and said to vibrate during rekindling. It appears in the caravan scene ("combined resonance amplified the shard's memory"). However, its role is summary-only: the hush is claimed to settle in travelers' bones and confirm meaning, but never shown constraining or enabling a choice with visible cost. It functions as a mystical label rather than a tactic-shaping stake.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.2</grade><comment>"Retrocognitively blessed" is introduced in setup and twice restated ("The retrocognitively blessed shard remembers the night the towers fell," "amplified the shard's memory"). The trait enables exposition (the shard whispers that renewal is possible, reveals a forgotten network) but does not constrain an on-page action or force a tradeoff. It is a passive narrative convenience, not a live capability with cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Rekindle" is the story's central action, signaled early and executed in the middle third (placing the prism, aligning edges, the ribbon of light, the lantern igniting). The rekindling transforms the pavilion into a beacon that draws travelers, shaping the final third. However, the action unfolds without friction or cost—no failed attempt or sacrifice—and the caravan pivot shifts focus to mapping a network, diluting the rekindling's closure weight.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Star-path tracking is introduced in setup ("Each night I step onto the cracked stone floor and track star paths"), used in the rekindling beat (aligning the prism's edges with star-drawn lines), and mentioned in the final paragraph (mapping new constellations). The method shapes the rekindling sequence, but its mechanics are asserted rather than demonstrated—no on-page adjustment or misalignment that forces a tactical choice. It is functional but not causally stressed.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The glass humming pavilion is named in setup, houses the prism in its central alcove, and serves as the site for the rekindling and the caravan meeting. Its glass walls amplify the hush and "sing like thistle in a gentle breeze" after rekindling. The pavilion recurs across beats and is visually specific, but it does not constrain a choice—the custodian moves freely, and no environmental pressure (access, proximity, weather) alters tactics. It is a vivid stage, not a crucible.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"After the collapse of civilization" anchors the opening and recurs in the shard's memory of the night the towers fell. The post-collapse context justifies the custodian's solitude and the beacon's symbolic weight. However, time does not tighten decisions—there is no urgency, deadline, or seasonal constraint that alters tactics. The timeframe is a static backdrop rather than a live pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The motivation ("prove that coincidences have meaning") is declared in setup and restated throughout ("Each coincidence… feeds the hush, confirming that meaning lurks behind random chance"). It frames the custodian's project but is never dramatized as a conflicted choice—no moment where proving meaning costs another value. The caravan arrival is called a coincidence, but the custodian welcomes them without friction. The motivation is told-only, not tested.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Thistle-blown hope" is introduced in setup, recurs mid-story ("a thistle-blown hope that refuses to be crushed"), and closes the piece ("May the thistle-blown hope that flickers here fire the hearts of all"). The tone is consistent—fragile optimism—and modulates slightly (watching, refusing, firing) across beats. However, the tone does not charge the final image with pressure; instead, it settles into declarative aspiration. The reprise reweights the motif but without undeniable cost.</comment>
