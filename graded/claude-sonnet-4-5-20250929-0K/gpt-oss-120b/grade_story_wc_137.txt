<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Lira is established as a "sympathetic skeptic" with the trait "courageously kind," but these labels remain largely ornamental. Her interiority consists of abstract wonder and a disciplined note-taking stance; no embodied contradiction or micro-choice under pressure appears. The climactic beat—realizing the tile is a conduit—lands as epiphany-by-assertion rather than earned through conflicting impulses. No visible cost forecloses a path; she simply closes her notebook feeling "rare peace."</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The piece follows a single continuous accumulation: Lira discovers the tile, watches it shift, transcribes verses, and places it in an alcove. No reversal or tightening narrows options; the tile cooperates throughout. The ending offers Resonant Reconfiguration language ("unheard symphony she had been chasing was not a sound to hear but a feeling to inhabit") but no on-page cost is legible—no choice forecloses a path, no felt price appears in the final image. Orientation is present by ~120 words (tower, cliff, night), so no penalty there, but closure under an Accumulative lens requires visible cost or a cadence shift that reweights the stake, neither of which lands.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The tower's "lattice of old wood and brass," "crystal panes," and "stone desk" ground the space. The magic square tile and the alcove carved weeks earlier anchor micro-setting. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or charge the final image in a way that would lift the score above mid-band; the tower is vividly described but remains backdrop. The whales' migration supplies atmosphere but does not pressure Lira's actions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"sculpt space for reflection"—is signaled early but remains abstract throughout. No reversal or tightening appears; Lira sits, the tile glows, she writes, she closes her notebook. The whales' migration unfolds in parallel but does not complicate her task. No on-page cost is paid; no live option is foreclosed. Under an Accumulative lens, pressure should deepen or a cadence shift should narrow options, but the piece moves in steady descriptive accretion without friction.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Theme of memory-as-journey and doubt-entwining-with-wonder emerges through the tile, verses, and whale arcs. The final image attempts to land thematic resonance ("unheard symphony…not a sound to hear but a feeling to inhabit"), but this is stated rather than earned through scene particulars. The tower-as-sanctuary idea recurs but remains concept-level; no concrete choice tests it. No stated moral appears, which is a strength, but the ending asserts its answer rather than letting the image speak.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization is stable; no head-hopping. The prose carries a lyric, elevated register throughout ("courageously kind," "a quiet alcove in the tower's echo where memories could settle like sediment"). Perceptual signature is ornate but consistent. However, the diction never modulates under pressure—crisis and calm read identically lush. Filter constructions ("She realized," "she felt") appear but are voice-consistent. No dialogue is present.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Dense figurative layering appears in nearly every sentence without pattern-teaching or payoff: "sea breathed mist," "constellations that only the patient could read," "words themselves were infused with the ocean's breath." Mixed vehicles appear (the tower "inhaled," the tile "pulsed," numbers "swirled" then "glowed" then "settled"). Register drift into abstract poetic language ("courageously kind," "entangled memories," "unheard symphony") pervades and is not anchored in the POV's concrete moment. Paraphrase loops: "She realized…" then "She slipped…and she whispered a promise…" then "Lira finally felt…"—three successive restatements of the same resolution without added pressure. Template cadence: many long sentences open with "The" or "She" and stack clauses in parallel rhythm. Apply −1.4 cumulative for density, coherence, and loops; artifacts touch the closure beat, triggering the 9+ disqualification and high-band cap at 8.8 globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The combination of stargazer's tower, magic square tile, whale migration, and transcription is specific but reads as assembled prompt elements rather than an organic synthesis. The "sympathetic skeptic" and "courageously kind" labels are not transformed into lived particulars. The ending's "unheard symphony" and "memory, like migration, is a journey that repeats yet never exactly mirrors its predecessor" gesture toward fresh insight but remain abstract. No bold risk heightens stakes; the piece chooses ornate description over narrative pressure.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Lira (sympathetic skeptic) is present throughout but makes no key decision that alters tactics. She observes, notes, writes, and closes her notebook; the tile cooperates without friction. No choice turns the story. She is labeled skeptic but never doubts or tests the tile's magic on the page.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The magic square tile appears early (hidden in floorboard), is placed on the desk where it glows and shifts, and is finally slipped into the alcove. Three distinct beats. Its numbers mirror whale paths and spell verses, constraining what Lira can transcribe. The tile's mechanics (shifting with memory, settling into calm) shape the middle and ending. However, the tile never resists or forces a trade-off; it simply reveals. Removing it would break the transcription mechanism, but no felt cost is tied to its use. Present in closure (alcove placement, glow) but the final image emphasizes Lira's feeling, not the tile's state.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Entangled memories" is the stated concept (ocean and sky memories woven by whale migration), but it functions as thematic decoration. The tile channels "entangled memories," but this does not constrain Lira's choices or create friction. Swappable with "forgotten songs" or "lost journeys" without structural change. No on-page demonstration of how memories being entangled (versus separate) alters her task.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Courageously kind" is labeled twice (offering tea to the wind, whispering apologies to stars; later as "courageously kind resolve") but never constrains an action with cost. No moment where kindness competes with courage or vice versa. The trait is asserted, not dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Transcription is Lira's central action: she writes each line in shimmering ink, guided by the tile's shifts. The action spans multiple beats (discovering tile, watching shifts, writing verses, completing final stanza). However, transcription itself is passive execution; the tile provides content, she records. No major turn hinges on how she transcribes or a choice within transcription. Swappable with "translate" or "interpret" without deep structural change, though the specificity of ink and parchment adds texture.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Through forgotten patterns etched in dust" is mentioned once at setup (the tile's surface has "forgotten patterns"), but the method's mechanics are vague. The tile rearranges numbers "whenever she thought of a memory," but Lira does not actively decode or struggle with the patterns. The method does not shape her attempts; it simply happens. Present at setup, absent in middle friction, and not paid off in a way that shows the method was necessary versus any other magic mechanism.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The stargazer's open tower is vividly described (lattice of wood and brass, crystal panes, spiraled stool, stone desk, cracked floorboard, narrow alcove). It appears in setup, middle (desk, windows catching whale calls), and closure (alcove, windows catching gust). The tower's openness allows the whales' song to filter through, but it does not constrain Lira's choices or alter her tactics. The alcove she carved "weeks earlier" supplies a place for the tile but was prepared off-page. Postcard detail without pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"During whale migration" frames the night: whales rise outside, their songs filter through the tower, their migratory paths mirror the tile's prime sequence. Present in setup, middle, and closure (whales' song fades, breach as punctuation). However, the migration does not tighten Lira's decisions or impose a clock. She could transcribe any night; the whales provide atmosphere and thematic parallel, not urgency. Time is untracked; no sense of limited window.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"To sculpt space for reflection" is stated as Lira's purpose in the opening and restated at closure ("the space would remain open, a sanctuary"). The motivation is told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants. No friction between reflection and another goal; no cost to pursuing it. The tower already exists as a reflection space; Lira's task is to transcribe and place the tile, not to fight for or build the sanctuary. Motivation is present but abstract and uncontested.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Unheard symphony" recurs as label (tower as "unheard symphony of stone, sea, and stars," whales' "unheard symphony," final realization "was not a sound to hear but a feeling"). Tone is lyric-elegiac throughout, coherent across beats. The prose never modulates under pressure; every sentence carries the same lush, abstract register whether Lira is discovering the tile or closing her notebook. The tone does charge the final image by naming itself ("unheard symphony…a quiet resonance"), but this is assertion rather than tonal shift. Coherent but static.</comment>
