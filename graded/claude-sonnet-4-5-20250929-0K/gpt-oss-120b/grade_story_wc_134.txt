<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Lira is introduced as "a clairvoyant who didn't see it coming" but never makes a meaningful choice under pressure; she watches, whispers promises, and feels things without agency. The pilgrim remains a cipher defined only by wool and a prayer. Internal contradiction is absent; emotions are labeled ("feels the unseen forces settle") rather than embodied through conflicting impulses. The story withholds interiority and offers no micro-choices that reveal values under cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed past 120 words—who Lira is and why she seeks the pearl emerge slowly through ornamental description. No on-page decisive change occurs; the pilgrim arrives, Lira whispers, the pearl glows, and a child appears, but no before/after choice or renunciation forecloses a path with visible cost. The ending loops back to thematic summary ("unseen forces…can magnify the magic") without a legible closure unit. Drive lens remains ambiguous between Accumulative and Situational, yet neither pays off in a crystallized final image with felt cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The crystal cave is vividly rendered with quartz, opal, and "overlapping shadows" that move like tides, and the musical resonance modulates across beats. However, setting does not constrain a choice or alter tactics—Lira simply steps forward and the cave responds without friction. Spatial choreography (pedestal, arches, floor) is legible but static. The cave functions as backdrop rather than crucible; micro-setting test not met for higher bands.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Lira seeking the pearl to amplify miracles—is signaled early but never tested by a reversal or tightening that narrows options. The pilgrim's arrival adds atmospheric pressure but no escalation; Lira's whisper is granted without cost, and the cave's response is benevolent throughout. No meaningful tightening or deepening occurs; the narrative drifts through accumulative beats without a pressure point that forces a trade-off or forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Theme ("everyday magic," "unseen forces," "bright darkness") is declared repeatedly rather than emerging from concrete events. The final paragraph moralizes: "unseen forces, when embraced, can magnify the magic hidden in everyday breath." No earned epiphany or non-literal answer; the piece tells its thesis rather than dramatizing it. Recurrent images (shadows, cave pearl, bright darkness) are decorative rather than constraining or reweighting prior material.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Third-person POV remains stable, but distance is inconsistent—Lira's interiority is thin and filtered through stock phrasing ("feels the unseen forces settle"). Diction drifts into elevated, abstract register ("steadily unpredictable change," "constellation of notes") that does not feel character-bound. The pilgrim and child have no interior access, and their actions lack subtext. Perceptual signature is absent; the narration reads as generic omniscient rather than a distinct voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade: "overlapping shadows" recur five times without evolving meaning; "unseen forces" appear in nearly every beat as theme assertion. Template cadence runs flatten momentum ("She steps forward…She captures…She knows"). Figurative density is high but muddy ("bright darkness" yoked to "dark tunnels can shine" within two lines; "tear of luminescent amber" that "turns shadows into ribbons of light" mixes vehicles). Closure beat is drowned in abstraction ("unseen forces…can magnify the magic hidden in everyday breath"). Apply −1.4 for loops, template stems, and figurative muddle touching closure; disallow 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The premise—magical cave that amplifies miracles—follows a familiar template without transformation through specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. "Clairvoyant who didn't see it coming" promises irony but delivers only a label; no fresh synthesis or risk emerges. Imagery ("bright darkness," "overlapping shadows") recycles familiar paradoxes without grounding them in a new context. The piece reads as a response to prompt elements rather than a singular artistic vision.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>Lira is present throughout but makes no choices that create turns. She watches, whispers, and feels; the cave and pilgrim drive events. Ornamental presence without agency. Late cap 2.8 applied; swappability and ornamental use lower to 2.3.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The cave pearl appears on a pedestal, sheds an amber tear, and glows in the final beat—three touches. However, it does not constrain a choice or enable tactics; Lira's whisper prompts the pearl's response without friction. Present in closure (glows brighter) but not causally active there. Setup + Payoff gates met; Development missing. Cap 4.6; lack of causal pressure lowers to 4.1.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Unseen forces" appear in nearly every paragraph as theme assertion but never shape an on-page decision or tactic. The phrase is invoked repeatedly ("unseen forces of the cave," "unseen forces settle," "unseen forces…can magnify") without mechanics or cost. Swappable with "magic" or "power." Cap 3.8 for label-only use.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Steadily unpredictable" is declared once ("steadily unpredictable change") but does not constrain or enable an action with cost. No visible tradeoff or friction tied to this trait. Ornamental mention. Cap 2.8; lack of any beat involvement lowers to 2.1.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Inhabit" recurs as verb and theme ("inhabit the space," "inhabit her destiny," "continues to inhabit") but does not define a major turn or redefine options. The action is abstract and could swap with "shape" or "fill." No causal pressure or cost tied to this verb. Cap 3.8; abstraction and swappability lower to 3.2.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Overlapping shadows" appear early, move like tides, turn into ribbons of light, pulse in rhythm, and are woven together in the final image—four distinct beats. The method is signaled and its visuals matter to atmosphere, but it does not constrain attempts or impose mechanics that alter tactics. Setup, Development (visual beats), and Payoff gates met. Lack of causal pressure and high swappability (could be "shifting light") hold at 4.8.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The musical crystal cave is introduced immediately, supplies resonance and light across multiple beats, and frames the entire action. However, it does not pressure a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome; it responds benevolently without friction. Setup + Payoff met; Development arguable via resonance beats. Micro-setting test not met (no constraint on tactics). Cap ~6.1 for all gates; lack of constraint holds at 5.9.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"After the pilgrim arrives" anchors the timeframe early and triggers Lira's recognition ("the moment has slipped"), but time does not tighten decisions or tactics thereafter. The sequence drifts without urgency; no clock pressure. Setup met, Development and Payoff missing. Cap 4.6; lack of urgency lowers to 3.6.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"To magnify everyday magic" is stated explicitly as Lira's promise and recurs in theme ("magnify the everyday magic"), but the desire is never dramatized in a conflicted choice. Lira seeks the pearl, whispers, and succeeds without friction between want and cost. Told motivation without on-page test. Setup + Payoff (thematic echo) met; Development missing. Cap 4.6; lack of friction lowers to 4.3.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Bright darkness" appears in the opening line, recurs six times, and anchors the final image ("the bright darkness remains"). The oxymoron is coherent and modulates from initial description to thematic charge. Setup, Development (multiple beats), and Payoff gates met. However, tone does not shift with pressure—it remains static and elevated throughout. Coherent but non-dynamic; 5.2.</comment>
