<comment>The bell tuner remains a static archetype without embodied interiority or contradictory impulses. No on-page micro-choices under pressure appear; he glides through the narrative performing symbolic gestures ("placed the ebony fork," "whispered to the stones") that are recounted rather than experienced from within. Motivation is declared ("restore shared balance") but never tested by competing wants or visible cost. Workers arrive as scenery, and the tuner's "patient patience" is label-only, never dramatized through a moment of temptation or doubt that might reveal character under stress.</comment>

<comment>Who, where, and when anchor tolerably early (tuner, plaza, pre-collapse dawn), but no meaningful escalation or tightening occurs. The tuner begins rebuilding and continues without obstacle, reversal, or changed knowledge; workers arrive on cue and the town completes itself in a single glide. The final paragraph offers thematic summary ("spirit renewed," "shared balance they now protected") rather than a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration with visible cost. Under any lens—Causal, Accumulative, Situational—the ending remains a tableau without on-page pressure or forfeiture that would constitute closure.</comment>

<grade>5.8</grade>
<comment>The archway, plaza, and cobblestones anchor setting cleanly and recur with some purposeful color (gold light, silver lattice). The tuner's fork touches dust, but no environmental constraint visibly alters a choice or tactic; setting mostly supplies backdrop rather than friction. The final well and market stalls appear late without prior setup, functioning as thematic ornaments. Sensory specifics (pine, iron, rippling water) are vivid yet do not press against the protagonist's goals, keeping the piece in mid-band.</comment>

<grade>3.7</grade>
<comment>A dominant stake is signaled (restore the town), but no complication or reversal tests it; the tuner imagines footsteps, the fork hums, stones slide into place, workers arrive, done. No on-page narrowing of options, no trade-off or visible price paid, no choice that forecloses an alternate path. The escalation requirement under any lens is unmet, and coincidence (sunrise, workers' arrival) drives events rather than protagonist agency. Without pressure or cost, the piece remains a sequence rather than a conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>4.9</grade>
<comment>Theme (community restoration, balance between stone and spirit) is declared overtly in multiple lines ("restore shared balance," "spirit renewed") rather than emerging from concrete events. The ebony fork and cobblestone rhythm are mentioned frequently but do not accumulate fresh meaning or constrain a final choice; they remain static symbols. No non-literal resonance or reweighting occurs at the ending; instead, exposition summarizes the moral ("unseen foundation upon which the revived community would forever thrive"). The piece tells its theme rather than dramatizing it through particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>4.4</grade>
<comment>Third-person POV distance is stable, but the narrative voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature; diction oscillates between archaic register ("wild hush," "cryptic bell tuner") and generic descriptors without anchoring in the tuner's lived experience. Filter verbs ("felt the balance," "seemed to carry") stack without purpose, dulling immediacy. No on-page dialogue appears, so those bullets do not apply. The prose reads more like external reportage than a mind under pressure, and the recurring phrase "wild hush" is asserted rather than rendered through sensation.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>3.8</grade>
<comment>Extensive paraphrase loops and template cadence runs pervade the text: "his reputation rode on," "a dark instrument said to vibrate," "the town, now a ghost town revival in the making" all restate the same concept; "each step the tuner imagined…set a rhythm," "each imagined footfall," "steady beat beneath his boots" cycle without added information. Figurative language ("silent bell," "lattice of silver," "dust on a drum") is dense but often mixed or strained, and nearly every sentence opens with a similar stem or elevated diction that flattens rhythm. Filter-verb stacks ("seemed to pulse," "felt the balance") and stock metaphors ("quiet yet undeniable") reduce immediacy. These artifacts cluster throughout, including the final third, triggering the patterned-artifact penalty pack and disallowing 9+ globally per Q7 rules.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>4.6</grade>
<comment>The premise (bell tuner rebuilds town via rhythm and tuning fork) offers a surface novelty, but execution relies on familiar allegorical tropes without transformation: the lone mystic, the ruined town, the magical tool, the effortless restoration. No specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus individualizes the material; the tuner's process is recounted in abstract ("imagined footfall," "invisible hands") rather than through concrete choices or friction. The emotional arc and plot could be transposed to any setting with synonym swaps, indicating insufficient specificity. Within Q8, apply the derivative-premise adjustment for the template allegorical frame and lack of transformative detail.</comment>

<question>9 A</question>
<grade>2.4</grade>
<comment>The cryptic bell tuner is present throughout but makes no on-page decision that alters tactics or outcome. He places the fork, whispers, raises it like a baton—all recounted gestures without internal friction or forfeiture. Workers arrive and rebuild without his active choice directing a turn. The character is a passive allegorical figure; removing him would require only a shift to an abstract narrator. Setup present, middle and closure participation both observational rather than decisional; ornamental use and swappability penalties apply.</comment>

<question>9 B</question>
<grade>5.1</grade>
<comment>The ebony tuning fork appears in beat one (placed on ground, hums), beat two (sings in resonance, raised like baton), and the final image (tuner holding it, distant resonance in breeze). Setup and closure gates met, but the fork's mechanics never constrain a choice or create cost; it functions as a static magical tool without evolving use or reweighted meaning. Its properties are label-only ("vibrate with memory") and do not narrow options. Lyric reprise with two beats and closure mention earns mid-band, but swappability (could be any mystical object) and lack of causal pressure prevent higher scoring.</comment>

<question>9 C</question>
<grade>4.8</grade>
<comment>Ghost town revival is the premise and frames the setup, drives multiple beats (tuner rebuilding, workers arriving, market stalls opening), and appears explicitly in the closure paragraph. All three gates met. However, the concept does not shape on-page tactics or create visible alternatives; the town simply rebuilds without obstacle or choice. Swappability moderate (could be any restoration project) and no felt cost tied to the revival itself. Functional across beats but replaceable, landing in mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question>
<grade>2.7</grade>
<comment>"Infinitely patient" is label-only, mentioned once in passing ("Infinitely patient, the tuner had waited") without constraining or enabling any on-page action. No moment dramatizes patience as a tradeoff or cost; the tuner never faces a temptation to hurry or a consequence of waiting. Setup present but no middle development or closure participation; ornamental use and lack of visible cost apply.</comment>

<question>9 E</question>
<grade>5.4</grade>
<comment>"Rebuild" is the central action, framing setup, driving multiple beats (tuner aligning stones, workers laying cobblestones, market stalls opening), and present at closure. All three gates met. However, the action is recounted in summary ("stones sliding into place," "together they rebuilt") rather than dramatized through discrete choices or obstacles. Swappability moderate (could be any communal construction) and no single turn hinges uniquely on rebuilding mechanics. Functional across structure but lacks irreplaceability and causal pressure, landing in mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question>
<grade>4.2</grade>
<comment>"Rhythm of footsteps on cobblestones" is signaled early ("cadence of footsteps…not yet laid"), recurs in the middle ("each imagined footfall," "steady beat beneath his boots"), and appears in the closure paragraph ("each footfall a silent bell"). Setup, middle, and closure gates met. However, the mechanics are asserted rather than shown shaping a choice; the footsteps remain metaphorical without constraining tactics or creating cost. Swappability high (could be any rhythmic metaphor) and no causal pressure. Functional presence across beats earns low-mid band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question>
<grade>4.9</grade>
<comment>The ancient archway appears in setup (first sentence, tuner strides beneath it), middle (catches light, shadows form lattice), and closure (market stalls open under its shadow). All three gates met. However, the archway supplies only visual color and does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; it is postcard description rather than pressure. Swappability moderate (could be any landmark) and no cost tied to its presence. Functional across structure but lacks causal work, landing in mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question>
<grade>3.6</grade>
<comment>"Before the collapse" appears in the opening phrase and implicitly frames the ruined state, but time never tightens decisions or alters tactics. No clock pressure or temporal constraint shapes the tuner's moves; the sunrise is a signal rather than a deadline. The timeframe is setup-only, with no middle development or closure participation. Functional but replaceable, and lacking urgency or cost.</comment>

<question>9 I</question>
<grade>3.3</grade>
<comment>"Restore shared balance" is stated explicitly mid-story ("promising to restore shared balance") and echoed at closure ("the balance he had vowed to restore"). Setup and closure gates met, but the motivation is told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants or visible cost. No on-page moment tests the tuner's commitment to balance versus another desire. Label-only use and lack of friction keep the score low despite structural presence.</comment>

<question>9 J</question>
<grade>5.3</grade>
<comment>"Wild hush" appears in the opening phrase, recurs at closure ("In the lingering wild hush"), and is asserted in the middle ("a wild hush that seemed to pulse"). Setup, middle, closure gates met. However, the tone is declared rather than modulated through pressure; the piece maintains a single static register of elevated lyricism without cadence shift or tension. The phrase itself is abstract and does not charge the final image with fresh meaning. Functional presence across structure but lacks modulation and specificity, landing in mid-band.</comment>
