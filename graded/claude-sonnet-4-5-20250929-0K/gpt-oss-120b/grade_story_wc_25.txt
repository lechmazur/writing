<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Milo's motivation is declared rather than earned through contradictory impulses. His interior reads as stock experimentation ("calculated spontaneity") rather than embodied thought under pressure. The key beats—whispering into the coin, following the map—advance a ritual checklist without visible internal conflict or cost. The ending recycles the same stance without alteration or renunciation that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation Test penalty applied: who/where/when anchor by ~120 words, but "port city" and "labyrinth maintenance worker" remain generic placeholders without grounding spatial choreography. Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (storm imagery, map motifs), yet no pattern is taught by 25% and the closure—"whispered thought could outlast any roar"—summarizes theme rather than delivering a Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with visible cost. The final image ("labyrinth breathe with his rhythm") abstracts rather than reweights prior material. Cost proof test fails: no on-page sentence shows a felt or conceptual price at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The container labyrinth and storm supply vivid atmospheric texture, but spatial choreography remains vague (Milo "follows" a glowing line without distance, turns, or obstacles). The zodiac coin and key are handled across beats, qualifying as micro-setting under the allowance. However, neither environment nor object constrains a choice at closure; the final image is conceptual rather than spatial. No 9+ eligibility without that constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"to prove that whispers travel farther than shouts"—is declared but never tested by opposition or trade-off. Milo's ritual (coin, map, key) proceeds without reversal, resistance, or cost. The radio crackles his phrase back, confirming the legend without agency or price. No meaningful tightening or deepening under any lens; the ending restates the premise rather than narrowing options or forcing sacrifice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The theme—"whispers are the true currents of this city"—is stated on the retrieved parchment and restated in the final paragraph, replacing scene pressure with authorial thesis. The zodiac coin and map recur but do not shift meaning at closure; they remain functional props. No non-literal answer emerges from particulars; the ending spells out the moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>POV remains stable single-character throughout. Diction suffers from elevated register drift ("calculated spontaneity," "moth's wing," "steel veins") that feels imposed rather than character-particular. Filter verbs ("felt," "sensed," "noting") stack in high-pressure beats, dulling immediacy. No dialogue present. Perceptual signature is generic—Milo notices symbols, pulses, vibrations—without bias or selective attention rooted in his role or psychology.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Loop and scaffold artifacts pervade: "The map, a relic...was annotated" / "the folded map...its creases"; "whisper" and synonym variants ("faint," "quiet," "soft") churn across adjacent lines. Template cadence: "He [verb], [verb], and [verb]" runs dominate action sequences. Stock metaphors ("age-worn veins," "living vein," "steel veins") repeat the same vehicle without fresh tenor. Figurative density in most sentences of high-pressure beats (coin placement, tunnel entry, box opening) lacks pattern-teaching or payoff. Artifacts touch the closure beat ("labyrinth breathe," "his rhythm"), triggering −1.7 baseline and 9+ disqualification globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The core premise—maintenance worker tests urban legend during geomagnetic storm—combines familiar genre elements (labyrinth quest, magical artifact, validation plot) without transformation. The zodiac coin, key with no lock, and glowing map function as a convenience stack that solves each step without cost or surprise. The ending ("whispers outlast shouts") fulfills the legend exactly as told, with no earned complication or non-obvious angle. Transformation test fails: swap names and the arc remains unchanged.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Milo's role as maintenance worker is mentioned but does not constrain his choices; he paces aisles with a clipboard (setup) but then abandons the job to conduct a personal ritual. His observations (map symbols, glowing paths) do not create key turns; he follows rather than decides under pressure. No middle development or closure participation tied to his occupational knowledge or duty.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The zodiac coin appears early (setup), is used in two beats (whisper capture, radio amplification), and is tucked away at closure with a brief reprise ("glinting under the waning lightning"). However, its specific properties—twelve symbols, brass, amplification—do not narrow options or impose cost. The coin is swappable with any resonant object; its zodiac aspect is ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Folded maps frame the setup (annotated with symbols) and guide Milo's path in the middle (glowing line). The final unfurled map shows a new route, qualifying as closure participation. However, the maps do not constrain tactics or impose a trade-off; Milo simply follows them. The "folded" aspect—creases like veins—is decorative metaphor rather than functional mechanic.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>The map "identifies people's walks through the steel corridors" via glowing symbols, but this attribute is only described; Milo does not use it to track, avoid, or interact with other people. No cost or tactical choice tied to this trait. Present in setup, absent in development and closure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The challenge—whisper into the coin to test the legend—is declared early and drives the middle ritual beats (coin placement, radio tuning). The distant voice repeating his phrase constitutes a turn. However, the challenge is easily completed without opposition or surprise; removing it would collapse the plot. Functional but not transformative.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The key appears early (tucked into a crate) and is retrieved in the middle, then used to open the steel box at closure. Its "no apparent lock" property is mentioned but not leveraged; the key simply works when pressed against a container wall. The method is present across beats but mechanically convenient rather than integral to tactics or cost.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The container labyrinth and port setting provide atmospheric texture and spatial vocabulary (aisles, stacks, rusted doors). Milo moves through the maze following the map's guidance, and the storm's electromagnetic pulses interact with metal surfaces. However, the setting does not pressure a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome; Milo's path is scripted by the glowing map. No micro-setting constraint at closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.0</grade><comment>The geomagnetic storm is present throughout (setup: "crackled," middle: "surged," closure: "begun to subside") and the whisper rides the storm's frequency. However, no ticking clock or urgency is established; Milo proceeds at leisure. The storm enables the legend but does not tighten decisions or alter tactics. Late-breaking resolution: the storm validates the whisper without prior cost.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Milo's motivation—"to prove that whispers travel farther than shouts"—is stated in setup and restated at closure ("whispered thought could outlast any roar"). No on-page friction between this want and a competing cost or fear; the legend is tested and confirmed without sacrifice or doubt. Told-only with no dramatized conflict.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Tone labeled as "calculated spontaneity" in one line ("laughed, a sound of calculated spontaneity") but not sustained or modulated across beats. The prose alternates between lyric elevation ("moth's wing," "aurora") and procedural description ("turned the knob," "pressed the key") without coherent voice pressure. The final image does not charge or resolve the tonal claim.</comment>
