<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The pocket-sun alchemist remains a label without embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. His friends are undifferentiated and serve as audience rather than sources of conflict. The "directed spontaneity" and emotional beats read as告诉 assertions ("felt a surge," "calm certainty") rather than dramatized through bodily response or hesitation. No visible cost forecloses a path; the experiment succeeds without friction, and the group departs unified.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors appear late (~180 words) and remain vague: "ember nexus at twilight" functions as atmospheric label rather than concrete place. The piece operates in Accumulative mode but never tightens or deepens—each beat adds decoration (shell, palette, glow) without narrowing options or raising cost. No on-page Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing occurs; the group achieves their goal without reversal, and the ending asserts thematic uplift ("revalue the world") rather than landing a felt consequence. Closure validity fails under any lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The "ember nexus at twilight" and "nautilus shell" are vivid in isolation but do not constrain choice or evolve causally. Spatial choreography is unclear: the basin, brushes, and shell's position shift without tracking. The setting provides atmosphere but never pressures a tactic—coals "flare brighter" in response to the ritual without mechanical cost or risk. Micro-setting allowance applies (shell, palette), but neither object alters the attempt or charges the final image with consequence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"to capture the density of presence"—is declared but never tested. No reversal, tightening, or deepening occurs; the experiment proceeds smoothly from setup to success. Coincidence does not complicate; luck does not solve—because nothing opposes. The friends "agreed to protect the glow" without dramatized friction or trade-off. No visible price is paid; the final image asserts uplift ("carry the glow within them") but forecloses no prior option.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Theme is stated directly in the final beat: "the true alchemy lies in the willingness to see light where others see only ash." This moralizing replaces earned resonance. The "palette of resolve," "scientifically romantic," and "revalue" recur as prompt labels without accumulating pressure or reweighting prior material. No concrete particular shifts meaning at closure; the ending asserts thematic victory ("revalue the world with every breath") without ambiguity or cost. Thematic Echo penalty applies: −0.6 for direct thesis articulation in the final paragraph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>POV remains stable (third-person limited on the alchemist) with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is generic: the alchemist "glanced," "explained," "watched," "smiled" without character-specific noticing bias. Diction elevates at peak beats ("density of presence," "directed spontaneity," "scientifically romantic") in ways that feel prompt-imported rather than voice-motivated. No dialogue appears to test subtext or character distinction. Filter verbs ("felt a surge," "felt certain") dominate emotional beats without embodied texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: "revalue" appears six times, "returning differently" thrice, "density of presence" twice, all without on-page pressure shift. Template cadence runs: "The alchemist felt... / He watched... / They agreed... / And with that, they..." across the final third. Stock metaphors cluster: "hearts alight," "light would speak louder than any argument," "each step a quiet affirmation." Register drifts into prompt-speak ("scientifically romantic," "directed spontaneity") mid-scene without voice anchor. Patterned-artifact penalty: −1.2 in Q7; disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band entries at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Core premise—alchemists gather to create magical light—follows a familiar workshop pattern without fresh transformation. "Scientifically romantic" and "revalue" read as imported thesis labels rather than discoveries from dramatized friction. The nautilus shell and pocket-sun furnace are vivid tokens but do not synthesize into an inevitable turn. No bold risk heightens stakes; the group succeeds without complication, and the ending offers uplift ("ready to revalue the world") that could apply to any inspirational tale. Derivative Premise Guardrail: −0.8 within Q8.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>The pocket-sun alchemist is named early and owns the POV, but makes no decision that alters tactics. He explains, watches, and smiles; the experiment proceeds without his agency forcing a turn. Ornamental presence without causal pressure. Late penalty waived (present early), but no beat involvement beyond setup and passive observation at closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The nautilus shell appears at setup, is used once mid-scene (glows when the liquid touches it), and is mentioned at closure ("the shell's light persisted"). Two beats, but both are passive: the shell reacts rather than constraining the alchemist's choice. No cost is tied to its use, and a similar object (crystal, lens) could replace it with minor edits. Setup + Development + Payoff gates met, but causal pressure and irreplaceability are low.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Palette of resolve" is described once (moonstone, carnelian, sunrise mixture) and brushed into but does not shape a turn or constrain a choice. The friends "dip their brush again" and "mix in a dash of their own breath" without friction or trade-off. The concept appears as thematic label, not stake-driver. Setup gate met; Development and Payoff gates missed. Ornamental mention; swappable with "shared intention" or similar.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"Scientifically romantic" is label-only: "He described this approach as scientifically romantic, a dance between precise measurement and the poetry of transformation." No on-page action demonstrates the trait, and no cost or constraint follows from it. The experiment does not require precision or poetry to succeed. Told attribute without dramatized tradeoff. Setup gate met; Development and Payoff gates missed.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Revalue" appears six times as a repeated claim: "to revalue the conventional alchemical hierarchy," "revalue the old belief," "to revalue the world." No turn hinges on revaluation; the word recurs as thematic echo rather than action. The friends achieve their goal without needing to revalue anything on the page. Ornamental recurrence; easily swappable with "transform" or "reconsider." Setup + vague Payoff; no Development beat.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"By returning differently" is mentioned twice: "His method was to revalue... by returning differently to the ancient principle that heat is memory" and "to revisit the experiment by returning differently each season." The method is asserted but not demonstrated—no on-page instance shows the friends returning to a prior step with a changed approach that alters outcome. Summary-only; no causal involvement. Setup + vague Payoff; no Development.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The "ember nexus at twilight" frames the opening and closing, appears mid-scene when "the coals flar[e] brighter," and is mentioned at closure ("faded into a quiet ember field"). Three touches, but the setting never constrains a choice or supplies a resource that changes tactics. Atmospheric backdrop; does not pressure the experiment. Setup + vague Development + Payoff, but causal pressure and irreplaceability are low.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>1.3</grade><comment>"In the moment a secret is whispered between friends" appears in the opening exposition and once mid-scene: "a secret was whispered between friends, a quiet vow." The timeframe is not tracked as a live clock; the ritual unfolds without time pressure. No tightening of decisions follows from the whispered-moment constraint. Label-only; does not shape tactics. Setup mention; no Development or Payoff involvement.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>"To capture the density of presence" is stated as the gathering's motive and echoed at closure: "the density of presence they sought was now a tangible glow." The desire is told rather than dramatized—no on-page friction tests whether the alchemist values presence over safety, speed, or another want. The goal is achieved without conflicting cost. Setup + Payoff via assertion; no Development choice. Functional but replaceable with "create lasting light."</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"Directed spontaneity" is named once: "The alchemist felt a surge of directed spontaneity, a sense that his carefully plotted experiment was now alive with unpredictable joy." The tone is asserted mid-scene but does not modulate with pressure—no shift from plan to improvisation alters tactics, and the ending maintains the same declarative uplift. Single static mood; does not charge the final image. Label-only mention; no coherent tonal arc.</comment>
