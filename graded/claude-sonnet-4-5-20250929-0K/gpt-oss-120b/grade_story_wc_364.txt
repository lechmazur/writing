<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The blacksmith remains a cipher throughout, defined by abstract labels ("meek," "quietly determined") rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. His choice to seek the silk and his final forging read as plot stations, not decisions emerging from internal conflict. The memory he "barters" is told in summary ("the memory of his first failed forge, a scar he kept hidden beneath soot") without embodied cost or visible friction. The villagers appear only to receive exposition in the final third, and no relationship pressure tests the protagonist's stance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed: "meek blacksmith" and "orchard planet" appear early, but no spatial anchor (workshop location relative to anything) or temporal frame emerges until deep into the piece. The dominant lens reads Accumulative/Textural (layered images of azure, defiance, rubble-to-resilience), but the closure—blade striking stone, cracks becoming crystal vines—is asserted without prior setup of world-rules or cost. The "bartered awakening" (memory exchange) happens off-page in a hum; the silk's attachment and the blade's singing are told, not dramatized with visible consequence. No meaningful tightening occurs; the blacksmith's journey from workshop to cavern to forge proceeds in and-then sequencing.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Vivid images (sapphire fruit, floating rock arches, azure glyphs, crystal veins) create atmosphere, but spatial choreography is vague—mine shafts "beneath the orchard's roots," cavern distance unstated, forge placement "beneath one arch" without tactical detail. The silk's tactile moment ("wind caught in cotton") is brief; its wrapping around the forge and infusing strikes is asserted rather than shown constraining or enabling a choice. The orchard and arches frame the piece but do not pressure the blacksmith's decisions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"coax resilience from rubble"—is declared but never tested by opposition or scarcity. The blacksmith's descent and retrieval proceed without impediment; the stone "answered with a low hum" and the silk "slipped onto his arm as if recognizing his resolve." No reversal, cost, or narrowing of options appears. The final act (blade striking stone, vines growing) is a declarative outcome, not a choice under pressure. Escalation is absent; the journey is a quest-fetch without friction.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Theme of bartered awakenings and resilience-from-rubble is stated repeatedly ("each edge a promise to coax resilience from rubble," "every rubble could awaken, if only bartered with resolve") rather than emerging from particulars. The azure motif recurs (glyphs, blade note, defiance) but functions as decoration; it does not constrain choice or reweight prior material at closure. The final image (cracks blossoming into crystal vines) offers visual resonance but no conceptual cost or non-literal answer to a dramatized question. The piece tells its thesis rather than enacting it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, but psychic distance drifts into elevated lyricism ("each strike a promise he could not yet name," "his mind a twin horizon of hope and doubt") that does not reflect the meek blacksmith's interiority. Register is high-literary throughout, with no modulation for urgency or stress. The villagers' dialogue in the penultimate beat ("He spoke of bartered awakenings...") is indirect summary, not dramatized speech. Perceptual signature is generic; the narrator's noticing (glittering fruit, humming silk, azure notes) could belong to any observer.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: "each strike a promise" / "each edge a promise" / "each pulse a reminder of the promise"; "quietly determined" and "deliberate" recur without variation. Template cadence dominates ("He listened... He resolved... He set out... He followed... He reached out..."). Stock metaphors cluster: "twin horizon of hope and doubt," "bartered awakenings," "coax resilience from rubble" (x3). Figurative density in every sentence ("fields...glittering," "market like sighs," "shafts yawned like dark arteries," "draped like a comet," "sang when lifted") without pattern-teaching or payoff. The final third repeats "azure defiance" and cognates four times in five sentences.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Core premise (blacksmith seeks magical silk to forge resilience) follows a standard quest-fetch template without transformation. The orchard planet and floating arches are vivid but remain postcard backdrop. The "bartered awakening" (memory for silk) echoes countless magical-price tropes without a fresh moral calculus. The blade's ability to turn stone cracks into crystal vines is introduced at closure without prior demonstration or cost, reading as convenient enchantment. No bold structural or perspectival risk; the piece proceeds in chronological and-then beats to a declarative ending.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>The blacksmith is present throughout and makes two decisions (seek the silk, offer the memory), but both are summarized without on-page friction or visible cost. He does not create key turns; events happen to him (stone hums, silk slips on, blade sings) rather than through contested choice.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The silk appears in three beats: rumor (early), cavern acquisition (middle), forge use (end). Setup and payoff gates are met, but middle development is weak—the silk's attachment is passive ("slipped onto his arm"). Its wrapping around the forge and infusing strikes is told, not shown constraining tactics. Specific properties (starlight weave, memory barter) do not recur or reweight at closure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>Bartered awakenings frame the premise and are named five times, but the concept is never dramatized with visible cost or tactical constraint. The memory-for-silk exchange happens off-page in a hum. The villagers hear the blacksmith "spoke of bartered awakenings" in summary. The concept functions as thematic label rather than stake-shaping mechanic.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Quietly determined" is stated three times but never shown constraining or enabling an on-page action. The blacksmith's resolve is asserted ("his fingers trembling," "knowing each glint was a step") without visible tradeoff or cost tied to the attribute. It reads as label-only characterization.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"Deliberate" modifies the blacksmith's setting-out and steps but does not define a major turn. The action is swappable with "careful," "purposeful," or similar near-synonyms. No choice or reversal traces specifically to deliberateness; it colors narration without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The mine shafts are signaled early ("ancient map that marked abandoned mine shafts"), used in the middle (descent, glyphs, tunnel opening), and referenced obliquely at the end (return "to the surface"). Setup and development gates are met. However, the shafts' mechanics (glyphs, hum, tunnel) do not constrain tactics or present obstacle; the blacksmith presses his palm and the path opens. The element shapes one key beat (acquisition) but is not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The orchard planet and floating arches frame the opening and closing but do not pressure choices. The blacksmith sets his forge "beneath one arch" for resonance, not tactical necessity. The setting provides vivid backdrop (sapphire fruit, azure skies, crystal veins) without altering the protagonist's options or supplying resources that affect outcome. Postcard description dominates.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"Between understanding and confusion" appears twice as abstract descriptor but is never tracked or dramatized. No on-page moment shows the blacksmith or villagers navigating this timeframe with decisions shaped by epistemic uncertainty. It functions as thematic echo, not temporal constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The motivation ("coax resilience from rubble") is stated four times and drives the quest-fetch structure. However, it is never conflicted or tested by cost. The blacksmith's desire proceeds without friction (no scarcity, opposition, or tradeoff between wants). The motivation is told, not dramatized through choices with visible price.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Azure" appears eight times as color and "defiance" four times as label, creating a consistent tonal palette. The tone modulates slightly (dim workshop → echoing shafts → resonant forge) but remains lyrically elevated throughout. The final image ("azure defiance," "steadfast chorus") reprises the tone but does not charge it with new pressure or cost. Coherent but static; one-note rather than dynamically reweighted.</comment>
