<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation ("harvest lessons from loss") is stated rather than discovered through contradictory impulses. The carving process itself lacks embodied struggle—she simply "began to carve" with no physical resistance, no competing desires pulling her away from or toward completion. The widow role and circus background remain labels; no micro-choice reveals how her tamer's training shapes her hands or perception under this particular grief. The closure renunciation (placing the lantern, understanding the paradox) arrives without visible cost that forecloses a live alternative path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes an Accumulative/Textural lens: rain, rust hue, kettle steam, and carved amber accumulate toward a final image of "rust-hued peace" as acceptance. Orientation anchors (widow, loft, carving blank) arrive early. However, the closure—Mara placing the lantern and feeling the lesson settle—registers as conceptual summary rather than a decisive image that reweights prior material with undeniable cost. The kettle's boil recurs but does not narrow options; it marks time without altering tactics. One meaningful deepening (sap hardening into memory vault) appears mid-story, but the ending defaults to explanation ("loss can be a tool, not a trap") rather than letting the image alone reconfigure stakes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The loft, kettle, and rain-beaded skylight are vividly rendered and consistent. The ash wood blank's grain "whispering of forests long felled" and the iron gouge "catching light like a tamer's whip" anchor sensory detail in Mara's professional past. However, spatial choreography wobbles: she stands at the window, sets the blank on the table, then places the finished carving on the windowsill and later the hearth without clear movement or distance tracking. The skylight participates only as atmospheric backdrop; it does not constrain a single choice or charge the final image beyond decoration.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—transforming grief into a functional vessel—is signaled early but never tested by a competing desire or external obstacle. Mara encounters no resistance: the sap emerges conveniently, the glass pane seals it, the lantern glows as intended. The kettle boiling functions as a timer motif but does not tighten decisions; she completes the carving without time pressure forcing a trade-off. No meaningful reversal narrows her options. The resolution (understanding that "loss can be a tool") is declared rather than earned through a choice that forecloses an alternative with visible cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The "here and gone" paradox of grief threads through rain beads, steam, and the amber-trapped roar, creating thematic coherence. The rust-hued peace deepening into warm amber at closure offers a resonant tonal shift. However, the final paragraph explicitly states the theme ("loss can be a tool, not a trap," "the paradox of here and gone could be lived, not merely mourned") rather than trusting the carved lantern image to carry meaning. The whispered thanks to "the empty space" verges on sentimental declaration. The piece leans toward thesis illustration rather than emergent complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV holds throughout with no head-hopping. Diction remains elevated and consistent ("hauntingly practical," "measured negotiation between memory and material"). However, perceptual signature lacks character-specific bias—descriptions read generically lyric rather than filtered through a lion tamer's widow's particular way of noticing. Repeated syntactic templates ("She set," "She coaxed," "She placed," "She lifted," "She paused," "She lifted again") flatten rhythm at key beats. No dialogue appears. The voice sustains tone but does not modulate under pressure or reveal distinct internal texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops cluster throughout: "the rain-beaded skylight" / "rain beads slid down the skylight," "each stroke a measured negotiation" / "every loss can be shaped," "loss can be a tool" / "grief...could become a quiet beacon." Template cadence dominates action beats: "She set... She began... She coaxed... She placed... She lifted... She paused... She lifted again" creates monotonous stems across fifteen sentences. Stock metaphors ("steam traced silver veins," "shadows that dance like the memory of a lion's mane") and elevated diction ("marked time that seemed crystallized," "vessel that could contain love") drift into purple without grounding specificity. Figurative density in nearly every sentence of the carving sequence (lines ~7–12) obscures concrete action. Apply −1.2 for pervasive template cadence and loop/scaffold artifacts across the text, including in the closure paragraph.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The widow-carving-grief premise follows a familiar emotional-object transformation template without a sharp particular turn. Circus setting and "crystallized time" alchemy hint at fresh angles but remain ornamental—neither the tamer's professional skill nor the alchemical method constrains a choice or generates friction. The rust-hued loft and kettleboil timeframe add texture but do not transform the emotional arc, which would function identically in any workshop with any timer. The sap-into-amber conceit offers a moment of specificity, yet the ending's thesis statement ("loss can be a tool") flattens the image into a generic lesson.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Lion tamer's widow: Present throughout (setup ✓). The tamer background flavors description ("whip," "roar," "applause") but does not constrain a carving choice (development ✗). She places the finished lantern at closure (payoff minimal cameo). Two gates. The widow role shapes motivation but no on-page decision turns on her specific tamer skills or social position. Her choices (carve, seal sap, place lantern) could belong to any artisan widow. Mid-band: functional role, no irreplaceable causal pressure. −0.4 swappability, −0.3 ornamental tamer references.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Ash wood carving blank: Setup (paragraph 2), development (carving beats mid-story), payoff (finished lantern placed at end). Three gates. Appears in three beats: introduction, carving/sealing, and closure placement. However, "ash wood" specificity never matters—oak or maple would function identically. The blank enables the transformation but does not narrow options or impose resistance (grain "whispering" is decorative). Closure participation is cameo: the lantern glows but the ending emotional turn ("loss can be a tool") is narrated, not shown through the object's properties. +0.9 two beats, +0.5 closure presence, −0.6 swappability, −0.3 static in final use.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Here and gone (core concept): Setup (paragraph 1 "grief is both here and gone, a paradox"). Development: steam and rain beads enact ephemerality mid-story, but no choice hinges on managing the paradox—Mara's method (sealing sap) aims to contain, not balance presence/absence. Payoff (final paragraph restates "the paradox of here and gone could be lived"). The concept frames theme and recurs in images (steam, puddles) but does not alter tactics or force a trade-off. Two gates (setup, payoff summary). Lyric reprise without mid-scene constraint. +0.5 thematic frame, +0.4 closure mention, −0.5 no tactical pressure, −0.4 told at end.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Hauntingly practical (attribute): Introduced mid-story describing the iron gouge ("hauntingly practical... its edge catching light like a tamer's whip"). No setup. The attribute appears once as a descriptor; it does not enable a choice or impose a cost (Mara does not choose between haunting reverence and practical speed). Development ✗, payoff ✗. One gate missing (setup), two missing (development, closure). The gouge itself is used but "hauntingly practical" as a trait constrains nothing. Cap 4.6 for missing setup. −0.8 label-only, −0.5 late, −0.4 ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Contain (action): Setup (motivation "to contain the raw grief" paragraph 1, restated paragraph 8 "realized she could contain"). Development: Mara seals sap under glass (paragraph 9), enacting containment mid-story. Payoff: final image "vessel that could contain love without demanding a roar" (paragraph 13). Three gates. The action shapes two beats (sealing, closure metaphor) and drives the carving's purpose. However, no cost or friction accompanies containment—nothing resists being sealed; no risk of over-containment or loss. The verb itself is generic (could swap "preserve," "hold"). +0.9 two beats, +0.6 closure linkage, −0.5 frictionless execution, −0.4 swappable synonym.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Through crystallized time (method): Setup ✗ (first mentioned paragraph 8, past midpoint). Development: "crystallized time, a process the old circus alchemists once whispered about" (paragraph 8); glass pane + kettle heat harden the sap (paragraph 9). Payoff: the lantern "now a finished piece, its surface smooth yet etched with the invisible lines of time" (paragraph 16). Two gates (development, payoff cameo). Method appears in one beat (sealing) and is summarized at closure. Mechanics are asserted not shown—why heat crystallizes time, how it differs from ordinary drying, remain unexplained. Cap 4.6 for missing setup (introduced ~55% through). −0.7 late arrival, −0.5 summary-only mechanics, −0.3 ornamental at closure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Rain-beaded skylight loft (setting): Setup (title, paragraph 1). Development: window, table, kettle, hearth are used across beats; Mara moves among them. Payoff: "rust-hued peace of the loft would stay with her" and she walks toward the door (paragraph 14). Three gates. The loft houses all action and the skylight's rain beads recur as motif. However, no spatial feature constrains a choice—she could carve anywhere with a kettle. The setting provides atmosphere but does not pressure tactics (no tight quarters, no intrusion, no resource limit). Rust hue charges tone but is not a spatial constraint. +0.8 present across beats, +0.4 closure mention, −0.6 postcard function, −0.3 no tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>While the kettle boils (timeframe): Setup (paragraph 4 "while the kettle boils, the steam traced..."). The kettle sings at paragraph 4, again at paragraph 13 ("The kettle sang its final note"), and is mentioned at closure (paragraph 19 "every kettle boil reminded her"). Three mentions across the text. However, the boil does not tighten decisions—Mara completes the carving without time pressure; no choice is forced by the nearing whistle. The timeframe functions as atmospheric marker, not constraint. Two gates (setup, closure cameo); development ✗. +0.4 setup signal, +0.3 closure cameo, −0.8 no tactical pressure, −0.5 ornamental clock.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>To harvest lessons from loss (motivation): Setup (paragraph 5 "Her motivation was simple yet profound: to harvest lessons from loss"). Development: the carving enacts the harvest; sealing sap = capturing lesson. Payoff: "she felt the lesson settle: loss can be a tool" (paragraph 13), and "grief...could become a quiet beacon" (paragraph 19). Three gates. The motivation drives the entire action and is restated at closure. However, it is told rather than shown in friction—no competing desire (to forget, to rage, to rest) tests the harvest impulse. The lesson arrives without visible cost or renunciation. +0.9 two beats, +0.6 closure tie, −0.6 told-only without friction, −0.4 no trade-off cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Rust-hued peace (tone): Setup (paragraph 1 "rust-hued peace"). Development: "rust-colored lantern" (paragraph 10), "rust hue deepening into a warm amber" (paragraph 12). Payoff: "rust-hued peace of the loft would stay with her" (paragraph 14). Three gates. The tone recurs and modulates (peace → lantern glow → deepening amber), charging the final image with warmth and acceptance. However, the tone remains static across pressure—no sharpening into urgency or cooling into doubt tests the "peace" against Mara's grief. The coherence is strong but single-register. +1.0 three beats, +0.8 closure charge, +0.5 modulation (rust to amber), −0.6 static emotional register, −0.3 descriptor rather than felt shift.</comment>
