<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The "gentle radical" remains an abstract concept rather than an embodied person with contradictory impulses. His interiority consists of label-only feelings ("retrocognitively trapped," "cradle empathy in arms of steel") without concrete embodiment or micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. The protagonist's final realization—"knowing at last that mercy, once aberrant, had become the world's new foundation"—reads as unearned epiphany rather than earned change tied to prior causality. No internal conflict shows contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The story attempts an Accumulative/Textural lens but the closure effect remains abstract. The protagonist kneels, whispers "Hearthsteel," and light cascades—but no visible cost or foreclosed path appears on the page. The final paragraph's "retrocognitively trapped past dissolve" is told rather than shown through a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early, but the causal chain from kneeling to light-release to city transformation lacks dramatized intermediary steps that would make the cost legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The ancient plaza and mosaic stepping stone recur throughout and anchor spatial choreography clearly. However, the setting functions primarily as backdrop rather than constraining choice or altering tactics—the protagonist kneels and traces patterns without environmental resistance or resource limitation. The "warm coldness" and "shattered sky" are repeated often but remain decorative metaphors rather than lived conditions that shape behavior. The mosaic's "chipped patterns" appear in multiple beats but do not impose visible cost or friction on the protagonist's actions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"to cradle empathy in arms of steel"—is declared but never tested by on-page opposition or trade-off. No reversal or tightening occurs; the protagonist kneels, forms a word, whispers it, and light cascades without resistance or visible price. The story summarizes transformation ("the city learned to cradle empathy") rather than dramatizing a single choice that forecloses a live option. Coincidence resolves: the tessera pulses on cue, survivors gather, children play—none shaped by protagonist agency under pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Theme is stated rather than emergent: "compassion could be engineered," "mercy, once aberrant, had become the world's new foundation." The final image offers no non-literal answer; instead it explicitly moralizes ("knowing at last that mercy..."). The "warm coldness" motif recurs but does not shift meaning or charge the closure—it remains a label applied to multiple images without accumulating pressure. No counter-reading is invited; the piece toggles between "warm" and "cold" without genuine complexity or cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited, but the narrative voice defaults to elevated, abstract diction ("retrocognitively trapped," "aberrant mercy," "tapestry of muted dawn") that does not modulate under pressure. The protagonist's interiority consists of thematic declarations rather than character-specific perception. No other character speaks or thinks on the page, so voice distinction is not testable. The prose reads as authorial philosophizing rather than filtered through a singular, lived perspective with perceptual bias.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Heavy pattern artifacts pervade: paraphrase loops ("the mosaic stepping stone" repeated in six paragraphs; "warm coldness" appears seven times with minimal variation), template cadence ("He felt," "He knelt," "He watched"), and stock metaphors ("wounded beacon," "living diagram of hope"). The final third contains synonym churn ("chipped patterns on a mosaic stepping stone" → "chipped fragment" → "chipped stones") and therapy-speak labels ("cradle empathy," "aberrant mercy") in peak beats. Register drifts into abstract philosophizing ("retrocognitively trapped," "Conceptual Repricing") outside the POV's established lexicon. Applying artifact penalties: paraphrase loops −0.6, template cadence −0.4, stock metaphors −0.3, cumulative −1.3 plus final-third artifact cap violation disallows 9+ globally and caps high-band entries at 8.8 per the Patterned-artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>The premise—protagonist renames a plaza post-catastrophe to forge communal healing—closely matches workshop templates for symbolic closure without transformation. "Hearthsteel" as the invented word reads as on-the-nose allegory (warmth + resolve) rather than a non-obvious synthesis. The mosaic, tessera, and "warm coldness" oxymora are present as ornament but do not combine into a fresh angle; the emotional arc (despair → collective hope) is generic and could run unchanged with different proper nouns. No bold risk-taking heightens stakes; the piece retreats to abstraction rather than committing to a single grounded particular.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>The "gentle radical" is named and performs actions (steps, kneels, traces, whispers, walks) but his choices do not create key turns—the tessera pulses automatically after he whispers, and the city's transformation is summarized rather than shown as a result of a decision with visible cost. Present in all three gates but ornamental; label-only trait without causal pressure. Cap 2.8 for missing closure participation (cameo in final image does not count as causally active).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The "minaret mosaic tessera" appears in the opening and "pulses, releasing a cascade of light" at midpoint, then recurs in the final paragraph ("mosaic's light washed over"). Two distinct beats but the tessera's unique properties do not constrain choice—it glimmers, then pulses on cue without dramatized cost or mechanics. Swappable with "ancient artifact" or "sacred stone" with minor edits. All three gates present but functional and replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Aberrant mercy" is named three times and frames the thematic claim but does not shape on-page stakes or tactics. It appears as a label the protagonist "summons" and later as the plaza's attributed quality, yet no scene dramatizes what makes mercy aberrant or how it alters options. Echoed as theme without causal work. Present in setup and closure mention but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>"Retrocognitively trapped" is named twice as a feeling but does not constrain or enable on-page action with visible cost. The protagonist's memories "loop in his mind" and later "dissolve," but no choice or tactic is shown to be altered by this trait. Label-only mention without dramatized tradeoff. Present in setup and closure summary but no middle development.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Rename" is the central action: the protagonist forms "Hearthsteel," whispers it, and the plaza becomes "the renamed Hearthsteel" in multiple subsequent paragraphs. The act of renaming is signaled early, executed at midpoint, and recurs in closure. However, the mechanics are told ("demanded a rename") and the outcome (light cascade, crowd gathering) is summarized rather than shown as causally dependent on this exact action. All three gates, shapes one key turn, but could be replaced with "bless" or "consecrate" with moderate edits. Causal role in one major beat lifts score into 5–6 band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Via the chipped patterns on a mosaic stepping stone" is stated once as the method by which the protagonist "formed the word 'Hearthsteel.'" The patterns are traced in an earlier beat, signaling setup, but the mechanics—how chipped patterns yield a syllable—are not shown. The method shapes one attempt but remains abstract. Two gates (setup, development) with functional but unexplained mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The "ancient plaza beneath a shattered sky" is named in the opening and recurs in the final third as the transformation site. It provides spatial coherence but does not pressure choices—crowds gather, children play, stonecarvers work, all without environmental friction or resource constraint. Postcard description rather than micro-setting that alters tactics. Two gates (setup, closure mention) but ornamental use.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"After the great fire" is the timeframe anchor in the opening line and recurs twice ("after the great fire," "warm coldness that lingered after the great fire"). The past event frames mood but does not tighten present decisions or impose a live clock—the protagonist's actions proceed without temporal pressure. Present in setup and thematic closure echo but no middle tightening. Cap 4.6 for missing middle development; subtracting ornamental use −0.3 and summary-only −0.3 yields 3.7 after rounding down.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>"To cradle empathy in arms of steel" is named as the protagonist's mission in the opening quarter and recurs in the final paragraph as what "the city learned." The desire is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choices—no on-page friction between the goal and a competing want or cost. Theme claim without on-page enactment. Present in setup and closure summary but no middle choice showing friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Warm coldness" appears seven times across the text, modulating from "strange warm coldness settled" to "warm coldness of the new dawn" to "warm coldness of a sunrise that had never fully arrived." The tone is coherent and recurs in the final image, charging it with the established oxymora. However, the phrase is applied as a label rather than shown through contradictory sensory detail or behavior. All three gates with charged reprise, lifting into 5–6 band, but static repetition without deepening and label-only application limit score. Lyric reprise qualifies for ~5.5–6.3 when return reweights stake; here the return is present but does not demonstrably reweight with new cost.</comment>
