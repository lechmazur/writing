<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to learn the language of old buildings remains abstract and told rather than dramatized through choices under pressure. Internal contradiction is absent—the narrator moves smoothly from curiosity to "clarity" without competing impulses acting simultaneously. The tutor Liora functions as a guide-figure rather than applying immediate pressure relevant to conflict. The final "feeling both humbled and newly fluent" reads as unearned epiphany, not supported by visible struggle or cost on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive promptly, but the closure unit lacks a decisive change or visible cost. The story presents a series of agreements and lessons without a narrowing of options or meaningful transformation—the protagonist simply continues to attend lessons. The ending offers summary ("each lie a bridge") rather than an on-page moment where cost is legible. Under an inferred Causal lens, the because/therefore linkage dissolves into "and then" sequencing after the initial meeting is arranged.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The rooftop garden and meteor shower are vividly rendered with sensory detail ("rusted iron rail," "mossy stone bench," "intermittent strobe of meteors"). However, setting functions largely as atmospheric backdrop rather than constraining choice—the protagonist could hold this conversation in any location without altering tactics or outcomes. The borrowed sugar and neighbor's hummingbird feeder add texture but do not pressure the central conflict.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake (learning the language of buildings) is signaled but never faces a concrete on-page test that narrows options. No reversal or tightening occurs—the tutor agrees to teach, sugar is borrowed without friction, and weekly sessions are arranged without obstacle. The "agreed upon lies" premise suggests potential tension but is neutralized immediately as both parties accept the deception. The resolution arrives through conversation and agreement rather than protagonist agency under pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The theme of translation and communication with inanimate structures is declared overtly rather than emerging from particulars: "to learn the language of old buildings...to hear the heartbeats of forgotten walls." The antique seal and meteor shower recur but function as decorative motifs rather than reweighting prior material. The final paragraph delivers explicit thematic summary ("each agreed upon lie a bridge") instead of trusting image and action to carry meaning.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The prose carries a consistent elevated register ("patiently nimble grace," "conspiratorial") that suits the mysterious tone but occasionally drifts into purple territory ("fleeting hymn," "stitch the night's fleeting light into the brick's silent grammar"). POV remains stable first-person without head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present but could be more character-specific—the observations tend toward poetic universality rather than revealing this particular narrator's biases and blind spots.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Multiple paraphrase loops appear: the "agreed upon lies" concept is restated at least four times without adding pressure or detail. Template cadence runs through the final third with parallel "each [X]" constructions that mechanically cycle without propulsion. The figurative language clusters densely in high-pressure moments ("meteor-lit night would be a lesson, each borrowed spoon of sugar a promise") without pattern-teaching, reducing clarity. Information density is low—many sentences restate the meeting's atmosphere without advancing situation or choice.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The premise of learning a "dead language" to communicate with buildings offers a poetic angle, but the execution relies on familiar mentor-student and mystical-tutor tropes without transformation. The meteor shower as backdrop and the borrowed-sugar motif feel like checklist ornament rather than organic synthesis. The "agreed upon lies" concept promises moral complexity but is defanged immediately, both parties comfortable with the arrangement. No bold risk-taking or unexpected turn distinguishes the material from similar atmospheric pieces about arcane knowledge.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Liora the dead-language tutor is present and described but makes no choice that creates a turn—she offers information and agrees to teach without conflict or cost. Her attribute "patiently nimble" is mentioned but does not constrain or enable action.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The antique desk seal appears in three beats: placed on the table, traced while explaining, and touched at closure. However, its function remains symbolic and expository—it does not constrain choice or alter tactics. The sigil's meaning is told rather than dramatized, and removing it would not break story logic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Agreed upon lies" is stated explicitly multiple times and frames the initial meeting, but it does not shape on-page stakes or tactics—both parties accept the premise without friction or cost. The concept functions as thematic echo rather than a constraint that narrows options.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.2</grade><comment>"Patiently nimble" is applied twice to Liora's movement but remains label-only description. No on-page action demonstrates a tradeoff or cost tied to this specific combination of patience and nimbleness.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The narrator arrives to "interrogate" Liora about the seal's origin, but the interrogation dissolves into cooperative conversation without pressure. The action is mentioned but not dramatized as a source of conflict or turn; it could be replaced with "ask" or "discuss" with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Borrowing sugar that turns into weekly tea sessions" structures the middle and ending. The borrowing beat is dramatized (neighbor, spoonful, smile), and the weekly ritual is established as closure. However, the method does not face resistance or constrain attempts—it enables connection without friction. Present in setup, middle, and payoff, it reaches the low 5s for shaping the frame but not driving a turn.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The rooftop garden during a meteor shower is vividly described and anchors the entire scene. However, it functions as atmospheric container rather than pressuring choices—the conversation and agreements could unfold in any location without altering outcome. The meteor shower provides visual punctuation but does not constrain tactics or supply resources that affect the stake.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>N/A</grade>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"To learn the language of old buildings" is stated as the protagonist's goal and recurs through the piece. It is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choices—the narrator achieves the goal through willing cooperation without cost or friction. The motivation frames the quest but does not generate on-page struggle.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Mysterious familiarity" is maintained through diction ("soft cadence," "whisper that felt both foreign and intimate") and the premise that walls teach their stories. The tone is coherent across beats and charges the final image with the tutor's murmur "stitching" light into grammar. However, it remains a single static layer without modulation under pressure.</comment>
