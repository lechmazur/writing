<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to preserve the orchard is stated but never tested by genuine conflict or contradiction. Her actions—probe, lift, secure, release—read as smooth procedural steps without embodied emotion or micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values under pressure. The "realization" in paragraph 17 arrives as summary rather than dramatized discovery with cost. Internal experience remains at the surface; no contradictory impulses complicate her path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece accumulates sensory detail and thematic motifs toward a final release-and-renewal image. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first 120 words. Closure reads as Conceptual Repricing—the broken tip dissolves into particles promising "endless cycles"—but the cost is abstract and off-page (future promise rather than present forfeiture). One meaningful deepening occurs when the tip's resonance accelerates growth, yet Mira's choice to release it carries no visible sacrifice or foreclosed path on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The floating rock arches, inverted rivers, and phosphorescent leaves create vivid, purpose-driven atmosphere that supports the accumulative lens. The inverted-gravity hour constrains Mira's flight path and enables the discovery beat. The broken arrow tip—handled twice (brush/lift, then release into basin)—functions as micro-setting object that charges the final image. Sensory selection (glint, hum, chime, glow) reflects urgency and filters through Mira's professional focus. Minor: some details (translucent coral, kelp metaphor) lean ornamental but remain tonally coherent.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—find the source of resilience—is signaled early but never jeopardized on the page. No reversal or tightening choice narrows Mira's options; the probe touch immediately yields the arrow tip without complication. The discovery accelerates plant growth instantly (paragraph 13), but no visible cost or trade-off accompanies the choice to release the tip. Escalation under the Accumulative lens requires density increase or cadence shift that reweights the stake; here the final dissolution reads as thematic promise rather than a pressure point with felt consequence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Theme—resilience as listening to echoes, a cultural memory—emerges from the motif of gathering echoes and the planet's cyclical inversions. The final image (tip dissolving into soil, promising endless cycles) offers resonance without overt moral. However, paragraph 17's summary ("the source of resilience was not merely the tip but the ancient practice...") borders on thematic echo, stating rather than embodying the insight. The whirling silence recurs effectively, shifting from threat to purposeful rhythm, and the closing line reweights Mira's role without didacticism.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Narrative distance is consistent and appropriately modest for a pilot's procedural focus. Diction ("verdant canopy," "slender wand tipped with a shard of obsidian," "kelp," "emerald fire") occasionally drifts toward elevated register during high-pressure beats (discovery, acceleration) rather than simplifying under stress. Perceptual signature is professional but not deeply character-particular; sensory selection reflects mission focus without idiosyncratic bias. No dialogue present. Psychic distance shifts are minimal and intentional.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Sentence openings vary adequately; rhythm modulates between longer descriptive passages and shorter action beats. Minor loop: paragraphs 8 and 9 both open with "Below" and "She lowered" / "As the probe," creating slight redundancy. Figurative density is high ("like translucent coral," "like kelp," "like quiet balloons," "like emerald fire") across multiple beats without pattern-teaching or payoff tied to closure. Register occasionally elevates ("the whirling silence," "verdant canopy," "phosphorescence") in proximity to simple action verbs. Information density is moderate; some sentences do double duty (setting + mood) but others lean ornamental. No major artifacts touch the closure beat, limiting severity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The premise—inverted-gravity orchard planet with echo-guided navigation and a star-metal growth catalyst—combines multiple speculative elements that feel assembled rather than synthesized from a singular vision. The emotional arc (curiosity → discovery → release) follows a template quest structure without fresh inflection; removing the orchard-planet skin would leave a standard retrieve-and-return plot intact. The "gathering of echoes" and "whirling silence" offer lyric texture but remain decorative motifs rather than constraints that shape choice. The broken arrow tip as catalyst is functional but not irreplaceable (any ancient artifact could serve). Transformation test: fails; the core moves and resolution work unchanged with different proper nouns.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Mira is present across all beats and her professional role (pilot navigating inverted gravity) enables access to the discovery site. However, her choices do not create key turns: she follows the river, lowers the probe, lifts the tip, and releases it—each a smooth procedural step without dilemma or visible cost. The decision to release the tip (paragraph 19) lacks friction or trade-off on the page. Setup present early; middle beats show observation and retrieval rather than decision under pressure; closure involves her action but not a choice that alters tactics or forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The broken arrow tip is handled or described across four distinct beats: discovery (paragraph 11), lift and hum (12), observation of acceleration effect (13), and release into basin with dissolution (19–20). Each touch advances plot and reweights meaning: from hidden relic → active catalyst → renewal seed. The tip's properties (star-metal, moonlight acceleration, resonance with echoes) are specific and irreplaceable. Closure hinges on its dissolution into soil, promising future cycles. Early signal (paragraph 5 legend), middle causal work (enables growth acceleration), and closure transformation satisfy all three gates with strong specificity.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The "gathering of echoes" is mentioned in the opening mission statement (paragraph 4), reappears when the tip's hum "merged with the gathering of echoes" (paragraph 12), and is referenced in paragraph 17's thematic summary. However, the concept does not constrain or enable on-page choices; Mira does not navigate by listening to echoes or adjust tactics based on their presence. The echoes function as thematic flavor rather than mechanical pressure. Setup present; middle mention is ornamental; closure involvement is summary-only. Swappable with "ancient resonance" or similar.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The "accelerates plant growth" attribute is described in the opening legend (paragraph 5: "possessed an attribute that accelerates plant growth when touched by moonlight"), dramatized when the tip's hum triggers instant growth (paragraph 13: "vines spiraling upward at double speed," "blossoms burst open in seconds"), and implied at closure when the dissolved particles promise "endless cycles of growth" (paragraph 20). The attribute enables the discovery's significance and provides the conceptual payoff. However, no visible cost or trade-off accompanies the acceleration; Mira does not sacrifice moonlight timing or face a constraint tied to the trait. Setup early, middle demonstration with causal effect, closure promise. One small friction: the moonlight condition mentioned in setup is not invoked on the page during the acceleration beat.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The action "discover" drives the central plot beat: Mira's probe brushes the branch (paragraph 10), a chime rings (10), the metallic glint reveals the tip (11), and lifting it triggers the growth acceleration (12–13). This discovery redefines her understanding of the planet's resilience mechanism (paragraph 15) and motivates the release-into-basin closure (19). Setup frames the mission (find the source), middle beat enacts the discovery with immediate consequence, and closure depends on what was discovered. The action is not easily swappable; without the discovery, the plot collapses. Minor: the discovery arrives without complication or false lead, reducing tension.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Navigating by water flow is named in the opening (paragraph 2: "trusted the ancient method of navigating by water flow") and reappears at closure when Mira "align[s] her descent with the river's descending flow" (paragraph 17). However, the method's mechanics are never tested or constrained on the page; Mira does not choose between water-flow navigation and another method, nor does the inverted river (paragraph 7) create a dilemma that forces tactical adjustment. The method functions as atmospheric detail rather than shaping attempts. Setup present, middle development absent, closure reprise is ornamental. Swappable with "following magnetic lines" or similar.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The orchard planet with floating rock arches appears in every paragraph, anchoring all action. The inverted gravity (paragraph 3) constrains Mira's flight path and enables access to dangling roots. The arches supply navigation landmarks ("glint of water on the stone arches," paragraph 7; "Returning to the floating rock arches," paragraph 19). The basin within an arch serves as the release site for closure. Setup immediate, middle beats use arches for spatial choreography and the inverted-hour constraint tightens timing, closure depends on the basin location. The setting pressures choices (timing, access) and supplies the resource (basin) that completes the renewal cycle. Strong across all three gates.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The sixty-minute gravity inversion is introduced early (paragraph 3) and bracketed at closure ("As the hour waned and gravity settled," paragraph 20). However, the timeframe is never tracked or dramatized as a live constraint; Mira does not race the clock, and no choice is tightened by the hour's limit. The inversion enables the visual of dangling roots and floating fruit (atmospheric payoff) but does not force a tactical trade-off. Setup present, middle pressure absent, closure marks the hour's end without consequence for delay. The timeframe shapes setting more than decision.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The motivation "to find the source of resilience" is stated in the opening mission brief (paragraph 4) and restated in Mira's realization (paragraph 17: "the source of resilience was not merely the tip..."). The desire drives the discovery action (paragraphs 9–13) and the release-into-basin choice at closure (19). However, the motivation is never dramatized in conflict; Mira does not weigh competing wants or face friction between the mission and a personal cost. Setup clear, middle enactment via probe and discovery, closure completes the stated goal. No visible trade-off or want-versus-need tension on the page; the motivation is fulfilled smoothly without dramatized friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The phrase "whirling silence" recurs four times (paragraphs 6, 16, 21) and modulates from "filled the air, a soundless vortex that seemed to pulse" (6) to "seemed less empty and more purposeful" (16) to "reminded her that resilience was a rhythm she could now hear" (21). This progression charges the final image by reweighting silence from threat to harmony. The tone is coherent across turns and supports the Accumulative lens. However, "whirling silence" remains a lyric phrase rather than a texture that modulates sentence rhythm or diction under pressure; the prose does not enact silence or stillness in cadence. Setup early, middle reflection reweights meaning, closure reprise completes the arc. Strong thematic integration; modest tonal modulation in prose texture.</comment>
