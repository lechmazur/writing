<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The alchemist remains abstract throughout—no embodied contradictions, no visceral struggle under pressure. Interiority consists of generic philosophical poses ("quiet pride," "heart light, mind full") rather than character-particular tension. The final "deserted alchemist" label is repeated without exploring what desertedness costs him in the moment of choice. Motivation is declared but never tested by a competing desire or visible tradeoff.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>No legible closure: the ghost town "revival" occurs entirely through mental construction with no on-page cost, reversal, or foreclosed path. The amber bottle "opens" twice (first releasing a sigh, then "fully") without dramatic consequence or changed options. The ending loops through summary ("the cycle of revival began anew") rather than landing a decisive image. Orientation is delayed—who, where, and concrete situation remain hazy past the opening third; apply −0.4 for orientation debt and cap Q3 at 7.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Paper-lantern cove supplies atmospheric sketch but never constrains a choice or complicates action. The ghost town's "cracked cobblestones" and "boarded windows" are catalog items that do not evolve or press tactics. The amber bottle's physical properties (sealed, humming, no opening) are contradicted when it releases a sigh and later dissolves its cork without dramatized effort. Spatial choreography is vague—alchemist stands on rocks, then "turned away," with no legible movement between.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>No escalation under any lens: the alchemist conceives a plan, executes it mentally, and succeeds without obstacle, adaptation, or cost. Stakes are declared ("revival," "reimagine an entire civilization") but never tested—no resource limit, no failure forcing adjustment, no competing claim. The "rejection of false comfort" is told twice but never dramatized as a live choice with a visible price. The final image recycles the opening lantern motif without deepening pressure or narrowing options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Theme is stated rather than earned: "comfort lies in truth," "imagination can still forge new beginnings," "memory as catalyst" appear as abstract claims disconnected from scene pressure. The amber bottle, paper lanterns, and memory motifs recur without shifting meaning or constraining choice. The ending moralizes ("civilizations are not built on stone alone, but on the fragile glass of remembered desire") instead of offering a resonant image. No coherent question is posed or reweighted by the closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Voice is uniform elevated-register throughout, with no modulation under pressure: "bruised sky," "amber of a promise never fulfilled," "constellations," "fragile glass of remembered desire." Diction remains abstract and decorative even at putative climax. The alchemist's perceptual signature is generic poetic observer—no character-specific bias in what he notices or how he processes. No dialogue to judge. Psychic distance is stable but generic.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Pervasive paraphrase loops and synonym churn: "deserted" appears four times, "ghost town" eight times, "paper lantern" / "lantern" nine times, "memory" / "recollection" / "recalled" thirteen times, often in adjacent lines without added pressure. Template cadence dominates: "He rejected," "He conceived," "He imagined," "He let," "He watched." Stock metaphors pile up: "skeleton of boarded windows," "sealed its fate in amber," "streets lit up like constellations." Register drifts into corporate abstraction ("working memory," "blueprint," "method") without POV anchor. Filter-verb stacks ("seemed to whisper," "began to pulse," "felt a quiet pride") dull immediacy in key beats. Apply −1.4 for artifact spread and disallow 9+ globally; final-third artifact presence caps high-band entries at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Core premise—magical restoration of a ghost town through mental effort—is a familiar template without specific transformation. The "working memory" mechanism is label-only and functions as arbitrary magic. Emotional arc and plot could swap "alchemist" for "wizard," "memory" for "willpower," "cove" for "hill" with no structural change. No on-page surprise or turn that reframes prior material. The piece reads as a prompt-response mosaic rather than a singular artistic vision.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>Deserted alchemist is present throughout but makes no on-page choice that alters tactics or narrows options. His "decision" to use working memory is told in summary; the "rejection of false comfort" is claimed twice without dramatized cost. All three gates nominally present (setup, middle label, ending label) but the character remains passive observer of his own mental theater. Swappable with "solitary mage" or "lone scholar." Late −0.3, ornamental −0.7, swappability −0.6.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Amber bottle appears in three beats: carried in satchel (para 4), opened with a question releasing a sigh (para 9), fully opened dissolving cork (para 17). However, its "no opening" property is contradicted without dramatized effort or cost—it simply responds when probed. The bottle does not constrain a choice or shape tactics; it is a passive prop that releases content on cue. Setup present, middle functional, closure cameo only. Mid-development cap 3.4 +0.4 beat involvement +0.3 specificity −0.5 ornamental second mention −0.6 contradiction of stated property.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Ghost town revival is the stated goal, frames all action, and is "achieved" in the ending image (lanterns above reconstructed roofs). However, the revival occurs entirely in mental space without on-page obstacle, cost, or reversal—no competing claim tests it, no failure forces adaptation. It shapes the dominant stake but never narrows options. All three gates present, one dominant beat (mental reconstruction para 12–18), closure participation via summary image. Setup +0.5, beat +0.4, closure linkage +0.8, but summary-only execution −0.7, no causal pressure −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Rejects false comfort is mentioned twice (para 5, para 21) as a character label but never dramatized. No on-page moment where the alchemist faces a tempting shortcut and chooses the harder path with visible cost. The "insistence that true revival must be earned by remembering" (para 15) is narrated philosophy, not a pressured choice. Setup vague, no middle action, closure thematic echo only. Label-only −0.6, summary-only −0.6, late payoff mention −0.3, cap at 4.6 for missing middle development, then apply friction.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Conceive appears once (para 6: "he conceived a plan") and drives the mental-construction sequence that follows. However, the conception itself is summary; no on-page deliberation, competing options, or cost accompanies it. The subsequent "revival" is execution of the conceived plan without adaptation or surprise. Setup present, shapes middle action indirectly, closure follows from it. One beat +0.4, causal link weak +0.3, swappable with "devised" or "imagined" −0.5, summary-only −0.5, cap 4.6 for missing true development.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>Through working memory appears as label (para 6) and is reiterated thematically (para 21: "method of working memory proved"). The mechanism is never shown—no dramatized act of recall with cost, no failure when memory falters, no constraint on what can be remembered. It functions as arbitrary magic rather than a dramatized method. Setup label only, no middle constraint, closure thematic claim. Ornamental −0.8, label-only −0.6, summary payoff −0.5, cap 3.4 for missing development.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Paper-lantern cove is the opening location, mentioned nine times, and provides the final image (lanterns above roofs). However, it never constrains movement, supplies a resource under pressure, or complicates action—it is atmospheric backdrop. The jagged rocks are static description; the cove's lanterns "bob gently" and "flicker" without affecting choice. Setup present, middle static, closure visual cameo. Setup +0.5, closure image +0.7, but ornamental throughout −0.8, no causal pressure −0.7, cap 4.6 then apply.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>After the last wish is granted is setup context (para 3: "since the last wish was granted, a wish that sealed its fate") and echoed at closure (para 24: "even after the last wish is granted, imagination can still forge new beginnings"). However, it imposes no temporal urgency, no ticking constraint, no tactical pressure. It is backstory flavor rather than a live clock. Setup present, no middle pressure, closure thematic echo. Setup +0.4, closure mention +0.3, but no tactical effect −0.8, ornamental −0.6, cap 4.6 then apply.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>To reimagine an entire civilization is stated as goal (para 20: "reimagined an entire civilization") and implicit throughout the mental-reconstruction sequence. However, the motivation is never conflicted—no cost is weighed, no competing desire tested, no moment of doubt. It drives the action in summary but is not dramatized under pressure. Setup implicit, middle action follows it, closure claims success. One beat +0.4, causal driver weak +0.4, but told-only −0.7, no friction −0.6, cap 4.6 then apply.</comment>
