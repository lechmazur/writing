<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivations are declared rather than dramatized: the childhood sailor mission and the "pane of hush" quest remain abstract without concrete stakes testing her commitment. Interiority relies heavily on poetic labels ("bruised awe," "coil around her heart") instead of embodied contradiction. The broken puppet head acts as symbolic cargo without forcing a meaningful trade-off or choice that reveals her values under pressure. No internal conflict manifests in competing impulses—her path is linear exposition dressed in lyric language.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed: who Elara is and why she's summoned emerges through poetic assertion rather than grounded anchors by ~120 words, triggering the Orientation Test penalty. Causality is largely absent—gears respond "as if acknowledging," the pane "materializes," and the lullaby succeeds without resistance or cost-bearing choice on Elara's part. The ending offers a Resonant Reconfiguration in image form, but no on-page decisive change or felt cost accompanies it; the lighthouse simply "stood as a keeper of peace" without Elara forfeiting or altering anything tangible. The piece reads as Accumulative/Textural in intent, yet the final image restates the premise rather than reweighting it through prior pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The lighthouse setting is vividly rendered ("scarred thumb," "stone ribs," "nested patterns of wind") and anchors the atmosphere. However, it functions as backdrop rather than constraint: Elara's actions are unimpeded by the environment, and the dial, pane, and gears respond cooperatively without spatial friction. The broken puppet head and brass dial charge the final image, meeting the micro-setting allowance, but the cliff, sea, and interior architecture remain decorative.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—pausing the doomsday clock through the lullaby—is signaled early but never tested. No reversal or tightening occurs; Elara places the puppet head, turns the dial, whispers, and the world pauses without obstacle or price. The "hush" arrives passively ("materialized"), and the lullaby "seeped" without resistance. Under an Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening or cadence shift that narrows options is required; here, each beat restates the mission without escalation or felt cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Theme of beauty-in-brokenness is stated overtly ("understanding that beauty lay in being beautifully flawed") rather than emerging from Elara's choices or the puppet's function. The lullaby as "pattern of ticking and silence" and "nested patterns" gesture at complexity, but the piece relies on thematic echo and label rather than dramatized friction. The final image of the lighthouse as "keeper of peace" offers resonance, yet it arrives without prior particulars that would reweight the premise with undeniable cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Voice is consistent and lyric, with purposeful compression ("breath a thin thread of frost," "scarred thumb") that suits the tone. However, register occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("vouchsafe a moment of stillness," "marrow of the sea") that feels imposed rather than character-particular. Psychic distance remains stable, and the prose teaches its patterned diction early. Elara's perceptual signature—focused on symbolic resonance—is coherent but lacks the idiosyncratic bias that would distinguish her worldview under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Overwriting is pervasive: figurative language appears in nearly every sentence without pattern payoff ("thin thread of frost," "bruised awe," "quiet river of silver light," "tapestry of sound"), triggering density and coherence penalties. Several mixed metaphors ("stone ribs bruised awe," "coil around her heart... scorched her nerves") violate physical logic. Template cadence runs appear in the middle third ("She began to turn... With each revolution... The humming resonated..."). Paraphrase loops cluster around the lullaby's effect (lines 24–26 restate seepage without added pressure). Combined artifacts and register drift in peak beats accumulate to −1.4, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The premise—mystical clock adjuster at a lighthouse—follows a familiar template (lone protagonist, symbolic quest, passive resolution through ritual). The "pane of hush" and "lullaby across a thousand lifetimes" remain abstract rather than transformed through specific, non-obvious mechanics or moral calculus. The broken puppet head offers a fresh image, but its role as passive talisman does not synthesize the elements into an inevitable outcome. No bold risk heightens stakes; the story chooses safety in lyric decoration over causal or emotional specificity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her occupation is named, but her choices do not create turns—she executes a predetermined ritual (place puppet, turn dial, whisper) without obstacle or adaptation. Observation and execution without decision.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The broken puppet head appears early (rescue from shipwreck), is placed on the dial (middle beat), and glows at closure. However, its cracked grin and glass eye function as symbolic description rather than constraint or enabler; Elara does not handle it tactically or pay a cost for using it. Lyric reprise with closure linkage, but no causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The "pane of hush" materializes passively in the middle third and is mentioned at closure, but it does not shape Elara's tactics or narrow her options. It functions as a thematic label rather than a rule that alters choices. Present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Beautifully flawed" is stated outright in the final third ("understanding that beauty lay in being beautifully flawed") as theme rather than dramatized trait. The puppet's cracks and Elara's own "cracks mending" are described without visible tradeoff or cost-bearing action. Label-only.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>2.7</grade><comment>"Vouchsafe" appears once in line 7 ("hoping the device would vouchsafe a moment of stillness") and again in line 19 ("vouchsafing the lullaby"). It names an outcome rather than an action Elara performs with mechanics or cost. Swappable with "grant" or "bestow."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Nested patterns" is signaled early (line 4: "nested patterns of wind and echo"; line 13: "nested patterns of the clock's mechanisms") and mentioned at closure (line 25: "nested echoes"). The method is present across beats, but its mechanics do not constrain Elara's attempts—she turns the dial and the patterns simply work. Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The hidden lighthouse at dusk anchors the entire scene, providing the dial, gears, pane, and lantern that Elara uses. Its "stone ribs" and "great brass dial" are tactile, and the setting charges the final image ("lighthouse... stood as a keeper of peace"). However, the environment does not pressure or limit her actions; it cooperates fully. Essential to the frame but not to choice-making.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"Time's final ripple" is mentioned in lines 11, 18, and 22 as a poetic framing device but does not create urgency or narrow Elara's window. No ticking clock or countdown alters her tactics. Thematic rather than functional.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The lullaby motivation is seeded early (line 12: "mission... to whisper a lullaby") and drives Elara's actions (turning the dial, whispering into the hush). However, no friction between this want and competing costs appears—she desires it, executes it, and succeeds without sacrifice. Functional role in one major beat but no conflicted choice.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Bruised awe" is named three times (lines 3, 10, 17, 29) and modulates from the lighthouse's initial state to Elara's internal experience to the sea's echo and her final departure. Tone remains coherent and charges the ending image. However, it is asserted rather than dramatically enacted through Elara's contradictory reactions under pressure. Purposeful reprise with closure linkage but static application.</comment>
