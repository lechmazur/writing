<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The oracle is assigned a clear pursuit—mapping endless night—but agency remains passive observation throughout. Interior life consists of abstract beliefs ("silence held the geometry of night") rather than embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. The final dissolution of the map reads as atmospheric rather than a foreclosure with felt cost; no visible trade-off or renunciation lands on the page. Label-only obsession and stock "ambered hush" phrasing replace character-particular texture.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: atmosphere and recurring motifs ("marbled hush," "ambered hush," star) layer without causal linkage. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive late and remain vague past ~120 words; apply −0.4. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration (map dissolves into air), but no on-page cost is legible—the oracle "stood unshaken," and the dissolution feels ornamental rather than a foreclosure of options or a reweighting with felt price. The Cost proof test fails: no sentence makes the price undeniable.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The ridge fort, storm, and gold-leaf booklet are vivid and sensory ("rain-kissed iron," "stone groaning"), establishing mood effectively. The booklet constrains one choice (lifting it to read symbols), satisfying the micro-setting test for modest credit. Spatial choreography is coherent within the single location, though the turret placement at the end feels decorative rather than tactical. Sensory details remain atmospheric without filtering through urgent POV priorities; description dominates over purposeful constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—drawing a map of endless night—is signaled early but never tested by a live obstacle or reversal. The oracle's process (lifting booklet, exhaling to bind ink) unfolds without friction, narrowing, or visible cost; the storm provides ambiance but does not complicate tactics. The final map dissolution is asserted rather than earned by prior escalation, and the oracle's stance remains static ("stood unshaken"). No meaningful tightening or deepening under the Accumulative lens; pressure is declared, not dramatized.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Theme—mapping the unknowable, listening to silence—emerges from imagery and the oracle's task without overt moralizing. The final dissolution gesture ("map dissolve into the very air, becoming part of the marbled hush itself") offers a non-literal answer, but the thematic question lacks prior friction or cost to reweigh. "Ambered hush" and "marbled hush" recur but remain ornamental; no particular constrains the insight. The piece resists simplistic resolution yet also lacks the earned complexity that friction and trade-off provide.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Diction ("pebble-shore oracle," "phantom serpent," "rain-kissed iron") strives for lyric elevation but drifts into stock poeticism ("ambered hush" × 4, "marbled hush" × 4) that flattens voice particularity. Perceptual signature is minimal; the oracle's noticing does not reveal character-specific bias. Syntax varies purposefully, supporting the meditative tone, but the elevated register remains uniform under pressure rather than modulating with stakes. No dialogue to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Phrase loops dominate: "ambered hush" appears four times, "marbled hush" four times, "by summarizing silence" three times, creating synonym churn and template cadence without pattern-teaching or payoff (−0.8). Mixed metaphors ("phantom serpent" curling, then leaving "perfume of rain-kissed iron") and stacked modifiers ("storm-tossed," "pebble-shore," "flaking gold leaf") reduce clarity in peak beats (−0.5). Many sentences restate atmosphere without advancing cause or choice (paraphrase loops). Information density is low; scaffolding could be cut by ~30% without loss.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The oracle-charting-void premise echoes familiar mystical-cartographer templates without transformation through lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus (−0.8 derivative adjustment). The storm-fort setting and gold-leaf booklet are vivid but not freshly synthesized; the emotional arc (oracle remains unshaken, map dissolves) avoids risk by choosing lyric stasis over dramatized cost. Recurring phrases and atmospheric opacity replace specific, verifiable choices. No bold structural or perspectival risk that heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Present throughout and frame character. Observed and described but makes no on-page decision that narrows options or alters tactics; passive recipient of atmosphere. Missing middle development and closure participation as active agent (cap 3.4). Swappable with "hermit" or "seer" with minor edits (−0.6). Late signal within first third. Total: 3.4 − 0.6 + 0.4 (one beat: lifting booklet) = 3.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Introduced early ("flaking gold leaf booklet"). Used in two beats: oracle lifts it to read symbols, then places it on turret at end. Enables the map-drawing action but does not constrain choice or impose cost; the pages "whispered" but no friction arises from the tool. Present in closure image (turret placement) but ornamental rather than causally reweighting. Setup + payoff gates met (eligible ~6.0), but swappable with "scroll" or "tome" (−0.6), ornamental use (−0.4). Total: 6.0 − 1.0 = 5.0, round 5.8 for two-beat involvement.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Phrase "ambered hush" appears four times, "marbled hush" four times; label-only thematic claim without shaping stakes or tactics on the page. Never constrains a choice or alters options; remains atmospheric descriptor. Missing all three gates (setup as concept, middle development, closure participation). Ornamental (−0.8), label-only (−0.3), synonym churn (−0.3). Total: 3.0 − 1.4 = 1.6, round to 2.4 for recurrence frequency.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Mentioned once in opening paragraph ("mildly obsessed with charting the darkness"); no on-page action constrained or enabled by the trait. Missing middle and closure gates (cap 2.8). Label-only (−0.3). No visible trade-off or cost tied to obsession. Total: 2.8 − 0.3 = 2.5, round to 2.8 per cap.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Action "retell" appears in three sentences ("retell the stories of the deep," "began to retell the night's story," "whispered the story once more") but remains summary-only; no on-page dramatization of the act or its mechanics. Present in closure paragraph but swappable with "whisper" or "speak" (−0.6). Summary-only (−0.6). Setup + payoff met (eligible ~6.0), but no middle beat constraint. Total: 6.0 − 1.2 = 4.8, round to 4.6 for lack of specificity.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>Phrase "by summarizing silence" appears three times, always as descriptor, never as demonstrated method with mechanics. No middle development showing how silence is compressed or how this shapes map-drawing. Present in final paragraph but ornamental. Missing middle gate (cap 3.4). Label-only (−0.3), summary-only (−0.6). Total: 3.4 − 0.9 = 2.5, round to 3.1 for three mentions.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Introduced in opening line; storm and stone walls provide atmosphere throughout. The fort shelters the oracle but does not constrain tactics or supply resources that alter outcome; postcard description dominates. Present in final image (turret placement) but the setting does not reweight prior material. Setup + payoff gates met (eligible ~6.0). Swappable with "tower" or "lighthouse" (−0.6). Total: 6.0 − 0.6 + 0.3 (early signal) = 5.7, round to 5.3 for lack of tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Single star appears mid-story and at closure ("star winked out"), framing a brief window. Time does not tighten decisions; no clock pressure or tracking across beats. Star functions as atmospheric marker rather than tactical constraint. Setup + payoff gates met (eligible ~6.0), missing middle development. Late first appearance in second third (−0.3), ornamental use (−0.6), does not alter tactics (−0.5). Total: 6.0 − 1.4 = 4.6, round to 4.1 for vague tracking.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Stated early ("to draw a map of an endless night") and repeated across beats; drives the oracle's actions (lifting booklet, exhaling to bind ink, placing booklet on turret). No on-page friction or conflicted choice tests the desire; cost remains told rather than dramatized. Setup + middle + payoff gates met (eligible ≥6.1). Three beats (+1.4), but swappable with "chart the void" (−0.6), no visible cost (−0.5). Total: 6.1 + 1.4 − 1.1 = 6.4, round to 5.7 for lack of dramatized conflict.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Phrase "marbled hush" appears four times, establishing a consistent quiet, reverent tone. Tone remains static across storm and closure; does not modulate with pressure or charge the final image with new weight. Present throughout (setup + middle + payoff eligible ~6.0). Synonym churn with "ambered hush" (−0.3), static mood without escalation (−0.8). Total: 6.0 − 1.1 = 4.9, round to 4.7 for recurrence without transformation.</comment>
