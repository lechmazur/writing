<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The poet's interiority reads as abstract philosophical musing rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. Motivation remains declarative ("furiously tranquil," "vigil in pause") without grounding in micro-choices that reveal competing impulses. The "cartography of scars" operates as thematic vocabulary rather than a dramatized need with visible cost. No secondary character pressure; the poet performs his ritual unopposed, flattening stakes into contemplative tableau.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation Test: who and where anchor early, but "when masks slip" remains abstract; the dusk claim never pressures a specific choice (−0.4). Closure unit ambiguous: the timer completes, the envelope opens, fragments glow, but no decisive change, earned refusal, or conceptual repricing with felt cost emerges—only poetic assertion that "the cartography of scars was not a wound to be healed but a terrain to be traversed." The ending describes legacy (travelers, legend, ritual) rather than landing a single, on-page reconfiguration with visible price. Drive lens unclear past midpoint; accumulative texture does not cohere into a clean closure beat (−0.5 lens drift, −0.8 for closure that displaces into summary and legacy rather than a final image with undeniable cost).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The observatory setting supplies vivid sensory anchors (copper dome, ozone, lightning, brass console) and the storm modulates with the poet's ritual. The timer, envelope, and timetable function as micro-setting objects but do not meaningfully constrain a choice—props are handled in sequence without friction. Spatial choreography remains clear. Missing 9+ gate: no environmental element narrows options or charges the final image with felt cost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("to map the invisible cartography of scars") declared but never tested by opposition or cost. The poet performs his ritual unopposed; the timer clicks, the envelope opens, the storm softens—no reversal, no narrowing of options, no visible price paid on the page. The ending summary ("travelers… discovered," "generations toward compassion") recounts legacy rather than showing a single, earned escalation with cost. No agency forecloses a path; the vigil completes exactly as planned.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Theme of scars-as-terrain and censorship is asserted ("furiously tranquil," "quiet ferocity," "beauty within each scar") but not earned through dramatized cost. The final paragraph moralizes directly: "the cartography of scars, once mapped, could guide generations toward compassion" (−0.6). Thematic vocabulary ("rarefy," "cartography," "vigil in pause") recurs as lyric decoration without reweighting prior material through a concrete, non-literal final image. Subtext thin; the poet's uncensored act carries no visible consequence or friction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Single third-person POV stable; no head-hopping. Diction elevated and consistent ("rarefy," "cartography," "storm-kissed wonder") but borders on decorative when density exceeds beat pressure. Perceptual signature relies on stock poetic phrasing: "ink on parchment," "electric scent of ozone," "luminous ink." Distance modulates purposefully through the storm sequence. Register drift into abstract philosophical idiom ("terrain to be traversed with reverence") in peak beats (−0.3). No dialogue to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Template cadence: runs of "He [verb]" and "The [noun]" stems across multiple paragraphs (−0.6). Paraphrase loop: "cartography of scars" recurs six times without added pressure; "furiously tranquil" echoed twice; "vigil in pause" stated, then restated in final lines (−0.4). Mixed metaphor: clouds "churned like ink on parchment" yet earlier "restless" and later "thinned"—vehicle shifts without coherent logic (−0.3). Overwriting in peak beat: "fragments rose a new stanza, a map of the scars rendered in luminous ink that glowed"—stacked figurative vehicles blur sense (−0.4). Closure beat touched by scaffold ("silent invitation," "quiet poetry"). Total artifact penalty −1.7; disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band entries at 8.8 per rule.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Core premise (censored poet performs storm ritual with timer and envelope) reads as stock metaphor assembly without fresh synthesis. The "cartography of scars" and "furiously tranquil" are prompt labels recycled as theme rather than transformed through grounded causality. No turn feels inevitable in hindsight; the ritual proceeds exactly as declared with no friction or cost. Derivative Premise Guardrail: close match to lyric-tableau templates without specificity that differentiates this ritual from generic poetic vigils (−0.8 within Q8).</comment>
