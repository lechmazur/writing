<question>1</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The weaver remains an abstract vessel for the concept rather than a character with contradictory impulses or embodied emotion. Her "purpose" is declared ("to carve a path from ruin to reverence") but never tested by competing desires or genuine obstacles that force difficult trade-offs. The piece summarizes her nightly ritual and its outcomes without dramatizing a single moment where her flaws, limits, or fears create friction. "Hauntingly optimistic" functions as a label rather than a trait that constrains choice or produces visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The piece opens with atmospheric description and delays who/where/when anchors past the ~120-word mark; "poetic wharf weaver" and "labyrinth" are named early but their spatial and temporal relationship remains vague until mid-story, triggering the Orientation Test penalty (−0.4). No meaningful tightening occurs: the weaver begins sewing, continues sewing, and ends sewing with escalating declarations of success but no on-page reversal or complication. The closure unit—travelers guided, guildmasters humbled—is summarized rather than dramatized, and no felt or visible cost appears; the final image ("continued to sew the world's wounds") restates the premise without reconfiguring it.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The labyrinth and canyon setting are introduced with vivid imagery ("red canyon walls," "stone arch," "orchid solace") and the overlapping sleepwalking paths create a striking spatial conceit. However, the environment never constrains a choice or alters tactics; corridors and tide pools are decorative backdrops rather than active pressure. The storybook plate glows and reflects but remains a passive object. Spatial choreography is coherent, and sensory detail (orchids, stone, luminous veins) is purposeful, lifting the score into the mid-5s despite the lack of environmental constraint on the protagonist's actions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—stitching hope into the labyrinth—is signaled early but never tested. No obstacle, setback, or complication forces the weaver to adapt; each step succeeds as declared. "Broken precedents" are mentioned as already crumbled under her "soft insistence," offering no on-page resistance. The piece cycles through nightly sewing and morning confirmations without a single moment where failure, doubt, or external pressure narrows options or raises cost. Agency is absent; the weaver acts in a vacuum of consequence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The theme of renewal and hope emerging from ruin is stated rather than earned. "Orchid solace," "broken precedents," and "ruin to reverence" recur as labels without evolving meaning or concrete grounding in choices. The ending's final image ("sew the world's wounds with gentle, orchid-soft hands") restates the premise in abstract terms rather than reweighting it through a non-literal answer. The piece gestures toward complexity ("courage to break the old laws") but dramatizes no conflict between law and vision, making the thematic claim ornamental. Subtext is minimal; all meanings are surfaced in narration.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited to the weaver, and the narrative distance remains consistent. Diction leans heavily on elevated, abstracted phrasing ("hauntingly optimistic," "orchid solace," "reverence") that reads as authorial overlay rather than the weaver's perceptual signature. Sentence structures fall into parallel patterns: "She [verb]… The [noun] [verb]… Each [noun] [verb]…" creating a lulling, incantatory rhythm that flattens rather than modulates with pressure. No dialogue appears. Filter verbs ("She saw," "She understood," "She felt") proliferate without voice-motivated purpose, dulling immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The prose is grammatically clean but marred by paraphrase loops and template cadence. Adjacent sentences restate the same content: "threading luminous yarn" / "Each nighttime wander stitched a filament of light"; "guide lost souls toward peace" / "their steps guided by unseen threads." Stock metaphors ("orchid solace," "gentle affirmation," "tapestry of stone and light") recur without fresh inflection. Figurative language appears in nearly every sentence ("tide pools empty," "orchid veins in frost," "luminous canopy") without pattern-teaching or payoff, creating density without propulsion. Sentence openings repeat ("The weaver," "She," "Each," "The labyrinth") across runs of three or more lines. Applying patterned-artifact penalties (paraphrase loops −0.4, template cadence −0.4, stock metaphor strings −0.3) totals −1.1; artifacts touch the final third, disallowing 9+ globally and capping this category at mid-band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The premise—mystical artisan who heals a ruin through ritual craft—echoes widely used writing templates (magical realism healer, redemptive artist) without transformation through specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. "Overlapping sleepwalking paths" offers a striking image but remains ornamental; the mechanism is asserted rather than tested or constrained. The weaver faces no genuine opposition, mistake, or cost, rendering the arc predictable. Emotional specificity is absent; "hauntingly optimistic" and "orchid solace" are generic affective labels. The piece could be recast with a potter, musician, or gardener and identical emotional beats, failing the transformation test.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>The weaver is present throughout and her actions (sewing, sleepwalking, whispering) are central to the plot, but she makes no on-page decision that creates a turn. She begins with her purpose and executes it without friction, complication, or choice under pressure. Her character is ornamental—a vessel for the concept rather than an agent whose choices alter tactics or stakes.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The storybook illustration plate appears in multiple beats (first third: carried in satchel and described; middle: painted with new corridors during sleepwalking; final third: reflects sunrise, guides travelers). However, it remains a passive recording device; the weaver never uses it to solve a problem, and removing it would not break the plot—she could sew the paths directly. The plate's mechanics (how painting onto it creates physical corridors) are asserted but not dramatized with constraint or cost. It returns with reweighted meaning (faint veins → glowing map) but does not constrain a choice, capping the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Broken precedents" is named twice: old guilds forbade weaving within stone, but those rules "crumbled under her soft insistence." The concept is told rather than dramatized; no guildmaster confronts her, no choice is forced between obeying or defying. It exists as thematic echo rather than a stake that alters options or tactics on the page.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.2</grade><comment>"Hauntingly optimistic" appears as a label in two beats ("hauntingly optimistic lullaby," "hauntingly optimistic heart," "hauntingly optimistic song") but never constrains or enables an on-page action with cost. The weaver's optimism is declared, not tested; no moment shows her choosing hope over despair with visible consequence. The trait is ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Sew" is the central action, appearing in ~8 beats (threading yarn, stitching seams, sewing invisible seams, sewing pathways, continued to sew). It frames the weaver's method and goal, and the ending image ("sew the world's wounds") reprises it. However, the action is repeated without evolution or complication; she sews at the start, middle, and end with identical success. No turn traces to a failure or adjustment in her sewing. The action is essential to the plot but not irreplaceable—"weave," "paint," or "carve" would function identically—and no cost attaches to it. One key reprise (first → last) with causal presence across beats places it mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Overlapping sleepwalking paths" is introduced in the middle third and described as a ritual where dream-steps merge with waking steps, stitching light into the walls. The method appears in two beats (explanation, nighttime intertwining) and is mentioned in the ending's summary ("travelers… found their steps guided"). However, its mechanics are asserted rather than demonstrated; the reader never sees a specific moment where sleepwalking enables or constrains a choice. It reads as a striking image rather than a method that shapes attempts or outcomes. Late first appearance (mid-story) and summary-only use cap the score below 5.0.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The labyrinth is present from the opening line and anchors every scene. It supplies the corridors the weaver transforms and the space where travelers later find guidance. However, the setting never constrains a choice or supplies a resource that alters outcome; the weaver moves through it without obstacle, and the stone's only role is to receive her sewing. The "centuries-old" age and "red canyon walls" are vivid but ornamental. Setup, development (middle corridors), and payoff (final image of guided travelers) are all present, and the setting is essential to the premise, placing it in the 5.0–6.9 band. Lack of constraint caps it at mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"After the tide pools empty" appears twice: in the first third ("After the tide pools empty, the silence deepened") and in the final third ("In the quiet after the tide pools emptied"). The timeframe marks a condition rather than tightening decisions or tactics. No clock pressures the weaver; she works across unspecified nights and dawns with no urgency or deadline. The element is ornamental, functioning as mood rather than constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The motivation "to carve a path from ruin to reverence" is stated explicitly in the first third and restated in the ending ("every ruin could become reverence"). It frames the weaver's goal and is present in every beat of her work. However, the desire is told rather than dramatized; no scene shows her wrestling with doubt, fatigue, or conflicting wants. The motivation drives the plot but is never tested by friction or cost, placing it at the functional threshold.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"Orchid solace" appears as a phrase or image in ~6 beats (air smell, colors glowing like orchids, orchid veins, orchid breeze, orchid-soft hands, orchid perfume). The tone is coherent—gentle, hopeful, fragrant—and modulates subtly from promise to affirmation. However, it remains a static mood rather than a tone that charges the final image with pressure or cost. The repetition is purposeful but ornamental, lending texture without altering stakes. Setup and payoff are present; lack of causal pressure caps it below 5.0.</comment>
