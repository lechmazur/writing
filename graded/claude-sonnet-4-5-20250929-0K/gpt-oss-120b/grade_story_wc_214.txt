<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The cosmic janitor remains a cipher throughout: labeled "spiritually curious" and given tasks (tracing star paths, empathizing), yet no contradictory impulse or on-page micro-choice under pressure emerges. The interiority consists entirely of abstract states ("feeling vulnerability turn to a quiet fire") without embodied sensation or a hierarchy of competing wants. The vow to the heavens and the final gratitude are declared rather than earned through dramatized struggle. No meaningful change or credible endurance forecloses a path with visible cost; the janitor begins reverential and ends reverential with no alteration in options or knowledge.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed: by line ~15 we know "janitor" and "station," but the spatial anchor (stone balcony) and the janitor's gender arrive past the 120-word mark without teaching disorientation as a pattern (−0.4). No causal turn occurs on the page; each sentence adds atmosphere but does not narrow options or change knowledge. The ending offers no Decisive Change, no Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost, and no Conceptual Repricing—only continued vigil and metaphoric "dawn" without a before/after in stakes or stance. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, yet no pattern break or cadence shift reweights the dominant stake with legible cost at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The station (stone, copper tubes, sensors) and the yellow lantern are vivid and recur across beats, anchoring the micro-setting. The lantern's glow shapes the final image ("spilled across the stone floor"), satisfying the 9+ gate requirement that an object or tool charge closure. However, spatial choreography remains vague (balcony, floor, machinery positions never cohere), and the "forgotten valley" functions as postcard backdrop rather than a constraint on choice. Sensory selection is almost exclusively visual-plus-hum; no smell, temperature, or tactile grain filters through the janitor's professional lens.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—honoring fallen stars—is signaled early but never tested by opposition or scarcity. No on-page reversal, tightening, or deepening narrows options: the janitor traces paths, whispers a vow, the station records it, and morning "arrives within" without cost. The tremor and the station's chord are responses from the world, not choices by the protagonist that foreclose alternatives. Under the Accumulative lens, escalation would require density increase or pattern break that reweights the stake; here the texture remains uniform from opening to close, and no price is paid or trade-off forced.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The theme of "flourishing stillness" and strength-in-vulnerability pervades every paragraph but is stated rather than enacted: "to find strength in vulnerability" appears as motivation label, and the final paragraph declares "vulnerability turn to a quiet fire" without prior scene work to earn the shift. The yellow lantern and the star-path motif recur, yet their meaning does not evolve—each mention restates reverence without complication. The station's "language of stars" and "melody of creation and decay" veer into abstract philosophizing rather than emerging from concrete, character-particular experience. No counter-reading or moral ambiguity is offered; the piece resolves into tidy affirmation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. The prose establishes a ceremonial, elevated register ("cradle of flourishing stillness," "drink from the well of universal silence") that remains consistent throughout. However, the diction often drifts into stock poetic phrasing ("primal elegance," "fertile ground where vulnerability could sprout") and the janitor's perceptual signature is generic rather than character-particular—no professional tic, idiosyncratic noticing, or lexicon tied to custodial or astronomical work. Psychic distance is uniform mid-range with no modulation under pressure. No dialogue is present to judge.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops appear across adjacent sentences: "flourishing stillness" is restated in varied metaphors (emptiness/fertile ground, hush/well of silence) without new information (−0.4). Template cadence runs: "The janitor's purpose…" / "To achieve this, the janitor traced…" / "Each trajectory became…" / "The janitor, feeling…" stack identical subject-verb stems (−0.5). Figurative density in every beat ("threads pulled into glow," "air polished by invisible hands," "molten sunrise," "flower in night") without pattern-teaching or payoff (−0.5). Stock metaphors ("cradle," "bridge between fragile and infinite") and elevated diction ("phosphorescent pulse," "primal elegance") clash with the utilitarian role of janitor. Sentence openings vary little, creating drumbeat rhythm. Combined artifacts touch closure beats, triggering the disallow-9+ cap.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The cosmic-janitor-as-contemplative premise echoes widely used templates (humble custodian discovers transcendence) without transformation through lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus (−1.0 derivative adjustment). The yellow lantern and star-tracing are specific objects/actions, but their function—conduit for spiritual communion—remains abstract and ornamental rather than forcing a trade-off or complication. The tone and imagery feel assembled from a poetic checklist (stone, copper, stardust, amber glow, silence, dawn-within) rather than emerging from a singular vision. No risk-taking or bold structural choice heightens stakes; the arc is linear affirmation without friction.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Cosmic janitor present throughout but makes no on-page decision that alters tactics or forecloses options. Tracing paths, whispering vows, and lifting the lantern are ritualized actions without visible cost or trade-off. Late first appearance of gender (second half) and no personality beyond reverence. Ornamental use; swappable with "keeper" or "watcher."</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Yellow lantern glass appears in opening third, recurs in mid-beats (glowing, flickering, pulsing), and returns in the final image ("spilled across the stone floor like molten sunrise"), satisfying setup, development, and payoff gates. The lantern's glow "served as a conduit" and "reflected the janitor's yearning," but these remain told functions rather than dramatized constraints on choice. The object charges the closure image visually yet does not narrow options or impose cost. Strong lyric reprise with modest causal work.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Flourishing stillness" is named three times and thematically echoed ("hush," "silence," "calm"), but it never constrains a choice or alters tactics on the page. The concept operates as atmosphere and theme claim rather than stake-shaping pressure. Mentioned in opening third and restated at closure without development or cost. Ornamental label.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"Spiritually curious" appears once as a label ("the lantern… served as a conduit for the janitor's spiritually curious mind") without enabling or constraining an on-page action. No visible tradeoff, friction, or cost tied to curiosity. Does not reappear or drive a beat. Label-only mention; swappable with "reflective" or "wondering."</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Empathize" is named explicitly ("to empathize with the dying whispers of each fallen star") in the opening third and restated in summary ("feeling their sorrow and triumph alike"), but no scene dramatizes the janitor performing empathy under pressure or facing a cost for doing so. The action does not create a turn or redefine options. Functional setup without middle development or closure participation. Swappable with "honor" or "commune with."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Tracing the path of falling stars" is introduced early ("the janitor traced the path of falling stars, mapping their luminous arcs… with delicate fingertip gestures") and recurs as guidance for the vow ("Guided by the traced star paths"). The method is named and visualized but does not alter tactics or impose a constraint—trajectories become stories without cost or choice. Present in setup and middle; modest closure linkage. Functional but replaceable with "recording" or "charting."</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Shooting star tracking station is named and described (weathered stone, copper tubes, ancient algorithms, sensors, stone balcony) across multiple beats. The station's sensors record the vow and emit a chord, giving it agency, and the final image shows the stone floor. The setting does not constrain the janitor's choices—space and resources are unlimited—but it provides props (balcony, sensors, machines) that the janitor uses and that respond. Setup, development, and modest payoff present; causal pressure is low.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Through the hush of an overlooked era" appears verbatim in the opening and closing paragraphs, framing the timeframe lyrically. The phrase does not tighten decisions, create a clock, or alter tactics; it remains atmospheric and thematic. No dramatized pressure from the era's "overlookedness" affects the janitor's options. Lyric reprise without causal work; swappable with "in a forgotten age."</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.0</grade><comment>"To find strength in vulnerability" is stated as motivation ("the janitor's own yearning to find strength in vulnerability") in the middle section and echoed in the final paragraph ("feeling vulnerability turn to a quiet fire within"). The desire is told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants or a choice that incurs cost. No on-page friction between vulnerability and another need. Summary-only; introduced after first third; no closure participation beyond label reprise.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Primal elegance" is named once mid-story ("a primal elegance settled over the scene") and the tone—ceremonial, elevated, reverent—is sustained throughout with consistent diction and rhythm. The tone does not modulate with pressure (no pressure present) but remains coherent and charges the final image through cumulative texture. Present across beats; static mood. Functional but not indispensable; "sacred stillness" would serve equally.</comment>
