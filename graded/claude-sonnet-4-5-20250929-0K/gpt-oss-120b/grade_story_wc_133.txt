<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is stated but her choices feel more like following a pre-ordained path than wrestling with contradictory impulses. The "exchange" decision arrives without visible internal conflict—she simply places the brooch and experiences the convergence. The interiority relies heavily on abstract constructions ("thresh meaning from experience," "haggard awe") rather than embodied particulars. No meaningful renunciation or foreclosed path appears; the ending grants her both art and renewal without felt cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors appear early (Keralan, post-war, Mara). The convergence functions as Resonant Reconfiguration, but the cost is unclear: Mara "surrenders" her paintings in exchange yet returns to paint again with the brooch above her easel, suggesting no actual loss. The causal chain from rain trail → brooch → altar → convergence reads more as a treasure-hunt checklist than because/therefore linkage driven by protagonist agency. The final image of the tide rising offers atmospheric closure but the stakes-alteration remains abstract.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The tidal island, cracked basalt, mist-collection gutters, and algae-slick stones provide vivid, purposeful detail that constrains Mara's movement and grounds the post-war scarcity. The rain trail and shallow pool guide action rather than simply decorating. The brooch on the stone altar becomes a spatial anchor for the convergence beat. Sensory detail is selective and reflects urgency, particularly the "glint that pulsed like a heartbeat" and the water column that "illuminated the night like a lantern."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—restoring balance to the scarred world—is declared but never tested by meaningful opposition or constraint. Mara follows the trail, finds the brooch, places it, and the convergence occurs; no tightening choice narrows options or forces a trade-off. The "exchange" of paintings for the secret arrives without dramatized friction: we never see her hesitate, mourn the loss, or face a competing desire. The ending grants renewal without visible cost, undercutting escalation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the water wars, mist-collection, and the protagonist's art as a processing tool. The amber brooch as "compass" and the rain trails as "conduits of memory" offer a non-literal answer to how meaning persists in ruin. However, the final paragraph tilts toward summary: "she had given it art to remember the water wars by" states the thesis rather than letting the image resonate. The exchange framework is conceptually clear but the lack of on-page cost softens the thematic charge.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited remains stable; distance and focalization are consistent. Diction occasionally overreaches—"wryly earnest," "haggard awe," "thresh meaning from experience"—into elevated phrasing that feels imposed rather than voice-rooted. Perceptual signature is present in Mara's attention to "each flicker of candlelight as a clue," but under peak pressure (the convergence) the narration shifts to passive reception ("a voice, faint as the rain, offered an exchange") rather than active perception. No head-hopping; internal voice is coherent if not deeply particular.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Line-level clarity is adequate; no major loops or scaffold. However, figurative density is high throughout without clear pattern-teaching: "bruised sky," "thresh meaning," "grind raw grief into pigments," "haggard awe," "varnish" of mist. Several phrases land as stock constructions—"her boots slipping on algae," "inner fire," "trembling note of hope." The convergence beat stacks passive constructions and abstract terms ("coalescing," "trembling note," "conduits of memory") that blur the physical event. Rhythm varies but propulsion slows in reflective passages.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The post-apocalyptic artist seeking meaning through an ancient artifact reads as a familiar template. The water wars, tidal island, and mist-collection provide setting specificity, but the core emotional arc—grief processed into renewal—follows a well-worn path. The amber brooch as key, the convergence as restorative pulse, and the exchange structure are coherent but not surprising. "Wryly earnest" and "haggard awe" gesture toward fresh texture without fully grounding it in scene-specific choices. The piece commits to its premise but does not transform the underlying framework.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Mara appears in every beat but her agency is limited: she follows the trail, lifts the brooch, places it on the altar, and experiences the convergence. The key turn—deciding to make the exchange—is told ("The terms were simple, yet heavy") rather than dramatized through hesitation or competing desire. She is present at closure but as receiver rather than decision-maker. Two gates (setup, payoff) are met; middle development is weak. Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.8, but summary-only exchange decision −0.6, swappable observer role −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The amber brooch appears in three beats: discovery in the pool, placement on the altar, and hanging above the easel at closure. It functions as the key that unlocks the convergence and returns with reweighted meaning (compass/reminder). However, its "glassy surface catching the dim light" and "cool metal" properties are generic; any artifact could serve the same plot role with minor edits. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.2, causal pressure +0.8, but swappability −0.6, ornamental final mention −0.3.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The unearthed convergence frames the quest and provides the resolution when "the rain trail seemed to converge upon it, spiraling upward." It shapes the dominant stake (restoring balance) and appears at closure. However, it remains abstract: we learn it is "a secret convergence of currents long thought lost" but the mechanics and immediate consequences are vague. Early signal +0.6, two beats (legend, event) +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, but swappability with any "lost power" −0.6, summary resolution −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Wryly earnest" is applied as a label in the opening ("moved through the dimly lit studios…wryly earnest, noting each flicker") and reprised once in the penultimate paragraph ("her own wryly earnest pursuit of meaning"). It colors voice but does not constrain or enable a specific choice with visible cost. The attribute remains ornamental rather than causal. Setup +0.4, closure mention +0.4, but label-only use −0.6, no beat involvement −0.5, no cost tied to it −0.4.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The exchange is central to the premise: Mara trades her paintings for the secret of the convergence. It appears in the midpoint proposition and structures the resolution. However, the exchange is told ("she would surrender…in return for a chance") and the cost is immediately reversed (she returns to paint again, brooch above easel). Early signal (midpoint) −0.3 for late setup, two beats (offer, altar placement) +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, causal pressure +0.8, but summary-only decision −0.6, swappable with any bargain −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"By following rain trails" is signaled early and used twice: Mara follows the glistening trail to the pool and the rain trails converge on the altar. The method is concrete and shapes her route. However, the mechanics are passive—she simply follows; no skill, risk, or choice differentiates this method from any other path-following. Early signal +0.7, two beats +0.9, closure linkage (trails converge) +1.0, but swappable with "following footprints/light" −0.6, no cost or skill requirement −0.6.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The tidal island pressures all choices: mist-collection sustains residents, algae makes movement treacherous, the stone altar and basalt cliffs provide the ritual space, and the rising tide at closure marks temporal change. The setting is specific (Keralan, post-water-wars, cracked basalt, salt-slick stones) and irreplaceable; the convergence could not occur elsewhere. Early signal +0.8, three beats (mist-collection, algae path, altar) +1.4, closure linkage (tide rises) +1.2, causal pressure (scarcity, terrain) +1.2, specificity +0.6.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"After the water wars" is mentioned in the opening and referenced at closure ("art to remember the water wars by"). It explains scarcity and ruin but does not tighten decisions or create a clock. The timeframe is static backdrop rather than active pressure. Early signal +0.6, closure mention +0.5, but no middle development −0.5, no urgency or countdown −0.7, swappable with any post-catastrophe setting −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Mara's motivation "to thresh meaning from experience, to grind the raw grief of the wars into pigments" is stated early and reprised at closure ("the meaning she had long been threshing"). However, it is told rather than dramatized through conflicting desires or visible friction. She never chooses art over another want or pays a cost to pursue it. Early signal +0.6, closure linkage +0.8, but label-only assertion −0.6, no on-page friction between wants −0.6, summary-only treatment −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Haggard awe" is named explicitly ("Mara felt a haggard awe rise within her") and the tone is sustained through "bruised sky," "crumbling shacks," "trembling note of hope," and the mist settling "like a varnish." The blend of exhaustion and wonder modulates with the convergence event and charges the final image of painting the ribbon of rain. Early signal +0.6, coherent through turns +0.8, closure charge +1.0, specificity +0.5, but explicit label in midpoint −0.4, static mood in places −0.4.</comment>
