<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Mara's interiority is often asserted through abstract labels ("combative tenderness," "desire to protect") rather than embodied in contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Her emotional arc from dock worker to island pilgrim feels more like a preordained mythic checklist than a path shaped by micro-choices under pressure. The final shift—"combative tenderness…would now defend the fragile peace"—is declared rather than earned through visible cost or renunciation on the page. Secondary characters (whale, spirits) exist as symbolic props without applying direct interpersonal pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The narrative follows an accumulative/textural lens but closure remains vague: the island "no longer vanished" and Mara feels "the island's heart beat within her own," yet what she has lost or forfeited is unclear. The Orientation Test is borderline—spatial anchors (dock, island, tower) arrive but temporal grounding ("the day after violence became impossible") is never dramatized or linked to present stakes. The scrimshaw unlocks the crystal, but the mechanics are metaphorical and the cost of release is gestural ("weight of centuries lift") rather than legible on the page. No meaningful tightening occurs; events unfold in and-then sequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The sublittoral fringe, basalt altar, and phosphorescent algae provide vivid sensory texture, and the scrimshaw's hidden compartment briefly charges a beat. However, the island itself functions more as symbolic backdrop than spatial constraint—Mara's movements (dock to island to tower) do not impose tactical choices or legible distances. The "disappearing island" premise is described but never pressures her navigation or safety. Micro-setting (body, tool) does not constrain the closure beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Mara's hunger to break free—is signaled but never tested by a meaningful reversal or competing cost. The whale's call and the scrimshaw's unlocking proceed without friction; no option is foreclosed, no trade-off dramatized. "After violence became impossible" is a striking premise but remains abstract; it never shapes a present choice or tactic. The ending asserts transformation ("defend the fragile peace") without showing what Mara relinquished or risked to earn it.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The theme of freedom through self-embrace emerges but is stated rather than dramatized. "Combative tenderness" and "guarded hearts" recur as labels without evolving through scene work. The scrimshaw's "unlocking" is a symbolic gesture, not a particular action tied to Mara's internal contradiction. The final paragraph ("she had finally found freedom in embracing her true nature") is a thematic summary rather than a resonant image. No counter-reading or ambiguity lingers; the piece resolves into a straightforward moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The third-person narration maintains stable focalization but relies on elevated, poetic diction ("bruised horizon," "moon-struck daggers") that sometimes overrides character-specific perception. Mara's internal voice lacks idiomatic texture; her thoughts read as narrated theme ("the combat within herself") rather than embodied consciousness. Register shifts into mythic abstraction ("the sea's heart," "ancient summons") are consistent but distanced, flattening urgency. No dialogue; the whale's "hymn" and Mara's "whispered" song are summary.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Dense figurative language appears in nearly every sentence without pattern-teaching or payoff: "seafoam clung to stone," "muscles sang of patience," "eyes glittered with a combative tenderness that could soften steel," "the horizon trembled as the earth itself seemed to shrink." Mixed metaphors ("shavings…glinted like moon-struck daggers" treats bone shavings as weapons) and template cadence ("She understood…She stepped…She placed…She realized") flatten momentum. Paraphrase loops appear: "guarded hearts" recurs five times without evolving. The closure beat is swamped by metaphor, obscuring what Mara has lost or gained.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The premise (disappearing island unlocked by scrimshaw and whale song) is a familiar fantasy template: chosen-one dock worker receives mystical artifact, hears call, passes test, releases trapped spirits. The "combative tenderness" phrase is repeated but not dramatized through specific, non-obvious character choices. The ending—spirits rising "like foam," island as "beacon," protagonist transformed—follows a predictable arc without a fresh angle. Emotional resolution is tidy and lacks risk or ambiguity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Mara appears in most beats but her decisions are reactive (hears hum, whispers hymn, places scrimshaw) rather than creating key turns. Her profession (dock worker) is mentioned once and does not constrain later action. She observes the island's transformation more than she drives it.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The scrimshaw is handled in three beats (inheritance, placement on altar, release to sea) and its hidden compartment matters at the tower scene. However, its mechanics are vague ("unlocks guarded hearts when the right song is played") and it resolves a problem (opening the crystal) it did not help create. Its final release ("detaching from Mara's hand") is passive.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The disappearing island is present in setup and ending, and the sea "pulls back the veil," but it never constrains Mara's choices or imposes navigational cost. It functions as symbolic prize rather than tactical pressure. Removal would simplify but not break the arc.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"Unlocks guarded hearts" is a label attached to the scrimshaw and repeated in narration ("unlocking the guarded parts of her soul"), but the trait is never dramatized as a specific capability with visible cost. The spirits' release is told, not shown as a consequence of Mara's trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Detach" appears in the legend ("detach from the past") and the scrimshaw's final moment ("detaching from Mara's hand"), but the action is passive and symbolic. Mara does not choose to detach; the scrimshaw releases itself. Swappable with "release" or "let go."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The whale's call is signaled early ("low, resonant hum…call of a whale"), prompts Mara's song, and returns at the tower to unlock the crystal. However, the mechanics are metaphorical ("matched the call of the whale") and the whale's role could be replaced by any mystical signal. It shapes two beats but does not impose cost.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>The sublittoral fringe is mentioned in the opening line but never pressures action. Mara moves from dock to island to tower without spatial difficulty. The setting is descriptive ("jagged reef," "weathered basalt altar") but does not alter tactics or supply resources.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"After violence became impossible" is a striking premise but remains abstract. It is mentioned once in exposition and never shapes a present decision or tightens urgency. Time is vague throughout ("That night," "At dawn") with no live clock.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>"To find freedom in embracing one's true nature" is stated in narration ("her longing to find freedom," "she had finally found freedom") but never conflicted by a competing cost or fear. Mara's desire is asserted rather than tested through on-page friction. The ending declares fulfillment without dramatizing the trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Combative tenderness" is a recurring phrase but not a modulating tone. The narrative maintains elevated, poetic register throughout; pressure does not shift diction or rhythm. The phrase is told ("her eyes glittered with a combative tenderness," "the air thrummed with combative tenderness") rather than embodied in contradictory gestures or choices.</comment>
