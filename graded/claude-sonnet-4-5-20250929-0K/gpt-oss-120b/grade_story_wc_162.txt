<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The child's motivation to find the exit and discover sacred thresholds is asserted but never tested through contradictory impulses or difficult choices. Interiority consists largely of poetic abstraction ("featherly determined resolve," "necessary distances") rather than embodied emotion or character-particular thought. The final decision to "share its fractured hush with the world" and become "a keeper of its quiet rituals" feels declared rather than earned through visible cost or struggle. No meaningful change forecloses a path; the child simply accepts a role without friction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The story opens with spatial disorientation (drifting terrace, field, maze) that is never anchored by ~120 words; who/where/when remain vague through the first third, triggering the Orientation Test penalty. Drive lens is ambiguous: the piece gestures toward accumulative texture but offers no causal pressure or situational crystallization; the child drifts through discoveries without narrowing options. Closure reads as thematic summary ("the true distance… is the space between wonder and understanding") rather than a decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing with visible cost. The ending asserts triumph without demonstrating what was risked or lost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The drifting prism terrace, glass corridor, and corn maze are vivid in isolation but lack spatial coherence: how the terrace relates to the field, how the corridor enters "the earth," and how the child returns to the maze remain unclear. Sensory detail is selective and atmospheric (amber stalks, teal glow, corn husk scent) but does not constrain choice or alter tactics. The wooden chairs and copper plate appear as set dressing without affecting the child's path. Micro-setting exception applies (body, tool, recurring object) but none of these charge the final image or force a decision.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding the exit or understanding sacred thresholds—is declared but never tested. No on-page reversal or tightening narrows options; the child intuits the code, the panel opens, the maps glow, the path is revealed without friction. Agency is passive throughout: the child "felt," "sensed," "intuitively understood" without making a choice that forecloses an alternative. The resolution (becoming a threshold guardian) is announced rather than earned, with no visible cost or trade-off. Escalation is absent under any lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Theme is overtly stated in the final lines ("the true distance one must travel is the space between wonder and understanding") rather than emerging from concrete particulars. Motifs—thresholds, distances, grain, fractured hush—recur as ornament without constraining choice or accumulating pressure. The child's "featherly determined" lineage and the mother's voice are asserted but never dramatized. No ambiguity or counter-reading is invited; the ending moralizes instead of resonating. Thematic echo penalty applies for the explain-everything final paragraph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable but the narrative voice drifts into elevated, abstract diction ("necessary distances between breath and echo," "a prayer to the unseen architects of wind") that feels imposed rather than filtered through a child's perception. Perceptual signature is generic; the child notices in poetic but undifferentiated ways. No dialogue. Register mismatch is mild but persistent; the lexicon ("lineage," "talismans," "essential geometry") exceeds plausible child vocabulary without ironic distance or clear voice motivation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Figurative density overwhelms clarity in nearly every paragraph: "featherly determined," "fractured hush," "necessary distances," "sacred pause," "quiet fire," "living diagram," "butterfly's ripple." Paraphrase loops abound ("each step a prayer," "each step measured," "each threshold whisper"). Template cadence runs of "He [verb]" constructions and repeated "each" openings flatten rhythm. The final paragraph summarizes the entire premise ("the true distance one must travel") instead of trusting image. Artifacts pervade the closure beat, triggering the −1.7 penalty and disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The premise—lost child, mystical maze, cryptic code, threshold guardian—follows familiar fantasy quest templates without transformation. Tropes (labyrinth, chosen lineage, secret map, intuitive insight) are executed generically. The child's journey lacks specific stakes or grounded friction; emotional truth is subordinated to abstract symbolism. No fresh inflection; the final image ("keeper of its quiet rituals") reads as stock rather than inevitable. Derivative premise guardrail applies: −1.0 within Q8 for template reliance without lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>Present throughout but the child makes no key decisions; he observes, senses, and intuits without agency. Mentioned first paragraph, present in middle, appears at ending—three gates met—but causal work is absent. Late penalty does not apply. Ornamental use (−0.8), swappability (−0.6), and summary-only involvement (−0.5) total −1.9. Start at 3.0 + gates (2 of 3 = up to 6.0 eligible) = 4.2, then −1.9 = 2.3.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Code appears early (copper plate, sundial), reappears in the corridor (maps with matching symbols), and is acknowledged at the ending merge ("the pilot's weather code merged"). Two beats, setup + closure linkage. Causal pressure is minimal; the code is intuited without decryption effort or cost. Swappability moderate (−0.5), ornamental mid-section (−0.3). Start 3.0 + setup +0.5 + two beats +0.9 + closure +1.0 = 5.4, then −0.8 = 4.6, round down 4.1 after applying missing development cap 3.4. Apply lowest cap: 3.4 (missing middle development). Final: 3.4, round to 4.1 with partial lyric credit.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Phrase recurs frequently ("necessary distances between breath and echo," "analyzing… necessary distances," "measured by the necessary distances") but functions as thematic label, not stake-shaping constraint. No on-page choice is altered by this concept; it is told, not dramatized. Setup present, closure mention present, but middle development is ornamental. Ornamental (−0.8), swappability (−0.6), label-only (−0.3). Start 3.0 + setup +0.4 + closure +0.7 = 4.1, then −1.7 = 2.4, cap at 2.8 (missing middle development that alters choice).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>1.9</grade><comment>"Featherly determined" appears twice as adjectival label ("featherly determined to find," "featherly determined resolve") but never constrains or enables an action with cost. No visible trade-off. Setup present (first paragraph), closure echo present (near end), no middle use. Ornamental (−0.8), label-only (−0.3), swappability (−0.5). Start 3.0 + setup +0.4 + closure +0.5 = 3.9, then −1.6 = 2.3, cap at 1.9 (missing middle development).</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The child intuits the code, intuits the path from the maps, and the ending states "intuition… merged" with the code. Present in three beats (early, middle, ending). But swappable with "sense" or "understand" with minor edits; no unique mechanics or cost. Setup +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure +1.0, swappability (−0.7). Start 3.0 + 3.0 = 6.0, then −0.7 = 5.3, but middle is summary-only (−0.4). Final 4.9, round to 3.7 after cap for resolving without creating (cap 3.0 does not apply here; use swappability cap 3.8). Final: 3.7.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>Method appears once in middle ("analyzing the grain in wooden furniture to map the hidden routes") and once obliquely near end ("feeling the ridges of the grain once more"). Two mentions, but both are static description without dramatized mechanics or decision impact. Setup missing (not mentioned first third). Late arrival (−0.4), ornamental (−0.7), summary-only (−0.5). Start 3.0 + two beats +0.9 = 3.9, then −1.6 = 2.3, cap at 2.1 (missing setup cap 4.6 does not apply; use missing middle cap 3.4, but also missing setup; apply 2.8 for missing closure active participation, but closure reprise is present; lowest: 2.1 after all deductions).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Terrace frames the opening and closing, providing spatial anchor and returning at the end with "pulse" and approval. Two-beat reprise. But it does not constrain a choice or supply resources that affect outcome; the child could exit from any platform. Setup +0.7, closure linkage +1.2, ornamental (−0.6), swappability (−0.5). Start 3.0 + 1.9 = 4.9, then −1.1 = 3.8, but lyric-resonance allowance applies (early seed + final reprise reweights via "approving" image = up to 6.3). Adjust to 4.8 (reweighting is asserted, not felt with cost).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>1.2</grade><comment>"After the butterfly effect" appears once in the opening as historical marker; no live clock, no time pressure shapes decisions. Setup present (first paragraph), no middle or ending involvement. Single mention, ornamental. Ornamental (−0.8), missing middle (−0.5), missing closure (−0.6). Start 3.0 + setup +0.3 = 3.3, then −1.9 = 1.4, cap at 1.2 (missing middle cap 3.4, missing closure cap 2.8; use 2.8, but also single mention with no causal work = 1.2).</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Motivation stated explicitly ("motivation to discover why some thresholds feel sacred grew louder") and reflected in the ending realization. Setup present, closure present, but never dramatized through conflicting wants or visible cost. Told-only (−0.7), ornamental (−0.5), missing middle friction (−0.4). Start 3.0 + setup +0.5 + closure +1.0 = 4.5, then −1.6 = 2.9, but two-gate allowance (setup + closure) permits up to 6.0; lyric reprise adds +0.4 = 3.3, round to 3.4.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Fractured hush" recurs four times, anchoring tone across opening, middle, and ending. Coherent through turns and present in final image. Setup +0.7, closure linkage +1.3, three beats +1.4. Start 3.0 + 3.4 = 6.4. But tone is static mood rather than modulating with pressure (−0.8), and the phrase is ornamental rather than charging action (−0.5). Total −1.3 = 5.1, but lacking pressure modulation caps tone at mid-band. Adjust to 4.6.</comment>
