<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Mara remains a collection of labels—"face blind portrait artist," "methodical"—rather than a character with embodied contradictions. Her interiority consists of therapy-speak abstractions ("dormant empathy," "alchemy of rigor and compassion") without specific micro-choices under pressure. The promised central tension—blindness vs. seeing—never manifests as dramatized conflict; she simply paints and whispers promises without visible struggle or cost. Actions are asserted via summary ("She felt a tremor," "she sensed") rather than shown through concrete choices that foreclose options.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The piece lacks a coherent drive lens; it drifts between accumulative (stone responding, mist swirling), causal (cold case resurfacing), and lyric registers without teaching a pattern. No meaningful closure unit is legible: Mara "steps back" having "sensed" success, but no decisive change, renunciation, or conceptual repricing occurs on the page with visible cost. The quarry "crack" and "tear" are figurative assertions, not dramatized turns. Orientation is delayed—"after the evidence disappears" situates time vaguely, and the cold-case premise is told rather than pressuring present choices.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The quarry is described with atmospheric density ("perpetual veil of mist," "thin line of blood"), and the ribbon fragment and limestone slab provide concrete anchors. However, setting remains decorative: the mist and stone do not constrain Mara's actions or alter her tactics. The fissure's reveal of names arrives late without prior setup, functioning as deus ex rather than earned discovery. Spatial choreography is vague—easel placement, Mara's movement, and prop distances never become legible.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—resolving cold cases via portraiture—is declared but never tested. No on-page escalation occurs: Mara paints, the quarry "responds" passively, and success is asserted without reversal or cost. Agency is absent; coincidence (the fissure's crack, names appearing) delivers resolution. The child's name "etched into the ragged edge" is a late plant, not a clue Mara pursues. No tightening or deepening forecloses a path; the ending grants satisfaction without visible price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Theme is overtly stated throughout: "unifying opposites," "lance the void," "awaken dormant empathy." These abstractions are repeated as labels rather than emerging from specific events. The final image—"tear rolled down the stone"—is figurative convenience, not earned resonance. The portrait's "voids" for eyes and Mara's promise to the stone read as symbolic gestures detached from concrete stakes. No ambiguity or counter-reading is available; the piece asserts its thesis without inviting reflection.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Mara, but interiority is filled with abstract declarations ("she believed," "she imagined," "she felt") rather than character-specific perception. Diction drifts into elevated register ("alchemy," "furrowed hush," "lance of pigment") that does not reflect a face-blind artist's sensory hierarchy. The quarry is granted agency ("the quarry seemed to respond," "the quarry responded with a sudden crack") without clear filter, blurring focalization. No dialogue to judge. Psychic distance remains consistent but distant, with no embodied immediacy under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Pervasive paraphrase loops and template cadence: "Mara was very methodical" → "Her method was patient"; "the evidence disappears" → "even if the evidence disappears again"; "unifying opposites" recurs four times without variation. Stock metaphors ("thin line of blood," "flame that would guide her") and abstract intensifiers ("perpetual veil," "furrowed hush") accumulate without propulsion. Figurative density in nearly every sentence—"lance the void," "battlefield," "chorus of lives"—obscures rather than clarifies. Sentence stems repeat ("She believed," "She felt," "She whispered"), creating mechanical rhythm. These artifacts pervade the final third, including closure beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The premise—face-blind artist solving cold cases via empathic portraiture—is high-concept but executed via stock tropes: mist-shrouded quarry, masquerade mask fragment, stone that "speaks." The unifying-opposites method and dormant-empathy motivation are template abstractions without specific transformation. The ending's tear-on-stone and names-revealed-in-fissure are genre-standard resolutions. No risky structural or perspectival choices; the piece remains safely within fantasy-procedural conventions without fresh inflection.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>Mara's face blindness is mentioned but does not constrain choices—she paints without dramatized struggle related to her condition. Her decisions (setting up easel, attaching ribbon, brushing) are setup actions, not turns. The portrait's completion is told, not shown altering stakes.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The ribbon fragment appears in three beats: attached to easel, catching light, and catching the tear. However, its role is ornamental—it does not enable or constrain action. The child's name "etched into the ragged edge" is a late plant (second half) that resolves without prior causal work. No evolving use; it remains static decoration.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Cold cases are declared as backstory ("string of cold cases") and motivate Mara's presence, but they do not shape on-page tactics. The child's case "resurfacing" is told, not dramatized. No evidence or clue work occurs; the quarry itself solves the mystery via coincidence (fissure, names). The concept frames theme but does not alter choices.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Very methodical" is a label applied once in setup and echoed once ("Her method was patient") without demonstrating constraint or cost. No trade-off between methodical patience and urgency appears. The trait does not enable a turn or foreclose a path; it exists as character flavor.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>"Lance" appears three times as metaphor ("lance the void," "lance of pigment," "lance of compassion") but never as literal action. The brushstrokes are described in summary, not dramatized. No turn or escalation depends on this specific verb; swapping to "pierce" or "break" would not alter structure. Mid-band ceiling applies.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Unifying opposites" is stated four times (silence/sound, darkness/light, blindness/sight, stone/breath) but the method's mechanics are never shown. Mara does not dramatize how opposing forces combine in her process. The method is theme assertion, not tactical means. It does not shape attempts or constrain choices.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The quarry is established early and frames all action. It provides atmospheric pressure (mist, silence) and delivers the fissure reveal. However, it does not constrain Mara's choices—she paints unimpeded. The limestone slab's names arrive via coincidence, not discovery shaped by setting affordances. Micro-setting (easel, canvas) is described but does not alter tactics. Present across beats but postcard-functional.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>1.9</grade><comment>"After the evidence disappears" situates backstory but does not create a live clock. No urgency or deadline pressures Mara's work. The timeframe is vague (fifteen years ago, "years" of cold cases) and does not tighten decisions. Time does not alter moves or escalate stakes.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.0</grade><comment>"To awaken dormant empathy" is declared as goal in two beats (setup and near-end) but never dramatized as conflicted desire. Mara does not choose between empathy and distance, cost and safety. The motivation is told ("she thought had been sealed away") without friction or trade-off. It frames theme but does not drive choice under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Furrowed hush" appears twice and coheres with "perpetual veil of mist," "silence," and "quiet" throughout. Tone remains stable—solemn, subdued—and supports the contemplative register. However, it does not modulate with pressure or charge the final image distinctly; the ending's tone matches the opening without escalation or shift. Coherent but static.</comment>
