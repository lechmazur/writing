<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to preserve forgotten names is coherent, but her interior life consists mostly of poetic abstraction ("thawing fire," "snowmelt ardor") rather than embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. The forgiveness backstory appears without causal grounding in present action. No genuine struggle or tradeoff emerges; she succeeds without friction, and the traveler's arrival adds no meaningful pressure or relationship dynamic.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed—who Mara is, her current situation, and why she's in the sanctum remain vague past the opening third, triggering the Orientation Test penalty. The closure unit (traveler entering, rope singing a new name, library expanding) reads as conceptual repricing, but the cost is declared rather than dramatized: no visible foreclosure or felt price in the final image. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, but the ending gestures toward resonance without delivering on-page consequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The icebound sanctum, aurora, and ceremonial rope are vividly rendered and appear throughout. The rope constrains Mara's method (reconfiguring braids) and charges the final image (luminous tapestry). Micro-setting (copper cylinder, punched card) shapes one key turn. However, spatial choreography is abstract—Mara's movements float without grounding—and the setting functions more as symbolic backdrop than tactical constraint in most beats.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake (preserve forgotten names) is signaled early but never tested or narrowed. Mara encounters no opposition, failed attempt, or forced trade-off; she simply succeeds. The traveler's arrival adds accumulation but not escalation. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening or cadence shift would suffice, but the final paragraph repeats the opening conceit without reweighting cost or options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Theme (memory as living conduit against silence) emerges from image and action rather than statement, and the rope's transformation offers a concrete thematic anchor. The ending's resonance—each name a thread in a luminous tapestry—avoids overt moralizing. However, the phrase "testimony that memory, once transcribed, could never truly freeze" edges into thematic echo, and the ease of Mara's success undercuts moral complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>POV distance is stable, and diction ("technically gentle," "snowmelt ardor") attempts a distinct texture. However, register drifts into elevated abstraction ("resonated through the ice walls," "living conduit") that feels imposed rather than character-rooted. The phrases "technically gentle" and "snowmelt ardor" recur as labels without dramatization. No dialogue on the page; the lone traveler remains voiceless, flattening potential for perceptual contrast.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Overwriting pervades high-pressure beats: stacked metaphors ("slithered like a silver serpent," "thawing fire," "delicate veins that glimmered like sunrise"), synonym churn ("whisper of a name…shouted in celebration"), and paraphrase loops (the final two paragraphs restate the sanctum-as-library conceit). Template cadence appears in the traveler sequence ("He knelt…he placed…the rope sang"). Filter verbs ("felt," "feeling") stack without voice motivation, dulling immediacy. The closing line—"learned to let the past melt into the present"—is a thematic summary rather than a charged image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The combination of lost wax caster, street organ punched card, ceremonial rope, and aurora creates a specific synthesis. However, the emotional arc (self-forgiveness → redemptive preservation → living library) follows a template redemption structure without fresh moral friction. The ending promises iterative expansion (each solstice, each new name) but offers no surprise or non-obvious turn. The piece commits to its lyric premise but retreats into abstraction rather than risk.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Mara lifts the cylinder, reconfigures the rope, records vibrations, and promises to return—functional across beats but her choices face no resistance or cost. Present early, involved in middle action, and referenced at closure (she watches the traveler), satisfying the gate model. However, her role is executory rather than decision-driven; she observes rather than wrestles. Swappable with another archivist or guardian without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The punched card scrap is introduced early, placed into the cylinder in a distinct beat, and the traveler's card reappears at closure, creating a lyric reprise. It encodes the melody of forgotten names, a causal necessity for Mara's mission. However, the card itself is passive—a brittle rectangle—and its mechanics remain abstract. Removing it would require a different memory medium but the story's logic and stakes could adapt.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Transcribed memory" shapes the mission statement and recurs in Mara's parchment recording and the traveler's card. It appears early, drives one middle action (transcription onto parchment), and the final paragraph declares the sanctum a "testament that memory, once transcribed, could never truly freeze." However, it functions more as thematic claim than tactical constraint; the concept is told rather than demonstrated through friction or cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Technically gentle" appears twice as a label ("fingertips technically gentle," "technically gentle resolve") but never constrains or enables a visible tradeoff. The trait is asserted rather than embodied in action under pressure. It does not shape Mara's approach to the rope or her interaction with the traveler. Ornamental mention without causal work.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Illuminate" is signaled early ("thawing fire that promised to illuminate"), drives the copper core glowing and the rope's luminous pathways, and charges the final image ("re-illuminate the rope"). The action structures multiple beats and the closure unit (names "illuminated anew"). However, the illumination is declarative—frost melts, walls soften—without physical or tactical consequence. Removing "illuminate" would require another verb but the arc remains intact.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Reconfiguring the ceremonial rope is signaled early ("the only way…untangling its knots and weaving them anew"), drives the central action beat, and the rope's new pattern at closure becomes a "map of luminous pathways." The method is specific and irreplaceable—the rope's braids encode memory. Without this exact method, the story's logic breaks. Present across setup, development, and payoff with causal necessity.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The icebound sanctum appears early, supplies the ceremonial rope and copper cylinder, and the aurora responds at closure. The setting's coldness and ice walls provide texture and the "frosted floor" anchors one tactile detail. However, the sanctum functions as symbolic container rather than tactical constraint—Mara's actions are not pressured by environment. The aurora "applauds" rather than complicating her task.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"After forgiving yourself" is mentioned once in the opening third as backstory context but never dramatized or returned to. The timeframe does not tighten decisions, create urgency, or constrain Mara's tactics. No clock, deadline, or temporal pressure appears. The phrase shapes Mara's emotional starting point but plays no causal role in escalation or closure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The motivation to preserve forgotten names is stated early, drives Mara's rope reconfiguration and transcription, and the closure expands the mission to future names. It is present across beats and shapes the dominant stake. However, the desire is never conflicted or tested—Mara faces no cost, obstacle, or competing want. Friction between want and price is absent, lowering the score despite strong presence.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Snowmelt ardor" appears twice as a label ("snowmelt ardor flooded Mara's chest," "feeling the snowmelt ardor pulse") but does not modulate with pressure or charge the final image beyond thematic assertion. The tone is consistent—reverent, lyric, warming—but static. No tonal shift or deepening occurs at closure; the final paragraph repeats the opening warmth without transformation.</comment>
