<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The withdrawn knight remains an abstraction throughout, defined by ornamental actions (placing fingers on glyphs, whispering promises) rather than contradictory impulses or embodied struggle. Interiority consists of label-only states ("shivering bliss," "murmured allegiance") without character-particular texture or micro-choices that reveal values under pressure. The final binding to the orchard reads as declared transformation rather than earned change with visible cost; no prior foreclosed path makes the renunciation legible. Motivation is asserted through poetic phrasing but never dramatized as conflicted choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed: who the knight is, where precisely he stands, and what concrete problem he faces remain vague past the opening third; "endless night" and "alchemical orchard greenhouse" supply atmosphere but not spatial or temporal anchors (−0.4 under Orientation Test, triggering Q3 cap at 7.0). The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural—vapor, script, moss accumulate into a tapestry—but no decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing with visible cost lands on the page; the knight's binding to the orchard is told in summary ("felt his armor melt into the moss") without a before/after choice or forfeited path. Causality is thin: the theater program's "forgotten patterns" enable the knight to "unsnap the cage of silence" and release the script, but how the patterns work or what resistance they overcome is never dramatized, only asserted.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The greenhouse supplies vivid sensory fragments—coppered vines exhaling vapor, luminescent moss, iron-and-jasmine scent—but remains a postcard backdrop; no spatial choreography tracks the knight's movement or constrains his choices. The control panel and moss respond to his touch without obstacle, so setting does not pressure tactics. The final image of armor melting into moss offers a charged reprise, lifting the score slightly, but the orchard never functions as a crucible that alters options or imposes cost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake, "to capture the shape of possibility," is declared but never tested on the page through a choice between competing goods or a visible trade-off. The knight encounters no meaningful resistance: the control panel yields, the vapor obeys, the script unfurls, and the orchard responds in harmony. No on-page reversal or tightening narrows options; the progression is additive (and-then vapor, and-then spores, and-then constellations) without escalation or cost under the Accumulative lens. Agency is passive observation and gesture rather than decision that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Theme of loyalty as song versus chain emerges in the final third ("loyalty was not a chain but a song"), but this insight is stated rather than earned through prior particulars. The marionette theater program and moss recur, yet their meaning does not shift through the knight's choices; they accumulate as symbols without dramatic friction. The ending attempts resonance through poetic assertion ("murmured allegiance... sealing the pact with a kiss of frost") but offers no non-literal answer grounded in scene work. Subtext is thin; the text tells its theme explicitly in the penultimate paragraph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited voice maintains consistent psychic distance and supplies a distinct perceptual signature—"factually mystical glow," "as reality shifts around the green glass"—that reads purposeful and pattern-taught. However, diction drifts into elevated, abstract register ("murmured allegiance," "shivering bliss," "symphony of midnight alchemy") that feels imposed rather than character-rooted, especially under what should be peak pressure. No dialogue appears; interior access remains stable. Patterned repetition of "murmured allegiance" and "as reality shifts" creates a rhythmic coherence that supports the Accumulative lens, preventing a steeper penalty.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Figurative density is extreme and often mixed: "night... stretched like a canvas awaiting a painter's breath," "pages curled like wilted petals," "script unfurled like a living serpent... breathing fire that painted... constellations." Metaphors pile without clear propulsion or causal linkage (−0.6 for density and coherence issues). Paraphrase loops appear: "murmured allegiance" recurs five times, "shivering bliss" three times, "as reality shifts" / "reality shifts" three times, often restating mood without advancing knowledge (−0.4 for template cadence and loops). Information density is low; many sentences perform atmosphere work without moving situation or character. The closure beat ("whispered once more, a final murmured allegiance... sealing the pact with a kiss of frost") is touched by these artifacts, escalating the deduction slightly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The withdrawn-knight-in-mystical-setting premise follows familiar fantasy templates; the alchemical orchard and marionette theater combine elements without transforming them into a specific, non-obvious synthesis. The knight's journey—enter strange place, discover artifact, unlock mystery, merge with environment—traces a stock arc. Emotional specificity is absent; "shivering bliss" and "murmured allegiance" are abstract mood labels rather than particular felt states. The ending's assertion that "loyalty was not a chain but a song" offers a generic insight unanchored in lived detail. No bold structural or perspectival risk heightens stakes; the piece reads as a lyric illustration of a prompt rather than an inevitable, character-driven necessity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The withdrawn knight is present throughout and handles objects (theater program, control panel, gauntlet), but his choices are passive enactments of the setting's will rather than decisions that create turns. He places fingers on glyphs, whispers promises, and lifts his gauntlet—actions that trigger responses but do not narrow options or impose cost. The character could be replaced with a generic seeker without altering the arc. Present in setup, middle, and ending, but ornamental across all three gates.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The abandoned marionette theater program appears in three beats: discovery in the orchard's heart, reference when remembering "forgotten patterns" at the control panel, and reprise when the knight places the glowing script back into its spine at the end. The program's "forgotten acts" and "murmured allegiance" supply the choreography the knight uses to coax vapor into shapes, enabling the middle action. However, the program's specific properties—what patterns, what acts—are never dramatized; it functions as a key that unlocks the next beat without visible cost or specificity that makes it irreplaceable. The final reprise reweights the object (now glowing) but does not alter the knight's tactics or charge the closure with a visible trade-off. Setup, development, and payoff gates met; causal role present but swappable with any mystical instructional artifact.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>A murmured allegiance is declared early ("murmured allegiance seep into his own oath"), recurs as a refrain across five beats, and serves as the knight's final act ("whispered once more, a final murmured allegiance"). Yet the concept remains thematic decoration; the knight's oath is never tested by competing loyalties or a choice that forecloses a path. The allegiance is told rather than dramatized through friction, and the story would function identically if the concept were replaced with "whispered vow" or "silent bond." Present in setup and ending, but ornamental in development; no cost or constraint tied to the allegiance on the page.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Factually mystical" appears twice as a descriptor for the vapor's glow and the program's light at the end. The attribute supplies atmosphere but does not constrain or enable any on-page action with visible cost; the knight never trades one mode (factual/mystical) against another or uses the trait to solve a problem. Label-only mentions without causal pressure or tactical relevance. Present in setup and payoff, but ornamental in both.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Unsnap appears twice: "hoping the old choreography would unsnap the cage of silence" and "he unsnap the lock that bounded the theater's heart, releasing its dormant script." Both uses occur at key turns—the control panel hum and the script's unfurling—and the second directly triggers the final sequence (constellations, glowing trail, orchard harmony). The action is specific enough that its removal would require rewriting those beats, though "unlock" or "release" could substitute with minor edits. Present in middle development and closure; shapes two beats but not irreplaceable. Early signal absent (first use is past the midpoint), capping score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Through forgotten patterns is signaled when the knight remembers "the forgotten patterns described in the theater program" and uses them to "coaxed the vapor into shapes that mirrored the marionette scripts." The method enables the middle action and recurs implicitly when the knight traces "the outline of a new stage" and the script unfurls. However, the mechanics of the patterns—what they are, how they differ from non-forgotten choreography—are never shown; the method is asserted as a key without visible constraint or cost. Present in setup (theater program lists "forgotten acts"), development (control panel), and closure (script unfurling), but the specificity needed to make the method irreplaceable is absent. Functional but swappable with "ancient ritual" or "lost knowledge."</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The alchemical orchard greenhouse shrouded in endless night anchors the story's single continuous location and supplies resources (coppered vines, vapor, control panel, luminescent moss) that the knight uses to enact his transformation. The setting's atmosphere is vivid and consistent, and the orchard's "response" to the knight's actions (vines humming, night softening) provides feedback that shapes the final sequence. However, the setting does not constrain choices or impose costs; the knight never navigates obstacles, lacks access, or trades one part of the orchard against another. The greenhouse breathes and responds but never pressures tactics. Present across all beats and essential to the story's imagery; micro-setting (moss, control panel) enables action but does not alter options with visible trade-offs.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>As reality shifts appears three times as a phrase and anchors the timeframe's fluidity: "every step stretched the night," "the night itself seemed to shift," "as reality shifts beyond the greenhouse." The timeframe is thematic and atmospheric rather than a tactical constraint; no clock tightens decisions, and the knight's actions unfold without urgency or a visible deadline. The final "as reality shifts" recurs in the penultimate paragraph to signal transformation, offering a mild reprise, but the timeframe does not alter the knight's moves or cost. Present in setup and ending as motif, but vague and untracked in development; no pressure derived from time's passage.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>To capture the shape of possibility is declared early ("His motivation, to capture the shape of possibility, flickered like a lantern") and recurs near the ending ("each step a chance to capture the shape of possibility"). The motivation frames the knight's goal, but it is never dramatized through conflicted choice or a visible trade-off between want and cost. The knight pursues this abstract aim without friction; nothing he values competes with the goal, and no tactic is abandoned or priced. The desire is told rather than tested. Present in setup and development, but ornamental; no friction or cost tied to the motivation on the page.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Shivering bliss appears three times: when the phantom chorus sings, when the knight steps onto the glowing trail "feeling the shivering bliss of being both observer and creator," and implicitly in the final image promising "a shivering bliss that promises endless tomorrows." The tone is consistent and modulates slightly from auditory to kinesthetic to promissory, supporting the Accumulative lens. However, the tone does not shift with pressure or charge the final image with visible cost; "shivering bliss" remains a static mood label rather than a tonal arc that reweights the stake. Present in setup (chorus), middle (trail), and ending (final sentence), offering coherence but not transformation.</comment>
