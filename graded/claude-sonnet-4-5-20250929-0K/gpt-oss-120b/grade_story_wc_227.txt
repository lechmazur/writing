<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The alchemist's uncertainty is declared but her internal contradiction never acts simultaneously in scene—she moves from doubt to resolve in a clean arc without competing impulses under pressure. Interiority relies heavily on abstract labels ("uncertain," "desperate rhythm," "quiet confidence") rather than embodied perception. The final smile and door-closing gesture feel like mechanical closure beats rather than earned renunciation with visible cost. No secondary character pressure tests her motives on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed: who she is, where the workshop floats, and why she's pacing emerge slowly through decorative detail rather than early anchors (−0.4). The closure unit—placing the charm against the statue's fissure and narrating a story that "stitches" the world—reads as metaphorical wish fulfillment without on-page cost; the acid sea "calms" and voids "fill with liquid light," but no choice is foreclosed and no price paid. The drive lens appears Accumulative/Textural (lyric density, kintsugi motif), yet the ending delivers a tidy resolution rather than a resonant reconfiguration with felt tension. Cost-proof test fails: I cannot point to a sentence where the alchemist loses, trades, or endures something concrete.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The floating workshop and acid sea are vivid and purposeful, but they function primarily as backdrop; the gears hum and the sea churns without constraining her choices or altering tactics. The statue's pockmarks anchor the ritual, and the key ring charm warms in response, offering micro-setting pressure that modestly charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective (corrosive mist, sea's bite, gear-pulse) and filtered through the alchemist's resolve, though spatial choreography remains stable rather than dynamic under pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"to conjure meaning from the edge of oblivion"—is signaled early but remains abstract throughout. No on-page reversal narrows options; the alchemist's narration succeeds without resistance, and the acid sea's calming feels coincidental rather than earned by her agency. The piece declares escalation ("each tick a reminder that time itself was a fragile alloy") but never dramatizes a moment where her choice forecloses a path or imposes a trade-off. Under an Accumulative lens, the ending should reweight cost; instead it delivers satisfaction without visible price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Kintsugi as theme—brokenness made beautiful through acceptance—is woven through imagery (golden seams, quilting memories, pockmarks closing) and gains resonance. However, the final declaration ("each crack holds the promise of a golden line") states the moral rather than letting the statue's shimmer and the alchemist's smile imply it. The piece resists true moral ambiguity; the alchemist's doubt melts cleanly and the world mends without friction or cost, reducing thematic complexity. Subtext in gesture and silence is minimal; most meaning is directly narrated.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Single-POV distance is stable, and the alchemist's perceptual signature (tracing pockmarks, feeling the workshop's pulse merge with the sea's bite) is consistent. Diction carries a lyric, elevated register ("skeletal ship," "dire enchantment," "luminous intention") that remains voice-motivated and legible. However, under peak pressure—the moment she aligns the charm and speaks the tale—syntax does not compress or modulate; the rhythm stays decorative rather than tightening with urgency. No filter-verb stacks or head-hopping; free indirect thought is clean.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout without pattern-teaching or escalation payoff: "skeletal ship," "tapestry of hope," "bulwark of purpose," "furnace," "liquid light" cluster in adjacent lines, blurring focus (−0.5). Paraphrase loops appear: "quilts memories together" is restated as "weaving a tapestry," "stitched a filament of light," and "quilting memories together" within three paragraphs (−0.3). Template cadence: multiple sentences open with "The alchemist" or "She" + past-tense verb across the middle third without variation (−0.4). Information density is moderate; many lines do double duty (e.g., the charm's warmth + forgotten tides), but scaffold phrases like "between breaths held underwater" recur without added pressure. The final paragraph stacks closure gestures (smile, door close, reflected sunrise) that feel like checklist beats rather than propulsive image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Kintsugi intentions as the lens for repairing a broken world offers a fresh inflection on healing-magic tropes, and the floating workshop on an acid sea supplies a vivid frame. However, the emotional arc—from uncertainty to quiet confidence through solo narration—follows a familiar template without bold risk or non-obvious synthesis. The statue's pockmarks and the charm's warming are specific details, but their function (tracing voids → filling them with light) reads as allegorical convenience rather than earned causality. The ending delivers satisfaction without transformation, and the alchemist's inner journey lacks the contradictory impulses or costly trade-offs that would elevate originality.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Present throughout; her choices (pacing, tracing pockmarks, lifting the charm, narrating) appear in multiple beats. However, these actions feel observational and declarative rather than creating key turns with cost. Her "resolve" is stated early and confirmed at the end without friction or reversal. Functional but replaceable; the arc could proceed with a generic protagonist without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Introduced in the opening paragraph, handled again when she aligns it with the statue's fissure, and returned as a symbol ("placed the key ring charm back onto her wrist") at closure. The charm warms and pulses, adding modest causal texture (it hums "the pitch of forgotten tides"), but its mechanics remain vague and it does not constrain a choice or impose a trade-off. Early signal + closure reprise + two distinct beats; swappability moderate (another talisman could serve). Band ~5.5–6.0; specificity and cost linkage are weak, so 5.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Kintsugi is named and described ("the philosophy that brokenness could become beautiful," "golden seams") and shapes the thematic frame. However, it does not constrain on-page tactics or alter options; the alchemist's narration succeeds without testing the concept's limits or costs. Setup and payoff gates met, but middle development (a choice where kintsugi creates friction) is absent. Functional theme claim without causal pressure. Cap at ~4.6; minor thematic integration penalty brings it to 4.1.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Quilts memories together" is stated in the opening and echoed in the middle ("quilting memories together as if the past could be sewn into a new present"), but it reads as metaphor rather than a constraint that enables or limits her action. No visible trade-off tied to this trait. Present in two beats (setup, middle), but ornamental. Cap ~4.6; swappability and lack of cost lower to 3.6.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Narrate" is signaled early ("resolved to narrate a story of repair"), drives the middle beat (she speaks the tale, "each sentence she uttered stitched a filament of light"), and anchors the closure ("She narrated the final stanza"). Three beats, clear causal role. However, the action itself is abstract—her words succeed without dramatized resistance or cost—so irreplaceability is moderate. Eligible for ≥6.1; causal involvement and closure linkage push it to 6.3.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Introduced early ("matching the pockmarks on a centuries‑old statue"), used in the middle (tracing dents, aligning the charm's loop with the deepest fissure), and the pockmarks "seemed to close" at the end. The method shapes her ritual and is present in three beats. However, the mechanics remain vague (how does matching work? what makes it effective?) and no cost or constraint arises from this specific method. Setup, development, payoff all met; causal pressure weak. Band ~5.0–6.0; three-beat involvement + early signal = 5.4.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The floating workshop and acid sea are vivid and present throughout, but they function as backdrop rather than constraining her choices. The acid sea "churns, trying to dissolve the workshop's foundations," yet this threat never forces a tactical shift or trade-off. The gears and floorboards are mentioned but not handled as resources. Setup and payoff met; middle development (setting alters a tactic) absent. Cap ~4.6; vivid description lifts slightly to 4.8.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Between breaths held underwater" appears twice as a poetic refrain but does not function as a live clock. No urgency tightens decisions; the alchemist's narration proceeds at declarative pace without time pressure. Ornamental mention; no causal role. Band ~1.5–3.0; recurring phrase without pressure = 2.1.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"To conjure meaning from the edge of oblivion" is stated and echoed ("surrendering fear," "the promise of a golden line"), framing her want. However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized through conflicting desires or on-page friction. No moment where this want clashes with cost or fear in a choice. Setup and thematic payoff met; middle friction absent. Cap ~4.6; thematic presence lifts to 5.1.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Dire enchantment" is present in diction (acid sky, skeletal workshop, corrosive mist, oblivion's edge) and modulates subtly as the alchemist moves from uncertainty to resolve. The tone charges the final image (acid‑fumed sunrise, gears settling like sighs) and remains coherent through turns. However, the mood stays elevated and lyric without sharp contrast or tonal break under peak pressure. Setup, development, and payoff all met; tone shapes the ending. Causal pressure moderate; coherence high. Band ~6.5–7.5; specificity and closure linkage = 6.7.</comment>
