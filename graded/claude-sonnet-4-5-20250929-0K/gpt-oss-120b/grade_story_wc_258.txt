<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The cartomancer remains too abstract throughout; her motivations are told ("steadily curious," "inherited mystery") rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses acting in scene. Internal life consists largely of poetic declaration ("She whispered to the void, confiding that the pattern she sought was not merely profit, but a blueprint of hope") without embodied emotion or genuine struggle. The final walk into the night feels like a pose rather than a choice that forecloses a path with cost—no visible tradeoff or renunciation occurs on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive adequately early. However, closure is largely asserted rather than enacted: "she had found her purpose" and "ready to chart the next unseen path" declare transformation without a decisive on-page change in options or knowledge. The textural/accumulative lens is implied but never tightens—each paragraph loops similar observations about mapping and mystery without a single beat that narrows her tactics or reveals new cost. No meaningful reversal or deepening occurs; the piece ends where it began, wrapped in ambiance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The loft's rain-beaded skylight, brass tables, and measuring tape are vividly rendered and filtered through the cartomancer's professional lens. Sensory detail (the tape's clicks, the hum in the walls, the droplet on the skylight) creates atmospheric cohesion. However, the environment never constrains a choice or alters tactics—it remains scenic backdrop rather than active setting. The micro-setting (tape, cards) is present but does not pressure decisions, capping the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—mapping cultural patterns to guide post-crash rebuilding—is signaled early but never tested. No reversal, tightening, or complication appears; the cartomancer proceeds from first measurement to final smile without obstacle or cost. The "snapped gently at a critical juncture" could be a turn, but the text immediately declares success ("where hope could be re‑stitched") rather than forcing a trade-off. Agency is observational, not decisional, and no price is paid on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Theme is repeatedly announced ("inherited mystery," "blueprint of hope," "guide a world reborn from digital ash") rather than emerging from concrete action. The final paragraph moralizes overtly: "In the inherited mystery, she had found her purpose…a legend whispered by those who learned to read the lines of history." Prompt language ("reverse engineering," "map cultural patterns," "inherited mystery") recurs as unearned epiphany. No subtext; every thematic claim is stated directly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Single-POV distance is stable; the piece sustains a lyric, elevated register throughout. However, the diction is often generic-literary ("chorus that reminded her why she chose to confide her doubts to the night") and template-patterned in structure ("She believed that by…she could…; She realized that…; She imagined…"). No dialogue. The perceptual signature is poetic but not character-particular—any seer could narrate this way. Voice remains consistent but lacks the specificity or rhythmic modulation that would charge peak moments.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Heavy paraphrase loops and synonym churn appear throughout: "inherited mystery" recurs five times; "reverse engineering the collapse" appears verbatim twice; "map cultural patterns," "measuring tape," and "onyx-ink" are repeated mechanically without reweighting. Template cadence dominates: "She [verb]…She [verb]…She [verb]…" runs across most paragraphs. Figurative language is dense but often stock ("a perfume of incense and old ledger ink," "pages fluttered like restless crowds"). The closure beat is obscured by abstract declaration rather than concrete image. Apply −1.4 for pervasive loops and template stems, plus −0.3 for stock metaphor strings in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The core premise—cartomancer mapping post-crypto-crash cultural patterns with a measuring tape and tarot cards—is a fresh synthesis of elements. However, execution leans heavily on prompt vocabulary ("reverse engineering," "inherited mystery," "map cultural patterns," "onyx-ink cartomancer") without transforming these into lived specifics. The narrative arc is generic (mystic seeks pattern, finds it, steps into night) and could function unchanged with different proper nouns. No risk-taking in structure or perspective; the piece plays it safe with atmospheric tableau.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The onyx-ink cartomancer is present throughout and performs actions (spreads cards, pulls tape, records measurements), satisfying setup and development gates. However, she makes no key choice—every action is observational or procedural. The ending ("stepped into the rain‑washed night, ready to chart the next unseen path") is declaration, not decision. Swappability is high; any mystic could perform these beats. No cost is tied to her specific choices. Cap at 4.6 for weak causal pressure; apply −0.8 for ornamental closure cameo and −0.6 for swappability.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The measuring tape appears in setup (coiled beside her), middle beats (pulled slowly, laid across map, traced spiral, snapped at juncture), and closure (folded like a silent promise). It is handled physically in at least four beats and its "clicks" and "snap" are given sensory weight. However, it does not constrain a choice—she uses it to measure, and the measurements succeed without complication. The tape is specific but does not alter tactics or impose cost. Strong beat involvement (+0.9) and closure linkage (+0.7) elevate the score, but lack of causal pressure (no cost, no narrowed options) caps it below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Reverse engineering is named repeatedly ("by reverse engineering the collapse") and framed as her method. It appears in setup and is thematically present throughout. However, it is never enacted—no on-page demonstration of how she reverses the process or what mechanics are involved. The concept remains a label rather than a tactic that shapes choices or alters stakes. Swappable with "analyzing" or "reconstructing." Functional but replaceable; cap at 4.9. Apply −0.5 for summary-only use and −0.3 for label-only treatment.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Steadily curious" is introduced early as "a trait inherited from a lineage of seers." It recurs at the end ("ever steadily curious") but only as a label. No on-page action is constrained or enabled by curiosity—she proceeds methodically without visible tradeoff between curiosity and caution, speed and care, or any competing impulse. The trait is told, not dramatized. Cap at 4.6 for weak causal pressure; apply −0.5 for label-only use and −0.3 for ornamental closure mention.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Confide" appears in setup ("chose to confide her doubts to the night") and middle ("confiding that the pattern she sought was not merely profit," "confiding her intention to the unseen architects"). The action is present across beats but does not create a turn—nothing changes as a result of her confiding. The void does not answer; no cost or complication arises. The act is poetic decoration rather than a driver of escalation. Functional across beats (+0.9) but no causal pressure or closure linkage. Cap at ~6.0; apply −0.7 for swappability (could be "promised," "vowed," "declared").</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"By multiplying paths" is mentioned once in the middle ("by multiplying paths of old trade routes with the trajectories of meme‑coin memes" and again "By multiplying paths of old merchants with the volatile trajectories of crypto investors"). The method is named but never demonstrated—no arithmetic, no shown process, no mechanics on the page. It does not shape tactics or constrain attempts. Summary-only, swappable with "combining" or "correlating." Cap at 4.6 for no setup in first third; apply −0.6 for summary-only and −0.4 for swappability.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The rain-beaded skylight loft is anchored early and recurs (rain-streaked panes, floorboards, walls that hum, final window). Sensory detail is strong. The loft provides the stage for all action, satisfying setup, middle, and closure gates. However, it does not constrain choice—she could perform these actions anywhere. The loft is vivid but functionally generic workspace. Present across all three gates allows eligibility up to ~6.0; strong sensory integration (+0.5) pushes toward that ceiling, but lack of tactical constraint caps further rise.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"After the cryptocurrency crashes" is established early as backstory context. The timeframe motivates her project (mapping post-crash patterns) and colors the atmosphere ("markets lay shattered like glass"). However, it does not tighten decisions—no clock pressure, no urgency that alters her tactics. The past event is context, not a live constraint. Setup present, thematic coloring in middle, but no closure participation. Cap at 4.6 for missing closure gate; apply −0.3 for ornamental use (does not alter tactics).</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"To map cultural patterns" is stated early and repeated throughout as her goal. It motivates every beat (spreading cards, pulling tape, recording measurements) and is declared achieved at the end ("her maps would become the new lexicon"). However, the desire is never conflicted—no friction between the want and a competing need, no cost that tests her commitment. The motivation is told and pursued without obstacle. Setup, middle involvement, and closure mention satisfy gates; beat involvement (+0.9) and closure linkage (+0.7) support mid-band scoring, but lack of dramatized friction caps it below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Inherited mystery" is introduced early ("inherited from a lineage of seers," "The inherited mystery of her family lingered in the loft's dust") and recurs at closure ("In the inherited mystery, she had found her purpose"). The tone is consistent—reverent, archaic, mystic—and charges the final image. However, it does not modulate with pressure; the register remains static across all beats. Strong setup, middle presence, and closure participation; purposeful early–final reprise reweights the stake. Lyric-resonance allowance applies; score in the 5.5–6.3 range. Slight elevation for closure charge.</comment>
