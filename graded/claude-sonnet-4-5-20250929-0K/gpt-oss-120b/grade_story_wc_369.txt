<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Eli's interior is paint-by-numbers: "quantified sorrow," "scattered dreams," and "what trees witness" remain label-only abstractions never embodied in a micro-choice under pressure. His motivation to discover arboreal memory is told twice but never forces a trade-off or complicates the work. Emotional progression is decorative—"sorrow in his chest ease"—without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final smile and "quiet testament" land as stock epiphany rather than earned endurance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation Test failure: by ~120 words we have "stormlit tower," "labyrinth," "echo-grid," and "astronomer's broken sextant" without clear who-where-when anchors or the nature of Eli's task (−0.4). The piece summarizes the deconstruction in a single sentence ("deconstructed the echo-grid layer by layer") without showing a decision that narrows options; the sextant's supposed healing and the grid's relief occur passively. No on-page reversal or cost forecloses a path; the "quantified sorrow lift[s]" by authorial declaration. Closure reads as Told Transformation with no visible price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The tower, sextant, and oak are named but never constrain a choice or alter tactics. Spatial choreography is vague: Eli "drifts up," "steps into the corridor," and later "descends" with no coherent map. Sensory selection defaults to moonbeam repetition and "rattling wind" without POV-filtered urgency. The sextant's broken limb and the oak's roots are mentioned for atmosphere, not to pressure the work.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—deconstructing the echo-grid—is signaled but never tested. No on-page reversal or tightening narrows options; the sextant guides him through the job without friction, and "each filament he released floated upward" by convenience. The storm "softens" in parallel without causal linkage. The "measurable peace" is declared, not earned through a choice with visible cost. Coincidence (moonlight healing) resolves rather than complicates.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"Quantified sorrow," "mundane miracles," and "what trees witness" are repeated as theme-labels without concrete particulars that reweight them. The ending doubles down: "a quiet testament to the power of mundane miracles" and "their sorrow quantified, their future bright" are thesis statements, not resonant images. The oak's "distant sighs" and the moon's "gentle smile" veer into greeting-card abstraction. No non-literal answer emerges from prior events.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is generic: "rattling wind," "modest glow," "faint tug of memory" could belong to any introspective narrator. Register drifts into elevated diction—"vaulted ceiling," "sigh of the earth," "the world itself approved"—without motivation in a maintenance worker's lexicon. Purposeful elision is absent; every step is narrated with equal ceremonial weight. The phrase "quantified sorrow" recurs six times in identical form, flattening voice under emotional pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: "the sextant could help him map scattered dreams" / "began to trace the faint outlines of dreams"; "quantified sorrow" appears six times without variation; "moonlight" and derivatives recur fifteen times. Template cadence: "He [verb]" anchors most beats with scaffold transitions ("As the moon rose," "When the last strand dissolved," "As he stepped into the night"). Mixed metaphor: the grid is "a lattice of sorrow" yet also hums and releases filaments like data threads. Figurative density in the final third ("the tower seemed to inhale," "moon's gentle smile") obscures causal clarity (−1.2).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The premise—maintenance worker mapping dreams with a broken sextant to heal a sentient maze—assembles quirky tokens (astronomer's tool, quantified emotion, witnessing trees) without grounding them in lived causality or occupational detail. The "mundane miracles" frame is asserted rather than demonstrated through specific transformation. The ending's "touch of magic lingered, waiting to be measured, healed, and shared" reads as prompt echo rather than inevitable synthesis.</comment>
