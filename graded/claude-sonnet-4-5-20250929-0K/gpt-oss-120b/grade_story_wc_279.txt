<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Liora's motivation "to discover meaning in the mess" is declared but never tested by a conflicting want or cost. Her actions—drawing mandalas, whispering to the tile—proceed without internal resistance or embodied stakes. The violinist arrives as a second character but adds no pressure or relationship crucible; he simply echoes her gestures. Interiority relies on abstract labels ("lilac unease," "emergent hush") rather than concrete, contradictory impulses acting in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who and where by the opening, satisfying the test. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: density and pattern should build toward a cadence shift or reweighted image. However, no meaningful tightening occurs; each beat (lifting the tile, drawing the mandala, the violinist's arrival) restates the same atmospheric effect without narrowing options or altering knowledge. The ending recycles "lilac unease" and "emergent hush" without visible cost or a reconfigured stake, failing the closure requirement.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The grotto's mist and slick walls are vividly described and the tile flake functions as a recurring object. The sand mandala serves as micro-setting. However, neither environment nor object constrains a choice or alters tactics; they remain decorative anchors for atmosphere. The final image mentions the tile and mist but does not charge them with new meaning or consequence, keeping the score mid-band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"discover meaning in the mess"—is signaled early but never tested or tightened. Liora's actions (tracing spirals, whispering to the tile) encounter no resistance, reversal, or cost. The violinist's arrival adds a parallel gesture but no escalation or choice under pressure. No live option is foreclosed, and the "emergent hush" merely accumulates descriptive mentions without narrowing tactics or stakes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Theme—unlearning as shedding assumptions, silence as language—is stated directly rather than earned through specific struggle. The piece declares "meaning can arise from mess" in exposition, not through dramatized consequence. The tile, mandala, and mist recur but do not shift meaning at closure; the violinist's arrival restates rather than reprices the premise. No earned wisdom arises from concrete cost or conflict.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Liora, with a brief clean shift to the violinist in the final beat marked by a section-like pause. Diction is elevated and consistent ("lilac unease," "emergent hush") but veers into prompt-echo phrases that feel assembled rather than lived. The tile's dialogue substitute—"a ripple of silence"—avoids naturalism issues but borders on over-figuration. No head-hopping, but voice lacks perceptual signature; Liora and the violinist notice in nearly identical terms.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Template cadence and paraphrase loops pervade: "Each line was a question, each curve a tentative answer"; "Each grain of sand became a memory released, each line drawn an invitation." Figurative language clusters densely without clear payoff—"mist curling like breath," "pastel peace," "lilac-tinged veil." Stock metaphors ("captured sigh," "warm stone at the base of her spine") and filter-verb stacks ("felt," "seemed," "sensed") dull immediacy. Synonym churn ("hush," "quiet," "silence") loops across adjacent lines. Apply −1.2 in Q7 (template + loops + mixed metaphors) and disallow 9+ globally per artifact rules.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>The premise—artist communes with mystical object to achieve atmospheric epiphany—follows a familiar mystical-encounter template. "Emergent hush" and "unlearning" function as prompt labels rather than transformed concepts. The violinist's arrival mirrors Liora's arc without adding friction or surprise. No fresh inflection or synthesis; the closure recycles the opening mood without a non-obvious turn. Specificity in the mandala and tile remains ornamental, not structurally irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Liora is present throughout and her occupation (chalk artist) is mentioned, but her choices do not create key turns. She draws mandalas routinely; lifting the tile and tracing spirals proceed without decision pressure or cost. The story could function with a generic "artist" or "seeker" with minimal edits. Present in setup and closure but ornamental in development.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The tile appears in setup (lifted, hums), middle (hovers, syncs with mandala), and ending (lifts, sheds surface, releases mist). It touches three beats but its function remains static: it hums and amplifies the hush without constraining choice or altering tactics. The final "shedding its surface" adds visual detail but not causal weight. Functional across beats but swappable with any resonant mystical object.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Emergent hush" recurs as a label throughout, anchoring the atmospheric stakes. However, it never shapes a decision or tightens options; characters respond to it identically (drawing, playing music) without friction. It functions as theme rather than causal force. Present in setup, middle, and closure, but ornamental—a descriptor, not a driver.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>"Socially perceptive" is mentioned once in the opening ("She was socially perceptive, noticing that each echo carried a fragment of a conversation") but never constrains or enables an action. Liora interacts with the tile and mandala, not other people, rendering the trait inert. The violinist arrives but no social perception is dramatized. Label-only mention, no visible tradeoff or beat involvement.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Interject" appears twice: "interject meaning into the grains" and the violinist "let his melody interject." Both uses describe the act of adding or weaving in, but neither creates a turn or alters options. The word could be replaced with "infuse," "weave," or "channel" without changing the narrative. Functional label, not a pivot action.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The sand mandala is signaled early (setup), used in the middle beat (Liora traces spirals, the tile syncs with geometry), and present in the ending (the violinist's notes shift its patterns). It shapes two beats and the mechanics—spiral geometry channeling the hush—matter on the page. However, the method does not constrain attempts or force a choice; it succeeds without friction. Functional across beats, but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The grotto is described vividly in setup and remains present throughout (mist curling, walls breathing). However, it does not pressure choices or supply tactical resources; Liora and the violinist perform their rituals unimpeded. The mist settles at the end as a visual effect, not a consequence of setting constraint. Present across beats but postcard function, not crucible.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"During the unlearning" frames the timeframe abstractly in the opening and middle reflection. However, no clock or urgency tightens decisions; "unlearning" remains a thematic concept, not a temporal pressure. The story could unfold "during meditation" or "at twilight" with identical pacing. Vague and untethered to tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>"To discover meaning in the mess" is declared in the opening and rephrased at closure ("meaning can arise from mess"). Liora's actions—drawing, whispering—align with the desire, but no conflicting want or cost creates friction. The motivation is told and restated, not dramatized through trade-offs. Present in setup and closure but lacks on-page struggle or choice under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Lilac unease" is named in setup, middle, and ending, modulating slightly from "unease" to "calm" to "peace." Tone remains coherent and the color-mood recurs purposefully. However, the shift from unease to peace occurs passively—no choice or cost precipitates it. The tone charges the final image visually but not causally. Functional reprise, mid-band integration.</comment>
