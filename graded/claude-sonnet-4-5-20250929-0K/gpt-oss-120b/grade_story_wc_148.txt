<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The boy remains an abstract symbol rather than a felt character. Interiority consists of poetic gestures ("chasing hush," "heart beat steady with purpose") without embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. The mother's vanishing and the lattice are told as backstory labels; no on-page action dramatizes internal conflict or a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. The final "peace" is declared, not earned through dramatized struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation remains vague past 120 words (who is the boy by name or age, when is this occurring, what immediate threat drives him). The Drive Lens is ambiguous—neither causal linkage nor accumulative pattern is taught early or held at closure. The ending declares transformation ("legend transformed into a guiding light") without an on-page decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing that makes before/after legible with felt cost. No specific choice or renunciation forecloses a path on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Vivid atmospheric phrases ("copperlight repose," "jagged reef") anchor mood, but spatial choreography is unclear—how the boy moves from cell to chamber to reef lacks coherent blocking. The lattice and chest function as plot tokens rather than objects that constrain choice. The reef's "hidden fissures" appear only in exposition without shaping an on-page action or the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake ("chasing hush," redemption from false alarms) is declared but never tested by a reversal or tightening that narrows options. The boy encounters no resistance; the lattice provides powers without cost, the map appears conveniently, and bodies rise "in grateful silence" without conflict. No on-page choice or renunciation forecloses a path; coincidence (fog, glowing map) advances plot without protagonist agency.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The redemption-from-false-alarms premise is stated repeatedly ("every warning is a thread, not a wall") rather than dramatized through particulars. The lattice and hush function as floating symbols without grounding in concrete choice or trade-off. The final paragraph moralizes ("became a beacon of truth") instead of offering a resonant image that reweights prior material. No counter-reading or ambiguity; the story telegraphs its moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Register oscillates between lyric elevation ("copperlight repose settled on the damp floor, painting every cracked tile") and narrative summary without a stable focalizer. POV certainty exceeds what the boy can know ("bodies rose in grateful silence," "future callers"). Diction like "sustaining impossibilities" and "thread a labyrinth with your own story" feels externally imposed rather than voice-specific. The boy's perceptual signature is generic poetic rather than character-particular.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade: "chasing hush" / "promise of peace" / "mythic quiet" restate the same idea without added pressure; "hover" appears five times without causal variation; "copperlight repose" bookends without reweighting. Template cadence runs: "He stepped… He followed… He reached… He lifted… He stepped…" across consecutive paragraphs. Figurative density ("lattice… seemed to sustain impossibilities, bending light and shadow") appears in most lines without pattern-teaching or payoff, obscuring causality and dulling the closure image. Mixed metaphors: the lattice "resonated" yet also "clung to his skin like salvation."</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The boy-who-cried-wolf reversal (from false alarms to true guide) is a familiar template executed without fresh particulars. The lighthouse-prison, glowing lattice, and mystical map are stock fantasy elements assembled without transformation. The ending's "beacon of truth" resolves into a tidy, abstract moral rather than a specific, non-obvious synthesis. No bold risk or unconventional choice heightens stakes; the piece retreats to safe allegory.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>The "cry wolf boy who cried wolf's son" appears as backstory label and thematic echo but makes no on-page decision that alters tactics or creates a turn. He follows the lattice's guidance passively; no choice reflects internal conflict or cost tied to his legend.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The lattice appears in multiple beats (carved into palm, glows, pulses, resonates) but functions as a convenience device—it provides powers (bending light, hovering, unlocking chest, sustaining impossibilities) without cost or tradeoff. It does not constrain choice; the boy never faces a decision shaped by the lattice's limits. Present throughout but swappable with any magical token.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Chasing hush" is mentioned repeatedly as thematic desire ("promise of peace," "mythic quiet") but never dramatized as a stake that shapes on-page action. The hush "answered" at the end without the boy making a choice or sacrifice to achieve it. Label-only integration.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Sustains impossibilities" is stated as a trait of the lattice but the mechanics remain vague. The boy hovers and bends light without visible cost or limitation. The attribute does not constrain an on-page action or force a tradeoff; it is a label for convenient magic.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Hover" appears five times but functions as description rather than decisive action. The boy hovers above boards, toward the reef's edge, and between worlds, yet none of these moments drives a turn or redefines options. Easily replaceable with "walked" or "moved" without altering stakes.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Through the scuffs on a narrow door left ajar for decades" is mentioned twice but its mechanics do not shape attempts or choices. The door is simply open; no obstacle or decision hinges on the scuffs. Late signal (after first third) and ornamental use.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The lighthouse prison and jagged reef provide atmospheric backdrop but do not pressure choices. The boy moves from cell to chamber to reef without spatial resistance or resource scarcity. The reef's "hidden fissures" appear on a map but do not alter on-page tactics. Postcard description without micro-setting constraint.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"Before they find the bodies" is mentioned once near midpoint but no clock tightens decisions. The boy proceeds at leisure; no urgency or countdown shapes his actions. The bodies are discovered at the end without time pressure having altered tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"To thread a labyrinth with your own story" appears once as abstract motivation but is not dramatized through conflicting wants or costs. The boy's goal to redeem his legend is told rather than tested by a choice that forces a trade-off. Summary-only use.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"Copperlight repose" bookends the story and recurs as atmospheric texture but does not modulate with pressure or charge the final image with new meaning. The tone remains static and declarative throughout; no cadence shift reflects escalation or cost. Present but ornamental.</comment>
