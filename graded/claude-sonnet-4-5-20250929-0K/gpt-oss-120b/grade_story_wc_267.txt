<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The bellhop remains an allegorical placeholder—"seraphically mundane" is declared but never embodied through contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. His motivations are inferred from symbolic gestures (placing the bolt) rather than dramatized through internal conflict or competing wants. The guests exist as a collective abstraction ("they") with no individuated stakes or reactions, flattening what could be relational pressure. The nerve-regeneration premise is told as ambient metaphor, not anchored in bodily sensation or choice-altering cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the bolt placement deepens the amber-to-copper discoloration and aligns the guests' internal rhythms, creating a pattern-break that reweights "unpardonable silence" without causal reversal. Orientation anchors arrive late—who the guests are, why they entered, and what nerve regeneration means remain vague past the 120-word mark, triggering the −0.3 to −0.5 penalty. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (the guests accept silence's cost and carry the memory forward), but the cost is abstract: no on-page forfeiture of warmth, speech, or safety option is dramatized in the final image. The bolt's echo and the deepening hue charge the moment, yet the precise trade-off—what they surrender to stay—remains gestural.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The cobalt fortress, frostbitten air, and dusty spiral staircase are vivid and consistent; the amber-to-copper discoloration functions as micro-setting that charges the closure image when it shifts in response to the bolt. Spatial choreography is clear (base of staircase, music room, spiral ascent). However, the nerve-regeneration timeframe and its bodily effects are never anchored in sensation—no tremor, heat, or perceptual shift that would ground "internal currents aligning"—so the setting's pressure on choice remains conceptual rather than tactile. The snow outside and frost-lined tiles recur purposefully but do not constrain a middle action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—"to understand the cost of safety"—is signaled early and deepened when the bolt's placement shifts the discoloration and the guests' rhythms align, a meaningful tightening under the Accumulative lens. Yet escalation is illustrative: the bellhop's choice to place the bolt and the guests' subsequent acceptance occur without friction, competing wants, or visible loss of another option. No guest voices doubt about lingering, no one attempts departure, no stamina or warmth is spent. The story delivers one pressure point (bolt → hue shift → alignment) but the protagonist agency is passive observation, and the cost—bearing silence—is understood rather than paid in a scene beat that forecloses warmth or speech.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Theme of safety's price and unpardonable silence emerges through image (bolt, discoloration, snow) and the final carry-forward memory, avoiding overt thesis. The bolt's dual nature—mundane iron charged with piano echoes—is purposeful and non-literal. However, the guests' realization ("safety's price was not measured in steel or stone, but in the willingness to bear silence") edges toward summary moralizing in the penultimate paragraph, narrowly avoiding a heavier penalty by anchoring in the prior bolt and hue particulars. The seraphic-mundane paradox of the bellhop is declared more than shown, and "frostbitten hope" recurs as label rather than evolving metaphor.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited collective ("the guests"), with no head-hopping into the bellhop's interiority. Perceptual signature is generic—observations like "frostbitten hope that clung to their throats" and "seraphically mundane" read as authorial register rather than character-filtered perception. Diction is uniform across beats: elevated, deliberate phrasing ("unpardonable silence," "nerve regeneration experiment") that never modulates under pressure or fractures into sharper urgency. No dialogue. The final paragraph's summative tone ("they carried with them the memory") softens closure instead of charging it. Free indirect style is absent; the narration observes from outside rather than inhabiting a distinct mind.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: "unpardonable silence" recurs four times without reweighting; "frostbitten hope" three times; "seraphically mundane" twice in identical phrasing. Template cadence dominates—"The bellhop...," "The guests...," "The bolt..." openers repeat mechanically. Figurative density is high ("bruised sapphire," "frostbitten hope," "seraphic mundanity," "slow heartbeat") without pattern-teaching or escalation, muddling clarity in peak beats. Register drifts into academic abstraction ("nerve regeneration experiment," "emotional or logical non-sequitur") that clashes with the fairy-tale frame. Sentence rhythm is uniform; no propulsion or breath variation. These artifacts touch the closure paragraph ("quiet promise," "seraphic mundanity"), triggering the −1.7 floor and disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The cobalt fortress, nerve regeneration as metaphor, and the piano-bench bolt offer specific texture, but the frame—silent guardian, guests seeking sanctuary, symbolic object—is a familiar allegory without transformation. The bolt's dual nature (mundane + echo-charged) is the freshest inflection, yet its symbolic work is announced rather than discovered through action. The guests' arc (doubt → alignment → acceptance) follows a predictable template, and the ending's carry-forward memory reads as stock closure for quest narratives. No bold risk elevates stakes; the piece hedges into abstract safety rather than committing to a singular, urgent vision.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Present in setup (hovering at the staircase), development (lifts and places the bolt), and closure (turns away, leaving the bolt as monument). The bolt placement is a decision that alters the staircase's hue and the guests' alignment, driving the story's central turn. However, the bellhop's interiority is never dramatized—his silence is trait rather than choice under pressure, and no competing want tests his vigil. Swappable with "silent monk" or "mute custodian" with minor edits. Two beats (placement, departure) + closure linkage + moderate irreplaceability place the score in mid-band, but passivity and trait-label use prevent higher.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Present in setup (mentioned as "from the nearby music room"), development (lifted and placed on the step, its iron gleam and piano-echo properties described), and closure (glinting on the step as monument). The bolt's dual nature—mundane iron + chord echo—enables the discoloration shift and charges the ending image. Two beats (placement, final glint) + closure linkage + moderate specificity (piano-bench origin, not generic tool). However, the bolt's mechanics are illustrative: it "seemed to pulse," but no on-page action tests whether its echo constrains or alters a later choice. Lyric reprise (music room → monument) reweights meaning, qualifying for upper 6-band under the allowance.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Present in setup ("unpardonable silence...wore like a badge"), development (guests "whisper doubts" about the silence, nerve regeneration "pauses" aligning them with the fortress's rhythm), and closure ("accept the unpardonable silence," "bear silence"). The concept shapes the dominant stake (cost of safety = accepting silence) and the ending reweights prior material (guests carry the memory of silence as a trace). Two beats (whispered doubts, acceptance) + closure linkage. However, the concept is told as theme rather than dramatized as a tactical constraint—no scene where speech is tested, forbidden, or traded. Swappable with "vow of stillness" or "enforced quiet" with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Label-only trait. "Seraphically mundane" is declared twice (opening, closing) to describe the bellhop's presence and uniform but never dramatized through contradictory action or choice. No scene tests the paradox: does angelic duty clash with humble service? Does the mundane mask hide seraphic cost? The trait does not constrain or enable any decision with visible trade-off. Ornamental use across two mentions without causal pressure or closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The bellhop's decision to "remain at the foot of the staircase" frames his vigil and sets up the bolt placement; the guests' choice to "remain in safety" at closure mirrors and completes the action, making it thematically indispensable. Present in setup (bellhop's vigil), development (implicit: guests do not depart), and closure (guests "accept...to remain in safety"). The action defines the dominant stake (cost of remaining) and the ending's conceptual repricing. Three beats + closure linkage + high irreplaceability (the story hinges on the stay-versus-leave tension). However, the guests' middle beats are passive—no one attempts departure, so "remain" is a stance rather than a tested decision under friction, capping the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Present in setup ("a single discoloration marked a step, the faintest amber tint"), development (the discoloration "began to shift, the amber tint deepening into a warm copper" after the bolt is placed), and closure (guests "carried with them the memory of the discoloration, a subtle map"). The discoloration functions as signal and mechanism: the bellhop places the bolt upon it, triggering the hue shift that aligns the guests' rhythms. Three beats + closure linkage + moderate specificity (spiral staircase, amber→copper progression). However, the mechanics are illustrative—no scene tests whether the discoloration constrains access, reveals danger, or demands a second interaction. The map metaphor at closure reweights meaning but remains conceptual.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Present throughout: the fortress's "protective ice walls," "cobalt skin," "frostbitten" air, and snow pressure the guests' safety calculus and are woven into the closure image ("cobalt fortress stood...frostbitten hope"). The fortress supplies the dominant constraint (cold, isolation) and the stakes (safety versus warmth). However, no middle beat dramatizes the fortress altering tactics—no blocked passage, no frost injury, no resource scarcity forces a trade-off. The setting is atmospheric backdrop rather than active agent. Micro-setting (staircase, bolt, discoloration) does more causal work than the macro-setting (fortress, snow), weakening irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Present in setup ("nerve regeneration experiment that pulsed through the fortress like a slow heartbeat"), development ("the nerve regeneration process...seemed to pause, their internal currents aligning"), and closure ("when the nerve regeneration completed, the guests emerged"). The timeframe brackets the action and the alignment beat keys the guests' unity. However, the duration is vague (hours? days?), the process imposes no visible deadline or degradation, and no choice is tightened by the clock. The timeframe is thematic marker (regeneration = accepting new internal rhythm) rather than tactical pressure. Three mentions across beats + closure linkage, but no cost or urgency tied to elapsed time.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Present in setup ("Their motivation was simple: to understand the cost of safety"), development (guests "whispered doubts about the safety of lingering," then align with the fortress's rhythm), and closure (guests "understood that safety's price was not measured in steel or stone, but in the willingness to bear silence"). The desire drives the dominant stake and the ending delivers the answer. Three beats + closure linkage. However, the motivation is told in exposition rather than dramatized through competing wants—no friction between fear of cold and desire to leave, no character voices conflicting priorities. Swappable with "to learn the price of refuge" with minor edits, and the final understanding is summary rather than lived choice with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Present in setup ("frostbitten hope that still lingered in the air"), middle ("frostbitten hope that clung to their throats refused to melt"), and closure ("frostbitten hope of all who dared to listen," "even in the deepest cold, hope can remain"). The tone coherently threads cold imagery with fragile optimism and modulates slightly as pressure shifts (lingering → clinging → enduring). However, the phrasing is static—identical metaphor across three beats without evolving texture—and the final line's declarative optimism ("hope can remain") flattens the ambiguity built earlier. Tone charges the ending image but does so through repetition rather than cadence shift or fresh inflection, placing the score in mid-band under the Accumulative allowance.</comment>
