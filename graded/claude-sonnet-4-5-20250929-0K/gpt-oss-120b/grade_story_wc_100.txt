<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Marlow's interiority relies heavily on abstract metaphor ("carrier of silence," "weight of centuries") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. His stubbornness is asserted but never dramatized through a micro-choice with visible cost; he places lens fragments without facing a dilemma that would foreclose an option. The ending merges him with the lantern's gleam in a lyric dissolve, but no prior causal chain earns this transformation as a character arc with felt sacrifice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation remains vague past 120 words—who Marlow is beyond "undertaker," why this package matters, and what "after the mysterious package arrived" stakes are never anchored concretely. The closure dissolves Marlow "beneath the waves," but no on-page cost is legible: we see no decision that forecloses a path, no renunciation with price, only lyric merging. The lens reads Accumulative/Textural, yet the final image recycles prior diction ("occupying impossible space," "chased stillness") without a decisive reweighting or felt sacrifice that distinguishes before from after.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The submerged library supplies vivid sensory anchors (water pressure, phosphorescent ink, marble tablets, bioluminescent fish) and the lens cradle on a floating pedestal constrains Marlow's placement choices. Spatial choreography remains coherent across moves. However, the setting never forces a trade-off or alters tactics at closure; Marlow's final vanishing is atmospheric rather than setting-driven, capping the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—giving restless souls a permanent address—is signaled early but never tightened by opposition or scarcity. Marlow places lens shards without impediment; no reversal narrows his options, and no visible price (stamina, tool failure, social cost) alters his tactics. The spirits' soft sighs and the library's glow constitute atmospheric response, not escalation with felt cost. Under an Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening or cadence shift that reweights the stake is required; here the ending recycles prior imagery without new pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The theme of rest as sanctuary emerges from concrete actions—lens placement, light pulses, spirit sighs—without overt moralizing. The recurring motif of "occupying impossible spaces" and "permanent address" returns at closure, reweighting the premise. Yet the final paragraph's line "a lighthouse for the lost" edges toward thematic summary, and the ending offers a resonant image without a non-literal answer that challenges prior assumptions or introduces undeniable cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Third-person POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present but generic: Marlow notices arches, water, and light without character-particular bias. Diction frequently elevates into lyric register ("phosphorescent ink that floated like ghosts," "each beam of light a promise") that feels authorial rather than emerging from an undertaker's lexicon. No dialogue appears. Psychic distance stays consistent, but voice lacks the textural specificity and rhythm control under pressure required for higher bands.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and template cadence abound: "occupying impossible spaces" appears thrice, "permanent address" four times, "chased stillness" twice, all within tight proximity without reweighting. Figurative density is high in every beat ("patient sigh," "trembling eye," "fractured hope," "sung its soft hymn") with mixed vehicles (a library cannot "breathe," a lens cannot "sing"). Sentence stems recur: "The library's…," "Marlow…," "The light…" Scaffold phrasing like "he believed that," "he understood that," and "the core concept of" front-loads explanation. These artifacts touch the closure paragraph ("the library's glow seeped," "a chased stillness that promised"), triggering the −1.7 penalty and disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The premise—underwater library as sanctuary for the dead—combines familiar gothic and solarpunk elements without a non-obvious synthesis. The "broken lens as beacon" and "undertaker lighting a lighthouse" read as metaphor-driven rather than grounded in choice-driven particulars. Marlow's task is explained early ("the core concept of distress signals"), reducing discovery. The ending's lyric dissolve ("vanished beneath the waves, forever occupying the impossible space") recycles the opening's diction, creating circular resonance but no transformation test surprise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Marlow is on the page throughout and his lens-placement actions occupy multiple beats. However, his choices do not create key turns; he moves through the library placing shards without facing a dilemma that alters tactics or forecloses an option. The final vanishing is atmospheric, not a decision-driven reversal. Swappability: another caretaker or guide could perform identical moves with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The broken lighthouse lens appears in beat one (arrival), beat two (placement on pedestal), beat three (re-pieced projection onto dome), beat four (last shard floated above floor), and closure (lens holds fast, Marlow merges with gleam). Its fragmented state enables the re-assembly action and its light pulses constitute the distress signal mechanic. However, the lens does not constrain a choice or introduce a visible cost; Marlow assembles it without impediment. Present across beats and in closure, but causally passive, placing it mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Distress signals" is named in paragraph one and returns as "each pulse of illumination sent a distress signal" and "distress signals finally finding a permanent address." The concept frames the premise but does not shape on-page tactics: Marlow never adjusts his approach based on signal failure or iteration. It functions as thematic backdrop rather than a mechanic that alters options, capping it in the functional-but-replaceable band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Inadvertently stubborn" is asserted once ("Marlow was inadvertently stubborn, refusing to let the library's waterlogged aisles dictate the shape of his work") and echoed in closure ("stubborn as the undertaker who dared to occupy the impossible spaces"). No on-page action demonstrates a cost or trade-off driven by stubbornness; the trait is label-only. Late closure reprise without mid-scene use and no visible friction places it in the ornamental band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Revitalize" appears three times: "revitalizing the forgotten city required occupying impossible spaces," "his task was…to revitalize the very concept of rest," and implied in the ending's "library…now breathed with a quiet pulse." The action frames the goal but is not dramatized as a distinct beat with obstacles or iteration. The library's transformation is shown through light and spirit response, yet "revitalize" could swap with "restore" or "renew" without structural change, placing it in the shapes-one-turn band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>"Occupying impossible spaces" is introduced early ("revitalizing the forgotten city required occupying impossible spaces—between the broken columns"), recurs mid-story ("corridors that seemed impossible to occupy"), and returns at closure ("forever occupying the impossible space between duty and peace"). The method is asserted but never mechanically specified; Marlow places a floating pedestal and walks water-filled halls without dramatized difficulty or a cost tied to the impossibility. Functional across beats but its mechanics do not alter tactics, placing it in the functional-but-replaceable band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The underwater library supplies the frame, resources (marble pedestal, alcove, vaulted ceiling, floating position), and sensory pressure (water pressing "like a patient sigh," crushing pressure against light). The setting constrains placement—pedestal in alcove, shard three meters above floor—and the library's response (glowing tablets, spirit sighs) constitutes the story's resolution. Removing the library would break the logic of light-as-sanctuary and the ending's image of the glow "seeped into the abyss." Present in setup, middle choices, and closure, with causal contribution, placing it solidly in the essential-across-beats band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>"After the mysterious package arrives" anchors the inciting moment but the timeframe is never tracked on the page. No urgency, countdown, or temporal tightening shapes Marlow's choices; the task unfolds in a single continuous action without time pressure. The package is mentioned once at arrival and once at departure ("the package now empty") without intervening reference. Present in setup and closure mention but does not constrain tactics, placing it in the ornamental band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"To give rest a permanent address" is stated twice: "his purpose fulfilled: to give rest a permanent address" and echoed in "spirits found a permanent address—an oasis of silence." The motivation drives Marlow's lens-placement actions across beats and the spirits' settlement at closure links directly to this desire. However, the motivation is never conflicted; no on-page friction tests whether Marlow would sacrifice his own peace or resources to achieve it. Shapes the goal and closure but lacks dramatized cost, placing it in the shapes-one-turn band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Chased stillness" appears in paragraph one setup, mid-story ("In the chased stillness of the water-filled atrium"), and final paragraph ("a chased stillness that promised all who entered would never be truly forgotten"). The tone remains consistent—hushed, elegiac, lyric—and the final reprise reweights "chased" from pursued to achieved stillness. The early-to-final arc and the tonal charging of the closure image meet the lyric-resonance allowance, but the tone does not modulate with pressure (Marlow encounters no obstacle that would break the stillness), capping it at mid-6s.</comment>
