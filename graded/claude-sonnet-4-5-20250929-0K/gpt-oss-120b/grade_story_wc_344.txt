<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The locksmith remains abstract—a cipher pursuing "the rhythm of repair" without embodied emotion or contradictory impulses. His motivation is declared ("simple yet ancient") but never tested by competing wants or costs; he encounters no friction, makes no trade-offs, and experiences no transformation beyond retrieving a gear. The final moment ("heart heavy with driftwood nostalgia, yet hopeful") asserts feeling rather than earning it through micro-choices under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: images and objects accrue without causal linkage. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive quickly, and the ending offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (the clock ticks, the locksmith departs with it), but the cost is asserted ("heart heavy") rather than legible in a choice or forfeiture. The prophecy scraps, mirror hall, and gear assembly proceed in and-then fashion; no decision narrows options or reweights the dominant stake through visible price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The frozen library, mirrored hall, and gear pedestal are vividly rendered and spatially coherent. The gear assortment constrains the locksmith's task (he must assemble it), and the mirror hall returns at closure, charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective and atmospheric, filtered through the locksmith's quest, though the environment itself does not force a tactical choice that alters outcome.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—learning the rhythm of repair—is signaled early but never faces escalation or cost. The locksmith encounters no reversal, no opposition, and no price; the prophecy guides him, the gears click into place, and the clock mends without friction. The resolution is gift-wrapped by prophecy rather than earned by protagonist agency, and no live option is foreclosed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The theme of repair and time emerges through recurring images (gears, clocks, mirrors, prophecy) and the final image of the ticking clock. However, thematic depth is announced rather than dramatized: "every repair sang its own story" and "rhythm of repair pulse within his chest" edge toward moralizing. The ending offers resonance through the departure and steady clock, but the locksmith's journey lacks the friction that would elevate theme beyond pleasant abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The prose maintains a consistent lyric distance and poetic register ("filament of light that curled like a whisper," "heartbeat steadied"). However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("pulse that steadied broken time," "lullaby for the ages") that reads more like thematic label than lived perception. No dialogue appears. Psychic distance is stable, but the focalizer's perceptual signature is generic—he notices beauty and mystery without character-specific bias or blind spot.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Figurative density is high and occasionally overwrites pressure: "coat frayed like old driftwood," "ink trembling like sea-foam," "gears...shimmering like frozen rain," "hands shivered, then aligned" stack metaphors in quick succession without pattern-teaching or payoff. Paraphrase loops appear: "The gears were silent, waiting" → "feeling the pulse of possibility rise" → "The words resonated, and the gears...clicked together" restates readiness across three beats. Sentence openings vary and rhythm modulates, but information density is low in the final third, where action is summarized rather than pressured.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The locksmith-of-celestial-alignments premise and frozen-library-above-clouds setting offer surface novelty, but the arc is template: quest → prophecy → hall of trials → artifact retrieval → departure. The prophecy functions as a convenience device, guiding the locksmith without resistance or cost. Emotional specificity is absent; "driftwood nostalgia" and "quiet hopes" are labels rather than lived particulars. The transformation test fails: swap names and props, and the emotional arc (resolve declared problem with magical artifact) remains generic.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The lunar-eclipse locksmith is present throughout and performs the central action (assembling the gear, mending the clock), satisfying setup, development, and payoff gates. However, his choices are passive—following prophecy, lifting lids, uncapping boxes—rather than decisive. No turn traces to his agency; the prophecy and mirrored hall deliver the solution. He could be swapped for any quest-fulfiller with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The clockmaker's gear assortment appears on the pedestal, is assembled by the locksmith after the prophecy unlocks it, and is placed into the broken clock at closure, satisfying all three gates. It drives two beats (discovery, assembly) and shapes the ending. However, the gears are interchangeable magical objects; their specific properties (silver, amber, shimmering) do not constrain tactics or impose cost. Strong closure linkage lifts the score, but swappability and lack of causal pressure prevent higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The hall of mirrors is seeded early (prophecy fragments), entered at midpoint, and returns in the ending passage ("hall of mirrors would wait"). It enables the locksmith to see "countless versions" of himself and frames the gear assembly. However, it does not constrain choice or alter tactics—he kneels, uncaps, assembles—without friction. The hall functions as atmospheric setting rather than active pressure. Early seed and closure reprise reach mid-band; lack of causal work prevents higher.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The "hauntingly bright" glow appears in two beats (cutting through frost, intensifying at closure) and guides the locksmith to the hall, satisfying setup and payoff gates. However, it is decorative light rather than a trait with cost: it does not constrain or enable action, and the locksmith never trades anything to follow it. The attribute is label-only and could be replaced with "pale" or "golden" without structural change.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Uncap" anchors the climactic beat: the locksmith uncaps the silver box, releasing the filament that unlocks the gear pedestal. This action is present in setup (tools chest), drives the middle turn (uncapping releases the key), and enables closure (gears assemble, clock mends). However, the act itself is trivial—lifting a lid—and the cost is zero. The major turn (gear assembly) depends on the uncapping, earning mid-band placement, but swappability (could be "unlock," "twist," "open") and lack of visible price prevent higher scores.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Scraps of prophecy hidden in the library's corner are discovered early, guide the locksmith to the hall, and supply the redemptive line he whispers at the gear pedestal, satisfying all three gates. The method shapes two beats (discovery, assembly) and is essential to the ending. However, the prophecy is a convenience device—it tells him where to go and what to say—without requiring interpretation, cost, or failure. Early signal and closure linkage reach mid-band; lack of friction and swappability (any magical map would serve) prevent higher.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The frozen library above clouds is anchored immediately, houses the prophecy and gear pedestal, and supplies the final departure image. It is present across all three gates and frames the quest. However, the library does not pressure choice: frost and crystal volumes are decorative, and the locksmith moves through it without obstacle. The setting is vivid and purposeful but postcard-functional rather than causal. Continuous presence and closure linkage secure low 6-band; lack of tactical constraint prevents higher.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Under the soft hush of a distant morning" appears in the opening line and returns in the final paragraph ("distant morning stretched its thin fingers"). The timeframe is poetic atmosphere rather than a live clock: no deadline tightens the locksmith's moves, and elapsed time is vague. Setup and payoff gates are met through lyric reprise, but the morning does not alter tactics or escalate pressure. Decorative presence and lack of urgency cap the score.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"To learn the rhythm of repair" is stated early as the locksmith's motivation and echoed at closure ("rhythm of repair pulse within his chest"). However, the desire is never dramatized through conflicting wants, costs, or friction. The locksmith pursues repair without hesitation, sacrifice, or obstacle; the prophecy and gears grant success without testing commitment. Told-only motivation with lyric reprise satisfies setup and payoff but lacks the friction required for higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Driftwood nostalgia" appears as a label in the departure beat ("heart heavy with driftwood nostalgia") and colors the prose's lyric, melancholy register throughout (frayed coat, sea-foam ink, quiet hopes). The tone is coherent and modulates slightly (wonder in the hall, resolve at assembly, wistfulness at departure), satisfying all three gates. However, the tone is static mood rather than pressure-responsive modulation, and "driftwood nostalgia" is asserted rather than embodied. Continuous presence and closure linkage secure mid-band; lack of charge and peak modulation prevent higher.</comment>
