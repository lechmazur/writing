<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The "veiled dreamer" remains a cipher throughout—no distinct interiority, no embodied emotion, no contradictory impulses. The protagonist's motivation is declared but never tested by a competing desire or cost; the watch-decoding proceeds without genuine struggle or foreclosed paths. Interiority consists of stock phrasing ("cautious exuberance," "heart swelling") rather than character-particular perception. The final "vow" arrives without dramatized internal conflict or visible price.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed well past 120 words with no payoff—"glowing library in mist" remains a floating placeholder, and spatial anchors never cohere (shelves, alcove, chamber, labyrinth, garden cascade without legible transitions). The drive lens is ambiguous: causal linkage is weak (gears "cyclically reversed" without clear mechanical consequence), accumulative patterning is attempted but never teaches its rule, and situational pressure never crystallizes a stance. Closure is asserted—"we had finally found the secret we chased"—but no on-page cost is legible; the discovery arrives without foreclosing an option or altering tactics. The "living script" and "propagation delays" are named repeatedly but never constrain a choice.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The "glowing library in mist" functions as generic atmosphere rather than a constraint; spatial choreography collapses across the alcove-chamber-labyrinth-garden sequence with no stable anchors. Sensory detail cycles through "glow," "shimmer," "hum," "mist" without POV filter or tactical relevance. The watch and crystal are handled on the page but their physical properties (brass, gears, ticking) never shape a choice. The Orientation Test penalty (−0.3 to −0.5) was applied in Q2; here the setting's failure to constrain any decision limits the score.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"to find the library of unspoken words"—is declared but never tested by a competing cost or narrowed by a reversal. The watch's "unfolding cipher" and "cyclically reversed" gears are named at every turn but never create a tactical problem or force a trade-off. The "propagation delays" allow the pair to "anticipate the next reversal," erasing rather than raising pressure. Coincidence governs progression: alcoves open, glyphs rearrange, the crystal "resonates" and "projected a map" without protagonist agency or visible price. No foreclosed path, no escalation under any lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Theme is stated rather than earned: "the library itself was a cipher, its passages encoded in time's own language" and the dreamer's closing line ("Each petal holds a promise…") function as prompt echoes rather than emergent insight. The "unspoken words" motif recurs but does not reweight prior material—petals, glyphs, and syllables are ornamental rather than charged by cost. The ending offers no non-literal answer; it summarizes the quest in declarative terms. Thematic Echo penalty (−0.6) applies to the final-paragraph moralizing ("a story that once spoken, will never fade").</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person, but the narrative voice is generic and tonally flat—"cautious exuberance" is labeled rather than rhythmically embodied. Perceptual signature is absent: the narrator notices "halos," "murmurs," "glyphs" in undifferentiated catalog fashion. The veiled dreamer has no distinct speech or interior texture; her two lines of dialogue ("Each petal holds a promise…") could belong to anyone. Filter verbs ("I noted," "We realized," "I recorded") cluster without voice motivation, and stock constructions ("heart swelling") recur. The prose lacks rhythmic modulation under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade: "cyclically reversed" appears five times, "propagation delays" four times, "cautious exuberance" three times, all in identical syntactic slots without variation or payoff. Template cadence dominates: "We [verb], [object]" and "The [noun] [verb], [result]" recur across twenty sentences. Stock metaphors ("letters that rearranged themselves," "floating glyphs," "echoing syllables") replace concrete action. Mixed metaphor: letters "sang," vowels "burst into radiant laughter," words "grew as luminous petals" without coherent vehicle. Figurative density in the final third (garden sequence) obscures the closure image rather than sharpening it. Applying −1.4 for template cadence, loops, and figurative muddle that touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Core premise—secret library accessed by cipher-watch—reads as a template fantasy-quest setup without transformation. The "unfolding cipher," "cyclically reversed" gears, and "propagation delays" are jargon labels rather than specific mechanics that generate fresh turns. The ending (luminous petals waiting to be plucked) is a stock reward-scene image. No bold risk-taking; the piece cycles through alcove-chamber-labyrinth-garden in predictable escalation without a non-obvious synthesis or a turn that feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>The veiled dreamer is present throughout but never makes a key choice. She lifts the latch (one action) and brushes a vowel (another), but neither turn alters tactics or costs; the narrator drives all decisions. Her whispered line in the opening and final-paragraph dialogue are ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The watch appears in six beats: clutched (opening), gears noted on parchment, hands spin backward/forward, resonates with crystal, chimes at the end, and the rhythm is confirmed through propagation delays. It enables mid-scene decoding and signals the final gate opening, shaping two beats and contributing to closure. However, its "unfolding cipher" mechanic is never dramatized as a constraint or cost—gear movement is described but does not force a trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The "unfolding cipher" is named repeatedly (watch cipher, glyphs as cipher, library as cipher, final alignment) but functions as a thematic label rather than a stake-shaping mechanism. The cipher never narrows options or imposes a visible cost; decoding proceeds smoothly without error or sacrifice. It frames expectation but does not constrain middle choices.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Cyclically reversed" is applied five times (gears, glyphs, symphony) but remains label-only; no on-page action demonstrates what "reversed" means mechanically or how it constrains a choice. The trait is ornamental—removing it would require only synonym edits.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Document" appears in four beats: setting up parchment, noting delay patterns, filling it fast, and the final vow to document every petal. It frames the quest method but does not drive a turn—no choice hinges on what is recorded, and the parchment's content never alters tactics. Functional but replaceable with "observe" or "record."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"Through propagation delays" is named four times and enables the pair to "sense the rhythm" and "anticipate the next reversal," but the mechanic is never shown on the page—no wait, no miscalculation, no cost. It resolves problems it did not help create (final gate opening). Summary-only use; cap 3.4 for missing middle development as constraint.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The "glowing library in mist" is signaled in the opening and returns as backdrop through alcove, chamber, labyrinth, garden; the glow "intensified" and "faded behind us" at closure. However, spatial properties never constrain a choice—doorways open on cue, passages yield without navigation cost. The mist wraps around them at the threshold but does not alter tactics. Present across beats but postcard-level; no tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"Between two fateful letters etched on the marble arch" appears once in the opening and is never revisited or clarified. No clock tightens decisions; time is untraceable. The element is ornamental and does not shape any beat.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"To find the library of unspoken words" is stated in the opening, drives the quest frame, and is declared fulfilled at the pedestal and garden. However, the desire is never dramatized as conflicted—no competing want, no cost paid to continue. Friction is absent; the motivation is told and consistent but does not generate on-page pressure. One clear beat (opening setup), one reprise at closure with declarative fulfillment.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"Cautious exuberance" is labeled three times (opening, mid-sequence, final paragraph) but never rhythmically embodied—syntax and diction remain uniform across discovery beats. Tone is asserted rather than modulated; no tonal shift under pressure. Present at closure but static.</comment>
