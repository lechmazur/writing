<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Arlen is granted interiority and a consistent trait (polished calm), but his choices across the piece feel more observed than embodied. The pivot from startup rise to train markers to dawn walk reads as conceptual movement rather than struggle; no on-page impulse forces him to *test* the calm he inherited. The foreign-currency motif and the circus-train boundary-setting are gestures toward internal stakes, yet they never press him into a visible trade-off or foreclose a path with dramatized cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece moves from startup ambition → physical markers → crash → dawn resolve in a plausible Accumulative/Textural arc. Orientation anchors are present but slow: "son of a feared highway robber" and "LoopForge" arrive early, yet *when* and *where* the startup sits remains hazy until "office, a converted warehouse." The closure—Arlen pocketing the last bill and walking toward the co-working space—signals a stance shift but lacks visible or felt cost: no dramatized renunciation or consequence that forecloses the old loop. The final paragraph asserts "measured hope" rather than *showing* what he surrenders to step forward.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The abandoned circus train is vividly rendered ("rusted caravan of cracked wagons…faded banners and empty seats"), and the warehouse office provides dusky light as a recurring atmospheric tag. However, neither setting constrains a choice at a pivotal moment. The foreign notes pinned in the train are handled descriptively, but they do not pressure Arlen's tactics or alter his options on the page. The co-working space at the end is named but not used; the train remains postcard atmosphere rather than a micro-setting that tilts the closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—why paths circle back—is named explicitly, but no on-page tightening forces Arlen to choose between competing goods or pay a visible price. Maya's objection to the markers is "gently dissuaded" without friction or consequence, and the startup crash arrives as summarized backstory ("clients withdrew, servers stalled, and investors fled") rather than dramatized reversal. The final realization that "circles are not failures but the universe's method of testing whether travelers remember the roads they once left" is told, not enacted; no decision narrows options or raises cost under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The theme—loops as testing rather than failure—emerges from the circus train, the algorithm's territorial markers, and Arlen's inherited restlessness, all specific to his biography. The final image of the last bill and the walk toward the co-working space *attempts* to reweight the circuit motif, but the insight is stated ("circles are not failures…") rather than dramatized through a concrete choice with cost. The piece resists overt moralizing until that penultimate paragraph, which edges toward thematic echo. Still, the currency collection and the train's boundary markers provide enough particularity to lift the score above generic territory.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited holds steadily on Arlen; no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks. The prose carries a consistent, slightly elevated register ("dusky harmony," "polished calm") that matches the reflective, observational stance but risks convergence with the narrative voice—Arlen's internal texture is hard to distinguish from authorial description. Dialogue with Maya is brief and functional, lacking subtext or goal pursuit. The perceptual signature leans on the "polished calm" motif but does not modulate under the startup crash; stress should narrow or distort perception, yet the syntax and diction remain uniform.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Information density is moderate; most sentences advance character or setting. However, the piece cycles through "polished calm," "dusky," and "territorial markers" as fixed phrases across multiple beats without deepening their charge—template cadence and synonym loops in "calm…perceptively calm…polished calm that never cracked…remained perceptively calm…the same polished calm" (−0.4). Figurative language ("bright arc," "low chord," "quiet purpose") clusters in the reflective second half without pattern-teaching, risking decorative drift (−0.3). No critical opacity or causality break, but propulsion sags in the middle paragraphs where exposition summarizes LoopForge's rise rather than dramatizing beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The combination of highway-robber legacy, foreign currency, startup culture, and circus-train physicalization offers a non-obvious synthesis. Yet the emotional arc—restless son seeks pattern amid rise-and-fall—echoes template "founder learns humility" plots without a fresh moral calculus or lived cost. The circus train as analogue for digital markers is ingenious in concept but remains ornamental; swapping it for another liminal site (warehouse, pier, library) would not break the logic. The final walk toward the co-working space reads as safe middle ground, hedging on whether Arlen truly transforms or merely iterates.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Highway robber's son frames Arlen's restless curiosity in paragraph one and resurfaces in the penultimate paragraph ("the weight of his father's legacy transform into a quiet purpose"). Present in setup and closure, but no middle beat shows him choosing *because* of that legacy. The identity enables thematic resonance but does not constrain or enable a tactic under pressure. Two-gate participation (setup + closure), minimal causal work: mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Foreign paper money appears early (smelled of distant ports), returns when Arlen pins notes in the train, and closes when he pockets "the last foreign bill, a crisp euros." Three beats; the collection shifts from memory object to boundary marker to keepsake. Yet the currency never *constrains* a choice—Maya's objection is verbal, not resource-based—and the final pocketing is symbolic rather than causal. Strong reprise with reweighted meaning, but no pressure linkage: eligible for ~6.0–6.3.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Polished calm is named repeatedly and tied to Arlen's observational distance. It frames his stance during the founders' panic and carries through the crash, but it does not *change* tactics or force a trade-off. The concept functions as trait and theme label rather than stake-shaping force. Present across all three zones (setup, middle, closure) but largely decorative; label-only use (−0.3) limits the score to mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Perceptively calm appears as a synonym for polished calm and anchors Arlen's detached observation ("observing…with equal distance"). The trait enables him to dissuade Maya without friction, but no on-page cost or constraint is visible—his calm never cracks under the crash, so the attribute remains untested. Present in setup and middle, absent from closure action; no visible trade-off: cap 4.6 for missing closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Arlen dissuades Maya from expanding routes freely (middle beat) and the algorithm later reroutes users away from dead-end loops (result beat). The action is tied to the territorial-marker mechanic and affects the product design, but it does not drive the major turn (the crash arrives externally, not from this choice). Causal role in one key beat, present in closure theme ("measured hope" vs. "endless loops"), but swappable with "constrain" or "redirect" without breaking logic: solid mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Territorial markers are introduced when Arlen proposes using the circus train, physically instantiated with the pinned currency notes, and thematically reprised in the final paragraph ("steady markers of measured hope"). The method appears in setup, middle (algorithm reroutes), and closure reflection. However, the markers do not *constrain* a choice under pressure—Maya's objection is brushed aside, and the crash is external. Three-gate presence with thematic payoff but minimal causal pressure: lyric-resonance allowance brings the score to ~6.3.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Abandoned circus train is introduced mid-story (suggested by Maya), becomes the site for Arlen's marker installation, and returns in the penultimate scene where he walks among the wagons. The train provides vivid atmosphere and a physical site for the territorial-marker metaphor, but it does not pressure a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome. Setup at ~30%, middle use, closure participation: three gates met, but ornamental role (−0.5) limits the score to mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Across a startup's rise and fall structures the macro timeline: LoopForge attracts investors, celebrates funding, then crashes. The arc is present in setup (joining), middle (expansion, funding round), and closure (crash → dawn walk). Yet the time compression is summarized ("Months later…when the inevitable crash arrived") rather than tracked beat-by-beat, and no live clock tightens a decision. Timeframe frames but does not pressure: functional but replaceable, mid-band at best.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>To discover why some paths circle back is stated explicitly in the penultimate paragraph and thematically present in the algorithm's loop-mapping and Arlen's reflections. The motivation is *told* rather than dramatized in conflicted choice: no on-page moment shows Arlen weighing the cost of circling back versus forging ahead. Present in closure reflection but not tested in middle choices; friction between want and cost is asserted, not enacted: cap ~5.3.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Dusky harmony appears in the opening ("dusky light…dusky harmony"), recurs as "polished calm," and returns in the final line ("dusky harmony of the early sky echoing his internal rhythm"). The tone is consistent and modulates slightly (observational distance → reflective acceptance), but it does not *charge* the final image with new pressure—it simply repeats. Three-gate presence with lyric reprise but static mood (−0.3 for ornamental repetition) yields mid-band.</comment>
