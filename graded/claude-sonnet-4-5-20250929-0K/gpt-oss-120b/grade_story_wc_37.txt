<question>1</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Lira is introduced as a "scattered memory keeper" but this trait never constrains a choice or creates internal conflict on the page. Her actions—singing, raising arms, whispering—read as ritual gestures without embodied contradiction or cost. The "bound release of centuries of restraint" is asserted rather than earned through prior struggle. Secondary characters (wandering spirits, visitors) are ornamental; they gather and observe but apply no pressure that alters Lira's stance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Orientation is vague: "mirror world" and "alchemical orchard greenhouse" anchor setting by name but not spatial or temporal boundaries within the opening window. The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens—density increases through layered imagery—but no decisive change, renunciation, or stance crystallization occurs; Lira's purpose is declared at the start and simply enacted without opposition or cost. The final paragraph asserts "permanent sunrise" and "never again surrender to silence" as outcomes, but these are told resolutions rather than on-page closure with felt price. Cost proof test fails: no sentence shows what Lira forfeits or what path is foreclosed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The mica window returns across multiple beats—scattering light, breathing, glowing—and charges the final image as visitors place memories upon it. The orchard's metallic roots, copper-jasmine scent, and silver-bark vines supply vivid sensory anchors. However, spatial choreography is abstract: Lira's position relative to window, trees, and gathering spirits remains unclear, and no environmental constraint shapes a tactical choice. The setting functions as atmospheric backdrop rather than pressure lever.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—rekindling a dying realm—is declared early but never tested by opposition or cost. No on-page reversal narrows options; Lira sings, light spreads, trees respond, visitors arrive, night softens in a linear accumulation without friction. The "forgotten songs" and "woven dawns" succeed immediately upon use, eliminating escalation. Agency is passive: outcomes unfold around Lira's ritual without her making a choice that forecloses an alternative or pays a visible price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The theme of communal renewal through memory and song is stated directly ("knit communities together," "weaving together the hearts of all who listened") rather than emerging from dramatized events. The mica window and woven dawns recur, but as ornamental motifs rather than images that shift meaning or constrain choice. The ending offers a complete, tidy resolution—"never again surrender to silence"—without ambiguity or cost, flattening thematic resonance. The phrase "true alchemy was not in transmuting metal, but in weaving together the hearts" is explicit moralizing that replaces scene pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited with stable distance, but the narrator's perceptual signature is generic: "breathing cathedral," "ribbons of light," "grand mosaic of hope" could apply to many fantasy settings. Diction drifts into elevated abstraction ("bound release of centuries of restraint") that reads unmotivated by the established voice. No dialogue appears. Psychic distance remains consistent, and no head-hopping occurs, but the prose lacks a character-particular filter—Lira's way of noticing does not reflect her "scattered memory" trait.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>Pervasive paraphrase loops and synonym churn: "knits communities together" appears verbatim three times; "woven dawns" recurs in identical phrasing across eight lines without variation or added pressure. Template cadence dominates: "The orchard… began to emit," "The ribbons seeped," "The mirror world… began to pulse." Figurative density is unrelenting—"ribbons of light," "chorus of sunrise fragments," "tapestry of twilight"—without pattern-teaching or payoff, obscuring concrete action. The closure beat ("permanent sunrise," "never again surrender") is abstract assertion rather than image. Deductions: paraphrase loops −0.6, template cadence −0.5, figurative muddle −0.5; total artifact debt −1.6 in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The premise—guardian restores light to a darkened realm through music and memory—follows a familiar redemption-through-art template without transformation. The "alchemical orchard," "mica window," and "forgotten songs" are presented as stock fantasy elements; no specific detail roots them in lived particulars or non-obvious logic. The turn from night to sunrise is linear and complete, lacking the friction or irreversible cost that would distinguish this telling. The final paragraph's explicit theme statement ("true alchemy") undercuts any emergent originality.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>Lira is present throughout but makes no on-page decision that alters tactics or forecloses a path. She enacts a ritual (singing, raising arms, whispering) without opposition or choice. The "scattered memory keeper" label does not constrain or enable any action with cost. Setup present, middle ornamental, closure absent as a decision-maker. Cap at 2.8 (no closure participation); further lowered for ornamental presence.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The mica window appears in at least four beats: scattering light when sung to, breathing with the dawn, receiving memory fragments from visitors, glowing at closure. It shifts from portal to loom to receptacle, reweighting its function across the arc. Setup early, middle enabling (light transmission), closure present (visitors place memories upon it). Eligible for mid-6s; slight penalty for lack of causal constraint on Lira's choices (the window responds but does not resist or complicate).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Woven dawns" is named repeatedly but functions as metaphor rather than stake-shaping concept. The window is described as "a loom of woven dawns," and the phrase recurs as thematic label ("woven dawns that knit communities together"), but the concept does not change options or tactics on the page—Lira sings and light spreads regardless. Setup present as description, middle thematic echo, no closure mechanism. Cap at 3.4 (no middle development).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.7</grade><comment>"Knits communities together" is stated three times but never constrains or enables an on-page action with cost. Visitors gather and form a circle, but their assembly is passive; no tradeoff or friction arises from communal bonding. Setup present as thematic claim, middle ornamental (visitors arrive), closure label-only. Cap at 2.8 (no closure participation); no visible cost linked to the attribute.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Swaddle" appears once: "she sought to… swaddle the world in music." The final verse is described as "swaddling the realm in a lullaby," but this is metaphoric summary rather than dramatized action. No major turn traces to swaddling; Lira's singing and the spreading light could proceed without this specific verb. Setup metaphoric, middle absent, closure echo. Cap at 4.6 (missing middle development); swappable with "wrap" or "envelop."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Forgotten songs" are signaled early ("sang through forgotten songs"), shape the middle (notes brush the window, causing prismatic scatter), and return at closure ("bound release of… forgotten songs… echoed across the mirror world"). The songs' mechanics matter: singing triggers light, which awakens trees. Setup clear, middle causal (singing → light → growth), closure present as echo. Eligible for 5–6 range; slight penalty for lack of friction (songs succeed immediately without failed attempts or cost).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The alchemical orchard greenhouse is present throughout, supplying vivid anchors (metallic roots, copper-jasmine scent, silver-bark vines). The endless night is the problem the story addresses; the orchard's response (trees inhaling, leaves unfurling, vines rising) shapes the middle sequence. However, the setting does not constrain Lira's choices or impose a resource limit—it reacts to her singing without complication. Setup strong, middle reactive, closure participatory (orchard thrums, expands). Eligible for mid-6s; slight penalty for lack of tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"Mirror world" is named in the opening and closing sentences but functions as a label rather than a timeframe. No sense of urgency, deadline, or temporal progression shapes decisions. The narrative unfolds in a continuous, untracked present; no clock tightens tactics. Setup label-only, middle absent, closure ornamental mention. Cap at 2.8 (no closure participation); further lowered for lack of time-based pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"To rekindle a dying realm" is declared early as Lira's purpose and restated at closure ("the realm would never again surrender to silence"). However, the motivation is never dramatized through conflicted choice or visible cost—Lira enacts the plan without friction between wants and obstacles. Setup present as declaration, middle pursuit without cost, closure assertion. Cap at 4.6 (missing middle friction); slight lift for thematic consistency, but no on-page tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Bound release" appears twice: "feeling the bound release of centuries of restraint" and "the bound release of Lira's song echoed." The phrase suggests tension and liberation, and the tone modulates from shrouded night to "gentle, unstoppable sunrise." However, the shift is linear accumulation rather than a charged reversal; no moment crystallizes the tension inherent in "bound release." Setup present as phrase, middle tonal shift, closure echo. Eligible for low-5s; the tone supports the arc but does not charge the final image with paradox or cost.</comment>
