<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elira's motivation is clear and her occupation is established, but her choices feel predetermined rather than pressured. Internal contradiction is minimal—she moves through the sequence with practiced ease, never genuinely torn between options. The final realization ("some truths don't set you free—they make you responsible") lands as an epiphany but lacks embodied cost that forecloses a live path on the page. The weeping reads as label-only emotion without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors arrive late (name at line 3, spatial grounding diffuse until "repair bay" recurs). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density and sensory layering build toward the crystalline core revelation. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—the withheld truth reweights Elira's existence and her mother's sacrifice—but the cost remains abstract ("responsible") rather than a visible forfeiture or tactical shift on the page. The lens holds, but the final image does not demonstrate a concrete price paid or option foreclosed, keeping it from higher bands.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The repair bay is vivid and returns with contrasting states (ruined, then pristine in Sigma-7), and the green shard functions as micro-setting that charges multiple beats. Sensory hierarchy is strong: oily floor, dust motes, residual warmth, and the shard's pulse all filter through Elira's professional lens. The shard constrains her navigation and shapes the final choice, meeting the 9+ gate requirement. However, spatial choreography inside the sealed chamber is sketchy, and the "Archival Containment" label feels generic rather than lived-in.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The dominant stake—uncover the withheld truth—is signaled early and pursued consistently. One meaningful deepening occurs when Elira touches the data core and the truth floods in, narrowing her understanding. However, the escalation is driven by setting discovery rather than protagonist choice under pressure; she follows the shard's pull without a trade-off or renunciation that alters tactics. The conceptual cost ("responsible") is asserted at closure but not dramatized as a visible price that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges cleanly from the mother's sacrifice and the cost of anchored divergence: some truths impose responsibility rather than liberation. The final image offers a non-literal answer to the central question, and the shard's cooling is a purposeful reprise. However, the ending edge tilts toward explicit articulation ("some truths don't set you free—they make you responsible") rather than letting the image alone carry the weight. The piece avoids moralizing but does not fully resist thematic statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited, and the prose carries a distinct lyric texture with elevated diction ("viscous," "lodestone," "cyclically spontaneous"). However, register drift is pervasive: phrases like "cyclically spontaneous failure," "redirect her breath," and "evidence of carry-through" read as prompt-speak or academic intrusion rather than character-filtered perception. Under peak pressure (the memory flood), the voice remains uniformly ornate rather than compressing or embodying stress. No dialogue is present to judge.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Heavy figurative density in most sentences without breathing room: "dust motes…a ghost of engines," "film peeling from reality's surface," "syrup made of memory," "unbearable lightness of knowing." Multiple mixed metaphors and elevated diction ("cyclically spontaneous," "lodestone," "residual warmth") obscure momentum in peak beats. Paraphrase loops: "not for direction, but for resonance" / "not from wind or magnetism, but from the pull of adjacent possibilities" share the same template stem. Template cadence: "not…but…" and "where it [verb], [noun]; where it [verb], [noun]" recur without taught pattern. Apply −0.9 for figurative muddle and template runs, and −0.4 for register drift touching closure ("unbearable lightness of knowing"). Final-third artifacts disallow 9+ globally and cap at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The sensory-map-maker premise and parallel-universe mechanics are competently executed but not transformed beyond genre template: a protagonist with unique perception crosses thresholds to retrieve hidden knowledge. The green shard as compass and the mother's sacrifice add emotional specificity, but the core arc (discovery → revelation → responsibility) follows a familiar structure. The lyric prose attempts freshness but the plot underneath is recognizable. No bold structural risk that meaningfully heightens stakes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elira is present throughout and her profession (sensory map maker) frames her methods, but her choices are reactive—she follows the shard's pull rather than making decisions that create turns. The closest to agency is placing the shard on the console and touching the data core, both of which are prompted by setting rather than internal conflict. She observes and receives rather than redirecting under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The green glass shard appears in beat one (cradled in her palm), beat two (placed on console, begins to spin), beat three (pulsed hot in Sigma-7), beat four (flared then dimmed at closure). It evolves from compass to fulfilled artifact, and its final cooling charges the ending image. However, its use is mostly passive—it guides rather than requiring Elira to trade off or redirect tactics. Strong presence, moderate causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Weaving between worlds shapes the plot structure (transition to Sigma-7, discovery in the chamber) and the final revelation hinges on divergence. However, the concept functions more as premise than on-page tactic—Elira steps through once, explores, and receives the truth. The mechanics do not constrain her choices or force a trade-off. Present in setup, middle, and ending, but swappable with other threshold-crossing methods.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Cyclically spontaneous" appears twice as a label ("trial and cyclically spontaneous failure," "cyclically spontaneous flickers") but never constrains or enables a visible action with cost. It reads as ornamental diction without functional pressure. No on-page demonstration of what the attribute does or what it costs Elira.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Redirect" is named in the transition beat ("redirected her breath, her heartbeat, her very intention") and ties to the core concept, but the action itself is abstract—no visible cost or trade-off dramatized. It enables the universe shift but could be replaced with "focus," "attune," or similar verbs without structural loss. Present at a key turn but functionally generic.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Parallel universes are signaled early (liminal seams, adjacent possibilities) and matter in the middle (Universe Sigma-7 where the spaceport never fell, where Elira never existed). The final revelation depends on divergence mechanics. However, the method is mostly setting rather than tactical constraint—Elira does not choose between universes or pay a cost to cross. Setup, middle involvement, and payoff present, but causal pressure is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The abandoned repair bay is established early ("cathedral of silence," broken gantries) and returns transformed in Sigma-7 (pristine, maintained by automatons). It pressures Elira by offering the sealed chamber and frames the closure (crumbling once more into silence). However, the bay does not constrain her tactics—she moves freely. Strong atmospheric presence, moderate functional pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"In the murmur of half-remembered dreams" appears once as origin story for the shard ("slipped between sleep and waking like a secret passed from one version of herself to another") but does not shape present choices or tighten decisions. The timeframe is poetic flavor rather than a live clock. No middle or ending integration.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The motivation to discover the withheld truth is signaled early and drives every beat: kneeling in the bay, following the shard, crossing to Sigma-7, touching the data core. The final cost ("responsible") ties directly to the revealed truth. However, the pursuit is frictionless—no internal conflict between discovering and protecting, no trade-off between truths. Present in setup, middle, and ending with moderate dramatized tension.</comment>
