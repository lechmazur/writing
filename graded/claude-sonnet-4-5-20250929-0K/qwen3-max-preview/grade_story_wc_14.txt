<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The stationer's motivation is clear—collecting textures of different times—but her interiority relies heavily on abstract summary ("she measured epochs by the curl of a leaf's edge") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The discovery of someone else's history provides a meaningful turn, with her tears marking "recognition" rather than sorrow, but the emotional progression feels more asserted than dramatized through micro-choices. The final act of leaving the notepad as an offering shows agency with visible cost (abandoning sole ownership), but the preceding beats lack the sustained internal conflict that would elevate this to high-band characterization. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks harm the single-POV frame.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who: gilded-leaf stationer; where: mountaintop bonsai forest; when: dawn after town silence) arrive within the first paragraph. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure deepens through the discovery of an "Unknown Era" that wasn't her invention, then the realization that others have planted fictions here, culminating in the offering of the notepad—a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where she leaves her archive open and walks deeper, reconfiguring her solitary collection into potential collaboration. Cost is legible: she relinquishes exclusive control and the certainty of her invented histories. One minor causality question—how the fluorescent lamp "carries frequencies" is told rather than demonstrated—but the overall arc holds under the accumulative lens with one meaningful deepening.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The bonsai forest provides vivid, selective detail ("pines bent like scholars over scrolls") filtered through the protagonist's cataloging eye, and the fluorescent lamp becomes a micro-setting element that constrains her method (pressing ear to casing, transcribing sensation). Spatial choreography is clean: mountaintop path → bonsai canopy → bench beneath juniper → deeper into maze. The lamp's "orphaned, flickering" state and the moss-crowned bench create a tactile, lived-in space. The final image—trees bending branches to shield the notepad—charges the closure by making the environment an active collaborator. No occupational depth issues at this length; the setting participates in the ending's reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>One dominant stake is signaled early: collecting and archiving invented histories. The discovery of someone else's "foreign past" provides a meaningful tightening that narrows her understanding of the archive from solitary to collaborative. Her decision to leave the notepad open with "Add Your Texture" forecloses exclusive ownership—a visible cost. However, escalation under the Accumulative lens is modest; the "cross-referencing" passage summarizes days of discovery rather than dramatizing pressure, and the townsfolk's return feels coincidental rather than causally linked to her choice. The protagonist's agency drives the final act, but the middle stretch lacks a second beat that would test commitment or force a trade-off before the ending.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: invented histories as shared archive, memory as collaborative loom, silence as creative substrate. The fluorescent lamp's hum shifts from personal tool to "chorus," and the final offering of the notepad answers the central question without stating it—collective fiction-making becomes the thematic resolution. The jasmine-and-porcelain discovery ("joy tinged with melancholy") provides emotional specificity. One slip: "the mountain was not just her archive; it was a chorus" edges toward thesis statement in the protagonist's interiority, though it stops short of moralizing. The ending avoids sermonizing and lets the trees' protective gesture carry resonance, but the thematic clarity is slightly over-articulated in the middle section.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present: the stationer notices "the angle of shadow at solstice" and "the density of bark's whisper," filtering setting through her archival lens. Voice maintains elevated diction ("incandescent restraint," "the loom on which she wove") that fits the contemplative tone. Two concerns lower the score: (1) some constructions drift toward telling abstraction ("Not with prism or lens, but by charting...") where dramatized action would sharpen immediacy, and (2) the passage describing her transcription method stacks multiple explanatory clauses without embodied micro-action. Psychic distance is controlled, and no dialogue appears to evaluate. Free indirect style is clean when used.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and figurative language is purposeful ("epochs pressed like petals," "silence was the loom"), but density suffers from scaffold and synonym loops: "not nostalgia, nor escapism, but collection" restates the same concept three ways without added pressure; "she didn't mind the quiet. Silence was the loom" paraphrases across adjacent beats. The phrase "refract harder, eyes closed, letting the lamp's vibration map the contours" uses "refract" metaphorically in a way that blurs the physical action. Several sentences open with "She" or "The" in runs, creating template cadence in the middle third. No major grammatical errors or pronoun drift, and the final image (lamp flickering approvingly, trees bending) carries clear propulsion. Deduction of −0.6 for paraphrase loops and template stems, avoiding the 8+ band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The premise—archiving invented histories in living bonsai and refracting them through a fluorescent lamp's hum—offers a fresh, non-obvious synthesis. The discovery of collaborative fictions across decades transforms the solo-archivist frame into something more resonant. Specificity in sensory detail (jasmine, porcelain teacups, "Winter of Whispered Truces") avoids generic abstraction. However, the "frequency as emotional carrier" mechanism edges toward magical handwaving without grounding its rules, and the townsfolk's silence-then-return feels convenient rather than causally integrated. The transformation test mostly passes—swapping names and setting would lose the bonsai/lamp specificity—but the arc's emotional beats (solitary → recognized chorus → offering) follow a familiar trajectory. No close echoes of famous lines detected.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The gilded-leaf stationer appears early, drives the discovery beat (pressing ear to lamp, charting "Unknown Era"), cross-references overlaps, and makes the closure choice to leave the notepad open. Her decision to walk deeper into the maze rather than flee alters tactics and forecloses sole ownership. Three beats with causal pressure and closure linkage place this in the 7+ band. The "earnestly studious" attribute is mostly label-only without constraining a specific on-page choice, but the character's agency is undeniable at closure. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +1.2, minus late-label trait −0.3, minus some summarized action −0.3 = ~7.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The battered notepad appears early ("carried no satchel, no inkwell, only a battered notepad"), is used at the fluorescent lamp to transcribe sensation, trembles in her hands during the recognition moment, and becomes the charged offering at closure ("left the notepad open on the bench, a single page marked 'Add Your Texture'"). The final reprise reweights it from personal archive to communal invitation with visible cost (she relinquishes control). Four distinct beats, causal pressure, and irreplaceable closure linkage. Early signal +0.7, four beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.5, specificity (frayed hemp, graphite ghosts) +0.6, cost +0.5, minus brief summarized handling in middle −0.2 = ~8.1, rounded down.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Invented histories frame the stationer's motivation from the opening ("living archive of invented histories she had whispered into their rings") and shape the middle discovery when she encounters someone else's fabricated past. The concept enables the cross-referencing beat and charges the closure offering ("Add Your Texture"). However, much of its presence is thematic rather than mechanically constraining a choice; the histories exist as backdrop more than tactical lever. Early signal +0.6, two beats (discovery, offering) +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, causal pressure moderate +0.8, but swappability (could be "memories" or "dreams") and theme-heavy treatment −0.8 = ~6.8, fitting two gates with moderate causal work.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Earnestly studious" is declared early ("Earnestly studious, she measured epochs...") but manifests mostly as summary label. The trait colors her method (measuring by leaf curl, charting hum variants) but does not constrain a key choice with visible cost—she never hesitates, second-guesses, or pays a price for over-diligence. Present in setup, colors middle actions, but absent from closure decision. Early signal +0.5, one functional beat (charting) +0.4, moderate pressure +0.3, ornamental in ending −0.5, label-only −0.3, swappable with "meticulous" −0.4 = ~5.4, mid-band functional.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Refract" is introduced at the first lamp beat ("she would pause... and begin to refract. Not with prism or lens, but by charting...") and recurs when she "refracted harder, eyes closed" during the discovery. It shapes two beats and the method, but the mechanics remain abstract; the word functions more as metaphor than specific action. The ending does not explicitly invoke refraction, though the lamp's approval nods to it. Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +0.6, specificity moderate +0.4, closure linkage indirect +0.3, swappability (could be "attune" or "channel") −0.5, summary-only in key moment −0.4 = ~6.3, solid two-gate with lyric resonance.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The fluorescent lamp is present early ("a lamp now orphaned, flickering stubbornly"), becomes the active tool in the first refraction beat ("press her ear to the lamp's cold casing, pencil poised"), deepens during the discovery ("the lamp's buzz deepened to a thrum"), and closes with approval ("The lamp flickered once, approvingly"). The hum's mechanics—carrying "frequencies of laughter" and "bleeding through the mountain's strata"—are told rather than shown, but the lamp's role as conduit is irreplaceable. Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.1, closure linkage +1.3, specificity (cold casing, dawn timing) +0.6, minus told mechanics −0.5, minus brief ornamental flicker −0.2 = ~7.8.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The blooming labyrinth of bonsai forests on a mountaintop anchors setting from the opening ("the blooming labyrinth of bonsai forests unfolded") and provides spatial structure (path, canopy, bench beneath juniper, deeper maze). The trees listen, bend branches to shield the notepad, and become "ancient conspirators" at closure. The mountaintop's "magnetic memory" enables the lamp's function. Three beats, strong closure linkage, environment actively shapes the ending. Early signal +0.8, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +1.5, specificity (moss-carved stones, scholars-over-scrolls pines) +0.7, cost indirect +0.3, minus some postcard phrasing −0.3 = ~7.6.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"After the town goes silent" is signaled early ("as the town below fell silent") and bookends the piece ("When the town's silence finally broke... the slow return of footsteps"). The silence creates conditions for her work ("the trees listened better") and its breaking prompts her offering, but the timeframe itself does not tighten decisions—she has unlimited leisure to chart and cross-reference. No countdown or clock pressure. Early signal +0.6, two framing beats +0.9, enables atmosphere +0.4, closure participation weak +0.3, no tactical constraint −0.7, vague duration −0.4 = ~5.9, functional frame without urgency.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The motivation to collect textures of different times is stated early ("her motivation was not nostalgia, nor escapism, but collection") and drives every action: climbing the path, pressing ear to the lamp, charting resonances, cross-referencing, leaving the offering. The discovery of someone else's texture creates friction ("This wasn't from her own inventions... achingly solid"), and the ending reframes collection as communal. However, the motivation is told more than dramatized in conflicted micro-choices. Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage +1.4, friction moment +0.5, told-only declaration −0.6, no visible trade-off −0.4 = ~7.4.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>"Incandescent restraint" manifests in elevated diction, measured pacing, and the lamp's glow as recurring image. Tone holds through the discovery (wonder without hysteria), weeping ("not from sorrow, but recognition"), and quiet offering. The lamp flickering "approvingly" and trees bending "just enough" embody restraint at closure. Modulation is subtle—slightly warmer at the jasmine discovery, slightly more open at the offering—but never breaks. Coherent through turns +1.2, modulates with pressure +0.8, charges final image +1.4, specificity (fluorescent vs. flame, "incandescent" literalized) +0.6, static register in middle −0.4, single mood dominant −0.3 = ~7.0, strong tonal control that fits but does not transform the ending.</comment>
