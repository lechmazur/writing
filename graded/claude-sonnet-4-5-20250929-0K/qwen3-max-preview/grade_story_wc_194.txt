<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The protagonist demonstrates clear interiority and embodied sensory training (coastal caves, standing waves as tuning method), but her response to the revelation—that she is the swapped heir—reads too smooth, lacking contradictory impulses in the moment. The shift from "dynasty ender" to "restoration" arrives as cognitive realization without visible emotional cost or conflicting desires acting simultaneously on the page. Motivation is consistent but the peak beat (hearing her mother's voice, learning her own identity) needed messier, more irrational simultaneous reactions to earn the final calm.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraph; the lens reads Accumulative/Textural (sensory memory, standing-wave method, cylinder as charged object). The closure—walking toward the clocktower—lands as Charged Poise: options crystallize, the mission inverts, and the cost (leaving behind her "ender" identity) is felt. However, the cost remains somewhat abstract; no on-page forfeiture of a concrete resource or relationship makes the price undeniable in a single image. The gramophone "spinning of its own accord" introduces a late rule (autonomous mechanism) not cued earlier, weakening causal grounding at the pivot.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The sepia reading room is vividly rendered with sensory specificity (dust on leather, yellowed spines, bruised-violet sky) and the gramophone functions as both setting anchor and constraint—she must align the needle, crank at the correct harmonic ratio. The space subtly mirrors her mission (grandfather's signature site, mother's last poetry reading), charging the final turn. Spatial choreography remains clear; the recurring object (crank handle) charges the closure image when it becomes "no longer a tool, but a relic of awakening."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The dominant stake—uncovering hidden truth—is signaled early and remains coherent. The cylinder's revelation (mother's voice, swapped-child secret) produces one meaningful tightening: her identity and mission invert. However, the escalation relies on information delivery rather than a choice under competing pressures; she does not face a live decision that forecloses an option with visible cost. The gramophone "spinning of its own accord" removes her agency at the peak moment, and the walk toward the clocktower, while charged, occurs after the tension has already resolved via the recording.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme—truth as resonance, silence as structure—emerges through concrete particulars (standing waves, coastal training, the gramophone as translator). The ending offers a non-literal answer: she is not the ender but the restoration, and the shift from mission to self is charged by the prior sensory method. However, the final paragraph edges toward thematic summary ("a coronation of understanding, not crowns"; "the city stirred, unaware") rather than letting the image alone carry the weight. The piece resists moralizing but the closure leans on articulated significance rather than pure implication.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and ornate, with extended syntactic structures and elevated diction ("golden shadows pooled like spilled honey"; "ghost-pressure of her mother's palms") that remain consistent. POV is stable third-limited with deep interiority. However, the prose occasionally drifts into essayistic register ("not as poets do in gardens, but as hunters do before the kill") that reads more like external commentary than the character's own perceptual signature under pressure. The final paragraphs compress urgency into declarative calm without clear motivation for the tonal shift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The prose is dense and figurative throughout, with high information load but uneven momentum. Multiple sentences in the opening third stack metaphors without clear propulsion ("the only language the dead still answered"; "invisible architecture of consequence"; "bridge of intuition—a living lattice of memory and resonance"). The cylinder revelation beat suffers from paraphrase loops: "not from shock, but from recognition" followed by "The voice was her mother's. And the child—the swapped child—was her." Template cadence appears in the coastal-training passage (repeated "she had learned" / "she could feel" stems). Line-level clarity is generally maintained, but the ornamental density in non-peak beats slows momentum without always advancing pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The premise—sensory intuition trained through standing waves to decode a gramophone confession—offers a fresh synthesis of gothic mystery and embodied perception. The inversion (dynasty ender becomes heir) is earned in hindsight by the swapped-child setup. However, the coastal-training backstory and the standing-wave method, while specific, read somewhat expository and do not face on-page resistance or friction that would test their limits. The gramophone's autonomous spinning and the "residual anguish in wood grain" push toward magical realism without full commitment, leaving the world rules ambiguous.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The "dynasty ender" character drives the central investigation and her decision to play the cylinder is the key causal act. However, her choices after the revelation are muted: she rises and walks toward the clocktower without on-page conflict or tactical shift. The label "dynasty ender" appears early and is reweighted at closure (she becomes "restoration"), satisfying two gates, but her agency at the climax is passive—she listens, the gramophone spins "of its own accord," and the walk is post-revelation rather than a contested choice.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The gramophone crank handle appears in beat one (tracing grooves), beat two (gripping like a scalpel, three turns to start playback), and the closure (warm in her palm, "no longer a tool, but a relic of awakening"). It constrains action—she must align and crank at the correct ratio—and its final touch reweights her self-understanding. The object is causally active across three beats and charges the ending, but the "correct harmonic ratio" mechanic is asserted rather than tested, limiting cost visibility.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The "bridge of intuition" is named explicitly in one paragraph ("imagining the air... as a bridge of intuition—a living lattice of memory and resonance") and described as a method learned in exile. It functions as thematic shorthand for her sensory training but does not constrain a specific on-page choice or alter tactics. The standing-wave method (Q9F) does more causal work; the "bridge" label itself remains ornamental and could be replaced with minor edits to the metaphor without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Eloquently silent" is attributed to her in the second paragraph with rationale ("because her thoughts carried more weight... and because silence... was the only language the dead still answered"). It enables her sensory method—listening to trapped vibrations—but the trait does not visibly constrain a choice or impose cost. She listens throughout without friction; no moment dramatizes a trade-off between speaking and remaining silent. The attribute is functional but replaceable; "attentive" or "patient" would serve similarly.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Muse" appears in one beat: "She mused, not as poets do in gardens, but as hunters do before the kill: eyes half-lidded, breath shallow, every nerve attuned." The action frames her preparatory stance and signals intent, but the peak turn—playing the cylinder—does not trace directly to this musing; it follows mechanically from her prior training and the cylinder's presence. The action is present and thematically apt but not causally indispensable; she could proceed with "she prepared" or "she focused" with minor loss.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Standing waves" are signaled early (coastal training paragraph, ~25% mark) and their mechanics—sensing trapped vibrations, tuning body as instrument—shape her approach to the gramophone. The method enables the cylinder's playback ("correct harmonic ratio") and is recalled at closure when the crank becomes a "relic of awakening." However, the standing-wave mechanics are told rather than tested; no on-page friction challenges her attunement or forces adjustment. Two gates met (setup, closure link) with solid causal work, but the method's specificity lacks visible cost or failure risk.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The sepia reading room is established in the opening beat and anchors the entire scene. It provides the gramophone, table, and charged history (grandfather's signature, mother's last poetry reading), all of which frame the stakes. The setting does not shift, maintaining coherent spatial choreography, and the "golden shadows" modulate with pressure at closure. The room itself does not constrain a tactical choice—she could play the cylinder anywhere—but the location's historical weight charges the revelation and the final image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.7</grade><comment>"In the first yawn of evening" anchors the opening and sets atmospheric tone (golden shadows, bruised-violet sky), but time does not progress or tighten decisions. No clock pressure is felt; the scene could unfold over minutes or an hour without affecting her choices. The timeframe is present and poetic but ornamental; it does not constrain tactics or escalate stakes, and the ending ("the city stirred") remains temporally vague.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The motivation "to uncover a hidden truth" is dramatized in her mission statement (paragraph three) and drives every beat: choosing the reading room, inserting the cylinder, cranking the gramophone. The revelation that the truth is personal (she is the swapped heir) inverts her want from political destruction to self-restoration with visible emotional cost. The motivation faces friction—her fear of what the cylinder might hold—and the final walk toward the clocktower enacts the reweighted desire. Three gates met with strong causal linkage and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Golden shadows" anchor the opening image and return at closure ("Golden shadows deepened around her... as the room's quiet benediction"). The tone is elegiac and ornate throughout, modulating slightly when the voice plays ("cracked and thin as ancient parchment") but remaining largely static. The tone charges the final image but does not meaningfully shift with pressure; the prose maintains its elevated, meditative register even during the peak revelation, muting emotional friction. Two gates met (setup, closure) with lyric reprise, but limited pressure-responsive modulation.</comment>
