<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The historian's motivation (daughter's silence after massacre) is concrete and drives the journey, but her interior experience leans heavily on abstract formulations ("anguished joy," "sweetness poisoned by certainty") rather than embodied contradiction. The climactic hum and palmprint choice feel earned by setup, yet the moment when she "felt lighter" edges toward diagnostic summary rather than contradictory impulse acting in scene. Micro-choices (unpredictable steps, refusal to pull away) are present but the embodiment remains poetic rather than visceral.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when clearly by the opening lines. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density and pattern-breaking (arrhythmic song vs. nostalgia's expectation of ritual mourning) reweight the stake, and the final release of atoms constitutes a Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost (weeping, darkened veil, daughter still silent). One meaningful deepening occurs when the historian shifts from scholarly detachment to singing her daughter's tune, narrowing options and charging the closure image. Cost is legible on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The bronze prism pagoda constrains the climax (warm surface, shuddering response to song) and charges the final image when it cools, fulfilling the 9+ gate for environment participation. Archive details (fractured dome, tilting shelves, scrolls unspooling) are vivid and filtered through urgency, though the civilization's backstory (twin moons festival, scraped promises) leans expository. Spatial choreography is clear: kneel, move, place palms, rise, turn toward exit.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: purify memory's grip to break the cycle her daughter inherits. Pressure accumulates as nostalgia-atoms surge and flood her with images, then the arrhythmic hum narrows options by refusing patterns—a tactic that forecloses mourning or rage and releases the motes. The pagoda's shudder and dimming constitute a visible turn; her daughter "would hear this song" is agency with cost (she returns carrying raw truth, not sanitized silence). One meaningful tightening under the Accumulative lens, with price legible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: forgetting-as-survival, pattern-avoidance as purification, and the refusal to repeat sanitized history. The bronze pagoda and arrhythmic song are concrete carriers, not abstractions. The ending image—"purified by refusal to repeat the past"—reweights prior material (daughter's silence, civilization's surrender) without moralizing, offering a resonant answer to whether forgetting heals. Minor slip: "anguished joy" label recurs without always earning fresh embodiment in each beat.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited with consistent distance and a lush, elevated register ("hues of molten regret," "patternless truth"). The perceptual signature is poetic and filtered through scholarly metaphor, though it remains coherent under pressure. No dialogue on the page. Sentence rhythm modulates purposefully (short fragments at peak beats, longer spirals during reflection). Register occasionally drifts into abstraction ("emotional imprints trapped in matter") that reads more like the prompt's concept vocabulary than the historian's lived idiom, slightly flattening immediacy at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout ("fireflies," "molten regret," "broken ribs," "pilgrims to a shrine," "embers freed from a dying hearth"), creating lush texture but risking overwriting in consecutive sentences without pattern-teaching or cost payoff. Paraphrase loops appear: "not for preservation, but purification" / "not erased, but released" / "not to flee, but to return" recur as syntactic templates. Minor template cadence in the pagoda-description paragraph. Information density is strong; no major clarity breaks. Deductions for figurative saturation and stem repetition in peak beats total approximately −0.9 under the artifact pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of physical nostalgia-atoms, resonance-chamber architecture, and arrhythmic purification is specific and non-obvious. The historian's unpredictable movement and off-key song as anti-pattern tactics feel fresh and earned by the premise. Risk is present (lyric density, concept-led design) and heightens stakes without obscuring causality. Minor derivative friction: the "lost civilization that chose forgetting" frame echoes familiar SFF templates, though the execution (daughter's silence, ritual tears, song as weapon) personalizes it.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Saffron-veil historian drives the journey (deciphering texts, traveling to archive), the climactic choice (placing palms, humming arrhythmically), and the resolution (rising to return with the song). Present in setup, middle confrontation, and closure with causal pressure throughout.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Bronze prism pagoda appears in opening description, becomes the tactile focus at climax (warm surface, shuddering, cooling), and its extinguished glow marks closure. Two distinct beats: scholar deciphers function, then uses it. Indispensable to the purification mechanism and final image.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Atoms of nostalgia are introduced early, personified as "glowing motes" that surge and respond to the historian's song. They shape the stakes (purification target) and the climax tactic (confuse them by avoiding patterns). Present in setup, confrontation, and release; causal pressure evident. Could theoretically swap for "emotional echoes" with edits, limiting irreplaceability slightly.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Steadily unpredictable movement is enacted on the page ("left foot forward, pause, right knee lowered, spin, stillness—never the same twice") and explicitly tied to strategy ("patterns were the anchors nostalgia used"). One beat of embodied constraint. Lacks further development or cost linkage at closure; the song's arrhythmia carries the pattern-avoidance work in the climax, leaving the walking less causally essential.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Purify frames the entire quest: "not for preservation, but purification" in the opening, enacted via the pagoda interaction, and fulfilled when atoms are "released" and she feels "purified by refusal to repeat." Shapes setup, middle confrontation, and closure. Removing it would collapse the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Avoiding patterns is signaled early (unpredictable steps, refusal of rhythm) and enacted at climax (arrhythmic hum that confuses the atoms). Two beats; the method enables the purification. Its mechanics matter on the page. Closure participation is indirect (the song embodies it) rather than making the method itself visible in the final image.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Lost civilization archive anchors all action, supplies the bronze pagoda and stolen texts, and its groaning shelves and fractured dome create atmosphere and urgency. The setting pressures the historian (ghosts whispering, dust settling) and the archive "sighed...relieved of a burden" at closure, personifying place as participant. Setup, middle pressure, and closure presence; causal constraint moderate.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Timeframe "across the end of innocence" is thematically present (civilization's surrender, daughter's silence post-massacre) but functions as backstory context rather than live narrative clock. Twilight-to-night progression marks elapsed time in the archive scene, yet no urgency or deadline tightens decisions. The phrase "end of innocence" does not shape tactics on the page.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Pursuing forbidden knowledge (texts burned by her order, unrecorded truth of innocence's end) is named early and dramatized: she deciphered the pagoda's function from stolen texts and came to the archive despite prohibition. Her motivation is personal (daughter's silence), not purely academic, and the choice to use the pagoda carries risk. Setup and climax; cost implicit in her order's censorship and her defiance.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Anguished joy is embodied throughout: "to touch them was to drown in anguished joy," she weeps while her lips curve "in something perilously close to triumph," and the ending frames the song as "sung with anguished joy, purified by refusal to repeat." Tone modulates (wonder at festival images, gasping pain, final triumph-through-grief) and charges the closure image. The label recurs frequently, risking telling-over-showing, yet the paradox is enacted in simultaneous weeping and triumph.</comment>
