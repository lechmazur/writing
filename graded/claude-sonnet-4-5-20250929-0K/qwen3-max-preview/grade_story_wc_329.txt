<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The violinist's motivation is stated rather than dramatized through conflicting choices under pressure. Her internal experience remains abstract—"grief," "trembling"—without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The transformation of the statues happens *to* them via her music rather than through her wrestling with doubt or cost; she never falters, questions, or pays a visible personal price that forecloses a path. The ending gift of the apple feels like reward without renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening lines. The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens: density and pattern intensify as the music spreads, statues crack, and the orchard shifts from metallic to organic. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (the orchard awakens, the violinist commits to her mission), but the cost is asserted in retrospect ("its purpose spent") rather than shown as a visible forfeiture that alters her options on the page. The final paragraph's thematic summary ("The tarnished wonder... was molting") replaces scene pressure with declared meaning.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The sky-bridge, orchard canopy, statues, and apples are vivid and purposeful. The locust shell is handled twice (pressed to the violin, then turning to dust) and its texture charges the music's effect. Spatial choreography remains clear across the violinist's position on the bridge and the statues below. The setting pressures the protagonist by providing the marble sentinels as obstacles and the orchard's condition as the problem to solve, meeting the 9+ gate for environment constraining choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The dominant stake—reawakening the orchard—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful deepening occurs when the statues begin to weep and kneel, shifting from threat to gardener. However, the protagonist's success is never in doubt; no reversal tests her commitment, and coincidence (the statues simply respond as hoped) drives the resolution. The cost (locust shell turning to dust) is mentioned but does not visibly narrow her future options or force a trade-off on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the contrast between mechanical/organic, metallic/living, but the final three paragraphs spell it out overtly: "beauty had never left—it had only been waiting," "The tarnished wonder... wasn't broken. It was molting." The locust shell as metamorphosis motif is earned, yet the ending shifts from scene to meta-commentary, replacing earned resonance with a stated thesis. The thematic echo in the closing lines triggers a −0.6 deduction for replacing pressure with assertion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-person limited on the violinist. Diction is elevated and consistent, though register drifts into lyric abstraction under pressure ("the liminal breath where logic falters and wonder stirs") rather than tightening to her perceptual signature. No dialogue appears. Perceptual filtering is present but not character-specific—any musician might notice these details. The prose modulates with the music's intensification, but the voice does not compress or shift distinctively at peak stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Figurative language saturates nearly every sentence ("curled downward like a falling leaf," "tactile ghost," "seeping into cracks," "candle wax near flame"), creating texture but slowing propulsion and obscuring causal links. Paraphrase loops appear: "She played not to defy, but to signal" / "Each phrase was a coded plea" restate the same idea. The final paragraph stacks metaphors ("baptism," "quiet thunder," "molting") without clear connective tissue. Template cadence: "She played... She shifted key... She played louder... She didn't stop" across consecutive beats. Apply −0.8 for density and loop artifacts touching closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The premise—music awakening petrified guardians in an enchanted orchard—is a familiar fantasy trope. The locust shell as metamorphosis symbol and the heart-rhythm method add specificity, but the emotional arc (artist restores beauty through art) follows a well-worn template. The statues' transformation and the violinist's mission proceed without surprise or moral friction. The transformation test fails: swap in a different musician with a different talisman and the structure holds unchanged.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The sky-bridge violinist is present throughout and her action (playing) drives all beats. However, her choices do not create turns—she begins playing and continues without deviation, doubt, or tactical shift. The narrative tells us she "uprooted their obedience note by note" but she never decides *how* to play differently when the statues first freeze versus when they kneel. Early signal present, closure participation present, but causal pressure and beat-level decision work are absent.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The locust shell appears in three beats: clutched in her palm (setup), pressed against the violin to amplify texture (development), and turning to dust as its purpose is spent (closure). It is described as "the ghost of metamorphosis" and its crackle/emergence is woven into the melody. The shell's brittleness and hollow form provide thematic weight, but its use does not constrain her tactics—she could play without it and the statues would still respond. The dust moment charges the closure image but does not create a visible cost that alters her next choice.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Breaking free is narrated thematically ("uprooted their obedience," "husked and patient") but does not shape on-page tactics. The statues' liberation unfolds passively in response to music; no choice tests the violinist's commitment to freeing them versus another goal. The concept is present as the story's thematic claim but does not narrow options or create a decision point.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Resonantly soft" is signaled early ("not with force, but with resonantly soft pressure") and repeated as her weapon ("the resonantly soft timbre was her weapon, seeping into cracks"). It enables her approach—loudness would fail—but the attribute does not impose a visible cost or constrain a later choice. The story tells us softness works; it does not show her wrestling with the limits of softness when the statues resist or force her to modulate.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Uproot" appears twice: "to uproot the silence" (setup) and "She uprooted their obedience note by note" (middle). The action is metaphorical rather than literal, and the story does not hinge on uprooting versus another verb—she could "awaken" or "dissolve" their obedience with identical structural impact. The word does not create a turn or redefine options; it labels the outcome rather than shaping the attempt.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Signaling through heart rhythms" is introduced in the middle third: "through heart rhythms disguised as vibrato, syncopated pulses mimicking ventricular sighs." It is described as method but never shown to matter—her playing succeeds without demonstrating why heart rhythms are necessary versus any other musical phrasing. The method is label-only; removing it would not alter any beat or the closure. Late arrival (after 40%) and ornamental use cap at 4.6; swappability and summary-only use lower further.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The enchanted orchard and living statues are present throughout, constraining all choices. The statues patrol with "metronomic precision," their obsidian eyes and stone limbs creating the obstacle the violinist must overcome. The orchard's condition (metallic apples, cold luminescence, absence of birdsong) defines the problem and its transformation (bees return, apples blush) measures success. The setting drives at least two beats (statues freeze, statues kneel) and shapes the closure image (sapling sprouting, ivy-crowned statue offering apple). Essential across setup, development, and payoff.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"In the gap between knowing and understanding" appears once in the middle third as a lyric phrase when the statues begin to weep. It does not function as a timeframe that tightens decisions or tracks elapsed duration. The violinist's attempt unfolds without temporal pressure—no deadline, no clock running out, no mention of how long she plays. The phrase is ornamental, swappable with any other description of transition, and does not constrain tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The motivation "to reawaken beauty in a mechanical world" is stated in the opening ("not to steal, not to trespass, but to uproot the silence") and restated near the end ("to reawaken beauty in a mechanical world"). It frames the violinist's goal but is never dramatized through a conflicting want or cost—she never doubts, tires of the mission, or sacrifices something else to pursue it. The desire is present and drives the scene's action, but friction between want and cost is absent. The motivation is told rather than tested.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Tarnished wonder is present in diction throughout: "clouds frayed into mist," "apples glowed with cold luminescence," "moss cracking along its collarbone," "baptism" of apple juice. The tone modulates from somber stasis (metallic orchard, metronomic statues) to lyric renewal (bees, blossom, trembling leaves) as pressure rises. The phrase "tarnished wonder" appears explicitly near the end, charging the closure image. Coherent and purposeful, though the final paragraphs tip toward overt thematic declaration rather than sustaining the tonal effect through image alone.</comment>
