<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The poet's interiority is established through vivid images (hollow bones, voice "stubbornly full"), but her choices remain mostly static—she sings, she writes, she curls around the postcard. The warming postcard moment ("They're listening. Keep singing.") prompts her to continue rather than alter course, showing endurance but not contradiction or a decision that forecloses a path with visible cost. The "shyly unstoppable" attribute is mentioned but not dramatized through a micro-choice where shyness visibly competes with determination. Reflection dominates without on-page micro-choices that tilt present stance, flattening pressure despite poetic specificity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation is clear (who/where/when anchored early). The dominant stake—transmuting pain into beauty through song—is signaled and sustained. The postcard's new line ("They're listening") registers as a micro turn, and the final image (continuing to sing, postcard humming, reef glowing) offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis: she chooses to persist in her vigil with "something like rest" in the spaces between words). However, the cost is conceptual and implied rather than legible on the page; no concrete option is foreclosed, no visible price paid in the closure beat. The piece reads as Accumulative/Textural, but the ending reprises the opening posture without a decisive tightening or cadence shift that reweights the stake.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The gargantuan shell functions as lived-in setting: spiraled chambers, ribbed throat, bioluminescent canopy, calcium walls. Sensory detail is vivid and filtered through the poet's perception (barnacle-teeth, kelp-strings, tidepools where dreams swim). The shell constrains her physically (she ensconses herself in the innermost spiral) and its acoustics shape her work (verses fossilizing into frescoes, echoes whispering lullabies). The final image of the reef glowing and the shell's interior charged by the postcard's hum integrates setting into closure, though the reef itself remains more atmospheric than choice-constraining.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—to transmute suffering into beauty via song—is clear and sustained, but pressure remains steady rather than escalating. The postcard's warming and new line ("They're listening") offer a micro turn, yet the poet's response is continuation rather than a forced trade-off. No live option is foreclosed; she simply sings a new kind of song (psalm instead of lullaby). The piece accumulates texture and reweights meaning, but under an Accumulative lens the closure lacks a decisive intensification or visible cost. Agency is present (she chooses to keep singing despite insomnia and centuries of longing) but the final act does not narrow options or impose a felt price on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—art as transmutation of suffering, beauty persisting in darkness—emerges organically from the poet's nightly ritual, the blossom armistice backstory, and the "reef-shadow joy" concept. The final image (singing stitches peace into ordinary lives, postcard humming, poet smiling "shyly unstoppable") offers a resonant answer to how sorrow can bloom without erasure. Subtext operates in the contrast between her isolation and the wide reach of her voice. The piece avoids overt moralizing, though "to coax grief to bloom wild and unashamed" borders on thematic statement. The recurring postcard and evolving song-type (lullaby → psalm) charge the ending without forcing a thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, filtered through the poet's perceptual signature (spiraling time, fractured light, "off-key wind"). Diction is lyrical and consistent ("photosynthesize pain into beauty," "calcium walls," "pollen-script"). However, elevated register pervades even peak emotional beats without modulation, risking monotone texture. Free indirect style is clean, though some passages lean toward poetic exposition rather than dramatized perception ("She never knew. She only sang."). No dialogue to judge. The prose reads as singular and voice-specific, but the ornate cadence flattens urgency in places where compression might sharpen pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Figurative density is high and mostly coherent ("spiraled chambers echoing with memories," "tide dragging moonlight inland," "orchids erupted from scorched earth"). Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, alternating long lyrical passages with short declarative beats ("She never slept. But sometimes..."). Minor template patterns appear ("She'd written... She'd found... She called it...") without severe loops. Information density is uneven: vivid images propel some beats, while others paraphrase the same concept (transmuting pain, reef-shadow joy) across adjacent paragraphs. The closure image is clear and propulsive, but mid-section reflection drifts into abstraction ("years folded into each other like petals") that slows momentum without altering present stakes.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The premise—insomniac poet in a shell, singing after a war ended by blossoming orchids—synthesizes fresh elements. The "blossom armistice" and "reef-shadow joy" concepts offer non-obvious inflections on post-war trauma and art-as-healing. However, the core arc (isolated artist persists in creative ritual, learns someone is listening, continues with renewed purpose) follows a familiar template. The galaxy postcard's warming and new message feel convenient rather than inevitable. Specific details (pollen-script constellation, jasmine/ozone scent, stanzas fossilizing into frescoes) elevate texture, but the emotional progression—endurance rewarded by external validation—lacks the bold risk or moral calculus that would distinguish this from other "artist finds meaning in solitude" narratives.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The insomniac poet is present throughout and her insomnia is mentioned as context, but sleeplessness does not constrain a key choice or impose visible cost in a pivotal beat. She continues her nightly ritual without the insomnia forcing a trade-off or altering tactics. Early signal present; closure participation (she sings in the final paragraph); swappable with "isolated poet" without major edits.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Galaxy postcard appears early (first third), is handled in multiple beats (pressed to lips, tucked against sternum, warms and reveals new line, nestled deeper at end), and returns with reweighted meaning (the new message prompts a shift from lullaby to psalm). It shapes a micro turn and charges the closure image. However, the postcard does not constrain a choice with visible cost; it validates rather than tests the poet. Three gates met; causal pressure moderate; closure linkage clear.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Blossom armistice is present in backstory (orchids erupting from scorched earth, poet writing the ceasefire's first stanza) and referenced thematically throughout. It frames the poet's motivation and the tone of "reef-shadow joy," but it does not shape on-page stakes or alter tactics. The armistice is historical context rather than a live pressure point. Setup present; development absent (no middle choice hinges on it); closure participation minimal (implied in the peace-stitching image).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Shyly unstoppable" is stated explicitly ("The poet was shyly unstoppable—a contradiction that suited her. She feared audiences, flinched at applause, yet every dawn she climbed...") and returned at the end ("shyly unstoppable"). However, the trait is described rather than dramatized through a micro-choice where shyness and determination visibly conflict with cost. Early signal; closure participation; label-only treatment trends low.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Ensconce" appears in one key beat ("each night... she would ensconce herself in the innermost spiral, knees drawn to chest") and again implicitly in the final paragraph ("in the deepest curve of the shell"). The act frames her nightly ritual and closure posture, but it is descriptive rather than causal—she could "retreat," "curl," or "settle" without changing stakes. Setup present; development marginal; closure participation via spatial echo; swappable with near-synonyms.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Half-sung lullabies carried on an off-key wind are signaled early, developed in multiple beats (wind turning verses into crooked hymns, fishermen and soldiers hearing her, children dreaming in rhymes), and return at closure (she sings a psalm, the wind carries it). The method shapes how her art reaches others and is integral to the piece's logic. However, the mechanics are atmospheric rather than constraining—the off-key wind does not impose a visible cost or alter her tactics. Three gates met; causal pressure moderate.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The gargantuan shell is present early, developed across beats (spiraled chambers, ribbed throat, innermost curve, ceiling with bioluminescent plankton, walls where stanzas fossilize), and integral to the closure image (deepest curve, inside/outside contrast). The shell constrains her physically (she ensconses herself, climbs its throat to sing) and acoustically (echoes, whispers, tide sighs). It provides spatial structure and charges the final beat. Three gates met; causal pressure clear; irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Centuries of longing" is stated and the piece references time spiraling, years folding, decades pooling. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions or alter tactics—it functions as atmospheric context rather than a live pressure. The poet's actions occur in an eternal present (nightly ritual, the warming postcard, the final singing) without urgency tied to the passage of centuries. Setup present; development and closure participation absent; ornamental use of temporal scale.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Motivation to "photosynthesize pain into beauty" is stated early and sustained throughout (writing verses, singing lullabies to lull sorrow into surrender, stitching peace into ordinary lives). It drives her nightly ritual and the closure beat (singing a psalm of roots and rupture). However, the motivation is told more than dramatized through conflicted choices—she persists without visible friction between transmutation and erasure, or between wants and costs. Setup strong; closure participation clear; friction limited.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Reef-shadow joy" is named explicitly ("She called it 'reef-shadow joy': the kind that thrives where light fractures, where beauty persists precisely because it knows how to bend in the dark") and modulates coherently through the piece (bioluminescent glow, crooked hymns, quiet rest in word-spaces, the poet's smile at the end). Tone charges the final image and aligns with the thematic arc. However, the concept is more declared than emergent from scene pressure. Setup present; tone coherent; closure participation clear; single static register without dynamic modulation under peak stress.</comment>
