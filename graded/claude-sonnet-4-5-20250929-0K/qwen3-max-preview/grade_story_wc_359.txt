<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The bell ringer's synesthetic gift is described but rarely shown constraining choices under pressure. Interiority leans heavily on abstract sensory labels ("taste the G-minor as burnt caramel") rather than embodied contradiction. The final walk-away feels more asserted than earned through prior micro-choices that foreclose a path with visible cost. Motivation remains consistent but the arc reads more as ceremonial performance than a character wrestling with conflicting impulses.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a pattern of sensory accretion and the final image reweights the opening covenant with felt cost (the hush now lives inside her, demanding daily tending). Orientation anchors are present early (ice cavern, aurora, bell ringer). However, the causal chain is thin—most beats are variations on "she strikes, ice responds beautifully"—and the closure unit, while present, lacks a decisive narrowing of options or a legible trade-off that alters tactics. The cost is more asserted ("wonder demands to be tended") than dramatized in a choice that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The ice cavern, aurora, and prism bell are vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (emerald veils, topaz tremors, candlewicks dipped in molten amethyst). The environment charges the final image: the hush "now lived in her bones, in the ice, in the aurora's afterglow." Spatial choreography is clear and the setting constrains her ritual (cathedral arches, suspended bell). Minor deduction: the outside world is referenced only in contrast, never tested on the page, so the setting's pressure remains largely atmospheric rather than tactical.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("certify wonder as essential") is signaled early but never faces a concrete obstacle or choice that narrows options. The piece is a series of bell strikes with beautiful consequences; no reversal, no escalation under pressure, no visible price paid in the moment (the child's laughter thaws, walls weep, hush dances). The final walk into the blizzard asserts future commitment but does not dramatize a trade-off or cost on the page. Under Accumulative/Textural lens, one deepening or cadence shift is sufficient—here the final return-with-difference ("carrying the sculpted hush inside her") qualifies minimally, but agency remains passive and escalation is absent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Theme (wonder as essential oxygen, tended not locked away) emerges from images and the ritual rather than sermon. The amber sheet, sculpted hush, and aurora-light function as recurring motifs that reweight at the end. However, the final paragraph edges toward thematic echo ("wonder, once unfettered, demands to be tended") and the piece never tests the theme through conflict or ambiguity—no counter-pressure from the world that "traded silence for sirens." The ending reconfigures prior material but the reconfiguration is more conceptual assertion than felt cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with a consistent perceptual signature (synesthetic filtering, lyric rhythm). Diction is elevated and purposeful, creating a distinct texture. However, under peak pressure (the chime sequences), the register remains uniformly ornate rather than modulating with urgency—"midwifing awe," "velvet pressure against her ribs"—and filter verbs ("She remembered," "She closed her eyes, not to block...but to feel") cluster in high-intensity beats without clear voice motivation. No head-hopping or tense breaks, but the prose does not tighten under stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Heavy overwriting throughout. Nearly every sentence carries figurative density ("breath curling like spectral notation," "liquid sapphire," "silk scarves woven from silence and starlight") without pattern-taught payoff, creating sustained elevated diction that flattens rather than charges the beats. Paraphrase loops appear: "not by decree, but by vibration, by hue, by the courage..." echoes prior enumerations. Template cadence: "She [verb]" stems repeat across paragraphs. Register drift into abstract philosophy ("wonder, left unacknowledged, becomes brittle") clashes with the embodied ritual. Cumulative artifact penalty: −1.2 in Q7; appearance in final third disallows 9+ globally and caps high-band entries at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The premise (synesthetic bell ringer in ice cavern performing wonder-ritual) is functional but reads as a lyric exercise combining familiar elements (synesthesia, aurora, prism, hush-as-tangible) without a fresh synthesis that charges the stakes. The transformation test fails: swap the bell for another instrument, the cavern for a different sacred space, and the emotional arc is unchanged. No risk-taking that heightens pressure; the piece prioritizes texture over conflict. The closing image is resonant but not non-obvious.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Present throughout and drives the ritual action (raises mallet, strikes, walks away). However, her choices are ceremonial rather than pressure-tested—no decision alters tactics or forecloses a path with cost. She performs a scripted ritual; the amber sheet guides her hands. Functional but replaceable role; the bell ringer could be any synesthetic devotee.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Appears in three beats: initial holding, mid-ritual guidance (shifts gradients, edges soften), and final tucking away. The sheet's "breathing" gradients guide her hands, but this guidance is not shown constraining a choice or creating friction. The final act of tucking it away signals the song now lives in her bones—a purposeful reprise that reweights, but without causal pressure or cost. Gates: setup ✓, development (weak), payoff ✓. Scores in the 5-band for shaping one turn (mid-ritual) and a lyric reprise, but lacks irreplaceability and cost connection.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The "sculpted hush" recurs as an image (carved by wind/water, trembles, dances, sculpted anew, whispers thank you, carried inside her) but functions more as metaphor than stake-shaping concept. It does not constrain tactics or alter options on the page; it is the object of her work, not a force that opposes or tests her. Present throughout but ornamental. Gates: setup ✓, development (label-only), payoff (thematic echo). Cap at 3.8 for swappability (could be "frozen silence" or "crystallized stillness").</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Synesthesia is described (see colors as hue/texture/weight, taste G-minor as caramel, feel crescendo as velvet) but rarely shown enabling or constraining action with cost. It colors perception but does not create a trade-off or friction. The attribute is label-only in most beats; when dramatized (tasting, feeling), it is sensory illustration rather than tactical pressure. Gates: setup ✓, development (weak), payoff (absent from closure image). Introduced early, used decoratively, no cost tied to the trait. Cap at 4.6 for missing closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Unfetter" appears explicitly in three beats (amber sheet etched with "hues waiting to be unfettered," mid-ritual "next unfettering," final sequence "unfettered the final sequence"). The action is central to the ritual and the final sequence is the climactic beat. However, the mechanics are abstract—what does it mean to unfetter a hue?—and the action could be replaced with "release," "awaken," or "liberate" with minimal impact. Gates: all three ✓. Causal role in two beats, shapes closure, but swappable. Scores 6.1 for meeting all gates and driving the ending, docked for low specificity and no visible cost tied to the act itself.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The aurora is present from the opening (veils shimmer, pulse through fissures) and functions as her conductor's baton ("feel the aurora's pulse through her skin," "letting the aurora guide her mallet"). It appears in the final image ("aurora-light tangled in her hair"). However, the mechanics are vague—how does the aurora guide?—and it could be replaced with "moonlight" or "starlight" without structural change. Gates: setup ✓, development ✓, payoff ✓. Functional across beats but lacks specificity and causal pressure. Scores 5.3 for spanning all three gates with moderate involvement but low irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The ice cavern is essential: cathedral arches, frozen chandeliers, fissures admitting aurora, walls that bloom and weep, hidden quartz veins revealed by chimes. It supplies the acoustic and visual environment for the ritual and its transformation (ice cracks to reveal, hush dances around ankles). The cavern's properties constrain her performance (suspended bell, glacial ceiling) and the final image depends on the setting ("carrying the sculpted hush inside her, where it would never freeze again"). Gates: all three ✓. Strong causal role, closure linkage, specificity. Minor deduction: the cavern does not create tactical friction or force a mid-ritual choice. Scores 7.2 for essentiality and closure charge.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>The timeframe phrase appears once in the middle of the story as a simile ("At the moment a sculptor's chisel first strikes marble, the world holds its breath; so too did the cavern now"). It does not structure the narrative, impose urgency, or tighten decisions. The ritual unfolds in an untracked present with no clock or deadline. The phrase is ornamental, disconnected from the plot. Gates: none. Ornamental mention, no beats, no closure role. Cap at 2.8 for missing closure participation; further reduced to 2.1 for appearing mid-story as a one-off simile with zero tactical or temporal function.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Her motivation ("to certify wonder as essential, even when the world outside had forgotten how to pause") is stated early and repeated at closure ("wonder had been certified—not as luxury, but as oxygen"). However, it is told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants or costs. No friction between desire and price; she performs the ritual without obstacle or renunciation. The motivation frames the ritual but does not create a choice that forecloses a path. Gates: setup ✓, development (weak—no conflict), payoff ✓. Scores 5.6 for shaping one turn (the ritual as a whole) and appearing in the closure image, docked for lack of dramatized friction and no visible cost tied to the desire.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Tone is consistently lyric and elevated, with occasional shifts in rhythm (opening anchor, mid-ritual intensity, closing walk). "Oscillating repose" is not clearly legible—repose suggests stillness, yet the piece maintains high figurative density throughout. The tone does not modulate with pressure (no acceleration or compression during the chime sequences) and remains uniformly ornate. Functional but static; does not charge the final image through tonal contrast or cadence break. Gates: setup ✓ (tone established), development (present but static), payoff (no tonal shift at closure). Scores 4.8 for coherent lyric voice across the piece but lack of meaningful modulation or oscillation.</comment>
