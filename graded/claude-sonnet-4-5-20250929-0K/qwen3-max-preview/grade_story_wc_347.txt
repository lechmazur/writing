<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The caretaker's resignation and refusal to let the chorus grow are consistently embodied through action—dragging heels, dislodging pebbles—rather than stated. His handing the nut to the girl and turning back demonstrate endurance with visible cost (foreclosing connection, accepting isolation). Minor slip: "offhandedly exact in his weariness" edges toward label-speak at the closure beat, though the prior moves earn it. Internal contradiction (hates the silence / refuses more ghosts) drives choices throughout.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: the nut's blueprint enables the protagonist's guided path, the girl's presence triggers the rescue sequence, and his whistled code and moss-arrows causally lead her out. Closure is Earned Stasis—he returns to the orchard heart, sighs back at it, and assembles tomorrow's invisible path with visible cost (enduring isolation, foreclosing escape). One orientation anchor comes late (protagonist title "caretaker" clear only after "assigned this orchard"), but the delay does not obscure the dominant stake (prevent another ghost). Cost is legible in the final turn back and the reciprocal sigh.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The cliffside labyrinth, mechanical birds, moss patches, pebble clusters, and weeping willow are integrated into the rescue choreography and constrain the caretaker's tactics (heel-dragging on moss, pebble placement, whistle echoes). The nut as micro-object charges the ending when he hands it off and then resumes his path-building. Spatial choreography (switchbacks, ridge view, central grove) tracks cleanly. The birds' non-intervention (no alarms for the lost) subtly reinforces the orchard's cursed logic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prevent another ghost added to the chorus) is signaled early and tightens when frost timing forces action. One meaningful escalation: the girl is lost, the caretaker assembles guidance under time pressure, and the successful handoff of the nut forecloses his own exit. Cost is visible—he returns to the orchard heart as frost forms, accepting another cycle of duty. The arithmetic motivation ("one more soul trapped…one more ghost") could be more viscerally tested on the page; the rescue succeeds without serious friction.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme of graceless duty and invisible care emerges through particulars: heel-dragged moss-arrows, pebble-trails, whistled code, and the handed-off nut. The girl's line "You walk like you're annoyed at the ground" and his muttered reply ("Ground's earned it") deliver subtext without moralizing. The final image—assembling tomorrow's invisible path before frost—resonates as renunciation without stating a thesis. Minor: "graceless beauty" is named by the girl rather than purely earned through image, though the phrase reweights prior action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited with tight focal control; the caretaker's perceptual signature (moss, pebbles, whistled code) is selective and consistent. Diction ("offhandedly exact," "ancient and ungrateful") reflects his weary pragmatism. Dialogue is spare, natural, and goal-driven ("Hold this. Don't crack it."). Distance remains stable; no head-hopping. The prose rhythm modulates effectively between the opening's lyric sweep and the terse, functional rescue beats. One micro slip: "graceless beauty" feels slightly elevated for his idiom, though the girl's attribution mitigates it.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line recharges "assembling" and "offhandedly exact." Information density is high across beats (nut as key, blueprint in grooves, candle smoke and mirrors for deciphering). Two deductions: "offhandedly exact" recurs three times as a template phrase (−0.3), and "the orchard sighed around him, ancient and ungrateful, and he sighed back" edges into mirrored figurative convenience (−0.2). Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; no loops or scaffold elsewhere. Clarity and propulsion strong throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The core synthesis—reluctant caretaker using a microscopic blueprint to guide without touching—feels specific and purposeful. The mechanical birds' indifference to "the lost" versus "the defiant" adds fresh logic. The final turn (handing off the nut, returning to assemble tomorrow's path) grows from established particulars. Minor: the cursed-orchard frame and the lost-traveler rescue follow familiar templates; transformation arises more from execution (moss-arrows, whistled code) than from premise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Setup: introduced immediately. Development: his decision to guide the girl (not heroism but arithmetic) drives the middle rescue sequence. Payoff: he hands her the nut and turns back to the orchard heart, foreclosing his own exit. Causal pressure: his choices (heel-dragging, pebble placement, whistling) narrow options and enable the girl's escape. Cost: visible in his return and resumed duty. Irreplaceability: the reluctant-yet-committed dynamic anchors every beat.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Setup: introduced in paragraph four. Development: deciphered via candle smoke and mirrors (paragraph five), carried in his coat during the rescue. Payoff: handed to the girl with instructions, charging her exit and his return. Three distinct beats; reweighted meaning (key to memory → talisman for safe passage). Cost connection: handing it off forecloses his own use. Specificity: "smooth as river stone," grooves with blueprint. Near-indispensable; slightly docked for late first mention (second paragraph of action).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Setup: revealed in paragraph five. Development: the blueprint's safe corridors shape his offhand turns and enable the rescue tactics (moss-arrows, pebble-trails follow the map). Payoff: implied in "assembling tomorrow's invisible path" but not foregrounded. Two beats (deciphering, applying during rescue). Causal role solid but understated; could be swapped for "inherited knowledge" with minor edits. Closure linkage indirect.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Setup: appears in paragraph five ("offhandedly exact in his turns"). Development: embodied in heel-dragging and pebble placement (paragraph seven) and the final assembly. Payoff: "offhandedly exact in his weariness" at closure. Three mentions; constrains action (precision without flourish enables invisible guidance). Cost: the attribute makes his labor unrecognized. Moderate swappability ("methodical" or "precise" could substitute). Trait visible in choices, not label-only.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Setup: paragraph seven ("began to assemble guidance"). Development: dragging heels, dislodging pebbles, whistling code—three distinct tactics that enable the girl's escape. Payoff: "assembling tomorrow's invisible path" at closure. Causal spine: without assembly, no rescue; the action defines his method. Cost: assembly is endless duty. Irreplaceability high; "assemble" as frame and verb charges the ending. Minor: late first mention (paragraph seven of ten).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Setup: paragraph seven ("leaving impressions without touching"). Development: heel-dragging moss, dislodging pebbles, whistling—three on-page applications that evade the mechanical birds' alarms. Payoff: the method's success (girl found, birds indifferent) and its resumption at closure. Causal necessity: touching would trigger wards; the constraint drives tactics. Cost: invisibility ensures no recognition. Specificity: "triggered no alarms, left no fingerprints, disturbed no wards." Indispensable to the rescue logic.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Setup: opening line. Development: switchbacks, moss patches, canyon walls for echo, weeping willow with silver sap—all shape the rescue choreography. Mechanical birds constrain method (no alarms for the lost, but defiance would trigger). Payoff: "reached the central grove as the last light guttered out." Setting tightens the timeframe and enables the guidance tactics. Cost: the labyrinth's decay and frost form the endurance context. Strong integration across beats.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Setup: paragraph six ("before the night frost formed"). Development: "frost already feathered the first branches" (paragraph nine) and "air now sharp with impending ice" (paragraph ten) tighten urgency. Payoff: "reached the central grove as the last light guttered out." Clock tracked across three beats; time pressure drives the caretaker's decision to act and shapes the rescue's pace. Cost: reaching the grove just in time forecloses rest. Solid but not maximally leveraged for tactical shifts.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Setup: paragraph eight ("His motivation wasn't heroism; it was arithmetic"). Development: the arithmetic (prevent another ghost) drives his choice to guide, and the handoff of the nut enacts the care. Payoff: turning back to the orchard rather than escaping with the girl embodies the motive with cost. Friction: motive is told more than conflicted; the rescue succeeds without serious resistance. Two beats; causal but understated tension between desire (guide to safety) and cost (endure isolation).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Setup: named by the girl in paragraph nine ("graceless beauty"). Development: embodied in heel-dragged arrows, pebble-trails, muttered dialogue, and the weary sigh. Payoff: "offhandedly exact in his weariness" at closure modulates tone into resigned endurance. Coherent across beats; the oxymoron charges the pragmatic care. Docked for late explicit naming (paragraph nine) and for being told rather than purely inferred. Tone supports the ending but does not drive a turn.</comment>
