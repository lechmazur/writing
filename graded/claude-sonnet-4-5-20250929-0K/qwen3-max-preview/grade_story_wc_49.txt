<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clearly established through backstory and concrete detail (seventeen years of preparation, tracing murals, decoding lullabies), but her interiority remains largely explanatory rather than contradictory under pressure. The mission unfolds smoothly without genuine internal conflict or competing impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The vine's response and the apparitions' appearance feel more like validation than choices that foreclose paths with visible cost. The final moment reads as completion rather than renunciation or a decision that carries felt weight.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors cleanly (who/where/when by the opening paragraph). The piece reads under an Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through layered sensory detail, the arbor's memory-hum, and the progression from brittle tune to full chorus. However, the closure—the vine forming a wreath and "sacred space—ready to be filled"—lacks a decisive cost or reweighting that makes a before/after legible with pressure. The harvest moon's work is described as "done" but the protagonist's stance or the world's options don't demonstrably narrow or change on the page; the ending feels more like thematic echo than earned reconfiguration. Application of −0.5 for Cost proof test: no exact sentence shows Elara forfeiting, enduring with visible loss, or crystallizing a choice that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The arbor at dawn is vividly rendered with selective, purposeful detail: dew on the vine tendril, moss and machine oil scent, amber rays through brass goggles, shadows deepening as the sun climbs. The vine tendril functions as micro-setting, constraining Elara's action (she must play to it, it responds by curling around her wrist, then releases and blooms). The final wreath image charges the closure moment. Sensory hierarchy reflects Elara's focus (sound, touch, light over taste/smell), and the environment subtly guides the ritual's progression. No spatial confusion or placeholder generics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—restoring sacred practices through song—is signaled early and pressure accumulates as Elara plays and the vine responds. However, escalation relies on external validation (the vine glowing, the chorus appearing) rather than protagonist agency driving a tightening or deepening under the Accumulative lens. No on-page reversal or trade-off narrows options; coincidence (the harvest moon's invisible power, the apparitions' emergence) delivers the resolution without visible cost or foreclosed paths. The oak's knot opening and the chorus stepping through feel granted rather than earned by Elara's struggle or sacrifice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from concrete events: song as contract between human and earth, the tension between progress/pragmatism and sacred rhythm, forgetting versus reclamation. The piece resists overt moralizing until the penultimate lines ("She had not resurrected the past. / She had rekindled its heartbeat") which tilt toward authorial summary. The final image—the vine wreath awaiting "the next singer"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without a stated moral. Subtext operates in the gathering hush, the birds' silence, the oak's knot as mouth. Minor penalty for the explanatory closure framing that slightly undercuts the image's charge.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-person limited on Elara; no head-hopping. Voice carries distinct texture through diction choices ("verdant arbor," "paradox she wore with pride," "velvet over stone") and rhythmic control. However, the prose occasionally drifts into elevated register that feels authorial rather than character-bound ("celestial tides," "latent music," "translucent but vivid"). The oak's child-voice dialogue ("Why did we stop singing?") introduces a second speaker but Elara's non-verbal response keeps focalization clean. Perceptual signature is present (she listens to "the sigh between notes") but not sharply individuated. Free indirect style is clean where used.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and clarity is high, but repetitive syntactic patterns accumulate: "Not with her voice, but through..." "Not fables, but truths..." "Not from outside, but from within..." "Not in spectacle, but in surrender..." This parallelism reads as deliberate patterning but becomes template-like across the full piece, triggering −0.4 for template-cadence in high-density runs. Stock metaphors appear ("velvet over stone," "mist under morning sun") without fresh transformation. Information density is good; no paraphrase loops or major scaffolding. The overwriting check flags figurative language in most sentences of key beats (the playing sequence, the apparition emergence) without cost or pattern-teaching payoff, applying −0.5 for density and coherence drift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The whimsical tinkerer restoring forgotten songs through a ritual tied to the harvest moon offers a non-obvious synthesis of steampunk aesthetic (brass goggles, machine oil, clocktower gear) and eco-spiritual reclamation. However, the emotional arc and plot structure follow a familiar template: solitary artisan completes long preparation, performs ritual, witnesses magical validation, departs satisfied. The transformation test reveals that swapping names/setting would leave the emotional and thematic beats largely unchanged. The vine tendril and flute are specific, but the apparitions' appearance and the wreath's perfect closure feel convenient rather than inevitable. No bold risk or fresh inflection that reweights prior material in an unexpected way.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her preparation is detailed, but her on-page choices are limited: she kneels, presses her palm to soil, begins to play, shifts key, lowers the flute, stands, tucks the flute away. These actions follow a predetermined ritual rather than creating key turns through decisions under pressure. The apparitions and vine blooms respond to her playing but she does not alter tactics, face dilemmas, or make trade-offs that redefine options. Setup and closure participation are present; middle development involves playing rather than choosing. Two gates met, no strong causal pressure or cost. Band 5.0–6.9 guidance; score 5.2 for functional presence across beats without decision-driven turns.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The vine tendril appears in multiple beats: Elara brushes dew from it (opening), it quivers and curls around her wrist (mid-scene response), it tightens in solidarity, releases and stretches upward, bursts into blossoms, then curls into a wreath (closure). It constrains her action (she must sing to it) and its evolving state tracks the ritual's progress. Present in setup, development, and payoff with clear causal linkage to the dominant stake. The wreath's final form charges the ending image. Strong beat involvement (three distinct moments), closure linkage, and specificity. Band 7.0–8.4 guidance; score 7.8 for essential role across beats and ending participation.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The harvest moon is mentioned in the opening (its invisible power "still breathed... into the earth below") and referenced in "The harvest moon's work was done" near the end, but it does not constrain choices or alter tactics on the page. Its mechanics are told rather than dramatized; Elara's ritual could proceed identically if the moon were absent as a concept. The timeframe "when everything aligns" does more causal work than the moon itself. Setup and payoff present but no middle development. Functional but replaceable; logically consistent yet swappable with another celestial event. Band 3.0–4.9 guidance; score 4.9 for presence without demonstrated necessity.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Spins golden stories" is dramatized through Elara's flute playing: "Elara spun golden stories with each note—not fables, but truths..." The attribute shapes the middle beat (she plays stories about rhythm, dance, celestial tides) and is reprised in the reflection passage ("to spin golden stories not from fantasy, but from reverence"). However, no visible cost or constraint is tied to this trait; it describes her method without foreclosing options or creating trade-offs. Setup, development, and lyric reprise present. One key beat shaped, no specific cost. Band 5.0–6.9 guidance; score 6.3 for purposeful early-final reprise that reweights the method without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Remedy" is framed as Elara's mission in paragraph 5 ("Her mission was not invention, but remedy—to restore sacred practices...") and recurs in the reflection ("some remedies require no blade, no potion, only presence and pitch"). It defines her approach but does not drive specific turns; the playing and the vine's response could be framed as "restoration" or "awakening" with minor edits. The concept is present in setup and thematically at closure but does not constrain middle choices or tactics. Setup and payoff met, middle development indirect. Band 5.0–6.9 guidance; score 6.7 for shaping one key turn (the mission framing) and thematic closure linkage without irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Forgotten songs" are signaled early (paragraph 6: "melodies. Forgotten songs, tucked into hollow reeds and copper pipes") and their mechanics matter throughout: Elara plays the flute forged from branch and gear, the tune is "brittle at first," she shifts key to reclamation, the apparitions sing in harmony. The method shapes her preparation (tracing murals, decoding lullabies, repairing music boxes) and the climax (playing triggers the vine's bloom and the chorus's appearance). Present in setup, drives multiple middle beats, and is active at closure. Strong beat involvement and causal pressure. Band 7.0–8.4 guidance; score 7.4 for essential role across attempts and ending.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The verdant arbor at dawn anchors the entire scene and its properties (the arbor hums with memory, shadows deepen though the sun climbs, the oldest oak's knot splits open, roots tap rhythm, branches sway) supply resources and constrain the ritual's progression. Elara kneels in it, the vine is part of it, the apparitions emerge from it, and the final wreath is left within it. Setup, development, and payoff all present. The arbor's "memory" and the oak's knot as doorway charge the closure. However, it functions more as stage than as a constraint that alters tactics under pressure. Band 7.0–8.4 guidance; score 6.8 for strong presence across beats and closure charge without tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"When everything aligns" is mentioned in the opening (Elara has waited seventeen years for this morning) and indirectly referenced at closure ("The harvest moon's work was done... the next alignment"). However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions or tactics on the page; no live clock or countdown alters Elara's moves. The alignment is declared rather than dramatized as pressure. Setup and payoff present, no middle development. Functional mention without mechanical constraint. Band 3.0–4.9 guidance; score 4.1 for presence in framing and closure nod without demonstrated urgency or tactical impact.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The motivation "to restore sacred practices the village had buried beneath progress and pragmatism" is stated in paragraph 5 and elaborated through backstory (seventeen years of preparation, tracing murals, decoding lullabies). It drives Elara's mission and the playing sequence but is not dramatized with internal friction or competing costs. The desire is told and consistent rather than conflicted in choices. Setup and development present; closure participation is thematic (the arbor remembers, "the land remembering, the people soon to follow"). One key turn shaped without visible trade-off. Band 5.0–6.9 guidance; score 6.4 for clear causal role in one major beat and ending linkage without friction between wants and costs.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Gathering hush" appears explicitly ("a gathering hush settling like velvet over stone," "The gathering hush lingered, not as silence, but as sacred space") and is dramatized through escalating silence: birds cease, wind pauses, the river holds its breath. The tone modulates with pressure—brittle tune becomes crescendo, then fades to the wreath's quiet—and charges the final image (the hush as "sacred space—ready to be filled"). Coherent through turns, present in multiple beats, and reconfigured with cost at closure. Band 7.0–8.4 guidance; score 7.6 for essential role across beats and a charged final reweighting.</comment>
