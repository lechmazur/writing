<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to rebuild faith is clear and drives her excavation work, but her internal experience remains abstract—"warmly curious," "cautious enchantment"—rather than embodied through contradictory impulses or visceral struggle. The orchard's approval ("roots curled gently around her wrists...as if the orchard itself approved") replaces earned tension with convenient affirmation. Her final weeping reads as release rather than a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. Villagers arriving at dawn feels orchestrated rather than pressured by her prior actions.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who and where by the opening ("Elara, a diaspora returnee") but the dominant stake—restoring communal faith versus personal belief—remains diffuse until the sundial reassembly crystallizes near the end. The piece teaches an Accumulative lens (petals, roots, artifacts layer meaning), but the closure lacks a decisive tightening: villagers arrive with seeds and songs, validating Elara's effort without on-page cost or trade-off. The Orientation Test penalty (−0.3) applies: "catacomb orchard" and "sundial base" are named early, but their spatial and temporal relationship to Elara's excavation remains vague past 120 words, and the effect does not charge closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard is vividly realized—"gnarled roots threading between femurs and skulls," "petals fell upward"—and sensory details (scent of damp loam, glint of quartz, echo of dripping water) guide Elara's wandering. The sundial base and ancestor stones constrain her reconstruction work, shaping the middle beats. However, spatial choreography blurs: distances between niche, mosaic, and chamber are unstaged, and the orchard's layout never coheres into a navigable map that pressures her choices at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—restoring the sundial to restore faith—is signaled early, but escalation is gentle: Elara digs, finds artifacts, reassembles stones without friction or trade-off. The orchard's roots "steady" rather than hinder, and the final alignment happens without visible cost ("the interruption was over"). Villagers' arrival provides communal validation rather than a protagonist-driven turn. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening is present (realizing the sundial "wasn't merely broken—it was displaced"), but the lack of a live obstacle or renunciation caps the score in the 6s.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme—faith as rhythm to tend, not monument to preserve—emerges from the sundial's reassembly and the orchard's pulse, avoiding overt statement until the final paragraph. However, the closing lines veer into thesis-speak: "Faith, she understood, was not a monument to preserve, but a rhythm to tend—a shadow cast anew each dawn, if one only dares to rebuild its base." This replaces scene pressure with articulated wisdom (−0.5). The sundial and roots recur with shifting valence, but the conceptual repricing lacks undeniable cost; the orchard simply approves.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited; perceptual signature—"warmly curious gaze," "cautious enchantment"—reads as authorial labeling rather than Elara's idiom under pressure. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register inconsistent with a hands-in-soil returnee: "spiritual dislocation," "communal belief," "the diaspora returnee became the orchard's quiet compass." Free indirect style is clean, but the prose does not modulate with urgency; syntactic rhythm remains lyric-steady throughout, flattening the distinction between excavation and epiphany. No dialogue appears, so those bullets are not assessed.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Heavy figurative density in nearly every sentence ("orchard breathed," "time itself bent like roots," "magic here was shy, bruised by neglect") without pattern-teaching or payoff; the accumulation blurs rather than sharpens pressure (−0.6 for overwriting). Template cadence appears in mid-section beats: "Each shovelful…Each artifact…Each detour" (−0.4). Paraphrase loops: "interrupted journey" restated as "the journey had looped back," "diaspora had ended" echoed as "the diaspora returnee" (−0.2). Momentum sags under weight of modifier stacks and abstract nouns ("purposeful wandering," "spiritual dislocation," "rhythmic reweaving"). Information density is low; many lines rephrase rather than advance.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard premise offers fresh visual texture, but the emotional arc—diaspora returnee restores communal faith through patient excavation—follows a familiar template of exile, pilgrimage, and symbolic restoration without transforming it through unexpected cost or friction. "Purposeful wandering" and "interrupted journeys" remain abstract concepts rather than tactics tested under pressure. The orchard's sentient approval and villagers' dawn arrival read as convenient affirmations rather than choices that surprise in hindsight. Derivative Premise Guardrail applies (−0.7): the core mirrors writing-prompt archetypes (return, ritual restoration, communal awakening) without lived complication.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her decision to excavate and reassemble the sundial drives the middle and ending beats. However, her choices are affirmed rather than tested: the orchard approves, roots steady her, villagers validate. She observes and acts, but without a visible trade-off or renunciation that alters later options. Setup present, development functional, closure linked; causal pressure is moderate (+0.5), but swappability is high—another earnest returnee with similar reverence could fill the role with minor edits (−0.5). Two beats (excavation, reassembly) involved (+0.9). Late mild artifact (label "warmly curious" without embodied constraint, −0.3).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The sundial base is introduced early (paragraph 1), described in multiple beats (tracing glyphs, realizing displacement, reassembling the circle), and returns with reweighted meaning at closure when shadows align. It frames Elara's goal and the final chime. Setup strong (+0.7), two distinct beats (discovery, reassembly, +0.9), closure linkage moderate (+0.9), causal pressure moderate (enables the ending alignment, +0.7). However, swappability is present—another broken ritual object (altar, bell, mosaic) could serve the same function with light edits (−0.6). Specificity of "sundial" (marking time/seasons) supports theme but is not irreplaceable (−0.4).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Interrupted journeys" is named once mid-story ("These were not interruptions to her journey—they were the journey") and referenced at closure ("the interrupted journey had not ended; it had rooted"). It functions as thematic claim rather than stake-shaping constraint; Elara's excavation is steady, not interrupted by friction or detours that force trade-offs. No middle beat where the concept changes tactics or options. Setup weak (concept arrives late as reflection, −0.5), development absent (no choice constrained by interruption, gate missing, cap 3.4), closure participation present as theme-echo only (+0.3). Ornamental (−0.7), label-only (−0.3). Swappable with "layered pilgrimage" or "patient gathering" (−0.5).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Warmly curious" appears twice as label ("warmly curious gaze," "her warmly curious heart") without on-page action that demonstrates the trait under pressure or constrains a choice. It does not prevent an easier path or enable a risky one; the orchard validates her approach without friction. Setup present as label (+0.3), development absent (no choice shaped by curiosity versus caution, gate missing, cap 3.4), closure participation as summary only ("her warmly curious heart the needle"). Label-only trait with no visible tradeoff (−0.6), swappable with "gentle reverence" or "patient attentiveness" (−0.6), ornamental (−0.5).</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Rebuild" is signaled early ("to rebuild—not stone by stone, but faith by fragment"), enacted through excavation and sundial reassembly across multiple beats, and explicitly fulfilled at closure when faith "speaks again." The action is irreplaceable: without rebuilding, the plot does not cohere. Setup strong (+0.7), three beats (kneeling, excavating, reassembling, +1.4), causal pressure high (the act narrows options and defines tactics, +1.2), closure linkage high (rebuilding completes the arc, +1.5). Minor swappability—"restore" or "awaken" could substitute with light edits (−0.5).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Purposeful wandering" is named mid-story ("Purposeful wandering meant no straight lines") and described as method (following scent, glint, echo to find context). It appears again at closure ("she wandered anew—not lost, but listening"). However, it does not constrain a choice or alter tactics under pressure; Elara's detours reveal context but no trade-off between wandering and efficiency is dramatized. Setup moderate (concept arrives mid-story, −0.3), one beat (detours unearthing context, +0.4), closure participation as summary (+0.5), causal pressure weak (enables discovery but no cost, +0.3). Swappable with "patient exploration" or "layered search" (−0.6), ornamental (−0.5).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard is established in the opening line, supplies tactile details (roots, bones, petals, loam) that guide Elara's excavation, and returns at closure when "roots still snake between bones" and the orchard keeps time. The setting constrains her work (digging around roots, navigating collapsed niches) and charges the final image. Setup strong (+0.8), three beats (kneeling, detours, final alignment, +1.4), causal pressure high (environment shapes tactics and ending, +1.4), closure linkage high (+1.6), specificity strong (roots intertwined with bones is irreplaceable, +0.7). Minor spatial vagueness (distances unclear, −0.3).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Across excavating a tomb" is mentioned mid-story ("began excavating the adjacent tomb") and again at closure ("Each morning, she wandered anew"). However, time is not tracked; the excavation spans "one dusk" and "dawn," but no clock tightens decisions or alters tactics. The timeframe is backdrop rather than pressure. Setup weak (time arrives mid-story as activity, −0.4), development absent (no deadline or duration constraint shapes choice, gate missing, cap 3.4), closure participation weak (time continues open-ended, +0.2). Summary-only (excavation recounted, not dramatized with temporal friction, −0.6), swappable with "seasons" or "days" (−0.5).</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"To restore lost faith" is named early ("to rebuild...faith by fragment") and crystallizes mid-story ("to restore lost faith meant reweaving time into place"). It drives Elara's excavation and sundial reassembly, and the ending declares faith restored. However, internal conflict between personal belief and communal ritual is told rather than dramatized; no on-page moment shows Elara doubting or risking her own faith. Setup strong (+0.7), two beats (motivation articulated, sundial reassembly, +0.9), closure linkage high (faith restored, +1.3), causal pressure moderate (goal shapes actions but no friction, +0.6). Told friction rather than enacted (−0.6), swappable with "awaken communal memory" (−0.5).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Cautious enchantment" is named once mid-story ("smiled, not in wonder, but in cautious enchantment") and recurs implicitly in the orchard's "shy" magic and Elara's patient reverence. Tone is coherent—lyric, hushed, affirming—but does not modulate with pressure; discovery and closure carry the same gentle cadence. Setup weak (tone named mid-story as label, −0.4), development present (tone inflects multiple beats, +0.6), closure participation moderate (tone charges final image with roots cradling Elara, +0.9). Static mood without escalation (−0.5), label-only mention (−0.3), swappable with "gentle wonder" or "reverent patience" (−0.4).</comment>
