<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lira's motivation to join community is clear and drives her search, but her internal landscape tilts heavily abstract ("luminescent ache," "braided loneliness into bridges") without sustained embodied contradiction. The final shift from pleading to welcoming reads more as stated transformation than earned through on-page struggle with genuine doubt or cost. The moth-lashed child and glass-blower remain gestural pressure points rather than forcing difficult choices. No diagnostic label-speak in peak beats, but interiority leans poetic summary over particularized impulse.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who and where by the opening paragraph; when is gestural ("beyond the murmur of lost languages") but does not obscure the present scene. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: sculptures accumulate, tags and notes layer, culminating in the arbor ritual that crystallizes Lira's acceptance. Closure (arbor dedication, figures emerge, sculptures shift function) lands on the page, but cost is implied through vocabulary ("no longer pleaded") rather than a visible forfeiture or altered tactic. The deepening is present but diffuse across many micro-beats without one sharp tightening that narrows options under pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The crystalline orchard, shimmering crater, and obsidian arbor are vividly rendered with sensory specificity (quartz branches drip liquid light, amethyst paths). The arbor constrains Lira's final choice—she must press palms and whisper her name to join the web—charging the closure image. Spatial choreography remains clear across locations. Minor: the moth-lashed child and storm-cloud weaver appear as catalog entries without distinct spatial anchoring in their brief mentions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (graft onto community) is signaled early. The search for Vesper's tags provides a through-line, and Lira's sculptures evolve from plea to announcement, showing progression. However, escalation reads as accretive layering (others notice, a note appears, Vesper arrives) without a moment where Lira must choose between competing goods or pay a visible price. The arbor dedication is offered freely; no renunciation or foreclosed path is dramatized. Luck (Vesper waiting, figures emerging) resolves the want without agency-driven cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme (kinship as chosen resonance, loneliness learning to bloom) emerges through images: reed sculptures, the arbor-loom, collaborative works. The final image of Lira handing a reed to travelers reweights her role without stating a moral. Minor weakness: phrases like "myth was the first stitch in community's quilt" and "the grammar of kinship made flesh" edge toward abstraction, and the arbor's revelation ("not for thread, but for memory") risks symbolic convenience introduced late. No overt sermonizing, but thematic echo is close in "loneliness learned to bloom."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Lira; perceptual signature is lyric and image-dense ("eyes that held centuries," "moss that glowed like drowned constellations"). Dialogue is sparse and serves subtext ("You sculpt absence into presence"). Diction stays elevated and consistent, though register occasionally drifts toward abstraction ("boldly sympathetic," "the language beyond murmur") that feels authorial rather than grounded in Lira's embodied thought. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks; psychic distance is controlled.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and imagery is dense, but several lines loop conceptually: "not a phantom, but a wiry elder" and "not for thread, but for memory" repeat the same corrective structure; "braided loneliness into bridges" and "stitching themselves into the land's memory" paraphrase the core metaphor. Template cadence in the final montage ("reed-and-glass birds…murals that shifted…paths that glowed") stacks parallel constructions without variation. Figurative language is vivid but appears in nearly every sentence, risking density without escalation. No major causality breaks, but momentum sags in the montage section. Deductions: paraphrase loop −0.3, template cadence −0.4, density without escalation −0.3 = baseline ~6.3.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The premise (artist seeking kinship through collaborative sculpture and street-art trail) synthesizes familiar "lonely wanderer finds belonging" and "hidden artist community" templates. The obsidian arbor as memory-loom offers a fresh inflection, and the final image of Lira as grafting point has earned resonance. However, the emotional arc (search → discovery → ritual → acceptance) follows a predictable trajectory without risky turns, and the collaborative utopia resolution lacks friction or counter-pressure. Vesper's arrival and the figures' emergence feel preordained rather than hard-won.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Lira's choices (leaving sculptures, following clues, pressing palms to the arbor) create beats but are reactive rather than forcing key turns. She accepts Vesper's guidance without conflict. Present across the arc but replaceable with another seeker archetype.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The glimmering obsidian arbor appears early (first tag beneath it), returns at the note discovery, and anchors the climax where Lira dedicates her name. Its function as memory-loom is revealed and used, constraining her final choice. Integral to closure but the mechanics are told rather than demonstrated through multiple tactile engagements.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Webs of kinship frame the search and are made literal in the arbor's glyph tapestry. The concept shapes Lira's tactics (leaving clues, seeking Vesper) and the ending (becoming a grafting point). However, it remains thematic backdrop more than a force that narrows options under pressure; Lira never faces a trade-off between kinship and another want.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Boldly sympathetic" appears once as a label ("Boldly sympathetic, Lira didn't hesitate") but does not constrain or enable an on-page action with visible cost. She trusts the note, but the gesture reads as plot convenience rather than a risky choice enabled by this specific trait. Label-only.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Dedicate" drives the climax: Lira dedicates her name to the arbor, the glyphs swirl and settle, and her sculptures shift function. The action is central to closure and could not be swapped without breaking the arbor-loom logic. Present in the ending beat and redefines her role, though the mechanics are summarized rather than shown through multiple steps.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The shared search for Vesper's tags shapes Lira's daily routine and sculptures, leading to the note and meeting. Others notice her work, creating a collaborative thread. The method is signaled early and recurs, but the search resolves through Vesper's arrival rather than Lira's tactical choices, weakening agency. Functional across beats but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The crystalline orchard and shimmering crater anchor the setting and provide the arbor's location. The weeping grove is the meeting site. Environment is vivid and specific, and the arbor's physical presence constrains Lira's final act. However, the orchard does not pressure choices mid-story; it functions more as backdrop than tactical terrain. Present in closure but not altering tactics earlier.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Beyond the murmur of lost languages" appears as an opening clause but remains abstract and untracked. No clock tightens decisions; "weeks" and "days" are mentioned generically without urgency. Time does not constrain tactics or escalate pressure. Ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lira's desire to graft onto community is dramatized through sculptures as pleas, the search for Vesper, and the arbor dedication. The want drives every beat and culminates in her becoming a grafting point for others. Minor friction: the path from loneliness to belonging is smooth; no on-page moment where she doubts, retreats, or pays a visible cost beyond vulnerability. Desire is clear and closure-linked but lacks conflicted choice.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Luminescent ache" is established early ("her heart aching with the luminescent ache of one who remembers belonging") and recurs through imagery (crater's shimmer, quartz starlight, glowing moss). Tone remains consistent and modulates at the arbor dedication, where communion replaces plea. The ache charges the final image ("loneliness learned to bloom") without becoming static. Coherent through turns but leans heavily on vocabulary repetition rather than tonal shift earned by pressure.</comment>
