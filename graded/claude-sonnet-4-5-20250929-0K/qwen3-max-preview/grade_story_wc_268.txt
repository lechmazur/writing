<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation is clear and drives action through the planted messages and final pellet placement. However, her interior experience remains largely abstract—"burned colder than the stars," "hollow echo of justice"—without embodied contradiction or micro-choices that reveal competing impulses under pressure. The secondary cast (librarian, scribe, general) are narrative conveniences who converge without individuated friction or resistance. The ending speech ("Truth is not a weapon. It is a mirror.") tips into aphoristic declaration rather than dramatized realization, undercutting the cost of her renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece signals its pattern early—cryptic messages across weeks—and the closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis: she declines the throne with visible cost). Orientation anchors are present by the opening paragraph (diminutive titan, ancient temple library, exile mission). The causal chain is legible: planted messages → converging witnesses → fountain revelation → pretender unmasked. However, the "days bled into weeks" ellipsis compresses all escalation off-page, and the final renunciation lacks a visible on-page forfeit that closes a living option; the cost is asserted ("hollow echo") rather than shown in a tactical sacrifice or relational fracture.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The ancient temple library is vivid and purposeful: "dust motes danced in starlight older than kingdoms," "books lined the walls like tombstones." The Celestial Alcove and sacred font beneath the throne are concrete locations that constrain the protagonist's approach and supply the mechanism for unmasking. The iron gall ink pellet functions as a micro-object whose properties (dissolved in water, reacts with skin) directly enable the climactic revelation. Spatial choreography is clean throughout (vaulted halls, gallery vantage). The "constellations outside the shattered dome paused mid-drift" motif recurs and charges the closure without becoming a checklist symbol.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>One dominant stake: unmask the pretender. The piece tightens once—from solitary planting to the converging witnesses to the fountain revelation—and that turn narrows the pretender's escape. However, the protagonist's agency is largely preparatory; the climactic exposure happens through the secondary cast's discovery and the pellet's reaction, not through a choice she makes in the closure beat. The cost (declining the throne) is declared but not tested on the page by a competing pull or visible sacrifice. Under the Accumulative lens, the pressure coheres but does not escalate tactically after the midpoint; the ending reconfigures meaning but without a felt trade-off that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Theme—truth as erosion, not weapon—emerges organically from the protagonist's method (cryptic messages, ink pellet, patient drift) and the final mirror metaphor. The recurring "rune of drift" motif and the closing line ("The crown is not worn. It is carried.") offer conceptual resonance. However, the final speech tips into overt moralizing ("You sundered yourselves by refusing to look"), and the thematic echo in the last paragraph ("I am the rune of drift... I move where truth is forgotten") articulates the premise too directly, replacing scene pressure with authorial thesis. The second ink pellet tucked into the book's binding is a neat circular image but feels like token recurrence rather than a reweighting charged by prior cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable; focalization remains with the protagonist throughout. The perceptual signature is consistent—elevated diction ("regally unpretentious," "cruel arithmetic of exile," "ink bleeding through parchment")—and the voice modulates appropriately from the temple solitude to the crowded throne room. Dialogue is sparse and purposeful; the protagonist's single line ("Truth is not a weapon...") is thematically apt but leans aphoristic. Minor register drift: "iron gall ink pellet" reads technical against the otherwise poetic lexicon. Psychic distance holds steady, and no head-hopping occurs. The prose rhythm accelerates cleanly through the convergence sequence without syntactic monotony.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and figurative language is vivid ("footfalls swallowed by centuries of silence," "moving like ink bleeding through parchment"). Information density is high; most lines advance character, atmosphere, or plot. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "Books lined the walls like tombstones, each spine a silent sentinel" immediately followed by "she chose none, yet left traces in all" recaps the same beat. Stock metaphors cluster in the opening third ("dust of the ancient temple," "stars burned colder," "hollow echo of justice"). The final paragraph's "absorbed her absence as it had absorbed her presence: without fanfare, without grief, with the quiet grace of stone accepting moss" is lush but stacks three parallel clauses that dilate the closure image without adding new pressure. No major clarity breaks, but the density dips in reflective passages.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The core premise—exiled royal using planted literary messages and alchemical ink to expose a pretender—offers a fresh synthesis of political intrigue and textual rebellion. The "rune of drift" framing and the protagonist's refusal to rule avoid the standard restoration arc. However, the iron gall ink pellet's properties (ancestral sigils appear on usurper's skin) feel convenient, introduced late without groundwork in the world's magic or biology. The secondary cast's convergence ("They converged—not as conspirators, but as witnesses drawn by gravity's quiet pull") reads as authorial convenience rather than earned causality. The closing gesture (second pellet in the book) is elegant but risks becoming a signature flourish rather than a necessary escalation. Emotional truth is present in the protagonist's bitterness, but the pretender remains a stock antagonist with no voice or counter-claim.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The diminutive titan protagonist is present throughout and her choices (planting messages, placing the pellet, declining the throne) create key turns. However, most decisive action occurs off-page during the "days bled into weeks" ellipsis; on-page she observes, plants, and waits. The final refusal to rule is a meaningful choice but lacks immediate tactical cost or friction—she simply declines and leaves. Setup and closure participation are strong; middle development is largely summary.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The iron gall ink pellet appears in three beats: held in her palm, placed beneath the coronation scroll, and dissolved in the font to unmask the pretender. Its specific properties (reacts with water, reveals ancestral sigils) are load-bearing at the climax. A second pellet recurs in the final image, reweighting the motif as an ongoing instrument rather than a one-time tool. Early signal, middle placement, and closure linkage all present; cost connection is indirect but clear (the pellet's use forecloses armed rebellion).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"A rune of drift" is invoked repeatedly as metaphor and self-description ("She had learned patience in the silence between falling stars," "I am the rune of drift"). It frames the protagonist's method (patient, erosive, decentralized) but does not constrain a specific on-page choice or alter tactics under pressure. The concept remains thematic rather than mechanical; it could be replaced with "patient saboteur" or "shadow architect" without structural loss. Present throughout but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Regally unpretentious" is defined in the opening ("not by choice, but by the cruel arithmetic of exile: crownless, voiceless, yet never powerless") and manifests in her refusal to wear the crown at the end. However, the trait is asserted rather than tested; no on-page beat shows her struggling between regal display and modesty, or paying a cost for remaining unadorned. The attribute is present and consistent but does not enable or constrain a pivotal action.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Sunder" appears twice: the pretender's illusion will be "sundered" by the pellet, and the protagonist tells the people "You sundered yourselves by refusing to look." The pellet's revelation at the fountain executes the first meaning and defines the climax; the second use reframes the theme. The action is load-bearing at closure, though the protagonist does not perform the sundering herself—the ink and the witnesses do. Swappable with "shatter" or "unmask" but tightly integrated into the ending turn.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Cryptic messages in library books are signaled early ("Each message was a rune of drift... guiding the disillusioned through labyrinths of metaphor"), planted mid-story ("folded corners, marginalia in cipher, phrases rearranged"), and pay off when the librarian, scribe, and general find and decode them. The method shapes the protagonist's tactics (patient accumulation rather than direct confrontation) and enables the convergence that witnesses the unmasking. Mechanics are clear; cost is opportunity (years in exile). The riddle in the Celestial Alcove is a specific instance that drives discovery.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The ancient temple library is present throughout: opening location, source of the books used for messages, site of the Celestial Alcove where the riddle is placed, and the closing image ("The library, older than memory, absorbed her absence"). It supplies the resources (forgotten tomes) and the spatial layout (vaulted halls, gallery vantage) that shape her approach and her final exit. The setting constrains her to textual rebellion rather than armed force and charges the closure image with its timeless, indifferent endurance. Setup, development, and payoff all present.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Across the pause of shifting constellations" frames the opening and recurs at closure ("the night the constellations resumed their march"). The pause suggests a suspended moment or liminal time, but it does not tighten decisions or create urgency; the protagonist works across "days bled into weeks" without a live clock. The timeframe is atmospheric and thematic rather than tactical. It charges the tone but does not constrain a choice or escalate pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>To unmask the pretender is the stated mission in the opening paragraph and drives all on-page actions: planting messages, placing the pellet, watching the fountain revelation. The motivation is clear and consistent. However, it is not dramatized as conflicted—no competing desire (e.g., safety, reunion with her people, doubt about the cost of exposure) creates friction. The "hollow echo of justice delayed too long" gestures at cost but is told rather than shown in a moment of hesitation or sacrifice. Setup and payoff strong; internal friction minimal.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Graceful collapse" is embodied throughout: the pretender's illusion erodes rather than explodes, the people's certainty crumbles ("Gasps became shouts; shouts became silence"), and the protagonist declines triumph for patient departure. The tone modulates from solitary patience (opening temple silence) to collective reckoning (throne room) to resigned withdrawal (closing library image). Syntax and pacing reflect the tone: long, suspended clauses in the opening give way to terse beats at the revelation, then return to lyric reflection at the end. The tone charges the final image without becoming static or sentimental.</comment>
