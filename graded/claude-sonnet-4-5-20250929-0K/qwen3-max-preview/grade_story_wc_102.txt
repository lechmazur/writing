<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The artist's motivation is abstract—seeking "unused love"—but never tested by contradictory impulses or visceral cost. Interiority relies on lyric summary ("a quiet, gnawing question") rather than embodied contradiction. The pilgrim encounter demands no choice from her; she kneels, matches breath, and receives revelation without forfeiting a live option or confronting a flaw. Final "opening her eyes" functions as passive reception, not agency earned through prior struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchors—who, where, when—arrive within bounds. The quest ("find the pilgrim") follows the tear's trajectory using breath modulation, establishing causal linkage. However, the ending delivers Resonant Reconfiguration (the reservoir is sung, not stored) without visible cost: the artist receives the answer, the viaduct blooms brighter, no option foreclosed. The piece teaches an accumulative lens but the closure reconfiguration lacks felt price or trade-off on the page, reducing the landing to reception rather than transformation with consequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The viaduct's bioluminescent vines, orchid trellis, and ironwork arches create vivid sensory anchors that guide the artist's ascent. The camera obscura's aperture adjustment and the tear's trajectory shape her tactical moves (breath alteration, path following). Spatial choreography remains clear across the climb. The setting charges the final image (blooms brighten) and constrains approach (breath-based navigation), meeting the micro-setting standard for this length and nearly reaching the 7.0 gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—locating unused love's reservoir—is signaled early and pursued through breath-tracking. The tear discovery at midpoint narrows the search to the pilgrim. Yet the climax demands no choice: the artist kneels, matches breath, and the tear unfurls automatically, granting access without cost. No live option is foreclosed, no trade-off faced. The single tightening (finding the tear) raises anticipation but the resolution gifts revelation rather than extracting visible price, leaving escalation incomplete under any lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The central question—"where is unused love stored?"—emerges from concrete imagery (coins beneath floorboards, songs to empty rooms) and resolves through the final image: "not stored; it was sung." The answer reweights prior search particulars without overt moralizing. However, the artist's epiphany is received rather than earned through struggle or sacrifice, softening thematic resonance. The mist permeating her body and the viaduct blooming brighter offer lyric closure, but the ease of access undercuts the weight of discovery.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The prose establishes a distinct lyric register with purposeful compression ("drowned stars," "lute of revelation") and maintains stable third-person limited POV throughout. Perceptual signature—scent of jasmine, breath-counting, aperture adjustment—grounds the artist's specialized attention. However, elevated diction clusters densely in every paragraph without pattern-teaching or clear payoff at closure, creating a homogeneous texture that flattens urgency. No dialogue present; no head-hopping. Internal voice remains coherent but lacks modulation under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Figurative language saturates most sentences ("brass instrument humming with the breath of the wind," "petals became faces," "archways became arms") without escalation pattern or clear closure linkage, triggering density penalty. Paraphrase loops appear: "not nostalgia, nor penance" / "Not discarded, not wasted" / "Not a person, not exactly" recur as template negations. "The artist's breath hitched" is the lone embodied reaction in a quest framed as spiritual curiosity. Information density is moderate; clarity holds, but momentum sags under ornamental layering and repetitive stems reduce propulsion in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The synthesis—camera obscura artist tracking a metaphysical pilgrim via breath technique—offers a specific, non-obvious combination. The "unused love pooled in hidden hollows" premise and Kwan Yin's tear as artifact provide fresh inflections on spiritual quest material. However, the plot's core—seeker finds guide, receives revelation—follows a familiar template without transformation through character flaw or morally complex cost. The final answer ("love was sung") arrives as lyric assertion rather than insight tested by prior particulars, limiting ingenuity's depth.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Camera obscura artist is named early, uses the instrument twice (adjusting aperture to see the tear, packing it to follow), and makes micro-choices (breath modulation, kneeling). Yet no key turn traces to her agency—she observes, follows, receives. The obscura enables discovery but does not shape a decision with cost. Present and functional, but swappable with "spiritual seeker" with minor edits; no irreplaceable causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Kwan Yin's tear appears at midpoint as artifact revelation, guides the pilgrimage trajectory, and transforms at the climax (splits into mist). Three distinct beats: discovery in obscura image, tracking its trajectory, unfurling at apex. The tear's properties (glowing blue, suspended, refracting longing) are specific and drive the quest's final leg. Scores above functional; however, it resolves the quest without creating prior friction, capping higher range. Early seed absent; closure linkage present but not transformative of prior material.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Pilgrim of sparks is introduced as legend ("traveler made of embers"), encountered as "silhouette woven from dusk," and enables the tear's unfurling by matched breath. The concept shapes the quest's target and the climax's mechanics (syncopated breathing). Two beats (legend explanation, encounter), but the pilgrim acts as facilitator rather than constraint—no choice forced, no tactic altered by its nature. Functional role, yet replaceable with "spirit guide" or similar; specificity present but causal pressure limited.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Spiritually curious frames the artist's motivation (learning breath-healing, seeking hidden hollows) and justifies her pilgrimage. Visible in opening reflection and quest initiation. However, the trait never constrains a choice with cost—curiosity leads smoothly to discovery without friction, doubt, or trade-off. Label-functional, enabling the plot but not tested or costly. Mentioned multiple times but does not alter tactics under pressure; mid-replaceable band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Heal appears as backstory skill ("learning to heal...absences...by revealing through breathing changes") but does not drive a turn on the page. The climax involves receiving revelation (mist permeates, reservoir accessed), not active healing with cost. The artist's breath-matching facilitates the tear's unfurling, arguably a healing act, but it is collaborative and passive. Easily swappable with "perceive" or "access"; no major turn traces exclusively to healing agency.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Revealing through breathing changes is seeded early (grandmother's 7-11 rhythm to soften the veil), shapes the path-finding tactic (shallow/deep breath at forks), and structures the climax (matching the pilgrim's breath unfurls the tear). Three beats with mechanical specificity. The method constrains approach and enables closure participation. Scores above functional; however, cost tied to the method is absent—breath always succeeds without struggle or price, limiting irreplaceability's felt weight.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Twilight viaduct in bloom is named in the opening line, provides spatial structure (ironwork arches, orchid trellis, ascending curve), and supplies tactical resources (bioluminescent vines pulse with her breath, scent thickens to guide path). The setting pressures navigation choices and charges the final image ("viaduct bloomed brighter"). Three beats with closure linkage. Essential across the arc; removing the viaduct's specific properties would collapse path-finding logic and the ending's resonance.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>After the past life memory surfaces is named in the opening as inciting event and frames the quest's urgency ("not nostalgia, nor penance"). However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions—no clock, no escalating consequence of delay. The memory provides motivation but remains static backdrop. One beat (inciting frame) without recurrence or deadline pressure. Functional causality but no tactical constraint; mid-replaceable range.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>To find where unused love is stored is articulated early as the gnawing question, drives the quest across all beats (obscura search, tear tracking, pilgrim encounter), and receives direct answer at closure ("not stored; it was sung"). The motivation shapes every tactical choice and the ending's thematic repricing. However, the desire faces no on-page friction—no competing want, no cost of pursuit. Strong presence and closure participation elevate the score, but lack of dramatized conflict with the motivation caps higher range.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Foggy lucidity pervades the prose—lyric compression, dreamlike imagery ("inverted blossoms swam...like drowned stars"), and meditative pacing establish a coherent tonal envelope. The tone modulates subtly (breath hitches at the tear's appearance, reverent haste when packing) and charges the final image (mist curling, viaduct blooming). Consistent through turns without static monotony. The tone supports rather than tensions the material, and the closure image embodies the established register, reaching solid integration without indispensability.</comment>
