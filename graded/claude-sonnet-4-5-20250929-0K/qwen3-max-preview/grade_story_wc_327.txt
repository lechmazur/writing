<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The storyteller is defined by external traits (copper veins, articulate speech) and stated motivation, but interiority remains abstract. Her decision to use the diamond and speak the language is declared rather than earned through on-page struggle or contradictory impulses. The weeping moment offers embodied emotion, but the arc from waiting to speaking lacks visible internal conflict that would make the choice costly. No secondary characters apply pressure; the flock and canyon function as setting rather than relational crucible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: patterns accumulate (echoes, flock choreography, diamond's filtration) toward a final reconfiguration where the dead language is revived through the canyon's response. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—the canyon echoes her final word forward, reweighting silence into transmission—but the cost is implied rather than sharply legible on the page. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening lines. The single meaningful deepening (diamond awakens, language emerges) fits the length, though the causal chain from flock patterns to speech feels more asserted than demonstrated.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The canyon and bone towers are vivid and purposeful, anchoring the acoustic logic early. The diamond constrains her method (must be fed noise to filter signal) and the flock's flight provides the syntax she needs, both shaping her tactic on the page. Spatial choreography is clear (canyon lip, towers, sky, flock overhead). The ending image—echoes peeling from walls, joining her voice—charges the closure by making the setting an active participant in the language's revival.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: revive the lost language by translating texture into sound. Pressure tightens when the birds arrive and the diamond awakens, creating a single meaningful escalation. Agency is present (she raises the diamond, speaks), but the resolution hinges on the canyon's autonomous response rather than a choice that forecloses a live option with visible cost. The flock's cooperation and the diamond's cooperation feel granted rather than hard-won, reducing the felt price of success.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme—memory, preservation, the hunger of silence versus the persistence of voice—emerges from the canyon's echo mechanics and the diamond's curse without overt statement. The final image (echoes responding, not repeating) offers a resonant answer to the central question of whether a dead language can be revived. However, the piece leans toward abstraction ("texture into sound," "ghost of meaning") rather than grounding the stakes in a specific, irreplaceable loss that the reader can feel. The weeping moment adds emotional honesty, but the lack of on-page friction or ambiguity limits thematic depth.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and controlled: lyric, compressed, with purposeful sentence fragments and elevated diction ("shattered cathedrals," "transient grammars," "glottal stop"). POV remains stable in close third, and the perceptual signature (noticing patterns, acoustic texture, emotional residue) is character-specific. The prose modulates with emotional intensity (short declaratives during the diamond's awakening, longer syntactic braids during the language's emergence). No dialogue to judge. Minor filter-verb use ("watched," "closed her eyes") fits the reflective mode and does not dull immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and many lines do multiple jobs ("It did not burn her. / It did not whisper. / It waited." establishes tone, object, and tension). Information density is high in the opening third, but the middle section loops conceptually: "texture," "resonance," "timbre," "emotional residue" recur without added pressure. The phrase "the grain of grief in a vowel, the roughness of joy in a glottal stop" is vivid, but similar constructions repeat ("rasp of longing, velvet hush of regret, brittle snap of resolve") without advancing causality. No major clarity issues, but the metaphoric density in peak beats (diamond awakening, language emerging) occasionally obscures the mechanics of what is happening on the page.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of dead language revival, acoustic memory, cursed object, and flock-pattern semiotics is specific and non-obvious. The storyteller's method (feed the diamond noise to filter signal) offers a fresh angle on translation and curse mechanics. However, the premise—lone keeper of lost knowledge seeks to revive it through ritual in a mystical landscape—follows a recognizable template, and the piece does not transform it through lived detail or moral calculus that complicates the success. The flock and canyon cooperate without resistance, reducing the sense of inevitable cost that would make the synthesis feel fully earned.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The copper-veined storyteller is present throughout and her actions (waiting, raising the diamond, speaking) drive the key turns. She is on the page in the opening, middle (testing syllables, raising the diamond skyward), and ending (speaking, weeping, grounding sound into earth). Her choice to speak alters the canyon's state and completes the revival, shaping closure. However, her actions feel declarative rather than contested; no visible cost or tradeoff is tied to her specific choices. Swapping her for a generic "keeper of lost knowledge" would require only minor edits, limiting irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The flawed diamond is introduced early ("cradled the flawed diamond rumored to be cursed"), used in the middle beat (she raises it skyward, it awakens and consumes sound), and present at closure ("The diamond cooled in her hand, sated"). Its curse—hunger for resonance—constrains her method: she must feed it noise so signal can slip through, a tactic that shapes the climax. The diamond's mechanics (absorbing noise, filtering texture) enable the language's revival, making it causally essential. Its specific flaw (internal fractures) catches light but does not further constrain choice, leaving some swappability with a generic "cursed filter."</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The tunnel of echoes (canyon) is present from the opening and defines the setting's core rule: it preserves sound across time, layering past and future. This acoustic memory enables the closure—echoes stir, peel from walls, and join her voice, then echo her final word forward. The canyon's mechanics shape her tactic (she needs its amplification to revive the language) and constrain the story's logic (only here can past voices respond). Removing the canyon would break the closure. However, the canyon functions more as setting than active opposition; it cooperates without resistance, reducing the felt stakes of success.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Quietly articulate" is stated in the opening ("not loud, not performative, but precise") and echoed near the end ("She did not sing. / She articulated. / Quietly. / Precisely."). The trait is label-only; it does not constrain or enable a specific on-page action with visible cost. Her speech at the climax could be loud or soft without altering the outcome—the canyon and diamond respond to the language's texture, not her volume or precision. The attribute adds tonal color but is swappable with any similar descriptor.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Harness" is signaled early ("to harness meaning through the patterns in a flock of birds") and executed at the climax: she raises the diamond to let the flock's rhythm strike its surface, then speaks using the patterns they weave. This action is causally central—it triggers the diamond's awakening and enables the language's emergence. The ending depends on this harnessing (the flock wheels overhead, their patterns shifting to match her cadence). However, "harness" is somewhat abstract; the mechanics of how patterns become syntax are asserted more than demonstrated, leaving minor swappability with "channel" or "capture."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The method (patterns in a flock of birds in flight) is signaled early ("to harness meaning through the patterns in a flock of birds") and executed in the middle and climax: the flock arrives, their flight weaves spirals and extinct glyphs, she tests syllables against their rhythm, and their patterns guide her speech at the ending. The method constrains her tactic—she must wait for the flock, observe their choreography, and match their cadence—and shapes the closure (the flock wheels overhead, matching her voice). Removing this method would require a complete reimagining of the climax. Minor swappability with "formations" or "movements" reduces irreplaceability slightly.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The towers of bone in a canyon of endless echoes are introduced in the opening line and define the setting throughout. The canyon's acoustic mechanics (preserving and layering echoes across time) enable the closure: echoes stir, join her voice, and respond to her final word. The towers provide visual anchoring and thematic resonance (cathedrals, memory, permanence). The setting constrains her choice—only here can the dead language find resonance—and charges the final image (the canyon exhales, echoes bloom). Removing this exact setting would break the story's logic and closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The timeframe ("across the death of a language") is signaled early and provides backstory pressure: the final fluent speaker died in her arms, and she has carried the loss forward. The phrase "across" suggests duration, but no live clock tightens her decisions on the page; she waits for the flock without urgency. The timeframe primes the closure (she revives the language after its death) but does not constrain her tactics or escalate pressure. A purposeful early–final reprise (death of language → language revived) reweights the stake, lifting the score into the mid-6s despite no middle-beat involvement.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The motivation ("to translate texture into sound, to give voice again to what had been silenced") is stated early and dramatized at the climax: she opens her mouth and speaks the language, shaped by the flock's patterns and the diamond's filtration. The desire drives her waiting, her preparation of the diamond, and her final act of speaking. The motivation is tied to visible cost—she weeps while speaking, grounding the sound into earth so it will not vanish again—and shapes the closure (the canyon responds to her voice). Minor friction: the motivation is somewhat abstract ("texture into sound") and could be reworded without altering the arc.</comment>
