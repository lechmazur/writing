<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The heiress is distinctly drawn—her observational method, her grandfather's pen, her modified telescope—but her choices remain largely cerebral and preparatory rather than tested under direct pressure. The backstory (grandfather's pen, father's letter) anchors her motivation but consumes significant space without dramatized friction. Her final act (emailing evidence) reads as decisive but feels more like execution of a pre-formed plan than a choice forged in the crucible of the scene. Internal contradiction is present (solemn playfulness, grief versus surgical precision) but not enough ambiguity acts simultaneously in a single beat to reach higher bands.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Orientation is anchored early (observatory, after the call, newsprint heiress). The piece follows a causal lens: journalist's call → her investigation → proof by contradiction → email dispatch. Closure is a Decisive Change with conceptual cost (she triggers exposure, foreclosing silence). However, the decisive act (emailing the folio) arrives without on-page resistance or micro-turn that narrows options; the tension is pre-loaded rather than built through scene pressure. The cost is felt but the final image (watching smoke, waiting for callback) diffuses rather than charges the moment, reducing closure punch.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The observatory, telescope, and city-below are vivid and specific. The modified scope with spy-satellite optics is a purposeful tool that constrains her investigative method and charges the final proof. The brass railing, iron ribs, cloud layer, and rooftop archive create a legible spatial frame. Sensory detail is filtered through her POV (cold metal, smoke patterns, mist-covered embers). The setting directly enables her surveillance tactic and the proof photo, satisfying the Q3 9+ gate's demand that environment constrain choice or charge the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—exposing a cover-up—is signaled early and sustained. Her method (proof by contradiction) provides a procedural tightening, but the escalation is intellectual rather than situational; no new complication arises on the page to test her resolve. The journalist's call and the archive's smoke pattern are prior discoveries, so the scene itself unfolds as execution rather than pressure-under-fire. The email dispatch forecloses silence with conceptual cost, but the lack of on-page resistance or trade-off keeps this in mid-range rather than high-band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme (truth versus erasure, orbits of regret versus breaking cycles) emerges organically from action and image. The proof-by-contradiction structure and the telescope-inversion metaphor charge the thematic question without stating it. The final line ("orbits are not prisons, they are paths") risks overt philosophizing but is redeemed by the prior concrete work (smoke, pen, evidence folio). The grandfather's pen and the father's letter anchor regret and inheritance without becoming mere symbols. No diagnostic label-speak or moral summary in the closure beat. A resonant, non-literal answer lands, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Voice is elevated and lyric, with purposeful compression ("silence corrodes faster than ink," "smoldering like embers"). The prose maintains a consistent register and perceptual signature (brass, rosewood, smoke patterns). However, register occasionally drifts into workshop poeticism ("solemn playfulness... blooms when you're about to turn a bureaucrat's arrogance into his epitaph") that edges toward self-aware cleverness rather than character-bound thought. No head-hopping; POV remains stable. Elision is taught (we learn her methods mid-scene) and legible. Psychic distance is controlled, though the final paragraph's oracular tone ("truth, like gravity, always finds its orbit") strains against the prior tactical focus.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Several strong images (telescope as urban microscope, smoke thread stitching sky to earth) and purposeful parallelism ("not for scandal, not for profit, but because..."). However, density suffers from synonym loops ("trembling with half-truths, his silence louder than his words"; "not merely sharp-eyed, but reverently attentive") and template-cadence runs in the opening third. The proof-by-contradiction sequence is efficient, but the final two paragraphs drift into abstract philosophizing ("truth, like gravity," "orbits are not prisons") that summarizes rather than charges. Filter-verb stacks ("watched," "adjusted," "photographed") in the telescope sequence dull immediacy. Apply −0.8 for loops and template cadence, −0.3 for filter-verb stacks in a high-pressure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The modified telescope (spy satellite grafted onto antique frame) and the proof-by-contradiction frame offer fresh angles on investigative-thriller material. The heiress-as-mathematician and the rooftop-archive purge are specific and non-obvious. However, the "lone crusader versus corrupt archive" premise is familiar, and the emotional arc (grief → surgical precision → reckoning) follows a well-worn path. The ending's oracular confidence ("she'd be ready... she would walk every one") undercuts ambiguity. Risk-taking in structure (heavy reflection, lyric compression) is present but execution is uneven. No bonus for risk when line-level artifacts reduce coherence.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Present throughout; her choices (adjusting the telescope, cross-referencing logs, emailing the folio) drive all three acts. Setup early, development mid-scene (document prep), payoff at closure (email dispatch with "Q.E.D."). However, choices are pre-formed rather than tested by on-page friction; no moment where she weighs competing goods or faces a meaningful trade-off. Causal pressure is intellectual, not relational. Two beats (telescope use, email send) plus closure linkage, but swappability is moderate (any investigator could execute this plan). Apply +0.9 (two beats) +0.5 (closure) −0.4 (swappability) = mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Setup early (grandfather's pen, warm from grip, curve worn smooth). Development: she uses it to write "Q.E.D." on the folio cover before photographing. Payoff: pocketed again as "weight a promise." Three touches across setup/middle/end, but functional role is minimal—any pen would serve the inscription. The inheritance theme charges it lyrically, but removing the rosewood detail would not break logic or closure. Apply +0.3 (early) +0.4 (one distinct beat) +0.7 (closure seed/reprise) −0.6 (swappable) = mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Setup early ("orbits of regret—elliptical, inevitable, returning always to the same wounds"). Development: cycles she's "spent her life trying to break" shape her motivation. Payoff: final lines reweight orbits as "paths" rather than "prisons," reconfiguring the premise. The concept constrains her goal (break the cycle) and charges the final image. However, it functions more as thematic frame than tactical pressure; no on-page choice where regret-orbit logic narrows options. Apply +0.8 (early framing) +0.5 (causal tilt via motivation) +1.0 (closure reweight) −0.6 (thematic echo without mid-scene tactical friction) = mid-to-high 6s.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Setup early (defined in paragraph 4). Development: her observation enables all investigation (telescope surveillance, timestamp correlation, pattern mapping). Payoff: the proof she photographs depends on months of "devotedly observant" documentation. The trait enables the core tactic and shapes the closure proof. Three beats (definition, investigation montage, photo evidence) with clear causal pressure. Apply +0.8 (early) +1.4 (three beats) +1.2 (causal enabler) +0.9 (closure linkage) −0.3 (could be rephrased as "meticulous" with minor edits) = low 7s.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Setup: timeframe "after the journalist called" implies she will act. Development: her intervention is the email dispatch to judges, publishers, journalist. Payoff: the send-action is the closure beat. However, "intervene" is broad; emailing evidence is one form, but the text doesn't explore alternate interventions or show this choice tested against other tactics. One major beat (email) that turns the premise, but swappable phrasing (she "exposes," "reveals," "acts") would work with minor edits. Apply +0.9 (one beat, causal) +1.2 (closure linkage) −0.6 (moderate swappability) = mid-to-high 6s.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Setup mid-scene (paragraph starting "And leverage..."). Development: "Assume the lie is true. Then follow it to its breaking point." She applies this method by creating evidence that contradicts the official story. Payoff: "Q.E.D." and the email with "If the official record is true, then this cannot exist. But it does." The method is named, taught, and executed; it shapes her tactic and charges the proof. Apply +0.5 (mid-scene setup, −0.2 for not first-third) +0.9 (two beats: explanation, execution) +1.6 (causal pressure) +1.4 (closure linkage) +0.6 (specificity: unique logical frame) = high 7s.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Setup immediate (title location, brass railing, echoing dome). Development: the observatory houses the modified telescope, which supplies the surveillance resource. Payoff: "The dome sighed around her, its metal bones groaning as if applauding." The setting enables her core tactic (rooftop surveillance) and echoes at closure. Three beats (anchor, telescope use, closure image). Apply +0.8 (early) +1.4 (three beats) +1.2 (causal resource) +0.7 (closure echo) −0.5 (echo is atmospheric, not charged with new cost) = low-to-mid 7s.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Setup immediate ("after the journalist called"). The call anchors the inciting stimulus, but no live clock pressures the scene. She's been documenting "for months"; tonight's action is self-scheduled. The callback "tomorrow" is mentioned at the end but doesn't tighten present decisions. One beat (inciting call) with no tactical urgency. Apply +0.8 (early setup) +0.4 (one beat) −0.5 (no escalation pressure) −0.8 (timeframe doesn't constrain present choices) = mid-4s.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Setup early (paragraph 5: "to discover hidden truths... because silence corrodes faster than ink"). Development: this desire drives telescope surveillance, cross-referencing, and folio assembly. Payoff: her email dispatch enacts the motivation at closure. The motive is dramatized through action (not told-only) and sustains all beats. Three beats (definition, investigation, email) with causal force. Apply +0.8 (early) +1.4 (three beats) +1.2 (causal drive) +1.0 (closure linkage) −0.4 (friction between motive and cost is implied, not tested on-page) = mid-7s.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Setup early ("solemn playfulness, the kind that blooms when you're about to turn a bureaucrat's arrogance into his epitaph"). The tone is coherent—grief mixed with tactical satisfaction—and modulates between lyric reflection and procedural focus. However, "playfulness" is asserted more than embodied; the prose leans solemn-lyric throughout with only brief wry touches ("Q.E.D.," "epitaph"). The final image ("orbits are not prisons") is oracular rather than playful. Tone charges the middle beats but doesn't fully land at closure. Apply +0.8 (early signal) +0.9 (two-beat modulation) +0.5 (partial closure link) −0.6 (playfulness undertone, not embodied pressure) = mid-6s.</comment>
