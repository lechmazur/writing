<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's interior life is richly developed through embodied metaphors (salt wind, collapsed expectations, regret magnetizing air), but the character arc suffers from passivity—she walks, names poles, remembers her father, then paddles away without dramatized internal conflict forcing a visible choice. The shift from paralysis to motion feels asserted rather than earned through competing impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The reflection-heavy design (~40% backstory/memory) anchors adequately in present stimuli (poles, compass, crow's washer) and includes micro-choices (pocketing the washer, climbing into the kayak), meeting BRR exception tests, but the final "becoming" reads as a label rather than a specific forfeiture or stance with felt cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation is clear (coastal launch, dusk, solo figure with compass). The lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density of metaphor and a cadence shift (from stasis to paddling) reweight the dominant stake (internal coherence vs. regret). However, closure relies on Resonant Reconfiguration (the compass needle stilling, pointing toward her stern) without a legible on-page cost—what path is foreclosed, what is risked or spent? The "no longer broken, now becoming" declaration substitutes assertion for a dramatized price, weakening the closure effect required at this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful: utility poles replace stars as navigational anchors, constraining the protagonist's tactics and charging the final image. The coastal launch, gravel, crossarms, and kayak hull are filtered through her navigator's perspective. Sensory detail is selective (salt wind, crows, fogged compass glass, tide licking boots) and the poles function as micro-setting, shaping her choice to move inland then return. This meets the 9+ gate test (environment constrains choice, charges closure), but the body itself (boots, wrists, breath) could be more tactilely integrated into peak beats.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—aligning heart and action—is signaled early and coheres under the Accumulative lens. Pressure accumulates through metaphor density and the protagonist's walk inland, but there is no on-page reversal or tightening that narrows options: she is stuck, walks, then paddles. The crow's washer and the compass repositioning offer symbolic turns but no dramatized trade-off or cost that forecloses a path. The lens holds, but the lack of a felt price or visible agency-driven escalation keeps this in mid-band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme (finding direction through brokenness, choosing motion over precision) emerges organically from the utility-pole navigation, the compass's reorientation, and the father's voice. The ending avoids moralizing and offers a resonant image (compass pointing toward her stern, stars emerging). Subtext operates through the named poles and the crow's washer as talisman. However, the final lines ("She wasn't broken anymore. / She was becoming.") edge toward thematic echo and label-speak, slightly undercutting the otherwise quiet, image-driven resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and lyrically compressed: "merrily melancholic," "salt-cracked," "bruised twilight," "gloaming." The perceptual signature (stars, vectors, latitude as love) is character-specific, and the free indirect style is clean. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("resonance between chest and current," "frequency," "pilgrim") that feels outside a navigator's plain idiom under stress. POV remains stable, no head-hopping, and the prose maintains texture, but the poeticized syntax at peak beats risks slight distance from embodied immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high (every line advances character or atmosphere). However, paraphrase loops and template cadence appear: "She didn't need perfect stars. / She needed imperfect motion." and "She wasn't broken anymore. / She was becoming." compress emotional turns into parallel declarations without fresh imagery. Filter-verb stacks ("She didn't look back," "She didn't need it to point north") and synonym churn ("collapsed expectations," "shattered," "broken beyond recalibration") dull immediacy in multiple beats. Figurative language is dense but sometimes strained ("regret had magnetized the air," "backlash of regrets... pinned her"), and the final third carries several loops that reduce propulsion. Applying patterned-artifact penalty pack: paraphrase loops and template cadence across adjacent lines in closure beats warrant −0.8 in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The utility-pole navigation is a fresh, grounded twist on the "broken expert" trope, and the compass reorientation (pointing toward her stern) offers a non-obvious inflection. However, the premise (expert lost after failure seeks symbolic redemption via journey) is widely used, and the transformation relies more on metaphoric accumulation than on specific lived detail or a surprising moral calculus. The merrily melancholic tone and the "navigation by feeling" synthesis feel coherent but not bold enough to escape mid-band. No close echoes of famous lines, but the emotional arc (paralysis → symbolic walk → gentle launch) follows a recognizable template.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Present throughout; frames the inciting stasis and the final launch. The "broken navigator" trait constrains her opening paralysis and her shift to terrestrial waypoints, shaping two beats (naming poles, pocketing the washer). However, her choices are more observational than decisive—she walks, names, remembers, then launches without a dramatized internal conflict or trade-off. Closure linkage exists (she paddles as a navigator reborn), but the exact "broken" quality does not drive a visible cost or reversal. Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.9, minus swappability (could be "broken pilot" with minor edits) −0.6 = ~5.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Appears in opening (spinning needle, fogged glass), mid-story (weighing heavy in coat, "not as guide but witness"), and ending (across her lap, needle stilling toward stern). Three distinct beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.2, specificity (astronomical, calibrated for stars, becomes witness) +0.5. However, the compass is handled passively—described and reflected upon, but not used to make a tactical choice that narrows options. Its final reorientation is symbolic rather than causal, and the piece would largely hold if replaced by another heirloom instrument. No felt cost tied directly to the compass. Total: 3.0 base +3.1 positives −0.5 swappability = ~6.4 (round down 6.4).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The "backlash of regrets" is named explicitly and shapes the opening paralysis ("pinned her to the launch ramp for weeks"). It pressures her motivation and constrains her early stance, qualifying as setup and development. The closing lines acknowledge regrets losing grip, connecting to the closure image. However, the concept is more thematic backdrop than on-page friction—no scene shows regrets altering a specific tactic or choice under stress. Early signal +0.5, development involvement +0.4, closure mention +0.6, minus summary-only presentation −0.6 = ~5.9, rounded to 6.1 for thematic coherence across the arc.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Merrily melancholic" is named once ("the kind of coping that dances on the edge of breakdown, laughing through tears") and echoed in "soft and salt-cracked" laughter near the end. It colors tone but does not constrain or enable a specific on-page action with visible cost—no moment where being "merry" or "melancholic" forecloses an option. Label-only trait with thematic echo; no causal pressure or beat involvement beyond mood. Late setup −0.3, ornamental use −0.8, label-only −0.3 = ~4.2.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Gravitate" appears as explicit motivation ("to gravitate—not toward a destination, but toward coherence") and is enacted when she lets poles "pull her inland" and later when the tide catches her. It frames the opening and recurs at closure ("gravitating toward something softer"). However, the action is largely passive—forces act on her rather than her choosing to move against resistance. Setup +0.6, development +0.4, closure linkage +0.8, minus passivity and swappability (could be "drift" or "surrender") −0.7 = ~5.3.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Introduced early ("the crooked line of utility poles marching inland"), developed through naming beats (Betrayer, Ghost, Whisperer), and paid off when "the poles receded" as stars emerge and she no longer needs them. The method directly alters her tactics (walking inland, navigating by silhouette) and provides the structural spine for the middle section. Early signal +0.7, two beats (observing, naming) +0.9, closure participation (receding as stars return) +1.0, causal pressure +0.8, specificity +0.5, minus the fact that the poles are described more than used as a navigational tool in a choice-forcing beat −0.5 = ~6.9 (round down 6.9).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The coastal kayak launch anchors the opening and closing, providing the spatial frame and the kayak as key object. The setting supplies the tide, gravel, and the contrast between sea (memory) and land (poles). However, the launch itself does not constrain a choice—she could walk away or launch from any dock. The kayak's presence matters, but the "launch" as setting element is more postcard than pressure. Setup +0.7, closure return +0.9, spatial coherence +0.4, minus limited causal role −0.6 = ~5.9.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"When expectations collapse" is named in the opening line but remains abstract—no on-page dramatization of the collapse, and no ticking clock that tightens decisions. The story spans one dusk (twilight to stars) but elapsed time does not alter tactics or raise cost. Timeframe is present as mood but not as constraint. Setup mention +0.3, vague tracking −0.5, no tactical pressure −0.8 = ~4.6.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The motivation "to align heart and action" is stated early and drives the entire arc: she moves from paralysis (thinking in vectors) toward embodied motion (feeling in tides, paddling). It frames the opening, shapes her inland walk, and is paid off in the final line ("heart and action finally aligned"). However, the alignment is declared more than dramatized through conflicting wants forcing a trade-off. Early signal +0.8, development across beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.2, causal coherence +0.6, minus summary-resolution and lack of visible friction between competing desires −0.8 = ~6.7.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Flickering faith" is named late ("hesitant as her own flickering faith") and recurs in the closing image ("faith flickering but not extinguished"). The tone is coherent and modulates from despair to tentative hope, charging the final strokes. However, the phrase itself arrives in the second half and the tonal shift is more gradual accumulation than sharp modulation under pressure. Late signal −0.4, closure linkage +0.9, tonal coherence +0.6, one beat (lanterns metaphor) +0.4, minus late introduction and lack of beat-by-beat pressure tied to "flickering" as a specific constraint −0.5 = ~5.4.</comment>
