<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The protagonist remains abstract throughout—"the gravity defier" never gains interiority beyond label-only traits. Her choices to speak confessions feel unmotivated; no prior causality establishes why *now* she stops running or what internal contradiction drives the shift. Emotions are declared ("I was afraid") rather than embodied through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final merge with echo-selves reads as convenient resolution without visible cost that forecloses a credible path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The piece opens with deliberate spatial disorientation (hovering atop viaduct, procedural corridors) that never anchors who/where/when by ~120 words; causality remains opaque throughout. The closure unit attempts Resonant Reconfiguration via confession-driven merging, but the shift from running to speaking lacks on-page motivation—no because/therefore link explains why confessions now dissolve echo-selves. Cost is asserted ("cracks spiderwebbing") but the protagonist pays no legible price; the tablet blooms and echoes rush to merge without forfeiture or stance crystallization. Drive lens wobbles between lyric accumulation and causal problem-solving without committing.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The glowing viaduct is vivid but serves as backdrop rather than constraint—hovering bare feet and phosphorescent veins establish mood without altering tactics. The procedural corridors (childhood room, staircases labeled with dates) function as thematic echo chambers rather than spatial obstacles; no door is locked, no path narrowed by environment. The frozen raindrops in the climax charge the final image visually, lifting the score modestly, but the body and tablet remain props rather than tools that shape choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"conquer the labyrinth of self"—is declared but never tested with live options or trade-offs. Each landing offers a scene to witness, not a dilemma to resolve; the protagonist simply touches walls and speaks confessions without visible friction or cost. No reversal or tightening narrows her choices; the tablet's bloom and echo-merge happen *to* her rather than through her agency. The viaduct's shudder substitutes for earned escalation, and coincidence (tablet cracks, echoes dissolve on cue) resolves the premise without demonstrated price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through recurring images (gravity defiance, fracture, recursion) and the conceptual scaffold of integrating rejected selves. The confessions ("I was afraid," "I let others define my gravity") veer toward thematic summary rather than dramatized insight, and "I am the branching" in the final beat states the moral overtly. The tablet-as-admission and frozen raindrops offer some non-literal resonance, but the ending blooms into light and merger without ambiguity or cost, resolving complexity into a tidy integration that answers the premise too neatly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV holds stable, and the prose carries a distinct lyric register ("not with sound, but with fracture"). However, diction frequently overreaches the moment's needs—"periodically eternal," "phosphorescent residue of temporal leakage"—creating register drift into abstract academic voice. Psychic distance wavers: the narrator knows the runes are "admissions" before the protagonist does, and the viaduct's recognition of her defiance reads as convenient anthropomorphism. No dialogue appears. Peak compression ("The tablet cracked…blooming—runes peeling open like petals") sustains voice under pressure and prevents further slide.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Figurative density clogs momentum in high-pressure beats: "not carved, but grown—organic script that shifted like roots seeking water" and "echoes of other selves—some radiant, some ragged, all periodically eternal" stack metaphors without clarifying cause or raising stakes. Paraphrase loops appear ("not to absolve, but to anchor" / "not to consume, but to merge"). Template cadence runs through the confession sequence: "I was afraid." [echo dissolves] / "I ran because…" [echo vanishes]—three identical stems without variation. Synonym churn: "fracture," "splintering," "branching," "recursion" rotate without added pressure. These artifacts touch the closure beat, triggering the −1.7 tier and disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>The core premise—gravity defier uses ancient tablet to navigate procedurally generated memory corridors and integrate fractured selves—is derivative of widely used introspective-labyrinth templates without transformation through lived specificity or world logic. The gravity defiance remains ornamental (hovering an inch, "gravity yielded") rather than a constraint with visible cost. The resolution (speak confessions → echoes dissolve → tablet blooms) follows predictable therapeutic arc without a non-obvious synthesis. "Periodically eternal" and "temporal leakage" gesture at SFF texture but remain cosmetic labels.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The gravity defier is present throughout but her choices do not create key turns. She observes corridors, touches walls, and speaks confessions; the tablet and echoes drive events while she remains reactive. Her final declaration ("I am the branching") articulates theme but does not alter tactics or foreclose a path. Late setup (no interiority or motive until midpoint) and swappability (any introspective character could fill this role) cap the score.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The tablet appears early (clutched against chest, pulsing), is handled across multiple beats (warmed, flared runes, cracked/bloomed at closure), and its state changes visibly (solid → cracked → blooming petals). It generates corridors and whispers corrections, shaping the protagonist's path. However, its mechanics remain vague—"procedural generation" is named but not dramatized—and the protagonist never makes a choice *because* of the tablet's constraint; it serves as facilitator rather than obstacle. Causal pressure is moderate; closure linkage is present but the bloom happens without cost to the protagonist.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Fractured timelines are theme-claimed ("versions of herself walking paths she hadn't taken") and visually echoed (echo-selves, dates on landings, frozen raindrops) but do not constrain tactics or create live trade-offs. The protagonist does not choose between timelines or pay a cost to collapse them; the fractures illustrate her internal state rather than altering her options. Present in setup and ending, but purely ornamental—swappable with "inner demons" or "repressed memories" without structural change.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>"Periodically eternal" appears once as a label for echo-selves ("doomed to recur unless she reconciled them") without constraining action or enabling a choice with visible cost. The trait is told rather than demonstrated—no beat shows recursion shaping her tactics or imposing a price. Purely decorative vocabulary; removing it would not alter plot, stakes, or closure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Retrace" is signaled early ("She had to retrace—not backward…through procedural generation") and frames the protagonist's journey through memory corridors. The action shapes two beats: climbing staircases labeled with past dates and touching walls to generate scenes. However, the protagonist never *retraces* a specific choice or undoes a prior action; she witnesses alternative paths without altering present tactics. The term functions as thematic gloss rather than mechanical driver. Closure linkage is present (the integration completes the retracing) but the action itself is replaceable with "confront" or "explore."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Procedural generation" is named twice ("letting the tablet's logic unfold recursive corridors" and "let the tablet generate the scene") but its mechanics never matter on the page. The corridors and scenes appear without cost, constraint, or algorithmic logic that the protagonist must navigate. The method is label-only; removing the phrase and saying "the tablet showed her memories" would not alter any beat. Functional mention without causal work.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The glowing viaduct appears in setup (hovering atop, phosphorescent veins pulsing) and returns at closure (trembles, cracks spiderweb), creating an early–final reprise that charges the ending image. However, the setting does not constrain choice—the protagonist hovers freely, and the viaduct's instability is cosmetic reaction rather than obstacle. The rain and glowing stone establish mood but do not alter tactics. Lyric resonance lifts the score into the 5.5–6.3 allowance, but lack of causal pressure prevents higher.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Between the drop and the ripple" is signaled early as the liminal moment where "choices still hung like dew before falling" and returns at closure (raindrops freeze midair). The timeframe establishes conceptual stakes but does not tighten decisions—the protagonist has unlimited time to climb staircases and speak confessions without a live clock. The frozen raindrops visually echo the premise at the end, providing modest lyric payoff, but the time pressure remains metaphorical rather than tactical.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"To conquer the labyrinth of self" is named early ("not to escape, but to integrate") and frames the protagonist's goal across beats: climbing staircases, speaking confessions, merging with echoes. The motivation shapes two distinct beats (choosing the fractured third path, speaking admissions aloud) and the closure completes the conquest via integration. However, the desire is never conflicted—no friction between wanting integration and fearing its cost appears on the page. The protagonist pursues the goal linearly without trade-offs or renunciation, reducing dramatic weight.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Darkening brightness" is visually present (glowing viaduct, runes flaring, liquid starlight core) but tonally static—the prose maintains elevated lyric register throughout without modulation. The viaduct's cracks and trembling suggest darkening, yet the ending blooms into light and merger, brightness winning without cost. Tone does not shift with pressure or charge the final image with contradiction; the piece reads as uniformly numinous rather than oscillating between shadow and illumination.</comment>
