<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The reaper's interior life is dense with embodied grief ("frost," "hollow between heartbeats"), and the naming ritual dramatizes his stance shift from passive mourner to active memory-keeper. Motivation is clear and intensifies across beats. However, the transformation from "heartbroken" to "heart-carrier" feels asserted rather than earned through a visible on-page choice that forecloses a path; the final smile lacks prior resistance or trade-off to charge it fully.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise shifting toward Earned Stasis): the reaper names terrors to distribute weight, crystallizing his new role. Orientation anchors quickly (reaper, observatory, dusk, post-discovery). The crystallization ritual deepens pressure through the naming sequence, and the final "heart-carrier" image reweights prior material. Cost is conceptual—accepting eternal witness-bearing—but the passage lacks a dramatized moment where he visibly forfeits an alternate path, keeping the cost somewhat abstract.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The observatory's fractured prism and cracked dome are not mere backdrop; scattered light through the prism enables the crystallization method, and the "broken teeth biting into twilight" charges atmosphere. The atlas page functions as micro-setting, handled across multiple beats and reweighted at closure. Spatial choreography (balcony, spiral stairs, central chamber, stone table) remains coherent and purposeful throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is legible early: transforming grief into bearable form by naming terrors so others carry less weight. Pressure accumulates through the ritual's progression (placing the page, calling scattered light, naming each monster), and the final pulse of the crystallized page confirms the stakes' resolution. However, the reaper faces no on-page opposition or complication; the ritual succeeds without friction, cost, or trade-off beyond the abstract burden of eternal remembrance, which limits escalation's bite.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—naming terror to distribute its weight—emerges organically from the naming ritual and closing "heart-carrier" turn, not from stated thesis. The shift from sea monsters as fears to witnesses ("Elan, who remembers every sailor's lullaby") offers a resonant, non-literal answer. The echo-of-sacrifice motif deepens without becoming heavy-handed. Minor slip: "echoes forgotten phrases" appears as both attribute and thematic tag without sufficient on-page friction or cost to elevate it beyond a lyric refrain.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited throughout; diction is elevated and consistent ("cloak whispering like regret," "marrow"). Perceptual signature is distinct: the reaper notices through the lens of duty and grief. However, register occasionally drifts into ornamental lyricism during peak beats ("frequency of forgotten fears," "memory made manifest"), and several phrases edge toward stock poetic phrasing ("echo of sacrifice," "cathedral of solitude") that slightly flatten voice specificity under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully and figurative language is mostly coherent. Sentence openings vary. However, the piece carries measurable text-pattern debt: synonym churn around "echo" (echoes, echo of sacrifice, echoes forgotten phrases), template-cadence runs ("He remembered her: not in face or voice, but in the hollow…"; "not alive, but resonant"; "not as beasts, but as witnesses"), and stock metaphor strings ("frost," "cathedral of solitude," "broken teeth biting into twilight"). These artifacts cluster in high-pressure beats and dull immediacy, triggering the patterned-artifact penalty pack baseline (−0.6 in Q7) and disallowing 9+ globally per the automatic cap rule.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The premise—reaper as grief-transformer through naming—offers a fresh angle on psychopomp tropes, and the crystallization-via-light method is specific. The naming sequence (Elan, Virel, Mira) personalizes the ritual. However, the core emotional arc (mourner accepts burden, finds purpose) follows a familiar template, and the "heart-carrier" coinage at closure reads as a tidy label rather than an inevitable synthesis. The piece does not take bold structural or perspectival risks that would elevate originality into the high band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The heartbroken reaper is present throughout and his choices (climbing stairs, placing the page, singing, naming) structure the ritual. Setup is immediate; development occupies the central naming sequence; payoff arrives in the final "heart-carrier" turn. However, his decisions do not narrow options or face resistance; the transformation proceeds without friction, and the final smile is asserted rather than earned through a visible trade-off. Causal pressure is moderate; the reaper enacts rather than wrestles.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The atlas page appears in setup (balcony unfold), development (placed on stone table, light strikes ink, monsters stir), and payoff (crystallized, pulsing in pocket). It is handled physically across three distinct beats and returns with reweighted meaning (from map-of-terrors to beacon-of-names). The object constrains the ritual's focus and charges the closure image. Strong integration; only modest irreplaceability limits the score (another artifact could substitute with minor edits).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The echo of sacrifice is seeded early (her song, his duty-bound inaction) and shapes the dominant stake (transforming inherited grief into distributable memory). It reappears at closure when he becomes "heart-carrier," reweighting his purpose from mourner to witness-bearer. Setup, development (naming ritual as response to sacrifice), and payoff are present. However, the concept functions more as thematic backdrop than as an on-page constraint that alters tactics or choices; the reaper's ritual proceeds without the echo forcing a visible trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Echoes forgotten phrases" appears in setup (from copper recordings), development (he sings "from the echoes forgotten phrases"), and payoff (wind hums them). The trait enables his song but does not impose a visible cost or constrain a choice; he uses the phrases without struggle or trade-off. The element is functional but replaceable—"remembered songs" or "collected chants" would serve equivalently. Lyric reprise (first → last) reweights the stake modestly, lifting it into the low 5s.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Crystallize" is signaled early (implicit in the method search), dominates the central ritual (naming → ink shimmers → crystal blooms), and delivers the payoff (atlas page half-crystallized, pulsing). The action drives at least two beats and shapes the closure image. Removing it would break story logic. High integration; only the lack of on-page friction during the crystallization process (it succeeds without complication) keeps the score below 8.5.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Through scattered light" is signaled at setup ("he would crystallize the grief… through scattered light"), mechanics matter at the climax (dying sun strikes fractured prism, casts rainbows onto page, ink vibrates), and the method charges the closure (crystallization completes). Setup, development, and payoff are present across three beats. The specificity of scattered light (via prism) makes it moderately irreplaceable, though "moonlight" or "starlight" could substitute with minor rewrites, capping the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The ancient observatory at dusk is established immediately and pressures choices throughout: the fractured dome frames stars, the shattered prism enables scattered light, the stone table holds the ritual, and the balcony bookends the piece. Setting supplies the resource (prism) that makes the method possible and charges the closure image ("first star pierced the violet sky"). Setup, development, and payoff across four distinct beats; high causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The timeframe "after finding the old recordings" is present in setup and primes the reaper's grief, but it does not tighten decisions or shape tactics on the page. The recordings are referenced ("copper cylinders," "echoes clung to his ribs") but remain inert; no clock pressure, no trade-off between using them versus another path. The element is ornamental context rather than a live constraint. Missing middle development and closure participation; introduced early but functionless.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The motivation "to give names to nameless fears" is articulated mid-story ("'Your name is not silence'") and fulfilled at closure ("so others might carry less weight than he had"). It shapes the naming sequence and the final "heart-carrier" turn. Setup (implied in early grief), development (naming ritual), and payoff (distributing weight to future mourners) are present. However, the desire is told more than dramatized through conflicted choice; the reaper never wrestles with an alternate want (e.g., erasing grief vs. sharing it), keeping friction low.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Distant intimacy" is coherent throughout: elevated diction and third-limited POV maintain distance, while specific grief details ("hollow between heartbeats," weeping quietly) create intimacy. Tone modulates with pressure (calm unfold → charged naming → quiet smile) and charges the final image ("no longer heartbroken, but heart-carrier"). Setup, development, and payoff across the arc; the tone is purposeful and stable, avoiding both flat affect and melodrama, though it edges toward ornamental lyricism in peak beats.</comment>
