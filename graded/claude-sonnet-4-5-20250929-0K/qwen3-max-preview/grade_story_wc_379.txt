<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's interiority reads as conceptually clear—her method of "hearing" objects and curating catharsis—but her choices arrive through perception rather than visible cost or trade-off. Leo's grief is embodied ("gaunt, eyes hollow, clutching a mug of cold tea"), yet the humming ritual unfolds without internal friction or contradiction in either character. The final weeping is triggered by object and environment, not by a decision that forecloses a path. Competence (Elara always succeeds) and gentle omniscience ("She'd learned long ago…") flatten genuine struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece anchors who/where/when clearly at dawn in the courtyard. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the locket's humming softens and Leo begins to talk, a shift toward communal healing. However, the mailbox "clicks" organically without prior rules, and Leo's transformation (from gaunt silence to "laughing—softly, tear-streaked, alive") compresses four mornings into summary rather than dramatized turns. Cost is implied (grief acknowledged) but not legible in a single on-page moment; the final image disperses across noon conversation and a child's seashell coda. Lens reads Accumulative/Textural, but the courtyard's unexplained mechanism and summarized middle weaken causal grounding.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The courtyard is anchored with jasmine, dew, iron gate, and stoop; micro-setting (the mailbox, the locket warm in Elara's palm) charges the closure as the door swings open and Leo weeps beneath the jasmine. Sensory detail is purposeful and selective. However, Cedar Hollow Apartments and the interior of 3B remain unshown, and the mailbox's brass plaque and organic click are described but their mechanics never constrain a choice. Spatial choreography is clear throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Leo's unresolved grief—is signaled early via the locket and envelope. Pressure tightens through Elara's four-morning vigil, but the escalation is recounted in summary ("She returned the next dawn… And the next"). Leo's door-opening and the mailbox's click arrive without on-page resistance or trade-off; Elara's method succeeds on schedule. The courtyard conversation at noon (Mr. Ruiz, Mrs. Chen) is told rather than shown, and Leo's shift to laughter occurs off-page. No visible price paid; coincidence (the mailbox clicks "organically") resolves rather than complicates.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme—communal listening as healing—emerges through the courtyard exchanges and the mailbox ritual, avoiding overt moralizing until the penultimate paragraph ("trauma doesn't shout—it echoes"). The locket's humming, the envelope, and the child's seashell create a pattern of passed grief finding safe harbor. However, "Her shop didn't sell objects; it curated catharsis" edges toward thesis statement, and the final seashell with "thank you" risks sentimentality. The ending reweights the ritual with cost (Leo's tears, communal talk) but the articulation is more allegorical than particular.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV holds cleanly on Elara; perceptual signature ("she heard things," "objects that resisted cataloging") is established early. Dialogue is natural and economical ("You're the curator." / "I hear things."). However, narratorial certainty overreaches: "She'd learned long ago that trauma doesn't shout" and "The locket wasn't just old; it was grieving" edge into omniscience rather than Elara's lived idiom. Filter verbs ("heard," "watched") are frequent but voice-motivated. Leo's interior ("eyes hollow, clutching a mug of cold tea") is observed cleanly, and diction remains stable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and sentence openings are purposeful; information density is solid in the opening courtyard beat. However, mid-story summary compresses four mornings into two short paragraphs, flattening momentum. Minor loops: "softly, imperfectly" / "softly, tear-streaked" and "side by side" (envelope and locket, then Leo's multiple relational pairings). "The humming inside had softened, no longer broken—just sad, and seen" stacks modifiers without advancing pressure. The seashell coda feels scaffolded—an emblem rather than a propulsive beat—but clarity and grammar remain clean throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The thrift-curator who "collects stories" and a locked mailbox for unspoken grief echo familiar motifs (healing-object tales, community-as-therapy). The locket humming "Moon River" is specific, and the courtyard as sanctuary offers texture. Yet the emotional arc—grief acknowledged, healing begun—follows a template path without friction or moral ambiguity. Leo's transformation is gentle and unearned by on-page cost; the mailbox's organic click invokes convenience magic. Risk is modest; the piece prioritizes allegorical resonance over surprise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara frames the story, returns the locket to the mailbox, and waits as Leo weeps—three beats. Her discernment drives the matchmaking (locket to Leo) but her choices are observational rather than conflicted; she never doubts or adjusts tactics. Setup early, development in the vigil, payoff when she places the locket in the mailbox. Swappable with "empathic healer" or "intuitive mediator" without major edits. Causal pressure is moderate; the role enables rather than constrains.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The locket appears in paragraph one, is lifted to Elara's ear (she hears humming), pressed to Leo's chest at closure, and its sound shifts from broken to "sad, and seen." Four beats; it drives the search, the vigil tactic, and the cathartic moment. Setup, development (warm in her palm, drives the walk), and payoff (Leo weeps holding it). Near-irreplaceable: the humming and the hairline fracture are specific. However, it does not constrain Elara—she succeeds on schedule—and the emotional cost belongs to Leo, not the object's use.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The mailbox is introduced early, described (no keyhole, brass plaque), and clicks open at the climax. However, its mystery is never investigated or resisted; Elara already knows its purpose ("she waited for the story to find its keeper"). The lock's mechanics are unexplained, and the concept does not shape tactics—Elara uses the locket and humming, not the mailbox's puzzle. Setup and payoff present, but middle development is absent. Swappable with "ritual box" or "community altar."</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Leads through following" manifests as Elara tracking "emotional resonance" and humming for four mornings until Leo opens the door. The trait enables the vigil tactic and the successful matchmaking. Setup (paragraph describing her method), development (humming as patient pursuit), payoff (Leo follows her back). However, the trait never constrains or costs Elara; she waits without friction, and the following is directional rather than a tradeoff. Cost is Leo's, not hers. Moderately specific but somewhat abstract.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Hear" drives four major beats: Elara hears the locket humming "Moon River," hears footsteps (Mrs. Chen), hears the wind catch the envelope, and hears Leo's breath hitch. The locket-hearing incites the search; the humming ritual replicates it; Leo's hitched breath signals recognition. Setup early, development across the vigil, payoff when the humming softens and is "seen." The verb is specific and near-irreplaceable—swapping to "sense" or "feel" would lose the aural signature. However, hearing does not narrow options; Elara always succeeds.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Neighborhood storytelling appears late: noon conversations with Mrs. Chen and Mr. Ruiz are summarized in one paragraph after the locket moment. The method is declared in the penultimate paragraph ("through neighborhood storytelling… hand to hand, bench to bench") but not shown shaping Elara's tactics. Setup is thematic label, payoff is summary, development is absent. Swappable with "community healing" or "shared grief." The mechanics—who tells what, how it alters Leo—are told rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The courtyard opens and closes the piece, supplies jasmine and the mailbox, and hosts the noon conversations. It is described as "sanctuary before the outside world intruded" and provides spatial grounding for three beats (Elara's discovery, the mailbox click, Leo's weeping). Setup vivid, development (the stoop at 3B contrasts the courtyard), payoff (Leo returns there and talks until noon). However, the courtyard does not constrain a choice—Elara's success is assured. The jasmine recurs but as backdrop, not tactical resource. Moderate causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"When the outside world intrudes" is mentioned once in paragraph three as the courtyard's boundary condition, but the intrusion never arrives or pressures a decision. The four dawns are summarized without urgency, and Leo stays "until noon" without time shaping tactics. Setup is label-only, no development or payoff. Clock is absent. The timeframe is ornamental; removing it changes nothing.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"To prove that listening heals" is articulated in Elara's reflections ("the only way to quiet the echo is to hear it fully") and the penultimate paragraph's thesis. The desire drives her method—lifting the locket to her ear, humming for four mornings—but is never tested or conflicted. Setup late (paragraph explaining her philosophy), development (the vigil enacts it), payoff (Leo's tears confirm it). No friction between want and cost; Elara's belief is validated on schedule. Told more than dramatized; the motivation is theme rather than stake.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Sandstorm calm" reads as gentle, patient, and contemplative throughout: dawn courtyard, jasmine, soft humming, Leo's slow emergence. Tone is consistent and supports the healing theme. However, it remains static—no modulation under pressure—and does not charge the final image beyond reinforcing the allegorical serenity. Setup early, sustained through middle, payoff in Leo's "softly, tear-streaked" laughter. The tone fits but does not escalate or reconfigure; it is coherent rather than transformative.</comment>
