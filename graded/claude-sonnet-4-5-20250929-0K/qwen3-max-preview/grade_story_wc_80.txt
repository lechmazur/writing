<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clearly articulated and her ritual of note-placing shows consistent devotion. The letter discovery prompts genuine emotion—"her stoicism yielding to the sensitivity she'd armored for years"—but the change reads more as momentary release than a path foreclosed with visible cost. Interior contradiction is present (stoicism vs. sensitivity) but acts sequentially rather than simultaneously in scene. The final refilling of the inkwell suggests continuity rather than transformation, keeping the score in the strong-but-not-exceptional band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (Elara, submerged pavilion, after drawbridge rises) land within the first paragraph. The discovery of the bride's letter deepens the stakes and the act of copying it with the inkwell's last drops functions as a Resonant Reconfiguration—Elara moves from surveyor to "priestess of the submerged," her role reweighted by witnessed absence. Cost is legible: the inkwell empties, she weeps, and she "felt lighter—not hollow, but clarified." The accumulative design (repeated note-placements building to the sealed letter) coheres under the textural lens and the closure lands with felt cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The submerged pavilion is vivid and purposeful: "chandeliers now crusted barnacle-crowns," water lapping at her knees, tiles shifting "like teeth in a slack jaw." Sensory hierarchy reflects Elara's professional bias (surveyor turned scribe) and the pavilion itself constrains her ritual—foundation repairs, cracked mortar, the sealed copper tube behind a keystone. The keystone detail charges the closure when she seals her copy there with fresh mortar, making the setting indispensable to the final image. Spatial choreography and decay details remain consistent across descents.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake: to catalog absence as "layered silence waiting to be translated." The repeated descents and note-placements accumulate pressure, and the discovery of the bride's letter tightens the question—can Elara truly witness and honor what was lost? Her decision to copy the letter with the inkwell's last drops and seal it beneath the keystone is a meaningful choice that forecloses further inscription (the inkwell empties). The cost is visible: tears, the empty inkwell, the shift from surveyor to priestess. Escalation under the accumulative lens is present but modest—one deepening rather than multiple reversals.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from Elara's ritual: memory as counterweight to oblivion, witnessed absence as presence. The inkwell's depletion parallels the act of inscription draining "something deeper from the structure—and from her," making the thematic claim concrete. The bride's letter—a choice of sea over altar—reweights the entire endeavor: not preservation but permission, not monument but "witnessed absence interlaced with presence." The final image of lights beneath the waves and Elara refilling the inkwell "from river, from rain, from tears" offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. No thesis statements intrude.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and aptly filtered through Elara's perceptual signature: "algae-streaked steps," "barnacle-crowns," "coughs seaweed." The prose carries a distinct lyric texture with controlled vocabulary ("interlaced absence," "archeologist of abandoned dreams"). Register occasionally elevates beyond baseline surveyor idiom ("entropy," "devotion as stoicism") but remains coherent as reflective interiority. No dialogue is present. Psychic distance is consistent, though the final paragraph's shift to townsfolk whispers briefly widens the lens before returning to Elara. Overall, voice is purposeful and the lyric mode is taught early.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and figurative language is dense but purposeful: "ghosts around her ankles," "teeth in a slack jaw," "sleeping serpent." Some metaphors border on overwrought ("chandeliers now crusted barnacle-crowns dangling above silent waltzes") but remain legible. Sentence openings vary and paragraph structure supports pacing. Minor scaffold appears in repeated syntactic stems ("She carried," "She wrested," "She found," "She copied") across the middle third, creating mild template cadence that does not obscure causality but dulls immediacy slightly. No paraphrase loops or clarity failures at closure. Information density is high.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The premise—surveyor as scribe, placing handwritten notes in a drowned ruin to archive absence—offers a fresh, non-obvious synthesis. The specific ritual (notes in foundation repairs, using a grandfather's inkwell that smells of cedar, copying a bride's apology with the last drops) feels particular and earned. The emotional calculus avoids generic "preservation is noble" in favor of "witnessing absence as layered silence," a more ambiguous stance. The story commits fully to its lyric, accumulative design without retreating into exposition. Risk-taking in structure (multiple descents, reflection-heavy) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, warranting modest bonus consideration within the 7–8 band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her choices—descending, placing notes, copying the bride's letter, sealing it with mortar—create the story's turns. Setup is immediate (first paragraph), middle beats show her ritual in action, and the closure hinges on her decision to copy and seal the letter with the inkwell's last drops. Causal pressure is moderate; the choices deepen her role but do not radically narrow options. Scores in the "shapes one key turn" band with solid development and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The inkwell appears in the setup ("antique traveling inkwell, brass-bound and dented"), is used across multiple beats (writing notes, copying the bride's letter), and its depletion—"the inkwell grew lighter… its reservoir thinning"—charges the closure when Elara uses "the inkwell's last drops" to copy the letter. The refilling at the end ("from river, from rain, from tears") reweights its meaning from heirloom tool to replenishable ritual vessel. Two-plus beats, early signal, and closure linkage place it in the "essential across beats and ending" band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Interlaced absence" is articulated in the setup ("the gaps where laughter once echoed… as layered silence waiting to be translated") and shapes Elara's method: cataloging what the water stole "not as loss, but as layered silence." The bride's letter—explaining an absence—becomes the story's pivot. The concept constrains tactics (she places notes to witness absence) and charges the closure ("witnessed absence, interlaced with presence"). It functions more as thematic lens than plot mechanism, but the final sealing act makes the concept concrete, earning mid-band placement.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Stoically sensitive" is signaled early ("stoically sensitive by nature") and demonstrated: she persists despite entropy ("her stoicism not indifference but devotion") yet weeps when reading the bride's letter ("her stoicism yielding to the sensitivity she'd armored for years"). The trait enables one key beat (the emotional release) but operates mostly as atmospheric descriptor rather than constraint with tactical cost. Present in setup and one development beat; closure alludes to it but does not hinge on it. Scores in the "shapes one key turn" lower range.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Wrest" is framed early ("to become the archeologist of abandoned dreams, to catalog what the water stole") and enacted: "She wrested meaning from the wreckage not with force, but with ritual." The act of copying the bride's letter with the last drops is the key "wresting" beat that changes Elara's stance. However, the action could be replaced by "preserve," "translate," or "rescue" without structural collapse—swappability lowers the score. Present in setup and closure, but not irreplaceable, placing it in the mid-6 band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The method is signaled early ("placing notes in foundation repairs, tucking handwritten fragments into cracked mortar, behind loose bricks, beneath warped floorboards") and executed across multiple beats: notes for Clara, Elias, children, the doll. The climactic act—sealing the copied letter "beneath the keystone with fresh mortar mixed from sand and her own resolve"—directly uses this method to achieve closure. The mechanics (where, how) matter and shape the ending. Early signal, middle involvement, and indispensable closure role place it in the "essential across beats and ending" band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The submerged pavilion is established immediately ("submerged pavilion in its own hushed world") and pressure-tests Elara throughout: slick steps, rising water at her knees, groaning beams, shifting tiles, the sealed copper tube behind a keystone. The setting supplies the keystone that becomes the closure anchor and the rising water adds urgency ("after the drawbridge had sealed them in for the night"). Removing this exact setting—its tactile decay and architectural specifics—would break the story's logic and final image. Early signal, multi-beat constraint, closure participation, and high irreplaceability justify high-8 placement.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The timeframe ("after the drawbridge rises") is mentioned in the opening and once later ("after the drawbridge had sealed them in for the night"), establishing isolation but not urgency. The story spans multiple descents ("she returned, again and again") without on-page time pressure shaping tactics. The frame functions as atmospheric boundary rather than live clock. Present in setup, minimal middle constraint, no closure participation—scores in the "functional but replaceable" band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The motivation ("to become the archeologist of abandoned dreams") is articulated early and dramatized through repeated note-placements and the climactic copying of the bride's letter. Friction emerges when the inkwell depletes and Elara weeps, revealing the emotional cost of her devotion. The closure image (refilling the inkwell, becoming "less surveyor, more scribe, more priestess") shows the desire reweighted. Setup, two beats (ritual and letter), and closure participation with visible cost place it in the "essential across beats and ending" lower range.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Hushed blaze" modulates across the story: the opening's "hushed world, half-swallowed by brackish water" and quiet ritual build to the emotional intensification when Elara weeps ("silently, salt mingling with brackish water") and the pavilion "sighed around her, timbers settling as if finally heard." The tone charges the final image of lights flickering beneath the waves and Elara's silent refusal to confirm or deny. Coherent through turns, with a modest peak that reweights the dominant stake, scoring in the "shapes one key turn" upper band.</comment>
