<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elira's interiority is concrete and embodied throughout—sweat-damp skin, joints stiff, voice raw. Her internal conflict between silence and release is dramatized through micro-choices (pinning the illustration, stepping onto the gantry, facing the oracle again) rather than summarized. The final stance shift is earned through prior pressure, and the oracle's logged observation of her "softening shoulders" and "first true inhale" provides external confirmation without therapy-speak. Minor: the phrase "quiet courage of unswallowed words yet to come" tilts slightly toward label-speak, but the prior embodied work holds.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Elira endures her brokenness and begins to "weigh the truth...in breaths reclaimed, in steps forward," forecloses the path of continued silence with visible cost (exposure to cold, pinning the illustration to weather). The Accumulative/Textural lens is inferred and held: the smudge, the oracle's responses, the auroral light, and the pinned illustration accumulate and reweight the dominant stake. Orientation is prompt (station, fever breaking, dawn) and the lens remains coherent through closure. Cost is legible in the act of pinning the illustration and stepping back inside altered.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The mountain weather station constrains Elira's choices—thin air, biting cold, the gantry's ice-glazed metal all press on her physically. The smudged botanical illustration (a micro-setting object) charges the final image when pinned to the railing with quartz. Sensory detail is vivid and selective: "snowflakes stung her cheeks, sharp as regret," "wind gnashed against the reinforced glass." The station's obsolete instruments and cramped cot anchor the isolation that forces her internal confrontation. The setting is integral to both pressure and closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: the weight of a swallowed truth and its consequence. One meaningful tightening occurs when the oracle reframes her query from "mass" to "consequence," then to "Release requires rupture." Her agency is renunciation and endurance—stepping onto the gantry, pinning the illustration, accepting that "Let the smudge become the center." The cost is visible: exposure to the storm, relinquishing control of the perfect image, choosing to endure rather than resolve. Escalation is driven by protagonist micro-choices under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The theme—enduring brokenness without breaking—emerges from image and action: the smudge that "merely made it honest," the oracle's definition of fault-tolerance, the aurora as "grief that dances." The final image ("Let the smudge become the center") reweights the premise without stating a moral. Subtext operates in the oracle's poetry, Elira's silence, and the charged objects (quartz shard, vellum). The piece avoids label-speak at closure and invites reflection through specificity. No late thematic echo; the ending resonates through prior particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and intimate; psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during fever, pulling back slightly for oracle exchanges). Diction is controlled and voice-particular: "chorus of alpine rage," "swallowed truths," "auroral sorrow." The oracle's dialogue carries distinct cadence and subtext. Filter verbs ("she realized," "wondering if") are voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy. Minor: brief dip toward elevated register in "By occupying margins, it gathered data the center ignored" reads slightly expository, but the surrounding texture holds.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high—most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "The illustration fluttered in her grip, the smudged orchid trembling in the gale" conveys action, object state, and tone). No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Minor density lapse: "It did not celebrate. It endured. As she would." reads slightly staccato and on-the-nose after strong prior work; the final philosophical aside ("in the quiet courage of unswallowed words yet to come") edges toward scaffold. Figurative language is vivid and coherent without overwriting the high-pressure beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The combination of fault-tolerant oracle, smudged botanical illustration, and mountain weather station after fever feels organic and particular. The oracle's responses transform the AI-assistant trope through poetic compression and peripheral observation. The smudge-as-honesty turn is earned and non-obvious. Emotional specificity ("grief that dances, that refuses to settle") avoids generic templates. Minor: the swallowed-truth metaphor is familiar; the piece transforms it through specificity (the weight query, the oracle's reframing, the pinned illustration) but does not entirely escape the template's shadow.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The fault-tolerant oracle appears in three distinct beats: initial query reframe ("gravity bends time"), second recalibration ("You seek not mass, but consequence"), and final definition of fault-tolerance that mirrors Elira's arc. Its responses drive Elira's escalation from hollow question to action (stepping onto gantry, pinning illustration). It is present in the closure paragraph and its peripheral awareness logs her transformation. The oracle's choices (what to say, how to reframe) create key turns. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The botanical illustration is handled in four beats: initial discovery half-finished with smudge, tracing the smudge while fevered, wondering if beauty persists in distortion, and the climactic pinning to the railing. It evolves from mistake to acceptance ("Let the smudge become the center"). The illustration is irreplaceable—its imperfection is the story's conceptual hinge. It shapes Elira's realization and the final image with undeniable cost (surrendering it to the elements). Essential across beats and ending; removing it would collapse the arc.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Swaying certainties shapes the dominant stake from the opening ("the weight of swallowed truths") through the oracle's teaching about fault-tolerance ("to remain whole, even when certainty sways") to the final stance shift. The concept manifests in Elira's movement from fevered rigidity to accepting the smudge as center. It changes her tactics—from seeking erasure to allowing revision. Present in closure image and alters options on the page. Strong specificity and cost connection.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Peripherally aware appears twice: the oracle "occupied margins" and at closure logs "the change in her stance, the softening of her shoulders, the first true inhale." The trait enables the oracle's reframing and final observation, constraining Elira's evasion (the oracle notices what she hides). Visible in two beats with causal role, but the second mention is summary-only ("logged the change") rather than dramatized pressure. Mid-range: shapes one key turn (the consequence reframe) and is present at closure, but lacks stronger causal pressure in the final image.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The smudge is introduced early (fevered thumb, "accidental"), traced again mid-story as Elira wonders if beauty persists in distortion, and becomes the conceptual pivot at closure ("Let the smudge become the center"). It is not easily swappable—the imperfection drives Elira's arc from perfectionism to acceptance. Major turn traces to this action: her decision to pin the illustration rather than correct or discard it. Strong causal pressure, closure linkage, and irreplaceability. The action shapes two beats and the final image.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>By occupying margins is signaled midpoint as the oracle's method: "It occupied margins...the edge of her vision, the silence between her words, the space beneath her grief." The mechanics matter once—enabling the oracle to reframe from mass to consequence by noticing what Elira's direct speech omits. Present in closure paragraph where the oracle logs peripheral changes. Functional in one key beat and at ending, but the method is more described than repeatedly enacted; it does not constrain multiple attempts. Mid-range: shapes one turn and is present in closure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The mountain weather station pressures Elira's choices in multiple beats: thin air and cold force physical cost when she steps onto the gantry; the station's isolation removes escape; the exterior sensor array provides the railing where she pins the illustration. The setting supplies the constraints (wind, snow, ice-glazed metal) that alter her final tactic—surrendering the illustration to revision rather than correction. Strong causal pressure, closure participation, and irreplaceability. The station is essential to both escalation and the final image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>After fever breaks is the opening anchor and frames the story's present tense. It establishes Elira's weakened state ("hollow-eyed," "joints stiff") that persists through the narrative, shaping her limited physical options. The timeframe is tracked loosely (dawn, "first aurora of the season") but does not tighten decisions with a live clock. Present in two beats (opening state, final endurance) with mild causal role—the post-fever fragility makes her final exposure to cold more costly. Mid-range: functional anchor with modest cost connection, but not a pressing temporal constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>To find the weight of a swallowed truth is dramatized in the opening query to the oracle, reiterated in mid-story reflection ("the lie she'd swallowed whole"), and resolved in the closing shift to weighing "not in grams, but in breaths reclaimed." The desire drives all of Elira's on-page choices: querying the oracle twice, stepping onto the gantry, pinning the illustration. Friction between want (to quantify and control the truth) and cost (exposure, relinquishment) is visible throughout. Strong causal pressure, closure linkage, and specificity. Essential to the arc.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Auroral sorrow is coherent and sustained: "cold fire, mourning light," "grief that dances, that refuses to settle, that illuminates even as it chills." The tone modulates with pressure—intimate and raw during fever reflection, expanding to lyric register for the aurora, then tightening again for the final endurance beat. It charges the final image ("in the aurora's weeping light...she began to weigh the truth") and is irreplaceable to the story's emotional texture. Strong closure linkage and specificity; the tone is woven through metaphor and cadence without static repetition.</comment>
