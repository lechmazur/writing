<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara's interiority is heavily abstracted through metaphysical apparatus (thresholds, grain patterns, necessary distances) rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. Her final "step off the terrace" reads as symbolic dissolution, not a choice with visible personal cost—the decision lacks a live alternative she's foreclosing. The backstory about her father dominates the present frame without anchoring micro-choices that tilt her stance on the page. Diagnostic label-speak appears in peak beats: "featherly determined" is repeated as a trait label without dramatized tradeoff.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive late and remain hazy: the terrace's spatial relation to the valley, the timeline since "Before," and Elara's current goal emerge piecemeal past the 120-word gate without teaching a pattern that pays off at closure (−0.4). The closure unit—Elara stepping into light and "unfolding"—gestures toward Resonant Reconfiguration but the cost is conceptual and off-page (she becomes structure like her father); no on-page forfeiture or tactical narrowing is legible. The piece attempts an Accumulative/Textural lens (grain patterns, weather code, threshold imagery) but the final image does not reweight prior material through a visible price; instead it restates the abstract premise. The logbook's child-scrawl twist introduces a time-loop mechanic in the final third without prior setup, breaking earned causality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The prism terrace supplies vivid atmospheric detail (rainbow mist, glassine floor, violet dusk) and the bench's grain is handled repeatedly, but neither constrains a choice or charges the final image with tactical cost. Spatial choreography between terrace, valley, cockpit cliffside, and the appearing corn maze remains vague; no distances or access rules shape Elara's moves. The piece leans on symbolic resonance (prisms, fractured valley) without grounding how the environment limits or enables her decision to step off.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—why thresholds feel sacred—is declared but never tested in a concrete on-page dilemma. Elara has no visible alternative to stepping off the terrace; the move reads as inevitable symbolic completion rather than a trade-off that forecloses a live path. The logbook and bench deliver backstory revelation, not escalating pressure that narrows her options. No second beat or micro-turn tightens her choice; the narrative accumulates metaphysical exposition without a causal tightening or felt cost at closure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Theme (thresholds, necessary distances, sacred geometry) is stated explicitly rather than emergent: "thresholds weren't merely doors—they were echoes of decisions unmade" and "sacred thresholds aren't marked by stone or scripture, but by the weight of what's willingly left behind" function as thesis sentences. The final logbook reveal ("Daddy, I found you" in her own handwriting) asserts time-loop cleverness without prior particular setup, undermining earned resonance. The bench's "sigh of relief" at the end is an overt symbolic flourish rather than a non-literal reweighting of stakes.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains stable focalization and the prose carries a consistent lyric register (compressed, elevated diction). However, perceptual signature is generic-poetic rather than character-specific: phrases like "featherly determined," "fractured hush," and "rainbow mist curled like beckoning fingers" could belong to any voice. The narration asserts knowledge Elara cannot plausibly hold mid-scene (her father "stepped through the stalk's threshold—and vanished… becoming the silent geometry") without dramatizing how she learns it. No head-hopping, but purposeful elision is not taught early or paid off with closure friction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Dense figurative language pervades without pattern-teaching: "edges bleeding rainbow mist," "sound folded into itself," "distance could protect or imprison," "grief absorbed into cellulose, fossilized." Paraphrase loops appear: "thresholds weren't merely doors—they were echoes of decisions unmade" is immediately followed by abstract restatement of the same idea across multiple sentences. Template cadence runs in the backstory exposition ("He'd known then—the maze wasn't meant to confuse, but to reveal. Each turn forced a choice…"). Register drifts into pseudo-philosophical abstraction ("sacredness had geometry," "surrender") that clashes with the concrete grain-reading premise. The logbook entries ("Turbulence at 8,000 ft—felt like regret with teeth") are vivid but do not propel the present scene. Artifacts cluster in the final third, preventing 9+ eligibility globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The core synthesis—grief embodied in wood grain, emotional weather codes, maze architecture as metaphysical anchor—is conceptually ambitious but executed through abstract exposition rather than specific dramatized discovery. The time-loop twist (Elara's own handwriting in the past logbook) is a stock device introduced late without groundwork. The piece reads as a collage of writing-prompt elements (corn maze architect's child, pilot logbook, necessary distances, grain analysis) arranged to satisfy a checklist rather than organically arising from character need. The final dissolution into light is a familiar transcendence image without a fresh inflection tied to Elara's particular struggle.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her backstory (architect's lost child, raised in labyrinthine stalks) frames her orientation toward thresholds and distances. However, her choices on the page are minimal: she kneels, traces grain, opens the logbook, and steps off—none involve a live dilemma or visible cost that alters tactics. The character identity supplies thematic resonance but does not drive causal turns.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The pilot logbook appears in two beats: retrieved from her satchel mid-scene and opened to reveal the final-page scrawl. Its weather-code cipher is described but not used on-page to solve a problem or constrain a choice. The logbook delivers backstory exposition (consecration rather than navigation) and the time-loop reveal, but these are told summaries rather than dramatized discoveries that shift Elara's present options. Setup and payoff are present; middle development and causal pressure are absent.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Necessary distances" is named explicitly and threaded through backstory (father's phrase, corn-row angles, space between hand and flame) and the final realization that sacred thresholds are marked by what's left behind. The concept shapes Elara's understanding but does not constrain an on-page tactical choice or force a trade-off. It functions as thematic coloring rather than a stake that narrows options under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Featherly determined" appears twice as a label ("featherly determined, knelt" in paragraph two; "No fear now, only featherly determination" near the end) but the trait is never dramatized through a visible tradeoff or action that only this attribute would enable. The word is ornamental and swappable with any determination synonym.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Elara "intuited that thresholds weren't merely doors" and later intuition guides her reading of the bench's memory and the logbook's cipher. However, the verb "intuit" labels an off-page cognitive process rather than showing a decision or discovery that shifts her stance. The action is summary-only and could be replaced with "realized" or "understood" without structural change.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Grain analysis is introduced early (paragraph two: "analyzing the grain… for chronology") and returns in two beats: tracing the bench grain to see her father's memory, and using grain patterns from three chairs to decode the logbook. Setup, middle development, and closure participation are present. However, the mechanics remain vague (how does wood stress match meteorological metaphors?) and the method delivers backstory rather than solving a present obstacle. Specificity and irreplaceability are low; the grain-reading could be replaced with any divination device.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The drifting prism terrace is described vividly in the opening and returns as the platform Elara steps off at the end, framing the setting. However, it supplies atmospheric texture rather than pressuring choices: the terrace does not limit access, constrain movement, or supply resources that alter Elara's options. The glassine floor and rainbow mist are postcard details without tactical weight.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"After the butterfly effect unraveled causality" establishes a post-disaster timeframe and "years later" signals duration since her father's vanishing. However, the butterfly effect is invoked as world-state flavor without shaping present urgency or tightening Elara's decision window. Time remains static rather than a live pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The motivation—"to see if sacredness had geometry"—is stated in paragraph ten and echoed in the final realization about sacred thresholds. Elara's desire is told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants or on-page friction. She pursues understanding without visible cost (no sacrifice, no competing obligation) until the ending step, which reads as symbolic fulfillment rather than a choice between hard options.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Fractured hush" is named explicitly ("The fractured hush of the terrace deepened") and the tone—compressed silence, lyric distance, violet dusk, mist—holds consistently through turns. The prose modulates from exposition to revelation without jarring shifts, and the final image ("dissolving into light, into distance") sustains the tone. However, the tone does not charge the closure with new pressure; it remains a static atmospheric layer rather than a dynamic element that reweights stakes.</comment>
