<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lira's interiority relies heavily on poetic abstraction rather than embodied contradiction—"grief settles into bone like barnacles" names the state without showing simultaneous impulses in action. The whale's call triggers a vision sequence that tells us what she "saw" in summarized chunks rather than dramatizing micro-choices under pressure. The final paragraph pivots to new characters (fisherman's child, widow, runaway) without establishing their stakes or Lira's specific costs in those interactions; the moves feel like thematic bullet points rather than earned endurance with visible trade-offs.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (Lira, dock, post-violence world) arrive early. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the scrimshaw glows, the island surfaces, Lira wades deeper, and the whale's call peels back "layers"—a density increase without strict because/therefore linkage. Closure attempts a Resonant Reconfiguration (she returns softer, her role shifts from hauling cargo to "mending souls"), but the final cost is asserted rather than shown: we're told "violence didn't return" and that her touch now carries the whale's echo, yet no on-page choice or renunciation forecloses a live option with felt consequence. The shift feels declared, not dramatized.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The sublittoral fringe, bioluminescent kelp, and tide-worn crates anchor the opening with sensory specificity. The scrimshaw's warmth and the glowing shore beneath Lira's feet charge two key beats. However, the "disappearing island" remains conceptual: it surfaces as light, not rock or reef, and imposes no spatial constraint on her wading or her final return to the docks—its presence feels symbolic rather than a lived environment that alters her choices.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—detaching from "the lie she'd worn" and finding freedom—is signaled early but remains abstract throughout. The wading deepens pressure texturally (water to waist, then chest), yet the whale's call and the island's appearance solve the problem without Lira forgoing a concrete alternative or paying a visible price on the page. The final vignettes (kissing the child's forehead, mending the widow's sail, taking the runaway's hand) declare success but do not dramatize a live choice that narrows her options or tests her commitment under resistance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Theme (alignment with self, freedom through embracing one's nature, healing the broken) emerges through recurring images—the scrimshaw, the whale's song, the dissolving foam—but the final paragraph delivers a thematic statement nearly verbatim: "true freedom is not escape, but alignment—with self, with sea, with the song only the broken can truly hear." The closing moves declare the lesson rather than letting the fisherman's child, the widow, or the runaway's grip embody it through friction or micro-cost. Subtext is present in the scrimshaw's "lover's reproach" and the pirate's weeping, yet the ending trades resonance for explication.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent, lyric, and rhythmically controlled: "salt on her lips," "tenderness sharpened by the combative edge of survival." Psychic distance remains stable in third-limited; no head-hopping. However, the opening's elevated diction ("borderland where sea met stone in whispered truces") and the vision sequence's high register ("layers she'd armored with labor and loneliness") do not noticeably degrade under stress—Lira's perceptual signature stays poetic even at the climactic wading. The final paragraph's direct address to theme ("Not here. Not now. Not while…") reads as authorial summary rather than Lira's interior voice under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The prose carries poetic density and varied rhythm, but multiple lines loop or paraphrase: "Not from shore, not from sky, but from the deep" is immediately echoed by "It wasn't sound—it was summons." The vision sequence summarizes three nested revelations ("She saw herself… She saw the pirate… The island surfaced…") in parallel template cadence without propulsion. Figurative language saturates most sentences ("bruised indigo sky," "lover's reproach," "seafoam between her fingers"), and mixed metaphors appear: grief "settles into bone like barnacles" (mineral accretion), then the scrimshaw's ridges "bite into her palm like a lover's reproach" (animate attack + emotional analogy). The final third deploys anaphora ("Not here. Not now. Not while…") that decorates rather than advances the image, triggering −0.6 for template cadence and loop artifacts across the closure beat, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The core premise—mystical island that appears when compassion stirs, a scrimshaw key, a transformative whale's call—assembles familiar fantasy/spiritual-journey tropes without a transformative angle: the remorseful pirate, the dock worker with hidden depth, the vanishing sanctuary, and the final community-healer role converge predictably. The "violence becomes impossible" frame is intriguing but never dramatized on the page; it remains a backdrop rather than a constraint that shapes Lira's choices. The ending's pivot to healing vignettes (child, widow, runaway) follows a template service-to-others arc without friction or non-obvious cost, and the thematic explication in the penultimate paragraph ("true freedom is not escape, but alignment") delivers the prompt's concept verbatim rather than synthesizing it through lived particulars.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Lira is present throughout and makes the central decision to wade into the shallows, clutching the scrimshaw. However, her choices are largely reactive to external summons (the scrimshaw grows warm; the whale calls; the island surfaces beneath her feet) rather than creating key turns through her own agency. The final paragraph shows her offering touch and silence to others, but these actions are summarized outcomes rather than on-page decisions with visible cost or resistance.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The scrimshaw appears in the opening third (beat 1: description and backstory), heats against Lira's skin as she approaches the water (beat 2: constraint cue), flares hot and glows blue during the whale's call (beat 3: participates in transformation), and dissolves into seafoam after she steps onto the island (beat 4: closure participation). Its "grooves etched with runes that hummed" and the pirate's penance backstory add specificity. However, its exact mechanics—how it "unlocks guarded hearts"—are never tested on the page through Lira's interaction with another character; it functions as a talisman whose properties are asserted rather than dramatized with cost. The final vignettes mention "the scrimshaw's memory" but the object itself is gone, so its closure linkage is indirect.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The disappearing island is introduced early ("visible only when compassion stirred the deep"), reappears as Lira wades ("the island surfaced… a swell of light beneath her feet"), and she steps onto its glowing shore at the climax. Its presence enables the transformation scene and delivers the thematic lesson. However, the island imposes no navigational constraint or tactical cost—it simply appears when summoned by the whale's call and vanishes by dawn as a narrative given. Its mechanics (receding with cruelty, surfacing with compassion) remain conceptual rather than tested through Lira's choices.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Unlocks guarded hearts" is attributed to the scrimshaw in beat 1 and echoed thematically when Lira's touch makes the boy "lean in" and when the runaway takes her hand. Yet the attribute is never dramatized as a specific ability with visible cost: the scrimshaw dissolves before Lira interacts with other characters, and the "unlocking" reads as metaphorical compassion rather than a constrained power with a price. The trait labels the theme without enabling a choice under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Detach" is stated as Lira's goal ("She'd come to detach—not from duty, not from grief, but from the lie…") and the wading sequence enacts a physical separation from the dock. The island experience redefines her purpose from hauling cargo to healing, which could be read as detachment from her prior role. However, the action is not tested against a competing pull or cost—she wades, the whale calls, the island appears, and she returns changed. The word "detach" itself does not recur at closure; "alignment" replaces it thematically, making the original action somewhat swappable with "transform" or "awaken."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The whale's call is seeded early ("the call of a whale from the deep" in the concept sentence), appears as the central turn ("a whale's song, low and seismic, vibrating through marrow"), and triggers the scrimshaw's glow and Lira's vision. Its mechanics matter: it is "not sound—it was summons," pulling at "essence" rather than ears, and Lira later hums the "deep-song" while mending the widow's sail. The method drives the transformation beat and is referenced in the ending. However, Lira does not choose to invoke the call or resist it; it arrives as an external force, reducing her agency in the method itself.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The sublittoral fringe is named in the opening line with vivid imagery ("bioluminescent kelp," "borderland where sea met stone") and grounds the wading sequence (water to waist, then chest). However, it functions as atmospheric backdrop rather than a constraint that alters tactics: the kelp does not entangle, the tide does not resist, and the depth does not test Lira's stamina or decision. The glowing shore she steps onto is described as light, not rock or reef, so the setting remains conceptual at the climax.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"After violence becomes impossible" is introduced in the opening line and repeated in the final stanza ("The violence didn't return. It couldn't. Not here. Not now."). The timeframe establishes tone and world state but does not tighten Lira's decisions—she faces no temporal deadline, no risk of violence returning during her wading, and no choice framed by the cessation of conflict. The element functions as setting flavor rather than a pressure that shapes tactics or stakes.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Lira's desire "to find freedom in embracing one's true nature" is stated explicitly ("The island called to those who sought freedom…") and drives her wading into the shallows. The vision sequence reveals her "true nature" as healer rather than cargo hauler, and the ending shows her enacting this new role. However, the motivation is declared rather than dramatized through conflicting wants: she does not weigh the cost of leaving the docks, resist the call, or forfeit a competing attachment. The friction between her prior "lie" and her new purpose is told in summary ("she cursed its mystery") without on-page hesitation or trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Combative tenderness" is signaled in Lira's description ("graceful… calloused palms," "her tenderness sharpened by the combative edge of survival") and modulates through the wading (physical struggle, cold water) and the final acts (kissing the child's forehead, taking the runaway's hand with "silence, then… her hand"). The tone is present across beats and charges the ending's gentleness-after-trial. However, the combative element weakens in the final third: Lira returns "softer," and the vignettes emphasize care without dramatizing friction or resistance from the people she helps. The tone tilts toward pure tenderness at closure, losing the duality.</comment>
