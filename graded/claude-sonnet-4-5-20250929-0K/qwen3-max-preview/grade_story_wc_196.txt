<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The archivist's interior is well-rendered through concrete actions (photographing dust, documenting kindnesses) and her emotional arc from viewing her role as "preserving loss" to "turning memorials into living stories" feels earned. However, the transformation happens largely in summary ("She'd spent years believing...But this—this was different") rather than through on-page contradiction or struggle. The micro-choices (lifting the button, switching off lights, opening the logbook) accumulate pressure but the final stance crystallization lacks visible cost—her healing is declared rather than forfeited against something she values.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density increases through artifact discoveries that reweight the archivist's understanding of her work. Orientation anchors clearly (file room, three years post-emancipation). The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (she transforms her mission from cataloging loss to magnifying kindness) with conceptual cost visible in the line "she healed by magnifying small kindnesses" and the recurring button-as-compass image. One meaningful deepening occurs when the button unlocks Corporal Vance's story, reweighting all prior artifacts. However, the cost remains largely conceptual/emotional rather than a felt forfeiture, and the supervisor's easy acquiescence ("he didn't object") softens what could have been sharper institutional resistance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The file room setting constrains choices (she uses dust patterns as evidence, the lamp angle reveals what daylight ignored) and charges the closure image (the button on her desk as compass). Sensory details are selective and purposeful: "dust motes danced in slanted afternoon light," "fluorescent hum," the tactile lifting with "gloved fingers." The micro-setting of dust as a readable text is ingenious and drives the investigation. Spatial choreography is clean (shelves, desk, adjacent surfaces). The setting earns high marks for functional constraint and closure participation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: transforming institutional neglect into recognized tenderness. One meaningful deepening occurs when the button discovery leads to Vance's story, reweighting all subsequent artifacts. However, the escalation is more accumulative than pressurized—each artifact adds texture but doesn't narrow options or raise cost. The supervisor's easy acceptance and the absence of institutional resistance or personal sacrifice (she simply continues her work with coffee and more boxes) keeps stakes largely conceptual. Agency is present in her choice to open the "Magnifications" logbook, but it doesn't foreclose a live path with felt cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from concrete particulars: the button, handprints, crayon drawing. The contrast between "preserving loss" and "turning memorials into living stories" is earned through artifact accumulation rather than stated thesis. The final image—dust and light as explanation—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. However, the supervisor's line "You're turning files into memorials" / "I'm turning memorials back into living stories" edges toward on-the-nose articulation. The piece resists false equivalence (not all stories have happy endings) while maintaining the theme that "love persists, even in paper and shadow."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with strong perceptual signature: the archivist notices dust gradients, regiment insignia worn smooth, the "ghost of a hand." Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during artifact examination, pulling back for reflection). Diction remains consistent and literary without jarring register shifts. The supervisor's brief dialogue feels natural and goal-driven. Free indirect style is clean. One minor slip: "unknown histories" in paragraph 8 shifts from her thought to authorial commentary without clear attribution, but recovers quickly. Overall, voice control under pressure is strong with distinct rhythmic pacing.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear with varied syntax and strong concrete detail. However, several paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "never mentioned but always present" echoes "silent ache"; "not a name, not a date, but" repeats structure; "dust, she'd learned, was never random" is followed by three restatements of the same insight. Template cadence appears in the artifact list (paragraph 27): "the button, the handprints, a crayon drawing...a birthday card." The phrase "examined unknown" appears twice as thematic shorthand. The "quiet declarations of belonging" (paragraph 36) edges toward elevated abstraction. Apply −0.8 for paraphrase loops and template runs that dull density without touching closure directly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The premise—reading institutional archives through dust forensics to recover hidden kindness—offers a fresh synthesis of archival work and detective investigation. The button as keystone rather than random inclusion is a strong non-obvious turn. However, the emotional arc (broken-hearted person finds healing through work) follows a familiar template. The dust-as-text conceit is specific and well-executed but the thematic resolution (love persists in small things) is earnest rather than surprising. The piece commits fully to its premise and the Vance backstory adds verifiable historical texture, but institutional resistance never materializes to test the vision.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Present throughout. The archivist's choices drive key turns: lifting the button (beat 1), switching off overhead lights to read dust (beat 2), cross-referencing military archives (beat 3), opening the "Magnifications" logbook (beat 4). Each action advances discovery and reweights her understanding. She appears in the closure image with the button as compass. Her decisions alter tactics (from passive cataloging to active magnification). Cost is conceptual (she shifts her mission) rather than a visible trade-off, which keeps the score mid-band. Not indispensable—another researcher could execute the same arc—but strongly integrated across setup, development, and payoff.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Setup: paragraph 4, "tarnished infantryman's button." Development: paragraph 6 (she examines the insignia), paragraph 18 (cross-references to Vance, "a silent vow"), paragraph 27 (listed in "Magnifications"). Payoff: final paragraphs ("The button still rests on her desk. Not as a relic, but as a compass"). The button is handled physically (gloved fingers, under magnifying lamp, under glass) and its meaning evolves from anomaly to keystone to compass. It drives the investigation, unlocks Vance's story, and charges the closure image. Causal pressure is strong (without the button, no Vance story, no reweighting of other artifacts). Cost connection: the button symbolizes her commitment to magnifying kindness. Very high integration with all three gates and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Setup: paragraph 2 ("children whose stories ended in ellipses"), paragraph 8 ("unknown histories...were invitations"). Development: the concept shapes her method throughout—she investigates what the system overlooked (dust patterns, artifacts). Payoff: paragraph 36 ("sanctuary of examined unknowns"), final line ("lets the light do the explaining"). The concept constrains her tactics (she documents anomalies the bureaucracy ignored) and reweights at closure (unknown becomes examined, invisible becomes visible). However, it functions more as thematic frame than on-page problem that narrows options. The stories remain unknown to others but become known to her, so the stakes are less about discovering unknowns than dignifying them. Strong thematic presence but mid-causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Setup: paragraph 9 ("tactfully hopeful curiosity"). The attribute appears as a label describing her gaze. It doesn't constrain or enable a specific on-page action with visible cost—she would investigate the dust patterns regardless of hopefulness. The trait colors her approach (she doesn't view the room "with frustration") but doesn't create a trade-off or alter tactics. It's consistent with her actions (opening the logbook, smiling) but swappable with "patient" or "determined" without structural change. Label-only integration, no middle beat tied to this specific trait, weak closure participation. Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Setup: paragraph 9 (she begins to notice dust patterns). Development: paragraph 15 ("letting accumulated dust patterns unfurl stories"), paragraph 16 (she photographs each anomaly). Payoff: paragraph 27 ("mapped seventeen such artifacts, each paired with its dust signature"), final image (she "points to the dust—and lets the light do the explaining"). The action of unfurling/reading dust patterns drives discovery and shapes her investigative method. It's specific (not just "reading files" but interpreting physical traces) and irreplaceable—the story hinges on this forensic reading. However, the major turns (finding the button, cross-referencing Vance) could occur without the dust patterns playing causal roles; dust enriches but doesn't define the plot spine. Strong presence across all three gates with closure linkage, but mid-range causal indispensability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Setup: paragraph 11 ("Dust...was never random. It settled in whispers...shaped by breath, movement"). Development: paragraphs 12–14 (she switches off lights, angles lamp, reads dust traces as evidence of contact). Payoff: paragraph 27 ("each paired with its dust signature"), final paragraph (she points to dust as explanation). The method shapes her investigative tactics (lamp angle, pattern documentation) and is signaled early with clear mechanics. It's purposeful and specific. However, the button discovery (the story's keystone) doesn't depend on dust—it was visible in daylight. Dust patterns confirm human contact but don't unlock new information or narrow options. The method enriches texture but could be reduced without breaking closure. Solid integration across gates but mid causal necessity.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Setup: paragraph 1–2 (file room, three years cataloging). Development: the room's shelves, fluorescent lights, desk, and basement files pressure her choices throughout. The spatial environment enables her method (lamp angles reveal dust, proximity to shelves allows documentation). Payoff: paragraph 36 ("turned the foster care file room into a sanctuary"), final image (she remains in the room, pointing to dust). The setting is not postcard description—it supplies resources (files, lamp, glass case) and constrains action (she works within institutional space). Micro-setting (dust on surfaces) functions as evidence. The room's transformation from bureaucratic void to sanctuary is central to closure. High integration with causal pressure and closure charge.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Setup: paragraph 2 ("three years in this foster care file room, post-emancipation"). The timeframe establishes her position (she's no longer a foster child herself, giving her perspective weight) but doesn't tighten decisions or create urgency. No live clock or deadline. The 1947 date on the intake form establishes historical distance but doesn't affect her tactics. The phrase "by week's end" (paragraph 27) marks elapsed time without pressure. The timeframe is consistent and plausible but could be altered (two years, five years) without structural impact. Functional backstory anchor, weak tactical constraint. Missing development and closure participation gates; cap at 4.6 per missing-setup rule (timeframe is mentioned but not used as constraint).</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Setup: implicit in her work (paragraph 2, "cataloging lives that slipped through bureaucratic cracks"). Made explicit paragraph 20 ("quiet, stubborn love surviving institutional indifference"). Development: paragraph 24 (she opens "Magnifications" logbook to "transcribe...kindnesses"), paragraph 27 (seventeen artifacts mapped). Payoff: paragraph 34 ("she healed by magnifying small kindnesses"), final image (button as compass, dust as proof). The motivation is dramatized through on-page choices (documenting rather than just cataloging, shifting from loss-preservation to kindness-magnification). However, there's no friction between this want and competing desires or costs—she faces no institutional resistance, no personal sacrifice. The motivation is consistent and drives action but lacks the tension of a difficult trade-off. Strong setup and payoff, weaker cost connection.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Setup: paragraph 8 ("unknown histories...were invitations...to lean in and listen"). Development: the tone of careful investigation and reverent attention is consistent (paragraphs 9–16, methodical documentation; paragraph 19, "throat tightened"). Payoff: paragraph 34 ("she healed by magnifying small kindnesses—proof that love persists"), final image (light doing the explaining). The tone is coherent and modulates with pressure (contemplative in investigation, emotional at Vance discovery, hopeful at closure). "Examined unknown" as a tonal descriptor is honored—she examines what was overlooked. However, the tone is somewhat static (consistently reverent) without sharp pressure that forces tonal shift. The final image charges meaning but the emotional register doesn't dramatically reconfigure. Solid coherence and closure participation, mid-range modulation under stress.</comment>
