<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The deckhand's motivation ("resiliently positive," cheerful despite catastrophe) is asserted through repeated smiling and grinning but never tested by genuine internal conflict or competing impulses. His choice to enter the grotto and tune the radio reads as confidence in a mystical solution rather than a trade-off with visible cost. The captain's return is passive (he simply appears), and the deckhand's final state mirrors his opening cheer without dramatizing what he has risked or lost. Interiority relies on label-only optimism ("resiliently positive," "cheerful wave") rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who and where by the first paragraph, satisfying the test. The closure unit—seven ferries converging, the deckhand whispering "Welcome home," then resuming work—qualifies as Earned Stasis under an Accumulative lens: he accepts the cycle of fraying and reknitting without pressing for permanence. However, the cost is conceptual ("permanence was never the goal—transience was the truth") rather than felt loss on the page, and the lens wobbles between causal problem-solving (tuning the radio by instinct) and accumulative mood-layering. The story teaches a mystical-technical pattern (glyphs, frequencies, hourglass resonance) but the mechanics remain decorative; the deckhand's actions feel like following a predetermined script rather than discovering under pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The spectral grotto supplies vivid sensory anchors (phosphorescent pebbles, ozone, coral arches pulsing with forgotten tides, stalactites dripping liquid starlight) and micro-setting details (the radio's glowing dials, the hourglass atop it) constrain the convergence ritual in the climax. Spatial choreography is clear across the grotto descent and surface return. However, the ferry deck and open water receive generic treatment ("salt spray," "brass railings") and the grotto's surreal properties (bioluminescent eels tracing equations, constellations rearranging) read as ornament rather than obstacles that shape the deckhand's tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The dominant stake—merging parallel timelines so souls have "a single, solid world to call home"—is declared midway but never dramatized as a choice with competing costs. The deckhand's descent into the grotto and radio tuning unfold without resistance, setback, or internal friction; he "didn't hesitate," "didn't sleep," "didn't eat much" but never sacrifices a concrete option or faces a tactical dilemma. The seven ferries converge through his humming and the hourglass igniting, which reads as mystical coincidence rather than protagonist agency narrowing options. No reversal or tightening forces a trade-off; the deckhand's final return to surface work resets to his opening cheer without visible cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The theme of "permanent transience" emerges through the hourglass, the phrase "when clocks run sideways," and the deckhand's acceptance that "permanence was never the goal." The final image—sand trickling upward, ghostly ripples only he can see—reweights the opening vanishings as part of an ongoing cycle. However, the piece relies on explicit statements ("transience was the truth," "patterns, once understood, could always be reknit") rather than letting imagery and choice carry the theme. The convergence itself feels like a solved puzzle rather than an earned reconciliation with loss, and the captain's silent gratitude and the commuters' amnesia flatten the human complexity of reunion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-person limited on the deckhand; no head-hopping. The voice carries a lyric, fable-like register ("spectral grotto under starlight," "breath of the sea itself," "faithful steward") that coheres across the piece. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("quantum tides," "collapsing probabilities," "harmonic beacons") that sits uneasily with the deckhand's hands-on sailor idiom. Perceptual signature is present (he notices grain of wood, glyphs in moonlight, tide patterns) but the narration's certainty about mystical mechanics ("time doesn't break—it braids") exceeds what a deckhand could plausibly articulate, blurring distance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The piece cycles through template cadences: "He didn't [X]. Didn't [Y]. Just worked…" (paragraph 16), "Didn't cheer. Didn't cry. He simply…" (paragraph 20), and repetitive "not [X], but [Y]" constructions across multiple paragraphs. Paraphrase loops appear: paragraph 2 restates vanishing as "not sunk, not capsized, but cleanly erased" and "as if time itself blinked," then paragraph 9 rephrases as "not accidents… corrections… oscillating, caught between parallel timelines." The final third stacks filter-verb phrases ("he placed," "began to hum," "whispered") and leans on stock mystical imagery ("liquid starlight," "void," "ghostly ripples") without fresh specificity. Momentum stalls in the middle section where the deckhand's research (tide tables, star charts, logbooks) is summarized rather than dramatized, and the grotto's responses (stalactites, eels) feel ornamental.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The premise—vanishing ferries oscillating between parallel timelines, resolved by a deckhand tuning a mystical radio—offers a fresh blend of maritime routine and speculative mechanics. The hourglass with glyphs, the phrase "when clocks run sideways," and the grotto's bioluminescent choreography create distinctive imagery. However, the core emotional arc (steadfast optimism rewarded by mystical success) follows a stock pattern, and the deckhand's lack of doubt or sacrifice undercuts risk. The convergence mechanic (humming to match the grotto's frequency) arrives as a late rule without prior groundwork, and the ending's return to cheerful routine nullifies the premise's potential for transformation or permanent cost.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The ardent ferry deckhand is present throughout and drives two key beats: descending into the grotto (paragraph 5) and tuning the radio while humming to trigger convergence (paragraphs 17–19). His decision to enter the grotto and his final choice to return to surface work bookend the arc. However, his role is more observer and conduit than agent making trade-offs; he follows the hourglass's cues and the captain's cryptic instruction without internal friction or competing desires. His "ardent" quality manifests as cheerful persistence rather than a trait that constrains a choice with cost. Setup is early, development spans the middle, and he is central to closure, meeting all three gates and lifting the score into the mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The empty hourglass appears in paragraph 3 (setup), is examined for glyphs in moonlight (paragraph 4), resonates with the radio's frequencies during tuning (paragraph 7), is placed atop the radio to trigger convergence (paragraph 17), and returns with sand trickling upward in paragraph 21 (closure). It shifts from dormant gift to active ritual anchor, and its final state (sand rising) reweights the opening "empty" descriptor, signaling the cycle's reversal. The hourglass enables the convergence beat and charges the ending image. Its glyphs and internal resonance are specific enough that swapping it for another time-device would require structural edits. However, the mechanics of "internal resonance" and why sand flows upward remain decorative rather than causally explained, capping the score below 8.5.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The vanishing commuter ferry frames the inciting mystery (paragraph 2, six vanishings; paragraph 5, the seventh) and the convergence outcome (paragraph 19, seven ferries shimmer into view). The concept shapes the deckhand's goal (to merge timelines) and his middle-section research (mapping vanishings to solstices, equinoxes, logbooks). The final convergence of seven ferries is the story's climactic image, and the ending's single ferry with amnesia-stricken commuters closes the loop. However, the ferry itself is passive backdrop; the deckhand never boards, rescues passengers on-page, or faces a tactical dilemma aboard a vanishing vessel. The concept drives stakes and closure but does not constrain moment-to-moment choices.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Resiliently positive" is asserted in the opening line ("grin," "humming," "resiliently positive") and repeated in paragraphs 10 ("he didn't cheer… simply tipped his cap"), 16 ("he smiled, resiliently positive"), and 24 ("smiled, resiliently positive"). The trait enables his persistence (he works through the night without eating, paragraph 16) but never constrains a choice or imposes a visible cost; he faces no moment where optimism blinds him or forces a tradeoff. The attribute is label-only, invoked across multiple beats but not dramatized as a flaw or friction point. It appears late in paragraph 16 as an adjective and is restated in the final paragraph, but lacks middle development where the trait would narrow options.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The radio is introduced in paragraph 6 (nestled between coral arches, humming, dials glowing), tuned by the deckhand in paragraph 7 (fingers brushing frequencies, aligning with hourglass resonance), emits echoes in paragraph 8 (laughter, wave, captain's order), and outputs interconnected patterns the deckhand maps in paragraphs 11–12. In the convergence beat (paragraph 17), placing the hourglass atop the radio and humming triggers the chord that merges timelines. The radio is declared "complete" in paragraph 21 and is the tool through which the deckhand executes his solution. Its specific properties (symbol-glowing dials, frequency-sensation interface, harmony with the hourglass) are irreplaceable; swapping it for another device would break the closure mechanics. Setup, development across multiple beats, causal pressure, and closure linkage are all strong. However, the radio's discovery is convenient (it simply awaits him in the grotto, not rusted) and its mechanics (tuning by sensation, outputting patterns) remain mystical rather than grounded, keeping the score below 8.5.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Via interconnected patterns" is named in paragraph 11 (the deckhand studies the radio's output: "ripples overlapping like schools of fish, spirals syncing with lunar phases") and paragraph 12 (he maps them onto tide tables, star charts, logbooks). Paragraph 13 declares "time doesn't break—it braids" and he learns to read the braids. Paragraph 14 describes him encoding "harmonic beacons" in lighthouse flashes and buoy chimes. The method shapes his middle-section tactics (cross-referencing, leaving beacons) and is implicit in the convergence beat when his humming matches the grotto's frequency. However, the mechanics remain abstract and decorative; the story asserts patterns without showing how one specific pattern narrows a choice or alters tactics under pressure. The method is present across setup, development, and closure but lacks the specificity and constraint needed for high-band scores.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The spectral grotto under starlight is introduced in paragraph 1 ("spectral grotto under starlight") and entered in paragraph 5 (boots crunching phosphorescent pebbles, ozone, memory-thick air). The grotto houses the radio (paragraph 6), responds to the deckhand's work (stalactites dripping starlight, bioluminescent eels, paragraph 15), and is the locus of the convergence ritual (paragraphs 17–19). The grotto's natural frequency must be matched by the deckhand's humming (paragraph 17), making it an active participant in the closure beat. Its vivid sensory details (phosphorescent pebbles, coral arches, starlight) and mystical properties (responsive environment) are specific and irreplaceable. Setup, development, closure linkage, and causal pressure (the frequency-matching requirement) all land cleanly. The grotto's surreal responses (eels tracing equations, trembling in convergence) constrain the deckhand's ritual, lifting the score into the mid-7s.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"When clocks run sideways" is the captain's cryptic phrase (paragraph 3), invoked again in paragraph 13 ("when clocks run sideways, time doesn't break—it braids") as the deckhand's interpretive breakthrough. The timeframe is implicit in the oscillating ferries and the convergence moment when "constellations rearranged themselves hourly" (paragraph 17). However, no live clock tightens the deckhand's decisions; he works "that night" (paragraph 5), "one midnight" (paragraph 17), and "the next morning" (paragraph 22) without urgency or deadline. The phrase functions as thematic flavor and a conceptual key rather than a tactical constraint. It is seeded early, returns at the breakthrough and closure, meeting setup and payoff gates, but middle development lacks a beat where sideways time forces a choice or alters tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The motivation "to merge parallel timelines" is declared in paragraph 10 ("his motivation crystallized… to merge parallel timelines… because every soul aboard deserved a single, solid world to call home") and drives the middle research beats (paragraphs 11–14) and the convergence ritual (paragraphs 17–19). The goal shapes his choice to descend into the grotto and his decision to leave harmonic beacons. However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized; the deckhand never confronts a competing desire (e.g., personal safety, doubt, a temptation to let the timelines remain split). Paragraph 10 frames the goal as selfless and certain, and no subsequent beat tests that certainty with cost or friction. The motivation is present across setup, development, and closure but lacks the internal conflict or visible tradeoff needed for high-band scores.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Permanent transient" is named explicitly in the final line ("permanent, permanent transience") and thematically seeded in paragraph 20 ("permanence was never the goal—transience was the truth"). The tone layers mystical wonder (glyphs igniting, liquid starlight, ghostly ripples) with workaday routine (polishing railings, checking life vests) throughout, and the ending's return to surface work embodies the paradox. The hourglass's sand trickling upward (paragraph 21) and the deckhand's knowledge that "timelines would fray again" (paragraph 23) charge the final image with the tension between stability and flux. However, the phrase itself is a late label rather than a tonal thread woven from the opening, and the story's lyric register sometimes obscures whether the deckhand has earned the philosophical stance or is simply narrating it. Setup in tone (cheerful persistence amid catastrophe), development across mystical and mundane beats, and closure participation (the final line and upward-sand image) meet all three gates, but the tone's coherence wobbles between fable and thriller, capping the score in the mid-6s.</comment>
