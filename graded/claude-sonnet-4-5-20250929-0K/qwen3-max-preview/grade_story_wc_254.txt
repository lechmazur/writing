<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The poet remains abstract throughout—no concrete micro-choices under pressure, no embodied contradiction. "Tremor of certainty" is asserted rather than dramatized through competing impulses. The final action (stepping onto ice) arrives as ritual rather than earned change; no visible cost forecloses a path. Interiority consists of poetic declarations ("simple, savage need") rather than character-particular perception.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation Test penalty applies: who, where, and when drift through metaphor past the 120-word threshold without concrete anchoring. The closure unit—stepping onto ice and "the world…remembered how to listen"—lacks visible cost; nothing forecloses a path or changes options on the page. The drive lens remains ambiguous (lyric accumulation or situational poise?), and no because/therefore linkage tightens stakes. The ban-lifting frame sets expectation but never tests the poet's agency against opposition.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The cobalt atrium and frozen lake supply vivid, specific images (quartz hum, bruised twilight, glacial marble). However, the environment remains decorative—no spatial constraint shapes a choice, no tool or object alters tactics. The poet moves through space without friction. Micro-setting allowance is met (body/pillar interaction), but the final image (stepping onto ice) does not hinge on environmental pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake ("to stride through boundaries") is declared but never tested by on-page opposition. No reversal narrows options; the atrium welcomes her without friction, the guardians have vanished. The climax—dancing and stepping onto ice—is surrender rather than choice under pressure. No visible cost: the ban lifted before the story began, so agency does not foreclose a live path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Theme (permission, silence breaking, sacred-made-supple) emerges from images and the ban-frame. The quartz/lake/lantern-moth motifs recur with shifting texture. However, the final image ("the world…remembered how to listen") states the theme rather than dramatizing it through a non-literal answer. "Unfold" and the paraphrase-hymn moments carry subtext, but the ending tips into summary rather than earned resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The prose carries a distinct lyric register ("lantern-moth hush," "savage need to touch what had been declared untouchable"), but diction drifts into elevated abstraction that does not read as the poet's lived idiom ("aesthetically driven," "translate sacred geometry into mortal motion"). Perceptual signature is generic poetic rather than character-specific. POV distance is stable, but the voice reads as authorial rather than inhabiting the poet's concrete perceptual frame under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Heavy overwriting throughout: nearly every sentence stacks metaphor or elevated diction without clear propulsion ("syllables shaped from ancient wind and glacial melt, verses she'd smuggled in dreams"). Paraphrase loops: "boundaries dissolved…boundaries once thought sacred" and "not in worship, but in conversation" echo without adding pressure. Template cadence: repeated "not X, but Y" constructions across the piece (−0.6). Register drift into abstract philosophical phrasing clashes with embodied moment. The final third remains ornamental rather than tightening toward closure (−1.4 total in Q7; artifacts touch closure −1.7 baseline applies).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The ban-lifting frame and poet-as-threshold premise offer a conceptual angle, but the execution defaults to generic lyric moves: the wise protagonist communes with mystical architecture, dances alone, speaks one verb, and is welcomed without friction. The quartz-hum and frozen-lake images are vivid but not transformed—they could swap into other mystical-place stories with minor edits. No bold risk that heightens stakes; the poet's unopposed journey reads as template transcendence.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>The cloud-shadow poet is present throughout but makes no decision that alters tactics or stakes. She steps forward, kneels, dances, and steps onto ice—all actions of acceptance rather than choice under pressure. Observation and ritual dominate; no turn traces to her agency.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The humming quartz colonnade appears in multiple beats (entry, passing, heart-of-colonnade kneeling, final dimming). It hums and warms in response, but this response is atmospheric rather than causal—it does not constrain or enable a choice with cost. Setup and development gates met; closure participation is ornamental (the colonnade dims as she turns away). Swappable with another mystical architectural feature.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>The phrase "tremor of certainty" appears once early as a label; it does not shape stakes or tactics on the page. The poet's confidence is asserted but never tested by opposition or doubt. Theme echo only, no action hinge.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The atrium is described as "aesthetically driven…not built for function, but for…resonance." This is exposition rather than a trait that constrains choice. The poet's aesthetic engagement (dancing, tracing pillars) is consistent but not shown to cost her anything or enable a tactic unavailable otherwise. Label-only.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Paraphrase appears explicitly: the poet "paraphrases the divine," "paraphrases the hymn of the lake," and the lake "remembered how to paraphrase the sky." Setup by first third; mid-story articulation of method; final image echoes the concept. However, no major turn hinges on paraphrase as a distinct action—she could "interpret" or "translate" with the same beats. One key thematic reprise with reweighting, but not indispensable to plot logic.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Dissolving boundaries is described: "boundaries dissolved not as walls crumbled, but as membranes thinned." Setup gate met. The method is poetic metaphor rather than mechanical—no beats show her working to dissolve a boundary or being thwarted. Closure line ("to stride through boundaries by becoming the threshold itself") is thematic claim, not causal participation. Ornamental presence in ending.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Cobalt atrium and frozen lake anchor the scene throughout. The marble floor, glass wall, and lake's cracking sound appear in multiple beats. However, the setting does not pressure choice—the atrium welcomes her, the lake mirrors her without resistance. Micro-setting (pillar warmth, ice surface) is handled but does not alter tactics. Setup, development, and closure presence met; causal pressure absent. Strong atmospheric work but swappable locale.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"After the ban lifted" frames the opening and is referenced ("seventeen years," "during the long ban"). The timeframe enables entry but does not tighten decisions—no clock, no urgency, no tactical trade-off driven by the moment. Setup gate met; no development or payoff that hinges on timing. Functional background rather than pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The motivation "to stride through boundaries once thought sacred" is stated early and echoed at closure. However, it is declared rather than dramatized through conflicting wants or on-page cost. The poet's desire is unopposed—no friction between the want and a competing need or fear. Setup and thematic closure echo present; no middle beat where the motivation forces a choice with visible price.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Lantern-moth hush" is named explicitly and the tone of quiet, trembling fragility is maintained throughout (hum, whisper, flutter, breath). The tone modulates slightly (smile when ice cracks, dance energy) but remains within a narrow lyric register. Coherent through turns, but does not charge the final image with heightened pressure—the ending sustains rather than transforms the mood. One lyric reprise that reweights, but not indispensable.</comment>
