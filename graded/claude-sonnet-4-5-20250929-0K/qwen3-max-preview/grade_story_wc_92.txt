<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The sentinel's motives are declared (spark a revolution via geometry) but never tested by a competing impulse or cost—she descends, aligns the sundial, copies angles, and exits without friction. Interior life remains at the level of confident assertion ("she smiled... someone who knew the world was listening") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The final beat ("knowing that somewhere below... would unfold their copy—and understand") tells us success rather than dramatizing a micro-choice that forecloses an alternative. No visible price paid or path refused on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph; no penalty applied. The piece operates in Causal mode (she descends to plant coded messages, completes the task, returns to watch dawn), but no reversal or tightening occurs—the blackout conveniently clears guards' attention, no obstacle materializes, and the final image announces success without an on-page cost or decision that narrows options. Closure reads as Declared Success rather than Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with felt price. The sundial mechanics and the phrase "cradle of sparks" are named but do not constrain a choice or shift tactics mid-scene.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The luminous fort, spiral stair, courtyard, and rooftop are spatially coherent and anchored early. The blackout dims the lanterns and dulls the guards' attention, which enables the protagonist's moves but does not force a tactical pivot. The sundial plinth and bronze quill holder are handled concretely (twist, align, press, trace), and the final rooftop return reprises the opening vantage with the light "seeping" back—this reprise reweights the opening image with modest thematic charge. Environment supplies resources rather than constraints; no moment where setting blocks a path and compels adaptation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake (plant coded messages to seed revolution) is signaled early and remains consistent, but pressure never escalates—the blackout conveniently mutes the guards, no complication arises, and the protagonist's actions proceed as planned without cost or adaptation. No on-page tightening that narrows options or deepening that changes knowledge. The final paragraph asserts that "a baker, a scribe, a stablehand, would unfold their copy—and understand," but this is a told outcome rather than a turn driven by the protagonist's choice under duress. Coincidence (the blackout) enables rather than complicates.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The theme of silent revolution via symbolic geometry emerges from the sundial's coded angles and the recurring phrase "cradle of sparks," but neither motif constrains a choice or reweights prior material at closure—they function as atmospheric declarations. The final image (watching the horizon, knowing others will understand) offers a lyric grace note yet avoids a non-literal answer to the central question; it asserts thematic success rather than complicating it. No epiphany earned through friction; the protagonist's confidence remains unshaken from first line to last. Subtext in gesture and silence is minimal; the piece tells its thesis ("patience," "angles," "no bloodshed") rather than enacting irony or ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable throughout with no head-hopping. The prose carries a distinct elevated register ("winking hush," "ledger of the willing," "the cradle of sparks, gently rocked") that remains internally consistent, though the diction leans toward writerly assertion rather than character-specific perception under pressure. Filter verbs ("knew," "watched") are voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy. No dialogue on the page. The narrative certainty never wavers—no moment where the focalizer's perceptual signature narrows under stress or reveals blind spots. Psychic distance is stable but does not modulate to heighten the peak beat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and opening stems shift across paragraphs, avoiding template cadence. Minor paraphrase loop: "The revolution required patience" (¶9) restates the opening's "vigilant... humming with latent purpose" thematically without added pressure; the lines between "cradle of sparks" (¶10) and "Just the cradle of sparks, gently rocked" (¶21) recycle the phrase as a thematic refrain rather than advancing action—apply −0.2 for conceptual redundancy. Stock elevated diction in peak beats ("fingers tracing the grooves," "sharp as dagger points, gentle as lullabies," "the cradle of sparks, gently rocked") leans on poetic ornament where concrete action would sharpen momentum. Information density is moderate; many lines describe rather than advance choice. No major clarity breaks, but propulsion softens in the long middle passage (¶6–18) where the mechanics are recounted without complication.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The frame of a silent geometric revolution offers a fresh angle on insurgency, and the sundial-as-cipher is specific to this premise. However, the emotional arc and plot structure are template-safe: the protagonist conceives a plan, executes it without friction, and watches the dawn knowing success is imminent—a shape that could apply to many "meticulous operative" stories with different names and objects swapped in. The "winking hush" tone and elevated diction (cradle of sparks, ledger of the willing) read as writerly ornament rather than inevitable character voice. No bold risk in structure or perspectival choice; the piece opts for lush atmospheric description over the vulnerability of genuine complication. Transformation test: the story's emotional truth does not depend uniquely on these particulars.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The vigilant lock sentinel is present throughout and her actions (descend, align sundial, trace angles, vanish, return to rooftop) drive the sequence causally. Setup by title and opening line; middle beats show her handling the sundial and evading guards; closure beat has her watching dawn. However, no choice that narrows options or alters tactics under pressure—she executes a plan without friction. Swappability: the role could be "insurgent operative" or "rebel scribe" with minor edits; "lock sentinel" adds flavor but does not impose a constraint that another role could not. Three gates met but causal pressure and cost linkage are absent; apply +0.3 early, +0.9 two beats, −0.6 swappability, −0.5 no cost → baseline ~4.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The bronze quill holder appears in the opening beat (¶1 "fingers tracing the grooves"), middle beat (¶11 "clinking softly against her thigh"), action beat (¶16 "pressed the bronze quill holder against the sundial's edge... its weight anchor the alignment"), storage beat (¶19 "slipped [vellum] into the quill holder's hollow shaft—designed for this very purpose"), and final beat (¶23 "tucked the bronze quill holder back into her belt"). Five distinct touches across setup, middle, climax, and closure; its hollow shaft enables the message-carrying mechanic. However, its weight and grooves are described but do not constrain a choice under duress—any hollow cylinder would serve the function. Apply +0.8 early, +1.4 three+ beats, +0.5 causal enabling, +0.3 specificity (hollow shaft), −0.7 swappability (generic container suffices), −0.4 no cost tied to it → ~5.1.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"The cradle of sparks" is named in ¶10 ("whispered only in safe rooms... the moment when enough minds aligned to birth irreversible change") and reprised in ¶21 ("Just the cradle of sparks, gently rocked by the hands of the calmly inventive"). Setup present; closure mention present. However, it functions as thematic label rather than shaping stakes or tactics on the page—the protagonist's actions (align sundial, copy angles) proceed independently of this phrase. The concept does not change options or narrow a choice; it is a poetic name for the off-page consequence. Two gates (setup, closure reprise) allow eligibility to ~6.0, but absence of middle development and causal work caps at 3.4 per the missing-middle rule; add +0.3 early lyric seed, −0.8 ornamental (label-only), −0.3 summary-only → ~3.2.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Calmly inventive" is declared in ¶8 ("calmly inventive, never rushed, never reckless") and reprised in ¶21 ("the hands of the calmly inventive"). The trait is asserted as a label but not dramatized through an on-page tradeoff—her calm enables the meticulous sundial work, but no moment where being "inventive" forecloses an alternative or imposes visible cost. Setup and closure mention present; middle development weak (the months of study are summary). Two gates met allow ~6.0 eligibility, but label-only use and no dramatized cost cap lower; apply +0.3 early, +0.3 closure reprise, −0.6 label-only, −0.5 no cost → ~4.2.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Intrigue" is named as the story's action in ¶17 ("The act itself was intrigue—not theft, not sabotage, but the planting of seeds"). The entire middle sequence (align sundial, copy angles, slip vellum into quill holder, distribute copies) enacts this mode. Setup by ¶5 mission statement; middle beats show covert alignment and evasion; closure consequence (dawn, copies distributed). However, "intrigue" as written could be swapped for "covert operation," "espionage," "subversion," or "sabotage" with cosmetic edits; the specific flavor of geometric cipher-planting does not impose a constraint that another covert method could not. Three gates met; apply +0.8 early, +1.4 three+ beats, +0.5 causal (enables tactic), −0.8 swappability, −0.3 label claim → ~5.7.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The sundial and its coded angles are introduced in ¶6 ("half-painted sundial, salvaged from the abandoned observatory... gnomon still cast a shadow... coded angles—geometric ciphers"), used in the climax beats (¶13 kneel beside plinth, ¶14 coded angles reveal sequence, ¶16 trace with charcoal), and their output (vellum copies) structures the ending consequence (¶20–24). Setup, middle constraint (the angles must be aligned and traced), and closure participation all present. The method is specific (geometric cipher via gnomon shadow) and irreplaceable within the story's logic. Apply +0.8 early, +1.4 three+ beats, +1.0 causal pressure (alignment shapes the tactic), +0.8 closure linkage (copies distributed as consequence), +0.6 specificity → baseline ~4.6 + 4.6 positives = ~9.2, but swappability concern: a different encoding method (invisible ink, musical notation) could serve with modest rewrite; subtract −0.4 for partial replaceability, −0.3 summary of months' study rather than on-page discovery → ~6.3. Rounds to 6.3.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The "luminous fort at twilight" is established in the opening line and the blackout's dimming is noted in ¶3. The fort's architecture (ramparts, spiral stair, courtyard, armory, kitchens, rooftop) is spatially coherent and the dimmed lanterns enable the protagonist's covert work by dulling guards' attention. Setup and middle presence clear; closure returns to the rooftop at dawn (¶23). However, the setting supplies access rather than imposing a constraint that forces tactical adaptation—no moment where the fort's layout blocks a path and compels a choice. Apply +0.8 early, +0.9 two beats (opening, closing rooftop), +0.5 causal enabling, +0.4 closure participation (rooftop return reweights opening image), −0.6 postcard description in places (¶1 "luminous fort," ¶3 "arcane lanterns"), −0.3 no forced pivot → ~5.9.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The "unexplained blackout" is introduced in ¶3 and lifts in ¶23 ("the blackout began to lift—not with a surge of light, but with a slow, silver seep"). Setup and closure bookend present; the blackout dims the guards' attention (middle consequence) and the protagonist times her work to the bell tower clock (¶11). However, the time constraint is loose—no countdown or moment where the clock forces a choice between competing actions. The blackout enables rather than tightens; no on-page pressure where dawn's approach narrows her window with felt cost. Apply +0.8 early, +0.5 closure participation, +0.4 one beat (guard evasion), −0.5 vague tracking (no live clock that alters moves), −0.3 convenience (blackout clears obstacles rather than complicating) → ~5.4.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"To spark a silent revolution" is declared in ¶5 ("Her mission: to spark a silent revolution") and reprised in ¶9 ("The revolution required patience"). The motivation drives all middle beats (plant sundial, copy angles, distribute messages) and the final image asserts success. Setup, middle, and closure all present. However, the desire is told rather than dramatized through friction—no moment where the cost of revolution (personal danger, moral doubt, competing loyalty) complicates her choice on the page. The protagonist's confidence never wavers; no want-versus-fear tension. Apply +0.8 early, +1.4 three+ beats, +0.5 causal (shapes all tactics), +0.4 closure linkage, −1.0 told-only (no on-page conflict within the motivation), −0.3 summary → ~5.3.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Winking hush" is introduced in ¶4 ("she smiled... with the winking hush of someone who knew the world was listening") and the tone of covert confidence persists throughout. The elevated, slightly arch diction ("luminous fort," "cradle of sparks," "ledger of the willing") maintains a consistent lyric register. However, the tone does not modulate under pressure—no moment where urgency or doubt shifts the narrative texture. The final image (watching dawn, knowing success) sustains the opening's assured mood without charging it with new cost. Setup present, middle coherence maintained, closure reprise weak (no tonal shift that reweights the opening). Apply +0.8 early, +0.4 one beat (coherence), +0.3 closure presence, −0.6 static (no modulation), −0.3 ornamental (mood as flavor rather than pressure) → ~4.6.</comment>
