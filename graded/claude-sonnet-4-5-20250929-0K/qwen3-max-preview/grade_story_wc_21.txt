<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The archivist remains a vessel for thematic statements rather than a character with contradictory impulses acting in scene. Interiority relies heavily on abstract claim ("it wasn't meant for machines, but for souls retrocognitively trapped") and therapy-inflected self-awareness ("she knew then she was retrocognitively trapped—not as punishment, but as witness"). The final "choice" to become archive is declared rather than earned through on-page friction between competing wants. Embodied emotion is sparse; most beats summarize her actions in elevated diction without visceral cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density of imagery around lagoon/debris/diary accumulates toward the final wading scene. Orientation anchors arrive (zeppelin, lagoon, archivist) but remain abstract; "floating library," "obsidian lagoon," "saltbox beneath dunes" function as lyric gestures more than grounded space. The closure image—archivist waist-deep, arms outstretched, humming—offers Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), but cost is asserted in elevated language ("unbearable, searing reverie") rather than demonstrated through a forfeited option or visible price. One meaningful deepening occurs (arranging debris → lagoon glow → becoming archive), sufficient for this length under an Accumulative lens, but the final cost remains conceptual and diffuse.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Vivid images (obsidian lagoon, saltbox, brass rivets, kelp braided into chains) are plentiful but function as lyric ornament rather than constraints. The zeppelin and lagoon remain postcard backdrops; no choice is altered by access, proximity, or physical property of these spaces. Spatial choreography is vague (rope-ladder descent, "waist-deep," beach arrangements) without clear distances or body mechanics. The Orientation Test is marginal but not penalized because the piece teaches its lyric mode early; however, the lack of concrete grounding prevents the setting from charging the closure choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—uncover truth via parley with the lagoon—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful deepening: arranging debris → lagoon responds with light → archivist becomes living archive. However, escalation is textural (density increase) rather than a narrowing of options or a visible trade-off; the archivist's agency reads as ritual performance without on-page friction or cost that forecloses a path. No antagonist or obstacle applies counter-pressure; the lagoon simply "responds" when she arranges debris correctly, bypassing struggle. Under the Accumulative lens, one tightening is sufficient, but the absence of legible price at the ending (she "sleeps little" is told, not shown as a forfeited concrete option) keeps this in mid-band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Theme—memory, witness, reckoning with historical erasure—emerges from recurring images (lagoon glow, debris messages, encrypted diary). The piece resists overt thesis until the final paragraph, where "truth thrives in tension" becomes explicit and borders on meta-commentary. The ending line "Arrange us. Remember us. Free us." offers a resonant whisper, but the overall design leans heavily on elevated abstraction ("electric space between what was recorded and what was remembered") rather than earning insight through on-page particulars. The archivist's transformation into "living ledger" is asserted more than felt. No thematic echo penalty applies because the claim arises in narration, not dialogue, yet the proximity to sermonizing in the penultimate paragraph lowers the score.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Third-person close, but psychic distance drifts into omniscient summary ("She knew then," "She learned," "Truth, she learned") that tells rather than dramatizes realization. Register is uniformly elevated and poetic; under peak pressure (kneeling as faces appear, final wading scene) the diction remains literary and distanced ("tears carving paths through the salt") rather than compressing or fracturing. No dialogue on the page. Perceptual signature is generic (archives, textbooks, protestors) without character-specific idiom. The voice is confident and lyrical but lacks modulation or embodied roughness that would anchor the narrator's lived interiority.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Density is high but compromised by pervasive overwriting: stacked metaphors ("veil to press its palm," "throat refusing testimony," "body's unspoken archive"), elevated diction throughout ("retrocognitively," "phosphorescent pulses," "liturgy"), and repetitive syntactic stems ("She stopped trying…instead, she wove"; "She never claimed…She claimed"). Template cadence and filter-verb stacks ("she understood," "she knew," "she learned," "she realized") dull immediacy in peak beats. Paraphrase loops appear: diary pulsing with grief is restated multiple times; truth-in-tension is revisited in three paragraphs. The final third is saturated with abstract claim rather than concrete propulsion, triggering the artifact penalty and disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Floating library on a zeppelin and obsidian lagoon are striking images; parley-via-debris-arrangement offers a non-obvious method. However, the emotional arc (archivist seeks truth → receives revelation → becomes witness) follows a template progression without fresh friction. The encrypted diary as tactile relic and the lagoon's phosphorescent reply are vivid, but the piece does not transform the familiar "witness to history" frame through lived complication or moral calculus. Specificity is uneven: kelp chains and crab shells are concrete, but the "massacres the state had buried" remain abstract placeholders. Risk-taking in structure (accumulative, lyric) is present but does not heighten stakes; the design serves atmosphere more than dramatic pressure.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Archivist is present throughout and makes choices (descend, arrange debris, weave oral tapestries), but these are ritual actions without on-page friction or trade-offs. She does not alter tactics when debris is "gnawed" by tide; she "rebuilds them" in summary. The decision to "stop trying to transcribe" is told, not dramatized. Present in closure (wading, humming) but her agency there is passive witness rather than decisive choice. Two gates met (setup, closure cameo); no middle development with cost. Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure presence +0.4, but swappability −0.6, summary-only middle −0.5, ornamental late use −0.4.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lagoon appears in opening image, middle (responds with light), and closure (archivist wades, it glows on anniversaries). Three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.0, early signal +0.6, causal pressure (responds to debris arrangement, releases faces) +0.8. However, the lagoon's mechanics are asserted rather than discovered through trial; it "remained mute" once, then "responded" when arrangement was correct, bypassing struggle. Specificity is high (obsidian, phosphorescent glow, subaquatic faces) +0.5. Swappability moderate (another body of water could function similarly with minor edits) −0.5. Cost connection is conceptual (grief, witness) rather than a forfeited resource −0.3.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Diary is introduced early (bound in copper, resists algorithms, pulses with grief) and shapes the archivist's goal. Present in middle (final page materializes as sensation) and implied at closure (humming "diary's last decrypted line"). Three gates met. Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.8, causal pressure (drives her to lagoon) +0.7. However, the diary's encryption and decryption are told rather than shown; the reader never sees the archivist struggle with ciphertext or test a failed method. The "retrocognitive trap" mechanic is asserted, not enacted. Summary-only middle −0.6, swappability (any encrypted artifact could serve) −0.6, ornamental use (much of its presence is thematic claim) −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>"Retrocognitively trapped" is claimed twice as a label ("souls retrocognitively trapped in loops," "she knew then she was retrocognitively trapped") but never constrains an on-page action or imposes visible cost. No mechanics are demonstrated; the phrase functions as atmosphere. Label-only −0.8, no middle development −0.6, no cost connection −0.6, late explicit mention (final third) −0.4. Present in theme only; does not shape a single choice or tactic.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Parley is the stated method ("truth here demanded parley") and drives the archivist's turn to debris arrangement and eventual descent. Two beats: understanding parley is needed, enacting it via arrangement. Present at closure (she "stands waist-deep," embodying ongoing parley). Three gates met. Early signal +0.7, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, causal pressure (shifts her from algorithm to ritual) +0.9. However, parley's mechanics are vague; the story tells us it is "not with the dead, but with the land" without showing failed attempts at other forms of negotiation. Swappability moderate (communion, offering, witness could substitute) −0.6, summary-only enactment −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Debris arrangement is described in one extended beat (bottles spelling SORRY, driftwood ASK, kelp chains, crab shells) and implied to recur ("she rebuilt them"). Present at closure as past action that enabled the lagoon's response. Two gates (middle, closure). Middle development +0.9, closure linkage +0.7, causal pressure (arranging debris triggers lagoon glow) +1.0, specificity (SORRY, ASK, kelp, shells) +0.6. However, the method is told in summary list rather than shown attempt-by-attempt with failure. The reader does not see her test one arrangement, fail, adjust. Summary-only −0.7, swappability (other symbolic acts could trigger response) −0.5, late full detail (40% mark) −0.3.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Zeppelin library is the opening anchor and recurs (crew at portholes, shelves swaying, gondola lined with sand). Present in three beats. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure presence (shadow rippling over lagoon) +0.5. However, the library functions as atmospheric backdrop; no choice is constrained by its altitude, fuel, or access. The archivist descends by rope-ladder, but the zeppelin does not limit her movement or impose resource cost. Postcard use −0.8, swappability (any remote archive location could serve) −0.7, no causal pressure −0.6.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"After the letters are found" appears as a time marker in one sentence but does not structure the narrative. The story is set in the aftermath of discovery, but no clock tightens decisions; the archivist works "decades," descends "one night," and the lagoon glows "on anniversaries" without specific temporal pressure. Present as frame but does not shape tactics. Setup only; no middle or closure linkage. Early mention +0.4, but vague and untracked time −0.7, no pressure from deadline or duration −0.8, swappable with "after discovery" or "during study" −0.6.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Archivist's motivation—uncover truth in tension between record and memory—is stated explicitly early ("her motivation wasn't academic glory…it was to uncover truth in tension"). Drives her shift to parley and debris arrangement. Present at closure in the penultimate paragraph ("truth thrives in tension"). Three gates met. Early signal +0.7, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.9, causal pressure (shapes her method choice) +0.7. However, motivation is told more than dramatized; the reader is informed of her drive rather than seeing it tested by a competing want or cost. The "electric space between" is repeated in similar phrasing. Told-only −0.7, thematic echo (final paragraph claim) −0.4, no on-page friction between want and cost −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Tone is consistently elevated, poetic, and solemn; "searing reverie" reads in the cadence and imagery (veil pressing palm, phosphorescent pulses, unbearable weight). Modulates slightly at the lagoon-response beat (intensity rises) and sustains through the final wading scene. Present throughout; charges the final image. Early establishment +0.7, coherent modulation +0.6, closure charge +0.9. However, tone is uniformly high-register without roughness or compression under peak pressure; "searing" is asserted in the penultimate paragraph rather than enacted through sentence rhythm or embodied cost. Static mood (lyric solemnity throughout) −0.5, register drift into abstract claim at closure −0.4, label-only "searing reverie" in final third −0.3.</comment>
