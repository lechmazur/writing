<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's emotional void is embodied through concrete actions—whittling to erode, burning pamphlets, narrating flatly—rather than labeled. Internal contradiction appears in the performance of grief while "feeling nothing at all," and the compliance visit forces a meaningful choice that forecloses authenticity with visible cost. However, the interiority occasionally drifts toward diagnostic phrasing ("morally ambiguous, perhaps, to perform grief as spectacle") and the character's flaws don't genuinely complicate the final choice; compliance feels pre-determined rather than earned through struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a pattern of erosion and hollow compliance early, sustains it through whittling/narrating beats, and lands closure when the protagonist seals the bouquet in the box, receives certification, and returns to whittling—a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) where endurance forecloses authentic mourning with visible cost. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly in the opening paragraph. One meaningful deepening occurs when the Compliance officers arrive and the protagonist must perform sanctioned grief, tightening the pressure between survival and authenticity, which pays off in the final image of "whittling absence into artifact."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The farmhouse, turbines, and dried bouquet create a coherent micro-setting. The turbines' "remade hush" and their brief stalls provide sensory anchors filtered through the protagonist's priorities. The whittling block and bouquet constrain the protagonist's choices—sealing the flowers enables compliance, and the turbines' pause allows the whispered "I miss you." Spatial choreography (porch, stove, Compliance Station, return to porch) tracks clearly across moves.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—surviving mandated happiness without losing grief—is signaled early and escalates when Compliance Officers arrive, forcing the protagonist to craft a compliant artifact. The sealing of the bouquet and the Station visit constitute a meaningful tightening that forecloses authentic mourning with visible cost: the protagonist earns a certificate but must continue hollow performance. Agency is renunciation with on-page cost; the whispered "I miss you" in true silence and the return to whittling demonstrate Earned Stasis under accumulative pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—grief as survival performance under authoritarian cheerfulness—emerges through whittling, narration, and the bouquet's transformation rather than thesis statements. The final image (whittling a new hollow, the turbines resuming) offers a resonant answer without moralizing: compliance is armor, not healing. The protagonist's arc is inextricable from the thematic question, and the piece resists tidy resolution. Minor slip: "morally ambiguous, emotionally void, cultivating lightness" in the penultimate section edges toward articulating the story's premise in prompt-like language, triggering a small thematic-echo penalty.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature (flat narration, erosion metaphors, whittling focus). The protagonist's self-narration ("Now, the knife meets grain. Resistance is minimal.") is voice-motivated and consistent. Dialogue with the Compliance Officers is goal-driven and carries subtext (the jargon deflection). However, a few lines drift toward elevated register that clashes with the focalizer's lexicon: "morally ambiguous, perhaps" and "recursive patterns" feel authorial rather than character-native, causing minor register friction in peak beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully, and most sentences advance character or atmosphere. However, several paraphrase loops appear: the whittling-as-erosion motif is restated across multiple paragraphs without added pressure (opening, mid-story, and final beats recycle "whittling to erode" / "narrating emptiness" / "hollow craft" phrasing). Template cadence: "They'd offered tea, smiled without muscle, and lied" / "They burned the pamphlets... feeding the flames" / "They knew... So they prepared" runs of identical stems appear in the middle third. The figurative density ("ghosts," "sentinels," "counter-rhythm," "armor") is high but mostly coherent; one mixed metaphor: "shavings curling like ghosts" then later "every shaving" treated as physical remnant without acknowledging the ghost simile's contradiction.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of grief-performance, whittling-as-erosion, and compliance theater feels specific and non-obvious. The dried bouquet sealed in a carved box with "Permitted" is a fresh inflection on mandated happiness tropes. The protagonist's flat self-narration and the turbines' "remade hush" create a memorable texture. However, the Happiness Decree / Compliance Officer framework echoes widely used dystopian templates (emotion policing, mandatory joy) without transforming it through lived occupational or regional detail; the farmhouse and turbines remain generic "rural refuge" rather than particular place.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The blank-faced performer's decisions create two key turns: burning the pamphlets/marigolds (middle beat) and sealing the bouquet to present at the Compliance Station (closure beat). Both choices alter tactics and options. Early signal present (opening paragraph). Causal pressure: the performer's choice to craft compliant grief enables survival but forecloses authenticity. Closure linkage strong: the return to whittling a new hollow is the final image. Cost visible: "lighter, emptier, perfectly compliant." Swappability low; the blank-faced performance and narration are irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The dried bouquet appears in the opening paragraph, is burned piecemeal in the stove (middle beat), sealed in the carved box, scanned at the Station, and its ghost lingers in the final image. Three distinct beats plus closure reprise. Causal pressure: sealing the bouquet enables compliance certification. Closure linkage: "The dried bouquet was gone, but its ghost lingered in every shaving." Cost connection: its transformation from tribute to compliance artifact is the story's central sacrifice. Swappability very low.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The "remade hush" is signaled early (turbines' "engineered quiet") and the turbines' pause/resume cycle brackets the protagonist's whispered confession and final image. The concept shapes stakes (grief must be silent) and tactics (the protagonist performs compliance to survive the hush). However, it functions more as atmospheric constraint than a pressure that changes on-page options; the hush is consistent rather than escalating. Closure participation: the turbines resume in the final line, reweighting the cycle as ongoing.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Morally ambiguous" is directly labeled in the text ("morally ambiguous, perhaps, to perform grief as spectacle while feeling nothing at all") rather than demonstrated through choice. The trait is stated rather than constrained: no on-page moment where the protagonist must choose between competing goods or harms with visible moral cost. The compliance performance could read as survival pragmatism without moral ambiguity; the piece doesn't dramatize an ethical calculus that tests the label. Label-only mention penalty applied.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Whittling is present in the opening, middle (creating the hollow), and final image (whittling a new block). Three distinct beats. Causal pressure: the carved hollow enables the bouquet's sealing, which enables compliance certification. Closure linkage: the return to whittling defines Earned Stasis. Cost connection: whittling-as-erosion becomes the protagonist's survival mode. Irreplaceable: the story's logic hinges on carving a container for the bouquet; no near-synonym action would work. Swappability very low.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dramatically narrating mundane tasks is signaled early ("Now, the knife meets grain. Resistance is minimal."), recurs in the nighttime whittling beat ("The blade angles left. The edge catches."), and frames the final image ("Today's task: hollowing."). Three beats. Causal pressure: the narration is the protagonist's "theater for no audience," a ritual to anchor in the hollow; it also provides the jargon deflection to Compliance Officers. Closure linkage: the final narration restarts the cycle. Cost connection: the method is survival armor, not healing.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The farmhouse and turbines are present in the opening paragraph (setup). The turbines' shadow and pause provide the setting for the whispered confession (middle beat). The turbines resume in the final line (closure). Two beats plus closure participation. Causal pressure: the turbines' pause creates "true silence," enabling the protagonist's only authentic utterance. However, the farmhouse itself is generic (dust, damp insulation, rattling windows) and does not constrain choices; only the turbines' cycle affects tactics. Spatial choreography is clear (porch, stove, Station, return).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The Happiness Decree and "after" framing are established early, and the 47-day upload gap creates urgency for the Compliance visit. However, the timeframe functions as backdrop rather than live pressure; no ticking clock alters the protagonist's tactics across beats. The "three weeks prior" anchor and "next morning" / "that evening" transitions track time but do not tighten decisions. The timeframe is present and consistent but passive. Missing middle development: time does not constrain a choice between the opening and closure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The motivation "to cultivate lightness in grief" is signaled early (the protagonist flees the city's enforced joy) and conflicted: the protagonist cannot feel grief but performs it, and the Compliance Officers force a test of this motivation (middle beat). Closure linkage: the protagonist's final narration and return to whittling demonstrate that "cultivating lightness" means hollow compliance, not healing. Friction between wants (survival) and costs (authenticity) is visible. However, the motivation is partly told ("cultivating lightness in grief, per subsection 7-D") rather than fully dramatized through contradictory impulses in scene.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Emotional void is coherent from the opening ("blank-faced," "whittling... into nothing recognizable," "voice flat as parchment") through the middle ("smiled without muscle") to the final image ("lighter, emptier, perfectly compliant"). The tone modulates subtly: the turbines' pause allows a momentary crack ("I miss you"), then the void resumes. Closure charge: the tone of hollow performance defines the ending's meaning and cost. The void is not static; it deepens under pressure, shifting from refuge to armor.</comment>
