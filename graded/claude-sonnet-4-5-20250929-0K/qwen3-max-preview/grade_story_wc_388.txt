<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation is stated rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. Interior life relies heavily on label-speak ("thrill of near-discovery," "smiled, not in triumph, but in sorrow") and abstract assertions about her mission rather than embodied tension. The walking-and-thinking structure creates a passive frame where discoveries happen *to* her rather than through resistant choices. No meaningful cost or foreclosed path is visible; she simply continues walking with new coordinates.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed—who she is and why she's here emerge slowly through exposition rather than anchored action, triggering the Q2 −0.4 penalty and Q3 cap at 7.0. The closure is a continuation (she walks on with new coordinates) rather than a Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with visible cost; no option is foreclosed, no price paid on the page. The causal chain is a discovery-and-continue loop rather than escalating pressure. The "reassembling shredded letters" backstory is told in summary, not dramatized, weakening the causal spine.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details ("peach blossoms glowed faintly," "gamma winds," "roots humming the frequency") establish atmosphere, but the orchard does not constrain a choice or charge the final image—she plants the diamond, watches the dust clear, then leaves. The wasteland is described more than inhabited; no spatial problem blocks her or alters tactics. The plaque discovery feels convenient rather than earned by spatial pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The dominant stake—excavating truth—is declared but never tested by a meaningful reversal or cost. She finds what she seeks (the plaque, the coordinates) without forfeiting anything or facing a live choice between competing goods. The diamond's "curse" dissolves into backstory explanation rather than creating present tension. No tightening occurs; each discovery simply leads to the next step in a pre-determined itinerary.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Theme is stated overtly ("Truth is not found. It is dug," "comfortable lies," "reassembled truth") rather than emerging from image and choice. The final paragraph moralizes directly: "Let them call her cursed... She would keep digging... Truth didn't hide. It rooted." The diamond and orchard as symbols feel imposed rather than organically charged by the protagonist's struggle. No thematic question is dramatized as a dilemma with competing moral weight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Voice carries a consistent poetic register with strong imagery and rhythm. However, diction occasionally elevates beyond plausible focalization ("transmuting radiation into nourishment," "ambient decay"), and the narration treats backstory discoveries (Project Stillpoint, the cover story) with certainty the protagonist couldn't possess without lengthy analysis. The perceptual signature is observant but generic; no character-specific bias shapes what she notices or ignores.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "reassembling shredded letters" appears three times with near-identical phrasing; "sharply observant" is recycled; "stillpoint" echoes across multiple lines without functional variance. Template cadence runs through the piece ("She [verb], [gerund]... She [verb], [gerund]..."). Stock metaphors ("truth became a ghost," "diamond... beat like a second heart") and filter-verb stacks ("watching as," "intuiting patterns," "cross-referencing them") dull immediacy. These artifacts touch the closure paragraph, triggering the −1.7 penalty and disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The conspiracy-debunker-in-wasteland premise combines familiar post-apocalyptic and truth-seeker tropes without a fresh synthesis. The "cursed object is actually science" reveal and "hidden network of sanctuaries" follow well-worn paths. The walking-monologue structure and discovery-without-cost arc read as template execution. No bold risk or non-obvious angle elevates the material; emotional specificity is replaced by abstract mission statements.</comment>
