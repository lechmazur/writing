<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's interiority is heavily reflective, with long passages explaining pacifism, resentment, and cellular memory rather than showing contradictory impulses acting in scene. The turn at the end—melody migrating inward, shoulders dropping—reads as asserted rather than earned through prior micro-choices under pressure. Embodiment is present ("clenched jaw from childhood, stiff shoulders from betrayal") but the cataloging feels diagnostic rather than lived. The final choice to leave the box and walk into mist lacks visible cost or foreclosed options.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive late: the "scheming pacifist" label and "soundless sanctuary" are named early, but no concrete spatial or temporal grounding emerges until well past 120 words; the "while reality shifts" frame remains abstract throughout. The closure unit—humming melody internalized, box left on moss—reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (specifically Charged Poise), but the cost is asserted ("Its purpose had shifted") rather than shown through a forfeited path or altered tactic. The piece operates in Accumulative/Textural mode (density increase, pattern break) but the final image does not reweight prior material with undeniable pressure; the "ghost of a chime" and walk into mist feel more like thematic echo than closure with felt consequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The "soundless sanctuary" and shifting walls (stone/glass/nothing) provide atmosphere but do not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters the outcome. The music box is handled in multiple beats (thumb over jagged tooth, pressed to sternum, placed on moss) and the moss floor appears at the end, but these remain descriptive rather than tactical. Spatial choreography is vague—no sense of room size, distance, or layout that would pressure movement.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—restoring the music box's function to trigger resentment release—is signaled early and present at closure, but pressure does not escalate through a reversal or tightening choice. The protagonist kneels, reflects, imagines the pin as pivot, and the melody simply "migrates" inward without a decision or tradeoff that narrows options. No meaningful cost is legible: she walks away humming, with no path foreclosed or price paid on the page. The "cellular memory" method and shifting reality remain atmospheric rather than sources of tactical friction.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The theme—resentment released through bodily memory rather than argument—emerges clearly, but the final paragraph ("Its purpose had shifted," "those who needed it would always find it") states the thesis rather than showing it through a resonant image. The music box recurs and shifts meaning, but the ending leans on meta-commentary ("she would teach them to listen not with ears, but with sinew") that replaces scene pressure. Epiphanies are asserted ("this was the lesson") rather than earned through struggle.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with a distinct, elevated diction ("scheming pacifist," "cathedral of instability," "marrow") that remains consistent under pressure. The voice is purposeful but occasionally drifts into therapeutic register ("cellular memory, the body's quiet archive," "re-membering—putting the self back together") that feels authorial rather than character-particular. No dialogue present to evaluate. Psychic distance is controlled, though the narration sometimes tells what the protagonist "knew" without showing the realization.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "Not peace. / Not rest. / Just absence" mirrors the pattern elsewhere; "Not from the box. / From within." and similar constructions recur without cumulative effect. Template cadence runs appear ("She had tried meditation, mantras, therapists, herbs, fasting, running, screaming into pillows"). The final third contains heavy scaffold: "This was the lesson," "Now it was a relic of surrender," and "It reappeared when needed—not because it was enchanted, but because..." that explain rather than show. Figurative language is dense but occasionally strained ("ink bleeding into water" is clear; "cathedral of instability" is abstract). Combined artifacts and loops in closure beats trigger −1.2 in Q7 and disallow 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The premise—pacifist protagonist internalizes a broken music box's melody to release resentment—offers a lyric angle, but the execution relies on familiar therapeutic language ("cellular memory," "re-membering") without transformation through specific lived detail. The sanctuary, shifting reality, and "soundless" constraint remain abstract gestures. The turn (melody migrating inward) is legible but feels conceptually complete rather than earned through friction or specificity that would make it irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The "scheming pacifist" label is present throughout but no on-page scheme or decision alters tactics. Reflection dominates; the protagonist's choice to walk away occurs after the melody has already migrated inward without her agency driving the shift.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The broken music box pin appears in at least three beats: thumb over jagged tooth, pressed to sternum, placed on moss at the end. It shapes the central problem (melody silenced) and the final image (left as "relic of surrender"), but the resolution—melody migrating inward—bypasses the object rather than being enabled by it. Setup and closure gates met; middle development is weak because the pin does not constrain a choice, only symbolizes one.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Shifting grace" is named once ("That was shifting grace: not fleeing change, but flowing with it") and echoed thematically in the shifting sanctuary walls, but it does not alter tactics or options on the page. The concept is told rather than enacted through a specific choice or tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Reappears when needed" is claimed twice in the final section ("It reappears when needed," "those who needed it would always find it") but never demonstrated on the page. No beat shows the pin or box reappearing to enable an action; the attribute is asserted as thematic commentary rather than dramatized with cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Convince" is named in the opening ("She had come here not to fight, not to flee, but to convince") and referenced ("To convince not with logic, but with limb"), but no on-page beat shows the protagonist convincing anyone. The action remains an intention rather than a dramatized event with resistance or cost.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>"Cellular memory" is named and explained ("the body's quiet archive of every wound, sigh, and surrender") and invoked when the protagonist maps her stored fury, but the mechanism does not shape an attempt or create friction. It appears as explanation rather than enacted method with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The "soundless sanctuary" is present throughout and the shifting walls (stone/glass/nothing, dissolving into mist) provide atmosphere. The setting does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome, but the final image—moss floor, box placed there—participates in closure. Setup and payoff gates met; middle development absent.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"While reality shifts" is signaled early and present throughout (walls flickering, edges dissolving), but the timeframe does not tighten decisions or create urgency. The shifts remain descriptive backdrop rather than a live clock that alters tactics or forces a choice.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"To teach resentment to release" is stated explicitly in the final section and implied earlier ("the song had been engineered...to trigger release"), driving the search for melody restoration. The motivation is told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants or costs, and the resolution (melody migrates inward, protagonist will teach others) is asserted without on-page friction.</comment>
