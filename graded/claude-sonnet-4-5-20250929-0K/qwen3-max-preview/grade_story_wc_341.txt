<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The meteorologist's interiority is concrete and voice-particular, with embodied grief ("not in shouts or shattered glass, but in the way she'd stare at an empty chair and feel the air crackle"). Internal contradiction operates throughout—"quietly explosive" as self-description, pressure held beneath surface—and the final smile emerges with visible cost ("not because the pain was gone, but because she'd proven"). The backstory of the broken violin string anchors present micro-choices (each cloud classification, the act of memorializing), though the piece leans heavily reflective; the spooled-wholeness method and the ledger entries function as micro-choices that tilt present stance. Minor slip: some interiority edges toward articulate self-diagnosis ("That was the hypothesis she staked her sanity on"), though it remains within the character's analytical lens.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors meteorologist, gondola, post-string-break timeframe by the opening paragraph. The piece accumulates density through cloud classifications that reweight the dominant stake (proving empty spaces remember), culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis meets Charged Poise): she memorializes Altocumulus #112 as "release," smiles with visible cost, and the final image ("watching her categorize not just clouds, but courage") reconfigures the premise with felt pressure. One meaningful deepening occurs when she moves from observation to active memorialization with the acceptance that "empty spaces remember." Cost is legible in the smile that acknowledges ongoing pain and the devotion required to sustain the method. The lens holds without contradiction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The brass telescope (salvaged, polished, warming in her hands) and the gondola (wicker floor, fraying cables, creaking suspension) constrain choices and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and voice-filtered: "starlight that clung like powdered memory," "ozone and awe," telescope eyepiece fogging with breath. The sky-as-micro-setting functions as both literal environment and emotional landscape, with cloud classifications (Stratocumulus #47 as "resigned acceptance") shaped by the protagonist's professional and grief-driven priorities. Spatial choreography is clean throughout. The recurring objects (telescope, ledger, gondola cables) evolve across beats and anchor the closure moment.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early: prove that empty spaces remember. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure deepens through repeated acts of categorization, each cloud entry a memorial that reweights the central question. One meaningful tightening: the shift from observing Altocumulus #112 ("quietly explosive") to memorializing its dissolution, which crystallizes her method and closes with visible cost (the smile that acknowledges ongoing grief). Agency is attention and memorialization—endurance that forecloses retreat into silence. The gondola's fraying cables and her deliberate focus function as persistent constraints. No explicit antagonist required; the situational pressure (absence, silence, need for proof) coheres throughout.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: the broken violin string, cloud classifications as epitaphs, spooled wholeness as gathering fragments. The piece asks whether emptiness is void or vessel and answers through the meteorologist's method—she proves remembrance not by declaration but by sustained, costly attention. The final image ("categorize not just clouds, but courage") offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in the warm telescope, the fraying gondola cables (stubborn hope), and the smile that accepts rather than erases pain. "Spooled wholeness" integrates organically with the narrative's accumulative design. Minor slip: "That was the hypothesis she staked her sanity on" edges close to articulating theme, though it remains within the analytical POV.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with psychic closeness; perceptual signature is distinct (clouds read as emotions, technical observation filtered through grief). Diction remains within the meteorologist's plausible lexicon—aviation terms, emotional cataloging, poetic precision. Purposeful compression and lyric patterning are taught early and sustained ("cumulus as grief, cirrus as longing"). No dialogue; all pressure runs through interior and action. Filter verbs ("she believed," "she knew") appear but fit the reflective, analytical voice. The piece maintains narrative distance and voice texture under emotional pressure, with rhythm modulating appropriately (short declaratives during classification, longer cadences during reflection). Focalization is clean; no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully, sentence openings shift, and information density is generally high. The opening anchors voice and stakes cleanly. However, scattered text artifacts lower the score: paraphrase loops ("Each entry was a memorial, a whispered epitaph" followed shortly by "Each cloud she categorized was a memorial"), template cadence in some ledger-entry beats, and stacked metaphorical constructions that occasionally blur rather than sharpen ("starlight that clung like powdered memory" works, but the density of figurative language in some paragraphs—frayed thread, wicker floor dusted with starlight, vapor's shadow, cloud's tremor—approaches saturation without always serving pressure). "Quietly explosive" repeats as both self-description and cloud label, which functions thematically but edges toward synonym churn. No loops touch the closure beat directly, capping deduction at −0.8 per the Non-closure Accumulation Cap. Grammar and sequence clarity are clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of meteorology, grief, and embodied memorialization through cloud classification offers a fresh angle. "Spooled wholeness" as concept and method feels specific to this voice and premise. The gondola setting and brass telescope avoid generic "anywhere" design. Emotional specificity (the violin string snapping mid-concerto, the smell of pine and unfinished conversations) anchors the universal in lived detail. Risk-taking in structure (heavy reflection, accumulative design) succeeds without obscuring clarity. Minor proximity concern: the lyric-inflected grief memoir and sky-as-emotional-landscape combination, while executed well here, echoes a familiar contemporary short-fiction mode. The transformation test passes—plot and arc would not work unchanged with different setting or method. No close echoes of famous lines detected.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Present in opening paragraph; drives categorization beats (Stratocumulus #47, Altocumulus #89, Altocumulus #112); role shapes the ledger method and telescope use. Choices (to categorize, to memorialize, to accept dissolution) create small turns and charge the ending. Not deeply irreplaceable—a different observer role could function—but the aviation-meteorology lens colors perception and justifies the technical precision. Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.8, some causal pressure +0.6, moderate swappability −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Introduced in opening paragraph (salvaged from grandfather's attic, polished with devotion); used in observation beats (adjusting aperture, focusing on Altocumulus #112); returns warm in her hands near closure, cradled "like a relic, like a promise." The telescope constrains perception (catches vapor and tremor) and charges the final image. Properties matter: brass warming, specific adjustments, tactile devotion. Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.2, causal pressure +0.8, specificity +0.6, minor swappability (any telescope could serve observation) −0.4.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Introduced early as "spooled wholeness—the act of gathering fragments of sky, of feeling, and winding them tight into something that didn't unravel." Shapes the method (categorization as binding) and appears in the penultimate paragraph to summarize the approach. Functions thematically and explains the ledger practice, but does not create a distinct beat or narrow options in a way a different metaphor couldn't. Early signal +0.5, thematic linkage +0.4, closure proximity +0.5, limited causal pressure +0.3, high swappability −0.6.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Applied to Altocumulus #89 ("thin and trembling, she labeled 'quietly explosive'—a contradiction that made sense only to her") and then mirrored as self-description ("That was her, too. Quietly explosive"). The trait appears in two beats and charges interiority with a visible tradeoff (pressure held beneath surface versus shouts or shattered glass). Not deeply causal—it describes rather than enables action—but it colors perception and links character to cloud. Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, some cost connection +0.4, label-heavy use −0.4, moderate swappability −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>First signaled in paragraph 4 ("Each entry was a memorial"), actualized in ledger entries (Cumulonimbus #12, Altocumulus #112), and drives the closure beat (memorializing the cloud's dissolution, proving the hypothesis). The act of memorializing defines the protagonist's method and produces the visible cost at the end (she smiles because she's proven empty spaces remember). Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.4, causal pressure +1.0, cost connection +0.5, moderate irreplaceability (another recording method could function) −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Introduced paragraph 4 ("memorized the clouds not by type or altitude, but by emotion—cumulus as grief, cirrus as longing, nimbostratus as regret"); demonstrated in Stratocumulus #47 (resigned acceptance), Altocumulus #89 (quietly explosive), Cumulonimbus #12 (furious love), Altocumulus #112 (release). The method shapes every observation beat and underwrites the closure proof. Mechanics matter: emotion-labels guide ledger entries and reweight the sky as vessel. Early signal +0.7, four beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.2, causal pressure +1.0, moderate irreplaceability (a different taxonomic lens could serve) −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Introduced opening line (swaying above valley, brass telescope adjusted); recurs with wicker floor, fraying cables, creaking suspension. The gondola's height and isolation supply the micro-setting for observation and memorialization; fraying cables function as constraint ("tethered by fraying cables and stubborn hope"). Physical properties (swaying, suspended between earth and heaven) charge the closure image. Early signal +0.8, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +0.9, some causal pressure +0.5, moderate irreplaceability (another elevated platform could function) −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Signaled paragraph 2 ("not since the string broke"), detailed in the backstory beat (violin string snapping mid-concerto, silencing the duet), and frames the entire present action (she climbed into the sky "After that, silence became her atmosphere"). The timeframe is more epochal than tactical—it defines the before/after but does not create urgency or tighten decisions within the gondola scene. Early signal +0.6, backstory linkage +0.5, some thematic pressure +0.4, no live clock or narrowing tactics −0.6, high abstraction −0.4.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stated early ("to prove that empty spaces remember, even when the world insists they've forgotten"), drives the categorization method, tested in each ledger entry, and paid off in the closure smile ("she'd proven, if only to herself, that empty spaces remember"). Desire is dramatized through repeated acts of observation and memorialization; friction between the hypothesis and the world's insistence creates cost (isolation, colleagues' dismissal, sustained grief). Early signal +0.8, multiple beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.3, causal pressure +1.0, cost connection +0.5, slightly abstract framing −0.3.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Introduced in closing paragraph ("the stars blinked through the retreating vapor, dusty and eternal") and seeded earlier with "wicker floor dusted with starlight that clung like powdered memory." The tone—melancholic, lyric, suspended, faintly luminous—coheres through turns and modulates with pressure (clinical observation softens to acceptance). "Dusty starlight" charges the final image by linking ephemeral beauty with memorial persistence. Lyric reprise +0.8, tone modulation +0.6, closure linkage +1.0, thematic fit +0.7, late first full appearance −0.5, slightly ornamental phrasing −0.4.</comment>
