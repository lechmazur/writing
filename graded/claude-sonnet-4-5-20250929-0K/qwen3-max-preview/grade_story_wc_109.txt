<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The oracle exists as an abstraction—"mildly obsessed" with "architecture of absence"—but never faces a choice under pressure that embodies those labels. Interiority is purely decorative ("hollows between them, the spaces where meaning collapsed") without contradiction or micro-decision. The final descent is declared, not earned by any on-page struggle or visible cost that forecloses a path. No relationship or secondary pressure tests the character; she moves through a solitary meditation unimpeded.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; the piece attempts closure via density and recurrence. However, the ending offers no decisive change, no visible cost, and no clear reweighting—only a tonal assertion ("marbled hush: striated, calm") that the oracle "vanished into the night she had drawn." Orientation is present early (oracle, ridge fort, storm). Causality is absent: the oracle's actions (tracing pages, whispering summaries) never narrow options or alter her situation; she simply walks away at the end without dramatized consequence or friction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The ridge fort, storm, and star anchor who/where/when early. Sensory detail is vivid ("salt-crusted stone," "peeled like sunburnt skin") and filtered through the oracle's priorities. However, the environment never constrains a choice or alters tactics—waves crash, wind howls, yet the "ambered hush" insulates her completely. The setting functions as mood wallpaper rather than pressure, capping the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—drawing a map of silence—is signaled early but never tested. No reversal, no tightening, no on-page choice that forecloses an option or imposes cost. The storm rages but the oracle works unimpeded; she finishes her task and departs without friction or sacrifice. Agency is absent: she does not decide, renounce, or endure under pressure; she simply completes a predetermined action and leaves. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure should deepen or break a pattern; here it remains static.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Theme—charting absence, valuing silence—emerges clearly from images and action rather than statement. The flaking gold leaf and summarized silences recur with intent. However, the ending offers no resonant reweighting or non-literal answer: the oracle's smile and descent are asserted satisfaction, not earned tension. The final lines drift into explicit moralizing ("knowing her obsession had not been in vain") and theme summary ("leaving behind only the echo of summarized silence") that replace scene pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited; distance and tense are consistent. Diction is elevated and voice-specific ("ambered hush," "marbled hush," "moth wings brushing glass"), creating a distinct perceptual signature. However, the prose never modulates under pressure—emotional peaks and calm beats share identical ornate phrasing. Purposeful compression is acceptable, but here the lyric texture remains uniform and opaque throughout, without the cadence shift that would charge the final image. No dialogue to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Figurative language ("honeyed resin trapping ancient breath," "dunes under moonless gusts," "throat of oblivion") appears in nearly every sentence without pattern-teaching or payoff, triggering overwriting penalties (−0.5). Paraphrase loops: "the silence after…; the hush when…; the stillness between…" is template repetition without added pressure (−0.4). Stock metaphors ("broken shell cradling a single pearl") and filter-verb stacks ("she knew," "she believed") dull immediacy in peak beats (−0.3). Artifacts touch the closure beat ("marbled hush: striated, calm"), disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8. Rhythm is uniform; no propulsion variation despite the storm/hush contrast.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The premise—mapping silence via an oracle's cartographic ritual—offers a lyric angle but remains abstract. The storm/hush contrast and flaking booklet are vivid particulars, yet the core action (summarizing silence into coordinates) is asserted rather than dramatized with fresh mechanics. The ending ("vanished into the night she had drawn") echoes stock mystical-departure imagery without transformation. Emotional arc is generic contemplation; swapping names and setting would leave the structure intact. No bold risk that heightens stakes; safety-middle lyricism without conceptual bite.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Present throughout, but the oracle makes no choice that creates a turn. She executes a preset task (tracing pages, whispering summaries) without friction, then walks away. Observation and declaration, not decision.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The booklet is handled in multiple beats (opening, tracing, closing) and its flaking gold recurs at the end. However, its properties do not constrain or enable any choice—it is a passive prop for description. The final mention ("faint gleam of flaking gold upon the stones") is a visual cameo, not causal participation in closure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The "ambered hush" is named early and recurs ("marbled hush" at the end), but it functions as atmosphere, not a constraint or driver of stakes. It insulates the oracle from the storm rather than shaping her tactics or choices. Present and coherent with tone, but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>Label-only. "Mildly obsessed" is stated but never dramatized through an on-page action with cost or tradeoff. Her obsession does not constrain her choices or create friction; it is narrated as backstory and asserted at the end ("knowing her obsession had not been in vain").</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The act of retelling/summarizing appears in multiple beats and is central to the oracle's stated purpose. However, the mechanics are vague ("summarized silence," "whispered summaries"), and the action does not create a turn or choice under pressure. Swapping "retell" for "record" or "inscribe" would leave the structure unchanged.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The method is signaled early ("by summarizing silence, distilling quietude into coordinates") and recurs, but its mechanics remain abstract. It does not shape attempts, narrow options, or impose visible cost. The oracle completes the task unimpeded; the method is thematic decoration.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The ridge fort is named early and provides spatial grounding. The storm and cliffside appear in multiple beats. However, the setting never pressures choices—the "ambered hush" nullifies environmental threat, and the oracle's task proceeds without spatial friction. Postcard description with coherent tone but no tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The star is present at the opening and its extinction marks the end of the oracle's task ("When the final star guttered out, swallowed by the horizon's yawn, she closed the…booklet"). This creates a loose timeframe bracket and a cadence shift at closure, but the clock does not tighten decisions or alter tactics. The oracle works at her own pace; the star's death is coincident, not causal.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The motivation is stated early and repeated. However, it is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choices or friction between desire and cost. The oracle pursues the map without obstacle or internal contradiction; she completes it and departs satisfied. No want-versus-fear tension or visible tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Tone is coherent and purposeful: elevated, quiet, lyric. "Marbled hush" appears at the opening (via "ambered hush") and returns transformed at the end ("marbled hush: striated, calm, and strangely welcoming"), reweighting the dominant stake with a charged final image. The tone does not modulate under pressure—it remains uniformly ornate—but the lyric reprise at closure justifies mid-6s under the Accumulative lens.</comment>
