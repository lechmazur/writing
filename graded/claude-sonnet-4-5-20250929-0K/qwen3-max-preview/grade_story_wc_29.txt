<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elira's core trait (cautious hope, pattern recognition) drives her counter-frequency decision, and her professional competence is balanced by genuine stakes—the tricksters adapt and she knows they'll return. Internal contradiction appears when she "allowed herself half a smile" yet remains vigilant, showing simultaneous relief and wariness. However, the interior relies heavily on告 exposition ("she'd trained for this—not with weapons, but with patience") rather than embodied micro-choices under pressure, and the Tau Ceti flashback functions as credential-building rather than a present dilemma that alters tactics.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes a Causal lens: Elira isolates the subsonic payload, threads a counter-frequency, and the campus calms—each step narrows options and raises cost (the tricksters notice, "writhed, weakened, then retreated"). Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph. Closure is Charged Poise: the tricksters retreat but will return, and Elira pins new coordinates with "Try me again. I'm listening," crystallizing the ongoing stance with felt cost (sleepless vigilance, the campus "breathing" but not healed). One meaningful tightening occurs when the signal "pulsed with irritation" and she realizes "they were watching," which narrows her tactical window and charges the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The university radio station control booth—dim glow, yellowed charts, Cold War transmitters—provides resources (the jury-rigged counter-frequency box, the boosted signal) that enable Elira's interference. The oscilloscope and charts are handled across multiple beats and anchor her methodology. However, spatial choreography beyond the booth (campus barricades, quad seminars) is summarized rather than shown, and the setting does not constrain a choice or visibly narrow her options during the climactic counter-broadcast; it supplies tools but does not pressure her tactics under duress.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—prevent the tricksters from corroding the community—is signaled early and tightens when Elira "took the controls" after oversight dissolves, then escalates when the signal "pulsed with irritation" and the tricksters realize "its prey had teeth." The counter-frequency test at 2:17 a.m. is a clear reversal that narrows options (students calm, barricades come down). Cost is visible: Elira stays awake until dawn, knows the tricksters will return, and accepts ongoing vigilance ("next time, they'd find her ready"). Agency is decision and endurance under pressure, and coincidence (the rally broadcast timing) complicates rather than resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Theme—hope as resistance, technical mastery vs. psychological warfare—emerges through Elira's counter-frequency work and the image of "turning lies into lullabies." The closing whisper "Try me again. I'm listening" offers a resonant stance without moralizing. However, the Tau Ceti flashback and the phrase "cosmic tricksters never abandoned a game they thought they could still win" veer toward thematic echo, and "the physics of hope" seminar on the quad reads as on-the-nose thematic summary rather than earned subtext. The final image reweights prior material but leans on stated concepts ("ethereal grit") more than pure particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Elira; diction is controlled and voice-particular ("Think of it as tuning a poisoned violin until it plays lullabies instead of dirges"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully—tight on her hands and charts, then zooming to campus reports. The single line of dialogue (the freshman's post) carries subtext (inexplicable emotion, shared relief). However, the phrase "psychological warfare dressed as cosmic revelation" and the meta-explanation "Usually, she flagged anomalies for oversight committees or published white papers no one read" drift into expository register that pauses momentum, and the closing direct address to the static ("Try me again. I'm listening") risks theatrical overstatement.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is high in technical beats (cross-referencing waveforms, patching the counter-generator). However, paraphrase loops appear: "She didn't broadcast over the signal—she interfered with it, threading her own subsonic tones into its structure, not to silence it, but to destabilize its emotional payload" immediately followed by the violin metaphor restates the same action. Template cadence runs in the opening ("adjusted her headphones... her fingers tracing... She had spent... but tonight, the signals weren't just noise") and in the Tau Ceti paragraph ("She'd seen it before—on Tau Ceti's fringe colony, where a harmonic pulse convinced..."). Stock metaphors ("like peeling skin from an apple," "like distant thunder") and filter-verb stacks ("She could feel it in the tightening") dull immediacy in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The premise—counter-frequency psychological warfare against subsonic manipulation—offers a fresh synthesis of signal theory and cosmic horror, and Elira's methodology (threading her own tones to destabilize rather than silence) is specific. The "cosmic tricksters" frame and the fringe-colony flashback risk familiar sci-fi territory but are grounded in technical detail (oscilloscope, pulsar coordinates). However, the emotional arc—lone expert saves community through specialized knowledge—follows a recognizable template, and the closing stance (vigilant readiness for the next round) is tonally predictable. The piece commits fully to its premise but does not transform the archetype in a non-obvious way.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elira (celestial signal interpreter) drives the key turn: she "took the controls" when oversight dissolved, isolated the subsonic layer, and patched her counter-frequency, which narrows the tricksters' options and earns the campus's brief reprieve. Her decision appears early (setup by paragraph 10), constrains middle tactics (the 2:17 a.m. test pulse), and shapes closure (pinning new coordinates, whispering her challenge). Removing her specialized role would break the story's logic. Cost is visible: sleepless vigilance and the knowledge that the tricksters will return.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Astronomical charts appear in three beats: opening ("fingers tracing the edges of yellowed astronomical charts"), middle ("cross-referenced tonight's signal peaks against her astronomical charts"), and closure ("She pinned a new chart to the wall—this one marked with counter-signature coordinates"). They enable her to match waveform signatures to celestial coordinates and track the Cassiopeia pulsar origin. However, their use is largely instrumental—she consults them but they do not constrain a choice with visible cost; the counter-frequency generator does the tactical work. The final chart pinning reweights their function (from passive reference to active preparation) but feels more symbolic than causally necessary.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Power plays (the tricksters' subsonic manipulation vs. Elira's counter-frequency) shape the central conflict: "they didn't conquer, they corrode" and Elira's interference is a strategic countermove. The concept appears early (the tricksters' method explained by paragraph 8) and drives the middle choice (threading her own tones to destabilize their payload). However, the on-page execution leans toward exposition of power dynamics rather than dramatized tactical friction; the tricksters' irritation ("pulsed with irritation, like a predator realizing its prey had teeth") is described rather than shown through contested action. The concept frames stakes but does not alter Elira's options with visible cost during the climactic beat.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Cautiously hopeful" is stated in paragraph 4 ("Elira wasn't panicked—she was cautiously hopeful") and constrains one action: she proceeds with the counter-frequency test rather than fleeing or escalating to destructive jamming. The trait reappears implicitly when she "allowed herself half a smile" after the first success yet remains vigilant. However, it functions more as tonal coloring than a driver of on-page tradeoffs; removing the label would not break the logic of her choices, which are already motivated by professional competence and the stakes. Cost is felt (ongoing vigilance) but not directly tied to the cautious-hope trait.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Interfere (via counter-frequency) is the story's pivot: Elira "interfered with it, threading her own subsonic tones into its structure, not to silence it, but to destabilize its emotional payload." This action drives the middle turn (the 2:17 a.m. test pulse calms the rally) and shapes closure (the tricksters retreat, she prepares for their return). It is signaled early (paragraph 9: "Elira had interfered before, but never this directly") and its mechanics are detailed. Removing or swapping the action (e.g., jamming, broadcasting a counter-message) would require major rewrites; the specificity of interference—destabilizing rather than silencing—defines her tactical philosophy and the story's conceptual core.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Subsonic frequencies are the story's technical mechanism: the tricksters "slipped subsonic frequencies into carrier waves... vibrating the amygdala" and Elira counters by threading her own subsonic tones. The method is signaled early (paragraph 2: "subsonic frequencies that vibrated beneath human hearing yet rattled her molars") and shapes her middle tactics (isolating the subsonic layer, patching the counter-generator). Its mechanics matter: students feel calmer because the emotional payload is destabilized. However, the on-page dramatization is thin—most explanation is expository rather than shown through trial-and-error or visible adjustment under pressure. The method is causally necessary but not irreplaceable; any technical countermeasure with similar specificity could serve.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The university radio station is signaled early (opening paragraph), provides resources (control booth, Cold War transmitters that boost the signal, the jury-rigged counter-frequency box), and its location "on the edge of town" makes it "the perfect vector." It enables Elira's interference and anchors her spatial isolation. However, the setting does not constrain a choice with visible cost during the climactic beat; she has unfettered access and no environmental pressure (e.g., failing equipment, intruders) that forces tactical adjustment. The micro-setting (oscilloscope, charts pinned to corkboard) charges atmosphere but does not alter her moves under duress.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The timeframe—"as the community divides"—is present throughout: "students barricaded lecture halls, faculty split into ideological camps" (opening), "oversight was gone now, dissolved in the chaos" (middle), and "By dawn, the campus wasn't healed—but it was breathing" (closure). The community's division motivates Elira's direct action and the resolution is keyed to the broadcast window ("three hours until the next broadcast window") and the 2:17 a.m. test pulse. However, the timeline is summarized rather than dramatized with a live ticking clock that narrows her options; the three-hour window is mentioned but not used to force trade-offs or heighten pressure during the climactic beat.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Outwitting cosmic tricksters is Elira's core motivation, signaled early ("entities that mimicked salvation while sowing discord") and driving her counter-frequency strategy. The desire is dramatized: she cross-references coordinates, jury-rigs the generator, and threads her tones to "outmaneuver" rather than defeat. Cost is visible—she knows they'll return ("next time, they'd find her ready")—and the tricksters' irritation confirms the contest. However, the motivation leans toward professional duty more than personal stakes; the story does not show friction between her want (to outwit) and a competing fear or cost (e.g., risking her credibility, exhaustion threatening her judgment). The motivation is coherent but lacks internal contradiction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Ethereal grit—scientific precision meeting cosmic mystery—is present in diction ("whispers from deep space," "threading her own subsonic tones," "the ethereal grit of a woman who'd learned to speak the language of stars") and modulates with pressure: calm technical description during the setup, tighter syntax during the 2:17 a.m. test, reflective cadence at closure. However, the phrase "ethereal grit" appears explicitly in the final paragraph, which risks telling rather than embodying the tone through image alone. The tone charges the final image (pinning the chart, whispering to the static) but occasionally drifts into expository register ("psychological warfare dressed as cosmic revelation") that flattens the ethereal texture.</comment>
