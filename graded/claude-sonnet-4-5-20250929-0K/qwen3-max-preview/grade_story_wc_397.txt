<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's interior life is richly embodied—"gripping reality loosely," the parasol-tip tuning ritual—and her contradiction (resenting miracles, terminally curious rather than suicidal) is legible. The change at closure (declining euthanasia, listening differently) arrives through accumulation rather than a single on-page micro-choice under duress; the shift reads as summary of offstage realization. Embodied interiority is strong ("humming to herself," clutching the parasol tip), but the final renunciation lacks a visible forfeiture dramatized in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story builds through sensory density and recurring motifs (parasol tip chime, glacier sigh, lace unraveling) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration—Elara's shift from seeking endings to hearing "music between heartbeats." Cost is felt (she drifts alone, half-frozen) and the closure reweights prior material cleanly. Orientation anchors arrive by the second paragraph. One minor slip: the Danish rescue and return feel compressed, softening the immediacy of the final stance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The drift-ice marina is vividly particular (black ice, rusted winch, groaning floes) and the parasol tip functions as micro-setting, constraining her ritual and charging the climactic chime. Sensory hierarchy is consistent (auroras, wind-borne frost, wet bell tone). The floe as final platform shapes her choice to drift rather than flee, and the setting's acoustic properties drive the core stake. Strong integration of body, tool, and environment across beats.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (learning the sound of endings) is signaled early and tightens when the parasol tip rings, triggering the glacier shear. Elara's agency—climbing onto the floe rather than evacuating—forecloses safety with visible cost (isolation, near-freezing). The accumulative lens supports the gradual deepening, but the peak choice (walking toward the water) reads as confirmation rather than a dilemma under competing pressures. One meaningful tightening is present; the consequence (drift, rescue, transformation) lands on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme (endings as thresholds, patience folding inward) emerges through concrete particulars: the parasol tip's vibration, the glacier's sigh, lace unraveling. The final image—hospices and burn units, reality flowing through her—offers a resonant answer without moralizing. Minor friction: "windborne solace" and "fold in patience" are named early and late, risking echo; the conceptual repricing is legible but leans slightly toward abstraction in the penultimate paragraph ("not events, but thresholds").</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Voice is lyric and consistent, with purposeful compression ("trawl…for endings," "the hush before collapse") that reads as pattern-taught texture. POV remains stable; psychic distance modulates appropriately (close during the chime, wide during drift). Minor slips: "terminally curious" and "fold in patience" feel slightly external to Elara's idiom under peak stress. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping. Diction elevates in the final reflection ("music between heartbeats") but remains anchored to her perceptual signature.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully, and imagery is dense without obscuring causality. Strong lines: "a low, wet chime, like a bell submerged in deep water"; "patience folding inward, finally at rest." Friction: the opening three paragraphs loop conceptually (woke changed, hollow eyes, gripping reality loosely) without advancing situation; "silt" / "slush" / "wind and frost like a ghost's breath" stack metaphors in close succession. Template stems appear mid-piece ("She'd come to…," "She realized then…"). Penultimate paragraph over-explains the thematic turn. Deduction: −0.6 for loops and stem repetition, partial recovery for closure clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis—euthanasia tourism meets disaster relief, acoustic obsession with finitude—is specific and non-obvious. The parasol-tip tuning fork is a fresh inflection, and the glacier-shear auditory climax grows inevitably from setup. Risk (lyric accumulation, quiet ending, sensory metaphysics) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Minor derivative note: the hospice-volunteer transformation echoes familiar "death-curious character finds meaning" arcs; the story transforms through the acoustic particularity and the parasol heirloom, lifting it above template. Within-band adjustment: +0.3 for risk coherence.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her choices (volunteering, tapping the parasol tip, climbing onto the floe, declining euthanasia consultations) create key turns. Setup early, beats in volunteering/chime/drift/closure, causal pressure evident. The floe climb is the pivotal choice; the final renunciation completes the arc. Swappability low; cost visible. Strong integration across all gates.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Parasol tip appears in beat one (tuning ritual), beat two (falls and rings, triggering the climax), and closure (chain around neck, embodied presence). Early signal, causal pressure (the chime precipitates the glacier knowledge), closure linkage strong. Irreplaceability high (heirloom lace, bride's canopy history, vibration with memory). Cost connection clear. Three gates met; specificity charges the final image.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"A fold in patience" is named early and recurs in the climax ("the fold in patience that signaled not surrender, but transition") and closure. It shapes the thematic stake but does not constrain a tactical choice on the page; the concept remains metaphorical rather than actional. Setup and payoff present; middle development weak. Lyric reprise reweights meaning, placing it in the mid 5s; the conceptual cost is felt but not enacted.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Grips reality loosely" is introduced early ("like silt") and echoed at closure ("She no longer gripped reality loosely. She let it flow through her"). The trait characterizes her but does not visibly constrain or enable a choice with cost; it remains a descriptive label. Setup and payoff gates met; middle development absent. Swappability moderate. Cap at 4.6 for missing middle gate; lyric reprise lifts slightly.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Trawl" is named early ("she'd come to trawl…for endings") and her listening method (parasol-tip tapping, tuning for resonance) drives the discovery of the glacier shear. The action shapes her approach but is not irreplaceable—another sensory metaphor (probe, search) could substitute. Setup and closure participation present; middle beats involve the tapping ritual. Causal role evident but specificity moderate.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Disaster relief volunteering is signaled early ("Northern Mercy Corps," sorting goods, hauling water) and provides the frame that places her at the marina during the glacier event. The method enables her presence but does not constrain a choice or tactic with cost; the mechanics appear as setup. Setup and middle presence (hauling jerrycans when she slips) met; closure participation indirect. Functional but replaceable with another plausible cover role.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Drift-ice marina is anchored in paragraph two and pressures every beat: fractured docks, black ice (the slip that triggers the chime), the floe she climbs. The setting's acoustic properties are essential to the core stake. Micro-setting (winch, ice) alters tactics (the fall, the climb). Early signal, causal pressure, closure linkage (floe as final platform). Irreplaceability high; the specific environment drives the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Woke changed" opens the story and frames the narrative as post-transformation reflection. The timeframe does not tighten decisions or create urgency; the piece is contemplative rather than time-bound. Setup present, but no live clock that alters moves. The opening and closing both reference the change, giving lyric coherence but no tactical pressure. Functional framing device, but swappable with "after the event" or similar.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation ("to learn the sound of approaching endings") is dramatized in the tuning rituals, the parasol-tip tapping, and the climactic auditory event. It conflicts with her prior euthanasia waivers and transforms at closure into listening for "music between heartbeats." Early signal, middle friction (volunteering vs. listening), closure transformation. Cost visible (drift, near-freezing, renunciation of euthanasia). Specificity and irreplaceability high.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Tone is elegiac and sensory throughout ("whispers of salt and surrender," "auroras," "humming"), modulating from melancholy observation to awed participation (the chime, the sigh) to quiet resolve (hospices, refugee tents). "Windborne solace" appears only in the final line, charging the closure image with the tone held across beats. Coherence strong; the tone reweights prior pressure. Setup implicit, closure explicit, middle consistent. Lyric reprise that recharges the arc.</comment>
