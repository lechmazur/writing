<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The potter's motivation is concrete and her agency shapes the arc through deliberate choices (aligning the glass, pouring water, molding clay). Interiority is imagistic but occasionally tips into therapeutic phrasing ("surrender — it had stopped fighting entropy," "resonance — aligning with rhythms older than ruin"). Embodied emotion is present in breath and gesture, yet the final insight feels delivered rather than earned through prior contradiction or mistake. The renunciation of firing the kiln forecloses a path, though the cost reads more conceptual than visceral.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural with conceptual repricing at closure. Orientation anchors early (potter, kiln, oasis, heat). The piece deepens pressure through layered images—thrum, bee, lantern glow—that reweight the oasis's resistance from physical to resonant. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the unfired pot and glowing glass crystallize a stance where "fractures heal not by sealing, but by letting light through." Cost is oblique but legible in the choice to leave the vessel soft, porous, vulnerable. One meaningful deepening suffices for this length; the ending reconfigures the premise with undeniable conceptual weight.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The oasis is vividly anchored (cracked kiln, broken hives, wax pooling, dust) and sensory detail reflects urgency (smoke flattening, heat relentless, shadows stretching). The lantern glass and pot function as micro-setting that constrains choice: the glass only glows with gentle intent, the pot cradles time. Spatial choreography is coherent (kiln, hive stand, riverbed clay). The environment directly charges the final image—pot in dust, glass glowing—making removal impossible without collapse.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: understanding why places resist change, manifested on-page as aligning the glass, interpreting the thrum, molding the pot. Pressure tightens through the bee's arrival and the lantern's brightening, narrowing options toward a stance of non-interference. Agency is visible in pouring water and choosing not to fire the kiln, forecloses permanence with felt cost. One meaningful deepening suffices; the final choice—leaving the pot soft—trades stasis for breath, a visible tradeoff that charges the closure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through image and action: resistance as surrender, preservation as resonance, healing through porosity. The lantern glass and unfired pot accumulate meaning rather than stating a thesis. The final line ("some fractures heal not by sealing, but by letting light through") edges toward direct statement but remains grounded in the prior particulars of glass, clay, and kindness. Subtext operates in gesture (not firing the kiln) and the bee's return, though "phototropic to kindness" occasionally reads as authorial claim rather than dramatized discovery.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: poetic compression ("liquid regret," "palimpsest of summers"), sensory specificity (thrum as heartbeat, iridescence of wings). Distance is tight and controlled; no head-hopping. Diction occasionally elevates into lyric register ("phototropic," "palimpsest") that fits voice but risks minor register drift under pressure. Rhythmic control is strong—long sentences breathe, short ones anchor—and the final image recharges prior motifs. Elision of exposition is purposeful and taught early.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout ("scorched and skeletal," "liquid regret," "resin undisturbed," "palimpsest of summers") without clear pattern-teaching or payoff discipline; in peak beats this crowds rather than sharpens. Paraphrase loops appear: "not through strength, but surrender — it had stopped fighting entropy, stopped demanding continuity" restates the same idea across clauses. Template stems recur: "She set…She closed…She poured…She began…She understood…She did not…She smiled…She left…She walked." Information density is strong when grounded but suffers when metaphor stacks. No causality breaks, but momentum drags slightly in the middle reflective block.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of fractured time, abandoned oasis, zen potter, and phototropic glass offers specificity and avoids stock templates. The emotional arc—understanding resistance through surrender—is earnest and the final stance (unfired pot as breathing vessel) feels coherent. However, the core logic (kindness repairs fractured timelines, preservation = resonance) leans into familiar spiritual-poetic territory without a sharp counter-pressure or non-obvious moral calculus. Risk-taking in structure and voice is present but does not fundamentally transform the template; the transformation test flags swappability of the oasis for other "places that resist" without altering arc.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Potter is present throughout and her choices create key turns: aligning the glass triggers the thrum, pouring water summons bees, molding clay enacts her stance, and refusing to fire the kiln crystallizes the closure. Early signal is strong; beat involvement spans setup, middle, and ending. Causal pressure is moderate—her agency enables rather than narrows options—and cost at closure is conceptual (leaving vessel soft) rather than visceral. Swappability is low; "zen-minded" manifests in her breath-synced rhythm and gentle intent.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Lantern glass appears early (satchel, first paragraph), is handled in multiple beats (aligned on hive stand, thrums, glows, projects images, fits inside pot), and charges the final image where it "glows faintly, thrumming in harmony with the sun's slow return." Its phototropic trait constrains action (only glows with gentle intent) and its evolving brightness tracks escalation. Removal would collapse the mechanism linking kindness to time coherence. High irreplaceability and closure linkage elevate the score.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Fractured timelines frame the premise and motivate the potter's journey; the lantern glass shows "bees dancing in spirals that defied gravity, nectar dripping upward, keepers moving backward through seasons." The concept shapes her interpretation (time as layered palimpsest) and her final stance (let moments pool undisturbed). However, the fracturing does not create on-page tactical constraints or alter her choices under pressure—she does not navigate competing timelines or pay a cost for choosing one strand. Closure reprices the concept thematically but the mechanics remain atmospheric.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Phototropic to kindness" is introduced early and tested once: the lantern glass glows when the potter pours water for the bee, literalizing gentle intent. This moment enables the thrum's deepening and the bee's return, shaping one beat. However, the trait is never constrained (she never acts with haste or hunger that dims the glass), so no visible tradeoff appears. The attribute remains more tonal signal than mechanical constraint. Label-only at setup, single-beat function at middle, ornamental at closure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Thrum begins when the glass is aligned, deepens as she breathes with it, syncs with the bee's wings and earth's exhale, and softens to lullaby when the glass is placed in the pot—spanning setup, escalation, and closure. It tracks her attunement and signals coherence of fractured time. The thrum's rhythm shapes her molding and final choice (let the vessel stay soft to sustain the hum). Removal would eliminate the sensory bridge linking kindness, time, and resonance. High causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Following sun patterns etched into desert stone, each dawn's angle a breadcrumb through dunes" is mentioned in the setup to explain how she arrived at the oasis. The method does not appear again; she does not navigate by sun angles during the scene, and the final alignment with the sinking sun is positional rather than navigational. Functional but replaceable—she could have followed any map or memory. Setup gate met, but no middle development or closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Abandoned beekeeping oasis in scorched wasteland anchors the entire piece: cracked kiln, broken hives, wax pooling, frames sagging, dust, riverbed clay. It supplies the constraint (why this place resists) and the resource (clay for the pot, hive stand for the glass). The oasis's state of arrested decay drives her inquiry and shapes the closure choice (leave the pot unfired to mirror the oasis's porous resistance). Removal would collapse both stakes and setting. Present across all beats with high causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"As chimney smoke flattens" signals the oppressive heat and static atmosphere but does not function as a ticking clock. Time is marked by "the hour when shadows stretched longest," "the sinking sun," "when the last light bled from the sky," and "dawn," yet these shifts do not tighten decisions—the potter works at her own rhythm. The timeframe provides ambient pressure (heat, duration) but does not force tactical changes. Setup and closure presence met; middle development weak.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Motivation—to understand why some places resist change—is stated early and dramatized through her actions: tracing the kiln, aligning the glass, interpreting the thrum, molding the pot, and refusing to fire it. The inquiry drives the arc and finds resolution in the closure insight (resistance = surrender). However, the motivation faces no friction or competing desire; she never doubts, falters, or pays a relational or opportunity cost for pursuing it. Told early, enacted in choices, but not conflicted.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Tone blends precise sensory detail ("cracked kiln," "wax pooled," "thrum," "prismatic shimmers") with tender, meditative phrasing ("quiet defiance," "let the vessel stay soft," "humming"). Sharp observation modulates into gentle interpretation at closure ("they, too, were phototropic to kindness"). Coherence holds across turns without flattening. The final image—pot glowing, smoke curling upward—synthesizes both registers. Tone charges the ending and sustains pressure without tipping into sentimentality.</comment>
