<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's interiority is vivid and specific ("snowmelt ardor—that fierce, thawing tenderness") with micro-choices threaded throughout the ritual. However, motivation reads more as declared theme than dramatized conflict; the caster never confronts a genuine obstacle or internal contradiction that would force a foreclosing choice. Embodied emotion is present but the trajectory from guilt to release lacks the contradictory impulses that would create authentic tension. The character endures and enacts rather than decides under pressure with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens inferred as Accumulative/Textural: the piece builds through layered ritual description toward a final Resonant Reconfiguration where the helix becomes a vessel for collective memory. The closure moment—"I step into the light, technically gentle hands empty now, heart full of names"—offers a clear before/after with conceptual cost (surrender of signature, transition from sculptor to medium). Orientation is delayed; who/where/when anchors arrive piecemeal across the opening third, and the causal chain reads elliptical rather than because/therefore. The meaningful deepening occurs, but the cost feels asserted more than dramatized on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The sanctum is richly textured: ice-prisms refracting aurora, permafrost preserving fibers, bedrock embedding the final artifact. The rope functions as both tool and micro-setting, constraining the work physically and charging the final image when it becomes "half-unraveled, half-reborn." Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, though the setting pressures choice more conceptually than tactically; the protagonist moves through the environment without spatial friction or resource scarcity altering tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preservation of forgotten names—is signaled early and sustained. The ritual unfolds in stages (unspooling, molding, pouring, cooling, blowing), creating a texture of accumulation. However, no on-page reversal or tightening choice narrows options; each step proceeds as planned without obstacle, adaptation, or visible trade-off. The stakes remain abstract; we are told the work matters but never see a moment where failure, loss, or sacrifice threatens the outcome. Escalation reads as elaboration rather than pressure under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme—memory as living resonance rather than archival stasis—emerges organically from the lost-wax process and the rope's preserved chants. The final image (helix embedded in bedrock, roots cradling it, children hearing lullabies) offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the preservation question. Subtext operates in gesture and image; no overt moralizing mars the ending. However, the protagonist's internal arc is more enactment of thesis than struggle; forgiveness and grace arrive fully formed rather than earned through friction or renunciation, blunting thematic complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and lyric, with a controlled perceptual signature: "bruise healing into dawn," "snowmelt ardor," "technically gentle." Psychic distance remains stable; focalization is clean with no head-hopping. Diction elevates but stays character-consistent (artisan's precision, devotional vocabulary). Purposeful compression and patterned syntax teach a meditative rhythm that the piece sustains. However, some lines drift toward ornamentation without advancing scene pressure: "Let deer nuzzle its cold curves" reads more decorative than dramatized, and the catalog structure in the middle third (tool list, cooling time, voice chorus) flattens momentum slightly.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Figurative language is dense and vivid ("aurora ripple overhead—green, violet, silver—as if the sky itself is threading light") but clusters heavily in descriptive passages, occasionally obscuring propulsion. Paraphrase loops appear: "not from beyond, but from within" / "not in vaults or scrolls, but in vibration" / "not to escape, but to preserve" recycles syntactic templates. Information density is high in ritual mechanics but scaffolding phrases ("This is preservation," "Others will come") tell rather than trust the image. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; clarity remains intact despite lyric compression. The overwriting doesn't touch closure but reduces mid-section momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of lost-wax casting, street-organ punch cards, and monastic rope-braiding is specific and non-obvious. The premise transforms familiar preservation themes through artisan detail and the physicality of bronze, wax, and fiber. However, the emotional arc (forgiveness → tender restoration → release) follows a well-worn template without friction or surprise. The risk taken—lyric compression, elliptical causality—heightens texture but doesn't deepen stakes. The piece commits fully to its premise but the execution leans toward beautiful enactment rather than transformation that forces choice.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The lost-wax caster is present throughout and executes all ritual steps. However, the character observes, enacts, and reflects more than decides; no choice alters tactics or forecloses a path with on-page cost. The role shapes tone and vocabulary but remains functionally interchangeable with any artisan-preservationist.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The punched card appears early (beggar's coat pocket), is physically handled mid-story (pressed into wax mold), and its perforations align to names in the final helix. It crosses setup, development, and payoff gates. However, the card's unique properties—melody-to-syllable transcription—are asserted more than dramatized; we are told it "whispers syllables" but the mechanics of how holes become names remain vague. Specificity is high but causal pressure is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Transcribed memory frames the entire ritual: the protagonist translates punched-card melody into bronze perforations that preserve voices. The concept appears in setup (street organ history), drives the middle work (threading melody into mantra), and charges the ending (children hearing lullabies). However, it operates more as thematic backdrop than tactical constraint; the transcription process doesn't narrow options or force trade-offs on the page.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"Technically gentle" is a vivid recurring phrase used three times, creating a perceptual signature. It colors the protagonist's handling of materials (beeswax, rope braids) and returns at closure ("technically gentle hands empty now"). However, it remains label-only; we never see a moment where gentleness constrains action, prevents a choice, or imposes cost. The trait enhances voice but doesn't shape stakes.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Illuminate" appears in the opening line and recurs ("I illuminate by listening," "I illuminate not with flame"). The protagonist's work literally brings light (aurora, ice-prisms) and metaphorically illuminates forgotten names. It participates in closure when the protagonist "step[s] into the light." However, the action is conceptual; removing "illuminate" and substituting "preserve" or "remember" would leave the ritual mechanics unchanged. Functional but swappable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The rope-braiding method is introduced early (monks' chants woven into fibers), its mechanics detailed mid-story ("unspooling sections, twisting in new strands"), and the rope's final state ("half-unraveled, half-reborn") charges closure as the protagonist's signature. The method drives two distinct beats (tugging the third braid to release Elara's giggle, molding the reconfigured core) and its constraint—cannot light the sanctum conventionally—shapes the entire approach. Strong integration with setup, development, and payoff all present.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The icebound sanctum is anchored early with vivid detail (aurora ceiling, permafrost, no idols). The setting supplies key resources (the rope, ice-prisms for light) and its permanence frames the ending vision (sanctum becoming meadow, helix embedded in bedrock). However, the environment doesn't constrain tactics; the protagonist moves freely without spatial friction, and the ice never threatens or alters the work. Strong atmospheric presence but moderate tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"After forgiving yourself" opens the story and establishes an emotional timeframe. However, the forgiveness itself is off-page; we never see what was forgiven or how it cost. The phrase returns conceptually ("stop burying the past") but doesn't tighten decisions or create a live clock. Present as thematic anchor but absent as pressure mechanism.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The desire to preserve forgotten names is stated early and sustained: the protagonist collects the punched card, weeps at Elara's voice, casts the helix to carry forward nameless melodies. The motivation drives the ritual sequence and shapes the ending (embedding the helix for future children). However, friction is minimal; we never see competing wants, opportunity cost, or a moment where preservation demands a sacrifice that tests commitment. The motivation is enacted rather than conflicted.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Snowmelt ardor" is named once mid-story ("fierce, thawing tenderness") and the tone of tender release modulates across the piece: weeping, wrapping in furs, stepping toward rivers. The tone charges the final image (light, empty hands, heart full) and remains coherent through the ritual's stages. However, the emotional register is static; intensity doesn't shift with pressure, and the tone reads as applied atmosphere rather than emergent from conflict. Functional lyric presence without escalation.</comment>
