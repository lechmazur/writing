<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The collector's interiority remains largely opaque—we see her actions but rarely feel contradictory impulses in real time. "Modest fearlessness" is declared rather than dramatized through a moment where dread and warmth compete. The ghosts receive more embodied attention (the boy snorting, the woman's translucent fingers) than the protagonist's inner life under pressure. No micro-choice reveals a hierarchy of values with visible cost; she proceeds with serene competence throughout.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: layered confessions and the harp's realignment constitute a Resonant Reconfiguration (the gorge's dissonance softens, ghosts integrate). Cost is signaled but abstract—"luminous ache," edges "blurring into stone"—without a concrete on-page forfeiture that narrows her next choice. The Orientation Test is satisfied early (gorge, sunrise, her task), and the lens holds, but the closure image reweights atmosphere more than it forecloses a path with felt consequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The gorge's "misaligned harp" and its geology-as-instrument function as purposeful constraint: she navigates by dissonance, plays to harmonize with brokenness. The crocodile's tooth and clay flute are handled across multiple beats and charge the ending. The sunrise timeframe anchors tone but does not tighten tactics. Spatial choreography is clear (rim, narrow passage, descent), and the setting actively shapes her method and the ghosts' emergence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The dominant stake—integrating fractured souls via laughter—is signaled early and coherent. Pressure accumulates through the harp's dissonance and layered confessions, then shifts when the flute's "trill" cracks the air and the boy giggles. One meaningful deepening occurs (sorrow becomes laughter, the harp realigns), but no on-page choice forecloses a live option or imposes a visible trade-off. The ghosts' transformation feels atmospherically earned yet lacks a moment where the collector risks or sacrifices something concrete.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme—grief as companionship, laughter as sorrow's sibling—emerges from image and action rather than statement. The final image (child's giggle downstream, another gorge waiting) offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. However, lines like "Laughter was not the opposite of sorrow. / It was its oldest sibling" edge toward thematic statement rather than letting the flute-and-giggle sequence carry the weight alone. The "luminous ache" phrase recurs as a label rather than being embodied through fresh particulars at closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited; perceptual signature is present in selective detail (crocodile's tooth "catching dawn-light like a secret"). Diction is elevated and consistent but occasionally drifts into register that feels more authorial than character-filtered ("modestly fearless," "luminous ache," "metabolized confession into grace"). Under peak pressure—when ghosts confess and laughter erupts—the prose maintains its lyric texture without compression or urgency shift, flattening the emotional gradient. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks, but the voice reads more as narrated atmosphere than lived interiority.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Overwriting pervades: figurative language appears in most sentences ("sound bent and memory pooled like mercury," "throat tight with luminous ache," "bleeding the same color"), creating density without propulsion. Multiple paraphrase loops: "She did not collect to hoard. / She collected to integrate" restates purpose without added pressure; "They did not speak. / They confessed" is a synonym toggle. Template cadence runs through the middle third ("She did not flinch. / … She did not speak. / … She did not collect"). The closure beat itself—"still warm, still remembering—and smiled"—is clean, limiting the total deduction, but artifacts touch multiple paragraphs and dull momentum throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The synthesis—soul collector as healer via laughter rather than exorcism, geology as instrument—feels specific and non-obvious. The crocodile's tooth from "the River Styx's lesser cousin" and the clay-flute harmonization transform familiar psychopomp tropes. However, the emotional arc (grief → laughter → integration) follows a predictable template, and the collector's serene competence avoids bold risk. The "luminous ache" coinage aims for fresh idiom but reads as calculated lyricism. One fresh inflection (the harp realigning through play) elevates the piece above generic execution.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The lost soul collector is present throughout and her actions (climbing, playing the flute, opening her eyes) structure the sequence. However, her choices do not create key turns—she enacts a predetermined ritual without on-page hesitation, adaptation, or cost. The ghosts' transformation happens around her rather than because of a decision that alters her tactics. Functional but closer to observation than decision-making that reshapes the plot.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The crocodile's tooth appears in three beats: dawn-light catch, finger brush as she pauses, and the closure where it glows and metabolizes confession. It is handled, remembered, and returns with reweighted meaning (absorbing sorrow, glowing amber). Its specific property—grinding regret into grace—matters to the method. Not indispensable (a similar relic could substitute), but it shapes two beats and participates in closure, placing it in the essential range.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Spectral confessions are the mechanism: ghosts rise and layer their voices ("I forgot how to smile before I forgot my name"), the tooth absorbs them, and the harp realigns. The concept shapes stakes (she pursues confessions, not banishment) and tactics (she plays to harmonize, not overpower). Present in setup, middle pressure, and closure (confessions metabolized into grace). The concept is irreplaceable—removing it would collapse the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Modestly fearless" is declared in the opening line and restated midway ("Modest fearlessness was not the absence of dread, but the choice to kneel beside it"). It does not constrain or enable a visible action with cost—she never faces dread on the page or makes a trade-off between modesty and boldness. Label-only; no dramatized friction.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Pursue" frames the opening and recurs at closure ("The lost soul collector pursues, always"). It sets her task (pursuing fractured echoes) and differentiates her from banishment or punishment. However, the major turn—ghosts giggling—is not driven by pursuit but by her playing the flute. The action is thematic but does not redefine options at the climax. Present across beats but functionally swappable with "gather" or "tend."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The misaligned harp is signaled early ("distorted notes … humming wrong notes"), guides her navigation ("dissonance that guided her as surely as a map"), and realigns at closure ("harp's dissonance softened, realigned"). Its mechanics—geology warped by weeping, producing broken hymns—matter throughout. She plays "to harmonize with its brokenness, note by fractured note." The method is irreplaceable and drives two beats plus the closure image.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Echo Gorge supplies the harp (its geology), constrains her path (narrowing passage where laughter was last heard), and integrates the ghosts at closure (edges blur into stone, laughter seeps into wind and water). The setting is not postcard but active: "centuries of weeping had warped the rock's resonance, turning geology into instrument." It appears in setup, middle, and ending, shaping both method and outcome. Essential.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Hidden sunrise" anchors the opening and the final image ("sunrise now fully risen, gilding the gorge"). It establishes tone (hush, violet and gold) but does not tighten decisions—no clock pressure, no race against dawn. The timeframe is atmospheric rather than tactical. Present at beginning and end (lyric reprise) but does not constrain choices in the middle.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The motivation—"to integrate laughter into healing"—is declared and enacted: she plays the flute, the ghosts giggle, laughter weaves into the fabric. It shapes her choice to play rather than banish. However, the desire faces no on-page friction or cost; she succeeds smoothly. Told and shown but not conflicted. Present in setup, middle action, and closure participation, placing it in mid-range integration.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Luminous ache" is declared midway ("throat tight with luminous ache—that tender bruise of joy and loss pressed together") and colors the ending's emotional texture. The tone—lyric melancholy softened by hope—remains coherent through all beats and modulates subtly as the harp realigns. It charges the final image (smile, still remembering) but is stated rather than purely embodied. Consistent and purposeful but not indispensable; the scene's images could convey the tone without the label.</comment>
