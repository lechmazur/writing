<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's interior state is vivid and particular—"crestfallen," fingers tracing broken edges, stitching with purpose—but her motivation to "descend into necessary darkness" remains abstract and told rather than dramatized through micro-choices that reveal conflicting impulses. The decision to stitch fragments and step onto the tapestry reads as symbolic ritual rather than a choice with visible cost or competing wants. Emotional progression is poetic but lacks embodied contradiction; pain is declared ("Pain was the price of coherence") without showing her flinch or hesitate. No secondary character appears to test her stance, and the final transformation feels proclaimed rather than earned through on-page struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first paragraph. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the protagonist gathers fragments, stitches parchment, and the final image (painting on eyelids, box reassembling) reweights prior material. However, closure lacks visible cost—the box reassembles "not perfectly, but functionally," walls remain "intimate with collapse," yet no specific path is foreclosed or price paid on the page. The moment she steps onto the tapestry triggers inversion and cocoon, but causality is metaphorical rather than motivated by prior choice; luck or magic resolve the transformation without her agency narrowing options.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The forgotten library inside a lighthouse is signaled early and returns throughout: damp stone, salt-crusted windows, spiral staircase, shelves "leaning like drunkards." The setting constrains her isolation and provides materials (parchment, books, tarot box) that she handles across beats. The final beat—walls closing in "not to crush, but to cocoon"—charges the ending image with the location's pressure. Spatial choreography is clear (cross-legged on floor, barefoot on tapestry, staircase inverts above), and the lighthouse's crumbling state persists at closure, grounding the transformation in place.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—meeting fractures to find "the shape of a new whole"—is signaled early but remains abstract. One meaningful tightening occurs when she steps onto the stitched tapestry and the lighthouse groans, walls close in, sea rises vertically; this narrows physical and perceptual space. Yet the tightening is coincidental (the world responds to her foot contact) rather than driven by her agency trading one option for another. No visible price is paid; the transformation is described as "luminescent ache" and "bone must break to grow," but no specific capability, memory, or path is foreclosed on the page. The ending offers Charged Poise (the box hums, walls still intimate with collapse), but the cost remains conceptual rather than felt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme—transformation through necessary descent, coherence assembled from collapse—emerges from concrete images: broken tarot box, stitched parchment, Tower card mid-collapse with roots growing from rubble. Rhetorical questions function as tools rather than traps, and the final painting on eyelids (not canvas) answers the thematic question non-literally. The story resists tidy morals; the box reassembles imperfectly, the lighthouse still crumbles, suggesting transformation without redemption. However, the protagonist's epiphany ("crestRISEN") and the phrase "luminescent ache of transformation" edge toward stated theme rather than letting images carry the weight alone. No diagnostic label-speak in the final paragraph, but "not to crush, but to cocoon" glosses the moment rather than trusting the reader.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and consistent—"the walls began to close in, not physically, but perceptually"; "tuning forks struck by the dark"—creating a lyric texture appropriate to the protagonist's artistic sensibility. However, register occasionally drifts into abstract philosophizing ("truth had become a chorus of echoes") that distances the reader from embodied perception. Psychic distance tightens during action (stitching, stepping onto tapestry) but loosens during reflection. No dialogue. The perceptual signature is selective (she notices threads, light bending, silence pooling) but the voice sometimes sounds more like the story commenting on itself than the character experiencing it. Free indirect style is clean when present.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and figurative language is dense but mostly coherent. However, overwriting clusters in high-pressure beats: "luminescent ache of transformation: the kind that comes when bone must break to grow correctly, when silence must swallow sound to birth song" stacks metaphors without grounding in action. Paraphrase loop appears: "She didn't flinch. Pain was the price of coherence" restates her acceptance without adding pressure. Template cadence runs in the painting sequence: "She painted her mentor's vanished smile. She painted the Tower mid-collapse... She painted herself..." The abstract register ("perceptually," "metaphysical," "latent possibility") recurs in peak beats, dulling immediacy. Stock phrases: "wind through broken glass," "heart as tuning fork." No scaffold or synonym churn, and information density is high, but figurative muddle touches the closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The frame—portrait artist who hasn't painted in seven years stitches reality fragments in a lighthouse library—offers a specific synthesis of occupation, collapse, and liminal space. The tarot Tower card and mentor's mid-sentence vanishing provide fresh anchors. However, the emotional arc (descent into darkness → transformation → wings of stitched parchment) follows a familiar template of artistic resurrection without a non-obvious moral calculus. The protagonist's choices (pulling threads, stitching, stepping barefoot) feel symbolic rather than embodying lived trade-offs. Risk-taking in structure (mosaic of memory, inverted staircase, painting on eyelids) heightens atmosphere but does not obscure clarity. Specificity (ozone scent, nautical almanac, unborn colors) avoids generic placeholders, yet the ending's "crestRISEN" coinage and the walls-as-cocoon metaphor gesture toward profundity rather than earning it through particulars.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The crestfallen portrait artist is present throughout, stitching fragments and stepping onto the tapestry in the final third. Her choices (beginning to stitch, choosing not to take the newly appeared books, stepping barefoot) shape the sequence. However, the stitching is ritual rather than a decision with competing wants, and stepping onto the tapestry triggers transformation but does not foreclose an alternative path with visible cost. Early signal is strong; beat involvement spans at least two distinct moments (stitching, stepping); closure linkage is present (she paints on her eyelids, becomes "crestRISEN"). Swappability is low—remove "portrait artist" and the painting-on-eyelids closure loses specificity. Causal pressure is moderate; the transformation arises from her action but feels more symbolic than driven by stakes. Cost is conceptual (no longer crestfallen) rather than a specific trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The broken tarot box appears in the opening paragraph (she traces its splintered edges), returns in backstory (mentor's gift, the day it broke), and reassembles at closure ("had reassembled itself—not perfectly, but functionally"). Three-beat involvement. Early signal is strong. The box's brokenness mirrors the protagonist's fracture and the world's peeling seams; its reassembly "not perfectly, but functionally" reweights prior material at closure. However, the protagonist does not handle or use the box across beats—she stitches the Tower card (one of the scattered contents) but the box itself is static until it reassembles on its own. Causally, the box's reassembly is coincidental rather than earned by her action. Specificity is high (velvet-lined, hinges snapped, three pieces). Swappability is moderate; another broken container could serve with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Fragmented reality is signaled early ("the world began to peel at its seams, revealing the fragmented reality beneath") and shapes stakes throughout: corridors stretch, reflections blink independently, the lighthouse groans and inverts. The concept constrains her environment and informs her tactic of stitching fragments to assemble coherence. Multiple beats: walls close in perceptually, shelves exhale new books, sea rises vertically. Closure participation is strong—the transformation into "not one world, but many, overlapping" directly enacts the concept with cost (she remains in the crumbling lighthouse, acceptance rather than repair). Swappability is low; remove fragmentation and the stitching tactic and ending image collapse. Causal pressure is high; her method directly engages the fractured world. Cost is conceptual but legible: she integrates fragmentation rather than mending it.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Rhetorical questions appear in the first third ("Why do mirrors shatter before eyes close?" etc.) and return once in the middle ("Who decides when a fracture becomes a feature?"). The text declares "Rhetorical questions became tools, not traps," but on the page they function as atmosphere rather than constraining a choice. The protagonist asks them; the answer "didn't come as words, but as sensation," yet this does not alter her tactic or force a trade-off. Early signal is present. Beat involvement is two (opening cluster, middle instance). Closure linkage is absent—no question charges the final image. Swappability is high; replace rhetorical questions with poetic observations and the plot remains intact. Causal pressure is low; the questions reflect interiority but do not enable or constrain action. Cost is not visible.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Redesign" is signaled early in the middle section: "She began to redesign her understanding of the world, not with brushes or pigments, but by untangling threads." The action drives the stitching beats (pulling needle, stitching parchment and card and sketch together) and links to closure (the tapestry she steps onto, painting to redesign herself). Beat involvement is at least two (stitching sequence, final painting on eyelids). However, "redesign" is swappable with "rebuild," "reweave," or "reconstruct" without major plot impact. Causal pressure is moderate; the stitching enables the transformation, but the mechanics are symbolic rather than specific (threading moonlight, stitching maps of nonexistent stars). Cost is conceptual—she shifts from external painting to internal—but not a visible trade-off. Closure linkage is strong; the redesign culminates in self-painting.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Untangling threads is introduced early ("by untangling threads—literal and metaphysical") and demonstrated on the page: she pulls a needle, stitches fragments of parchment, torn pages, and memories. The method is literal (sewing) and metaphorical (mapping distortions, digging through collapse). Beat involvement is strong (stitching sequence spans multiple paragraphs, returns at closure when she steps onto the stitched tapestry). Closure linkage is present—the tapestry she created by stitching becomes the medium for transformation. However, the method's mechanics are vague (threads "whispered secrets," she threaded "moonlight through a tear"), making it more poetic device than constraint. Swappability is moderate; "weaving" or "binding" could replace "untangling" with minor edits. Causal pressure is moderate; the method enables the ending but does not force a choice with cost. Specificity is mixed—literal needle and thread, but metaphysical execution is abstract.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The forgotten library inside a lighthouse is anchored in the opening paragraph and returns across beats: damp stone floor, salt-crusted windows, shelves leaning, spiral staircase. The setting constrains her isolation and provides materials (books, parchment, tarot box) she handles. Three or more beats involve the space: opening, shelves exhaling new books mid-story, staircase inverting and walls closing at closure. Closure linkage is strong—the lighthouse groans, walls cocoon her, and the final line notes "the library was still forgotten, the lighthouse still crumbling." The setting's decay and enclosure directly shape the stakes (meeting fractures in a collapsing sanctuary). Swappability is low; the lighthouse's verticality (spiral staircase, inverted climb) and the library's archive function are irreplaceable. Causal pressure is high; the environment forces her descent and cocoon. Cost is visible: she remains in the crumbling structure, transformation without escape.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"When the walls close in" is signaled early in backstory ("the day the walls began to close in, not physically, but perceptually") and literalized at closure ("the walls, finally, fully closed in—not to crush, but to cocoon"). The timeframe is more metaphorical than literal; no live clock tracks minutes or hours. The closing-in recurs across beats (perceptual closure in the past, present isolation, final physical cocoon), but does not tighten tactics—she does not race a deadline or alter her method under time pressure. Early signal is present. Beat involvement is two (backstory trigger, closure moment). Closure linkage is strong; the walls' final closure enacts the transformation. However, swappability is moderate—"when reality fractures" or "when isolation deepens" could serve. Causal pressure is low; the walls respond to her stepping onto the tapestry rather than forcing her choice. Cost is conceptual.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The motivation "to descend into necessary darkness, to meet the fractures eye-to-eye" is declared early and restated ("She didn't flinch. Pain was the price of coherence"). It drives her stitching and stepping onto the tapestry. However, the desire is told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants—no moment where she hesitates, weighs escape versus descent, or pays a visible price to pursue it. Early signal is strong. Beat involvement spans the stitching sequence and the closure descent. Closure linkage is present—she closes her eyes, paints in darkness, and emerges "crestRISEN." Swappability is moderate; "to repair the broken" or "to embrace fragmentation" could substitute. Causal pressure is moderate; the motivation explains her actions but does not create friction or force a trade-off. Cost is asserted ("pain was the price") but not shown as a specific forfeiture.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Luminescent ache is embodied early ("the luminescent ache of transformation") and modulates across beats: opening crestfallen melancholy, mid-story laughter "like wind through broken glass," peak "cool pulse in fingertips, resonance in sternum," closure "luminescent ache" reprised. The tone remains consistent—lyric, elegiac, charged with paradox (collapse as cocoon, fracture as feature)—and does not flatten under pressure. Closure linkage is strong; the phrase "luminescent ache" reappears at the transformation beat, charging the final image. However, the tone is declared as much as demonstrated; "luminescent" is a chosen descriptor rather than arising purely from image and action. Swappability is low—the specific pairing of light and pain fits the artist's perception and the ending's paradox. Causal pressure is moderate; tone supports the stakes but does not constrain choice. Specificity is high.</comment>
