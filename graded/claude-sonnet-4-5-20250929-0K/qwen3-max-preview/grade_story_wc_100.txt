<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The undertaker's motivation is clear and embodied through his occupation and "inadvertently stubborn nature," driving his choice to answer the signals rather than ignore them. His micro-choices—tracing the crack, dismantling the lens with bone-handled tools, embedding shards—are concrete and pressure-driven. The final kneeling moment carries reverence rather than exhaustion, showing earned transformation. Internal contradiction is present but light; the character's emotional arc could deepen further through more conflicting impulses acting simultaneously in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors quickly: weary undertaker, drowned Vaelith, underwater library refuge. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural—density increases through layered signals, soul impressions, and the final transformation of distress into belonging. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): the undertaker's choice to walk deeper rather than surface forecloses rescue/escape with visible cost (his hands no longer tremble, he commits to more signals). One meaningful deepening occurs when he realizes the lens broadcasts rather than breaks, tightening his stake from burial to release.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The underwater library setting constrains choices throughout: burlap-wrapped package arrival, books floating in brine, cathedral-rib ceilings where he embeds prisms, marble statue's hollow eye. The lens shards become micro-setting elements that charge the final image—amber radiance pulsing through the library's bones. Sensory detail is vivid and selective: salt-crusted package, molars aching from resonance, silt brushing ankles. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from refuge to deepest stacks to archive of unsent letters, each location pressuring his mission.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: giving rest to the unquiet dead, now complicated by broadcasting distress signals. One meaningful tightening occurs when he realizes he can't bury or ignore the chorus—he must answer it by turning the lens into a beacon of release. The method (embedding prisms in impossible spaces) narrows his options and carries visible cost: he walks deeper rather than toward surface, committing to "more fractures to mend." Agency is present through his choice to dismantle, place, and activate rather than ignore, though the escalation could sharpen further with a clearer trade-off or obstacle.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: rest as architecture rather than erasure, belonging versus rescue, the transformation of distress into acknowledgment. The lens becomes a charged motif that shifts meaning—from broken to broadcasting to belonging. The final image (walking deeper toward unsent letters and half-finished symphonies) offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the question of how to house unrest without stating a moral. Subtext operates in gesture: kneeling in reverence, souls dissolving rather than erased, his stillness settling within rather than around him.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited throughout, with controlled psychic distance that tightens during peak beats (tracing the crack, embedding shards, kneeling). Perceptual signature is undertaker-specific: bone-handled tools, plot numbers and headstones as his lexicon, viewing the library as "mausoleum of knowledge" becoming "cathedral of quiet endings." Diction remains consistent—elegiac, reverent, precise—without register drift. The prose rhythm modulates with pressure, slowing for embedding beats and quickening for the final walk deeper. No dialogue present to evaluate; focalization clean with no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Information density is high; nearly every sentence advances the mission or deepens the undertaker's relationship to rest. Rhythm varies purposefully, with longer sentences during embedding and shorter ones at the kneeling beat. Minor overwriting appears in figurative density: "frozen lightning," "ghost-light," "tidal pull of unfinished business," "amber radiance"—each apt but clustering in the first half without pattern-teaching. One paraphrase loop: "not a grave / Not a marker / But a place" followed immediately by "The lens...no longer broadcasted distress. / It broadcasted belonging." No clarity harm to closure; the loop serves emphasis but could tighten.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of undertaker + underwater library + lighthouse lens as signal-answering is specific and non-obvious, transforming the familiar "giving rest" trope through the mechanics of broadcasting belonging. The image of embedding prisms into architecture to create a beacon of release rather than rescue feels fresh. Risk-taking in the commitment to lyric accumulation and the choice to walk deeper (not surface) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Emotional specificity avoids generic templates—souls as impressions rather than specters, acknowledgments rather than cries. The premise could push further into conflict or complication to fully escape the contemplative-mission template.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The weary undertaker drives all key turns: choosing not to ignore the lens, realizing it broadcasts, deciding to answer rather than bury, dismantling and embedding the prisms, activating the final shard, kneeling in reverence, and walking deeper. Introduced immediately, developed through multiple choices under pressure, and present in the closure beat where his hands no longer tremble and he commits to more signals. The cost is visible: he foregoes surface/escape and binds himself to ongoing impossible work.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The broken lighthouse lens appears in the opening, is handled and examined (tracing the crack, dismantling with bone-handled tools), embedded across multiple beats (walls, ceilings, silt floor, statue's eye), and its activation transforms distress signals into belonging. Its fractured state enables the broadcast mechanics; its prisms constrain the undertaker's method (each placement sends a shiver). Reweighted at closure: no longer broken or broadcasting distress, but "scattered across the library's bones" as belonging. Irreplaceable; no other object could serve this function.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distress signals shape the entire stake: the undertaker hears them as "harmonic tremors, frequencies only the dead or those near them could feel," each fracture emitting a different cry. The concept drives his tactics—he must answer them, not summon help. It reweights at closure: signals transform from cries for rescue into acknowledgments, thank-yous, goodbyes. The distress-to-belonging arc is the story's spine. Present by paragraph three, developed through embedding beats, and resolved in the closure image where the lens "broadcasted belonging."</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Inadvertently stubborn" is named early and visible in one key choice: "He would not ignore this." The trait enables his refusal to bury or ignore the signals, but the inadvertent quality isn't dramatized—his stubbornness reads as deliberate resolve. Cost is implied (he commits to impossible work) but not sharpened by the "inadvertent" dimension. The trait could constrain more beats or create friction if his stubbornness led to a visible mistake or trade-off. Present and functional, but the specific attribute's irreplaceability is low; generic determination could substitute.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Revitalize drives the major turn: the undertaker decides "to revitalize the signal—not to summon help, but to answer it. / To turn the lens into a beacon not of rescue, but of release." This redefines his stake and tactics, leading to the dismantling and embedding sequence. The method comes to him "in a dream" and shapes all subsequent beats. Present at the story's pivot (~40% mark), developed through the embedding sequence, and paid off when souls are released and signals transform. Irreplaceable; the story would collapse without this exact action.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Occupying impossible spaces" is named at the pivot: "places where time bent, where pressure didn't crush but cradled, where the living couldn't go but the dead still wandered." It frames his method—embedding shards in the deepest stacks, cathedral-rib chambers. The mechanics matter (each placement "sent a shiver through the water—not a tremor of collapse, but of awakening"), though the impossibility is asserted more than demonstrated through constraint. Functional across beats but could sharpen if the impossibility created a visible cost or obstacle. Present, developed, closure-adjacent.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The forgotten underwater library is introduced early as his "sanctuary, his self-imposed exile" and pressures every choice: books float in brine, spines bloated, ink bleeding into whispers. It supplies resources (the architecture for embedding: walls, ceilings, statue's hollow eye) and alters tactics (he moves to "the deepest stacks, where ceilings arched like cathedral ribs"). The library transforms from mausoleum to cathedral at closure, charged by the amber radiance. Spatial choreography is clean, moving from refuge to stacks to archive. Irreplaceable; no other setting could anchor this exact closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the mysterious package arrives" anchors the story's start and every beat follows causally from that arrival. The package triggers his realization, decision, and action sequence. Time doesn't tighten visibly—no countdown or urgency—but the window is coherent (one extended sequence from unwrapping to final walk). Functional and causal, but the timeframe itself doesn't constrain choices or shape tactics; "after arrival" is a narrative container rather than a pressure. Present and structurally sound, but swappable with minor edits (e.g., "after discovering the lens").</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The motivation "to give rest a permanent address" is stated early ("He'd spent his life giving rest a permanent address—plot numbers, headstones, whispered eulogies") and dramatized through every choice: refusing to ignore the signals, deciding to answer them, embedding prisms, and walking deeper to find more. Friction appears when the lens presents "a chorus of unrest" he can't bury or ignore, forcing him to redefine rest as belonging rather than burial. Cost is visible: his hands tremble at the start, steady at closure, and he commits to ongoing impossible work. The motivation charges the final image: "more rest to house."</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Chased stillness" modulates throughout: opening with trembling hands and "grief sank slower than elsewhere," intensifying through "the library groaned...not from pressure, but recognition," and resolving when "the chased stillness settle—not around him, but within him." Tone remains elegiac and reverent under pressure, with cadence slowing during embedding beats and quickening at the walk deeper. The final image is charged by tone: no longer chasing, he embodies stillness while moving toward more signals. Coherent, purposeful, and integral to closure, though one could argue the tone risks becoming static in the middle embedding sequence.</comment>
