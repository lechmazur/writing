<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara operates as a vehicle for lyric reflection rather than an agent under pressure. No on-page contradictory impulses or choice that forecloses a path; she ascends, sings, witnesses, and the "work" is done without friction. The vinyl shard's "golden filament" healing reads as symbolic convenience rather than earned cost. Interiority consists of abstract declarations ("she understood then") instead of embodied struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation is delayed—"ascended…to the radiant haven" appears before grounding who is acting or what choice anchors the present moment. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration via the final hymn and dissolution of the shard, but cost is asserted ("her work was done") rather than dramatized through a visible forfeiture or reweighted option. The "not by fixing…but by witnessing" summary tells the effect rather than showing a before/after legible through action.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The haven is described through vivid metaphor ("scent of hope: crisp as mountain air…sweet as bread rising") but remains a static backdrop. Spatial choreography is vague—figures "drift," Elara sits "on nothing"—with no grounding that constrains movement or choice. The vinyl shard is handled in multiple beats, meeting the micro-object test, and its dissolution charges the ending, lifting the score above pure ornament.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("execute a flawless goodbye" / "reunification") is signaled but not tested by opposition or tightening. No reversal or narrowing of options; the gathered souls simply respond positively to each hymn without resistance. The "reunion" unfolds as accumulation of successful moments rather than escalation under pressure. Cost is claimed ("by witnessing, by holding space in the breakage") but not demonstrated through a trade-off or forfeited alternative.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Theme (wholeness through brokenness, mundane as sacred) emerges from recurring images—vinyl shard, mundane hymns, golden filament sealing the crack. However, the final paragraph explicitly moralizes: "even endings…become beginnings" and "world made whole through gentle fractures." The piece leans on lush metaphor rather than letting specific actions and stakes generate resonance. The vinyl's transformation into "motes of light" tilts toward symbolic convenience.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with a lyric, elevated register ("decisively kind hand," "hymning the mundane"). Distance control is consistent but the diction often drifts into abstract poeticism ("pulsing stillness," "clinging like dew to spiderwebs") that flattens immediacy. No dialogue to test voice distinction. The elevated register is voice-motivated but lacks the perceptual signature or selective bias that would ground it in Elara's professional or personal lens under stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Pervasive overwriting: nearly every sentence in high-pressure beats deploys figurative language ("cloud-light," "incense," "filament," "motes," "honey on warm toast, salt on a lover's skin") without pattern-teaching or payoff, triggering the density penalty. Multiple paraphrase loops: "not grand requiems…but the ordinary turned sacred" restated across three consecutive sentences. Template cadence in the hymn catalog ("the squeak…the rustle…the clink…the sigh"). Figurative muddle: "scent of hope…could be tasted—like honey…like salt" mixes vehicles. Penalty: −1.2 in Q7 for density + loops + mixed metaphors; artifacts touch closure ("motes of light"), disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>Premise (hospice therapist ascends to afterlife, uses broken vinyl to sing souls into connection) is imaginative but leans on the "gentle guide helps souls transition" template without a non-obvious moral calculus or lived friction. The vinyl's healing and dissolution feel symbolically inevitable rather than earned by specific choice. Risk-taking in lyric density does not heighten stakes; instead it obscures causality. Transformation test: swap Elara's name and setting and the arc remains unchanged.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her "mission" frames the arc, but her choices do not create turns—she raises the shard, begins hymning, and succeeds without obstacle. Observation and witness dominate; no decision alters tactics or forecloses a path. Late middle development and no causal pressure: cap 3.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The vinyl shard is introduced early, handled in multiple beats (she cradles it, raises it, it glows, dissolves), and its dissolution shapes the ending image. Setup ✓, middle ✓, payoff ✓. However, its transformation (crack sealing with "golden filament," dissolving into "motes") is symbolic convenience rather than a cost-laden choice. Strong beat involvement and closure linkage lift the score; swappability and ornamental resolution in the final beat limit it to mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The scent of hope is described in vivid metaphor throughout but does not constrain or enable a choice. It "thickened," "curled," "became so thick it could be tasted," yet no character's action changes because of it. Present in setup, middle, and ending, but purely atmospheric. Functional presence without causal pressure: mid-4s.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Decisively kind" appears in the opening line ("a decisively kind hand") and is echoed abstractly at closure ("decisively kind hands"). No on-page moment where this trait constrains a choice or imposes a visible cost; it remains a label. Ornamental bookend without causal work.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Reunify" is stated as the mission ("to reunify…presence with peace") and the plot follows: souls gather, connect, reach out "to each other." Setup ✓, middle ✓, payoff ✓. However, the reunification is described rather than dramatized through a specific choice that narrows options. The action shapes the arc but could be swapped with "comfort" or "guide" without major structural change. Solid integration without irreplaceability: upper 5s.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Hymning the mundane" is signaled early ("began hymning the mundane") and its mechanics are shown across multiple beats (wheelchair brake, hospital sheets, IV drips, cartoon theme). Setup ✓, middle ✓, payoff ✓. The method drives at least two beats and contributes to the ending. However, the hymns succeed without friction or adaptation, limiting causal pressure. Essential across beats without felt cost: mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The "radiant haven above the clouds" is introduced early and described throughout. However, it functions as a static backdrop—"pulsed with stillness," "light began to mend"—without constraining movement or altering Elara's tactics. Postcard description without choice-level pressure. Setup ✓, middle ornamental, payoff ornamental: cap 4.6; strong metaphoric texture slightly lifts to 4.3 within that cap.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"After the blood work comes back" anchors the opening line but imposes no live clock. The phrase signals death has arrived, but no urgency or tightening follows; the narrative unfolds in a timeless, meditative register. Setup ✓, no middle development, no payoff. Present but inert.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Execute a flawless goodbye" is stated as Elara's goal in the opening and echoed at closure ("executed her flawless goodbye"). However, the desire is told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants or cost. No friction between the goal and an obstacle or alternative. Setup ✓, middle told-only, payoff told-only. Functional framing without pressure: mid-4s.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Pulsing stillness" is introduced early ("pulsed with stillness") and returned multiple times ("the pulsing stillness," "quiet hum"). The tone is coherent and modulates subtly (the scent thickens, light pulses brighter) but remains static in emotional register—no sharp turn or contrast. The phrase charges the final image ("surrounded by the pulsing stillness"). Setup ✓, middle ✓, payoff ✓, with modest modulation: mid-5s.</comment>
