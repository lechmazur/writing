<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elira's motivation is clear and her agency drives the climax, but interiority reads overwritten and abstractly poetic rather than embodied—"longing tempered to steel" and "surprise fate" are high-concept declarations, not lived contradictions in scene. The broken clock and film reel function more as symbolic props than objects that force micro-choices under pressure. Emotional progression is legible but the final moment ("didn't turn / Not yet") withholds agency rather than dramatizing a cost-laden choice, leaving the closure more gestural than earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed—we learn "tidal arbor above the clouds" and the pianist setup early, but the spatial logic (floating dais, projector mechanics, how film images materialize as compasses) remains vague past the first third, triggering a −0.3 penalty and capping Q3 at 7.0. The lens reads Accumulative/Textural: musical escalation layered with compass symbolism and clock ticks, building to the chord that "shatters" the horizon and summons laughter. Closure achieves Charged Poise—the final moment crystallizes Elira's defiance and reconfigures fate's script—but the cost (she doesn't turn toward the laughter) is oblique and felt rather than visible. One meaningful tightening (the clock advancing from 11:53 to midnight) reweights prior material, meeting the length default, but the film-reel mechanics and compass physics feel ornamental rather than causally constrained.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The tidal arbor is vividly rendered with silver bark, mist pockets, and cloud-sea below, and the setting constrains one key choice: Elira has mapped harmonic resonances to "bend local gravity" and "coax color from the monochrome sky," shaping her tactical approach to the final chord. The projector, piano, and moss-pulse details are sensory and purposeful. However, spatial choreography wobbles—how the film projects onto the canopy, where the compasses materialize relative to Elira, and the mechanics of "threads of starlight from below the clouds" remain abstract. Capped at 7.0 per the Orientation Test penalty applied in Q2.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: surprise fate by playing an unplanned encore. The escalation is coherent under the Accumulative lens—Elira layers chords, the arbor responds, the clock ticks forward, compasses align—culminating in the final chord that "shatters" the horizon into dawn. However, agency at closure is muted: the chord is "woven from surprise, defiance, and steely longing" (abstract labels), and the laughter's arrival feels more like a plot gift than a consequence of prior tactical choices. One meaningful tightening (clock advancing, compasses freezing) narrows options, but the cost is implied rather than visible on the page. No explicit price paid for the harmonic gambit beyond "the film reel burst into flame, harmless and bright"—the "harmless" qualifier undercuts stakes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme—defiance of fate, art as rebellion, strategic creativity against causality's bureaucracy—emerges organically from Elira's actions and the recurring compass/clock motifs. The final image (laughter echoing, Elira choosing not to turn "Not yet") reweights prior material with a non-literal answer to the central question. However, several lines veer into on-the-nose philosophizing: "fate was a meticulous archivist" and "She composed around its edges, slipped between its ledger lines" are overt meta-statements that replace scene pressure. The film reel's "emotional coordinates: regret, defiance, euphoria, rupture" reads like a thematic checklist rather than discovered meaning. The ending avoids a stated moral but the conceptual cost (what Elira loses by not turning) remains oblique.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Voice is densely textured with elevated diction ("violet yawn," "bureaucrat of causality," "syncopated grace") that reads consistent and purpose-driven, establishing a lyric register appropriate to the protagonist's artistic identity. However, under peak pressure the prose remains ornamental rather than sharpening—"a chord that didn't exist in any known scale—a sound woven from surprise, defiance, and steely longing" is abstractly poetic when urgency would compress. Focalization is stable third-limited; no head-hopping. Psychic distance stays consistent. The "Not yet" final beat is clean and voice-coherent, but perceptual signature is more decorative than character-specific—Elira's way of noticing reads like authorial lyricism rather than a pianist's trained ear for harmonic mechanics.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Overwriting pervades: nearly every sentence in high-pressure beats carries figurative language ("ripples across the cloud-sea," "jagged shadows through the arbor's lattice," "threads of starlight from below the clouds"), triggering −0.5 for density without pattern-teaching or payoff. Mixed metaphors: "fate was a meticulous archivist" filing "deviations" under "anomalies to be corrected" clashes with "She composed around its edges, slipped between its ledger lines"—fate shifts from filing cabinet to musical staff without coherent vehicle. Register drift: "bureaucrat of causality" and "emotional coordinates" are academic abstractions outside a crisis POV. Template cadence in the buildup: "She played faster. / Not with desperation, but precision... / Each note was a calculated risk... / The broken anniversary clock began to tick..." uses parallel stems across four consecutive beats, applying −0.4. Paraphrase loop: "The flickering compass materialized" / "The flickering compasses—now a constellation" restates without adding pressure, −0.2. Total artifact deduction −1.1 in Q7. Figurative muddle in the climax (the chord that "shatters" the horizon "into dawn" while the reel "burst into flame, harmless and bright") obscures causality, but the closure image lands legibly enough to avoid routing the break to Q2. Information density is high but momentum drags under ornamental weight.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The premise—pianist above the clouds using music to manipulate physics and defy fate, guided by a dead lover's film-reel map—is imaginative and synthesizes familiar SFF tropes (music magic, pocket dimensions, grief quests) into a fresh configuration. However, the "surprise fate" motivation and "strategic creativity vs. destiny's script" frame echo common writing-prompt templates (artist protagonist uses unusual method to achieve audacious goal), applying a −0.8 derivative premise adjustment within Q8. Execution shows bold risk-taking (lyric accumulation, abstract mechanics, no villain) that heightens thematic stakes, but the arbor's physics and the film-compass system remain ornamental rather than causally grounded, limiting irreplaceability. The final chord and laughter echo feel emotionally specific yet the transformation test is mixed—swap "pianist" for "sculptor" and "chords" for "clay" and the arc holds, suggesting insufficient particularity. One fresh inflection: the "Not yet" ending refuses tidy reunion, committing to ambiguity with cost.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elira is introduced early (first paragraph), drives the entire narrative arc through her decision to play the final chord, and appears in the closure beat. She decodes the film, maps harmonic resonances, and executes the climactic performance—three distinct causal beats. Her trait ("strategically creative") enables the tactic of composing "around fate's edges." However, her choices trend reactive to setup (the compass points, she follows; the film instructs "Play until the needle stills," she obeys) rather than generative, and the final decision to withhold turning feels more symbolic than cost-laden. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +1.2, minor swappability friction −0.4 (her pianist identity is ornamental—another artist type could execute similar defiance). Rounded down: 6.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The broken anniversary clock is introduced early (paragraph 5), handled in two distinct beats (mid-story it "emitted a single, metallic tick" at 11:54, then ticks forward to 11:55, 11:59, and finally "chimed midnight—and kept going"), and appears at closure as part of the temporal rupture signaling success. Its frozen hands at 11:53 anchor Elira's grief and the timeframe stakes. However, its function is more symbolic than causal—it marks time but does not constrain her tactics or force a tradeoff. Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, moderate causal pressure +0.8 (it validates success but doesn't shape attempts), specificity +0.4 (the 11:53 detail is unique), but swappability −0.5 (another broken timepiece would serve). Rounded down: 6.2.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Flickering compasses are seeded early ("hidden sections... frames spliced with musical notations only she could decipher. / Each flickering compass etched into the celluloid pointed not north, but toward emotional coordinates"), drive three beats (first compass appears and points to "defiance," prompting the minor seventh; later "a constellation above her" snaps into alignment; at closure "The compasses froze"), and shape the protagonist's tactical choices throughout. They are indispensable to the story's logic—remove them and Elira has no map, no method to navigate fate. Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, strong causal pressure +1.4, closure linkage +1.5, irreplaceability +0.7, cost connection +0.4 (following the compass subjects her to its volatility). No major frictions. Rounded down: 7.1.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Strategically creative" is named explicitly ("Strategically creative, Elira had mapped every harmonic resonance...") and illustrated through her approach: mapping resonances, tuning compositions to bend gravity, composing "around fate's edges" rather than fighting head-on. It enables the climactic tactic of the final chord. However, the trait is told more than dramatized—we see results (colors, wind-chords) but not the on-page trial-and-error that would show the strategic process under pressure. The "disastrous fugue that summoned hailstones" is summary-only, −0.6. Early signal +0.5, one causal beat +0.4, causal pressure +0.8, but swappability −0.5 (another competence label like "resourceful" or "adaptive" would fit), summary-only use −0.6. Rounded down: 4.9.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Refuge" is the designated action element. The arbor functions as Elira's refuge—"a fortress of improvisation, built note by note above the clouds where no bureaucrat of causality could reach her." It is introduced early and frames the setting throughout, but "refuge" as an action is passive: it describes the arbor's role rather than a specific deed Elira performs. The active choice is "playing," not "refuging." The arbor constrains one tactic (she must stay there to access its resonances) and the setting charges the final image, but "refuge" itself is more a premise than a turn-generating action. Early signal +0.4, causal pressure (indirect) +0.6, closure linkage (setting-level) +0.8, but swappability −0.7 (rename it "sanctuary" or "hideaway" and the logic holds). Rounded down: 5.7.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Hidden sections in the film reel are introduced early (paragraph 10), their mechanics explained (silent film frames spliced with musical notations, compasses pointing to emotional coordinates), and they drive three beats: Elira decodes them over months, threads a spliced segment into the projector mid-performance, and the reel "burst into flame" at closure. The method is indispensable—without the film's instructions ("Play until the needle stills"), Elira has no guidance for the final chord. Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, strong causal pressure +1.4, closure linkage +1.6, irreplaceability +0.8, cost connection +0.5 (decoding required months of effort, the reel's destruction is the price of success). Minor friction: the projection mechanics are vague, −0.2. Rounded down: 7.4.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The tidal arbor is introduced in the opening line, described throughout with vivid sensory detail (silver bark, mist pockets, cloud-sea, roots pulling starlight), and its unique properties—harmonic resonances that can "bend local gravity, summon wind-chords, and coax color"—constrain Elira's tactics and enable the climactic chord. The arbor "leaned into the chord progression" and "shuddered" in response, making it an active participant. It charges the final image (horizon shattering into dawn, laughter echoing). Early signal +0.8, two beats +0.9, strong causal pressure +1.3, closure linkage +1.4, irreplaceability +0.7, cost connection +0.3. However, spatial choreography wobbles (vague projector placement, unclear compass materialization), −0.5. Capped at 7.0 per the Q2 Orientation Test penalty, but raw score before cap: 6.9. Rounded down: 6.9.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Until the horizon invites night" is the timeframe element. The horizon's violet yawn and the approach of night are mentioned early and frame the narrative clock. The story tracks time explicitly (the clock advances from 11:53 to midnight), and the climax occurs as "The horizon darkened, but not with night—with anticipation" followed by "it shattered into dawn," inverting the expected arrival of night. The timeframe creates urgency and the final reversal (dawn instead of night) charges the closure. Early signal +0.6, closure linkage +1.2, moderate causal pressure +0.7 (the clock ticks forward but doesn't force tactical changes), specificity +0.4. However, the timeframe is more atmospheric than constraining—Elira's actions don't race against a hard deadline. Swappability −0.4 (another time-of-day frame would work). Rounded down: 5.3.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The motivation "to surprise fate with an unplanned encore" is stated explicitly in paragraph 4 and dramatized throughout: Elira decodes the film, maps resonances, and builds toward the final chord designed to "fracture destiny's script." The motivation drives all three acts and is tested at closure when the chord succeeds (laughter echoes, clock chimes past midnight). Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, strong causal pressure +1.3, closure linkage +1.5. However, the motivation is declared more than conflicted—Elira's commitment never wavers, and no on-page friction forces her to weigh the cost of defying fate versus accepting loss. The final "didn't turn / Not yet" is a refusal to complete the reunion, but the internal tension (why not turn?) is oblique. Cost connection +0.3, but told-only desire −0.5, lack of friction −0.4. Rounded down: 6.4.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Steely longing" is the tone element. The prose sustains a consistent register of elevated, poetic grief laced with defiance: "longing tempered to steel," "grief and triumph," "strategic creativity." The tone modulates purposefully—lyric and mournful in the setup (anniversary clock, vanished lover), tightening to tactical precision in the buildup ("calculated risk," "harmonic gambit"), and charging the final image with both cost and hope (laughter echoing, Elira's choice not to turn). Early signal +0.7, coherent across turns +1.2, closure charge +1.4, tone-pressure alignment +0.8. However, the tone occasionally tips into overwriting that diffuses rather than sharpens pressure ("violet yawn," "bureaucrat of causality"), −0.5. Rounded down: 6.6.</comment>
