<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The seer's interiority leans heavily on abstract layering ("mercury-glass," "obsidian wind," "frequency of home") without embodied contradiction or micro-choices under immediate pressure. Her backstory of finding others' talents is told rather than shown affecting present action. The final kneeling moment ("not in worship, but in arrival") gestures toward resolution but lacks visible cost or a foreclosed path—she simply receives sanctuary. Internal voice is dense and consistent, but the protagonist's agency reads passive throughout.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through sensory density and motif recurrence rather than causal turns. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (arrival/sanctuary), but the cost remains conceptual and atmospheric rather than legible in a specific forfeiture or trade-off. The stone cracks and the room appears; no prior option is visibly foreclosed. Orientation anchors (who/where) arrive within the opening paragraph. The piece teaches its lyric pattern early and holds it, but the final image does not reweight prior material with undeniable pressure—it delivers rather than charges.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The mountain-bookstore supplies vivid, purposeful detail: shelves as tectonic plates, inverted atriums, the seventh sub-basement. The architecture "breathes" and rearranges in response to the seer's action, directly enabling the climactic threshold. Sensory selection (mercury slide, parchment whisper, feather texture) is filtered through the seer's craft. The recurring stone and feather constrain the ritual method. The final room's specifics (jars of laughter, pressed flowers) charge the closure image with tangible anchors, lifting the category into the mid-7s despite the abstract tone.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: finding/remembering the shape of home. The piece declares intensification ("remembering became painful") but no on-page reversal or tightening narrows options—the seer performs a ritual, it succeeds, sanctuary appears. Agency is ritual execution rather than a choice with alternatives. The feather and stone function as props in a sequence that unfolds without friction or cost. Under Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening is sufficient, but here the accretion does not reweight the stake with visible price; the ending grants rather than tests.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme (home as frequency, not place; belonging through texture and memory) emerges clearly from image and action rather than statement. The final image offers a resonant answer without overt moral. However, the thematic resolution is granted rather than earned—no trade-off or ambiguity complicates the arrival. The stone's "purpose fulfilled" and the seer's welcoming of the past read tidy. Subtext operates in gesture and sensory detail, and the piece avoids sermonizing, but the lack of friction or counter-pressure keeps it from the higher band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Single POV, stable third-limited with a dense, lyric register. Perceptual signature is consistent: the seer notices textures, fragments, architectural memory. Diction is elevated and voice-specific ("tactile luminescence," "quicksilver struck by moonlight"), though the uniformly ornate register risks flattening urgency. No head-hopping. Free indirect style is clean. Psychic distance remains narrow throughout. The prose holds a singular, purposeful texture, but the lack of modulation under pressure (every beat carries the same metaphorical density) slightly dulls momentum.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Figurative density is extremely high: nearly every sentence carries metaphor or abstraction ("obsidian wind," "tactile luminescence," "gravity... as sanctuary returning"), obscuring concrete cause-and-effect at peak beats. Paraphrase loops appear: "not magic... but the shape of home" recurs conceptually across multiple paragraphs. Template cadence: "not [X], but [Y]" structures proliferate (five instances). Information density is uneven—long descriptive passages advance atmosphere but not plot. Sentence rhythm is consistent but does not vary with scene pressure. Artifacts touch the closure beat (final two paragraphs), triggering penalties and disallowing 9+ globally per the rubric.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of bookstore-as-archive, lost-language ritual, and texture-as-truth is specific and purposeful. The feather-as-method and stone-as-key show imaginative detail. However, the core arc (lonely seeker performs ritual, finds sanctuary) is a familiar template, and the story does not transform it through non-obvious moral calculus or lived friction. The resolution grants the protagonist's desire without complication. The piece commits fully to its lyric premise and executes it cleanly, but the lack of risk or counter-pressure keeps it from higher originality bands.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The mercury-glass seer is named early and present throughout. Her choices (tracing the stone, placing the feather, stepping through the archway) drive the sequence, but these are ritual steps rather than dilemmas with alternatives. She does not face a turn or cost that alters tactics. Present in closure (kneeling, placing the stone), but her agency is passive receipt. Two gates (setup, closure presence) met; development beat is ritual execution without friction. Mid-band for functional presence without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The lost language stone appears in paragraph three, handled across multiple beats: traced, pressed to foreheads (backstory), rippled, cracked open, placed on the floor. It enables the ritual and cracks to release sanctuary, directly shaping the climax. Reweighted at closure when it "stilled—its purpose fulfilled." Three gates met (setup, middle use, closure participation) with visible causal role. Specificity: "egg-shaped relic humming with syllables." Scores in the 7–8.4 band for essential presence across beats and ending contribution.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Buried talents are mentioned in backstory ("poets who sculpted time, cartographers who mapped dreams") and the seer's final act involves resurrecting her own talent. However, the concept operates as theme rather than shaping on-page stakes or tactics. The dominant conflict is finding home, not unearthing talent. The burial/resurrection metaphor enriches subtext but does not constrain choice or alter the closure outcome. Present but replaceable; swappable with "finding lost identity" or "recovering memory" without structural change. Functional but mid-low band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Substitutes reality... nightly" is mentioned once in paragraph five ("Each night, she substituted reality... rebuilding the world"). It contextualizes her past coping but does not constrain or enable an on-page action with cost. The current ritual replaces rather than continues this practice. Label-only; no visible trade-off or tactical consequence. Ornamental backstory detail. Absent from middle beats and closure. Single mention without pressure or cost trends low.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Seed" structures the action: "she would seed a new truth" (paragraph six), the feather "dissolved" and "imprinted onto the stone," which "cracked open" to release sanctuary. The seeding initiates the climax and is irreplaceable—without it, the closure mechanism fails. Setup in paragraph six, executed in paragraphs twelve–fourteen, present in closure. Three gates met. Causal role is clear. However, the action is ritual completion without alternatives or visible cost, capping it below 7.0. Scores solidly for beat involvement and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Via the texture of a feather" is signaled in paragraph six and executed in paragraphs seven, twelve, and thirteen. The feather is placed, glows with "tactile luminescence," guides her fingers, and dissolves to imprint the stone. Mechanics matter: texture as method is specific and shapes the ritual. Three gates met (setup, middle use, closure participation). However, it functions as a ritual ingredient rather than constraining choice or imposing cost. Scores in the 5–7 range for purposeful involvement across beats without elevating irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The labyrinthine bookstore occupying a mountain is anchored early and recurs: seventh sub-basement, spiraling staircases, inverted atriums, shelves as tectonic plates. The architecture "groans," "shifts," and rearranges to form an archway, directly enabling the climax. The bookstore supplies the ritual space and responds to the seer's action. Three gates met. Spatial choreography is coherent. It pressures choices (decades of navigation) and charges the final image (the new room). Scores solidly in mid-6s for beat involvement and closure contribution.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"After remembering becomes painful" establishes the inciting condition in paragraph two and recurs in the final line. It frames backstory and motivation but does not function as a live clock tightening on-page decisions. The timeframe is retrospective context rather than escalating pressure. Setup present; closure callback present; middle development absent (no ticking urgency). Two gates yield eligibility to ~6.0, but lack of tactical constraint lowers the score. Lyric reprise reweights slightly, landing in the 4–5 band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"The shape of home" is dramatized throughout: paragraph four declares it, paragraph fifteen realizes it ("Home was not a place... but a frequency"), and the final room embodies it. The desire drives the ritual and is tested by visible cost (kneeling, welcoming pain). Three gates met (setup, middle pursuit, closure satisfaction). Friction: "raw nerve of her soul," "flinch at the past." The motivation shapes tactics and charges the ending. Scores in the 7–8.4 band for beat involvement, cost connection, and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Hidden thunder" is declared in the penultimate paragraph: "thunder growled—hidden, distant, but undeniable." The tone throughout is subdued, layered, atmospheric—consistent with "hidden" intensity. It modulates slightly (dense description → ritual climax → quiet arrival) but remains in a narrow lyric register. The final thunder image charges closure by acknowledging the shift. Setup is implicit; closure participation is explicit. Two gates met. Coherent and purposeful, but static mood through most beats keeps it mid-band. Lyric reprise lifts it slightly above 5.0.</comment>
