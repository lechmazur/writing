<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The hourglass turner possesses a distinct perceptual signature—viewing prophecy through buttons and echoes—with consistent interiority grounded in her ritual work. However, her character remains static throughout; she begins as a patient cataloger and ends the same way, with no internal contradiction forcing a difficult choice. The "recognition" moment when the echo speaks clearly feels declarative rather than earned through prior struggle. Agency is present in her teaching and jar-distribution, but no visible cost forecloses a path on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with mosaic structure (warehouse work → echo speaking → jar distribution → teaching → final image). Orientation anchors arrive late—"hourglass turner," "amber warehouse beneath cliffs," and her cataloging practice emerge across the first third without early spatial grounding. The closure unit attempts Conceptual Repricing ("prophecy was stitched in silence"), but the cost remains abstract; no specific choice or renunciation forecloses a path on the page. The escalation is density-driven rather than causal, which fits the lens, but the final image recycles the opening ritual (sand falling, echoes humming) without reweighting prior stakes through a visible pivot.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The amber warehouse is vividly realized—resin, rust, high slits, shelves of jars—and the cliff underbelly creates a purposeful contrast to the "truth unraveling overhead." The buttons function as micro-setting objects that constrain her method (hue, wear, fracture cataloging). The canyon echo jar is handled across multiple beats and directly enables the climactic clarity moment. Spatial choreography remains coherent throughout the warehouse and crossroads scenes, and sensory detail (dust motes, bone-flute hiss) is selective and POV-filtered.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—unscrambling the prophet's final words to transform prophecy into shared possibility—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates through her cataloging ritual and the echo's resistance, then shifts when the echo speaks clearly and she begins distributing jars. However, no on-page reversal narrows her options with visible cost; the transition from solitary work to teaching happens off-page ("She began leaving small jars"), and the cliffs' final trembling is environmental rather than protagonist-driven. One meaningful deepening occurs when the echo's clarity prompts her methodological shift, but the cost is conceptual rather than felt in a specific forfeiture.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the button-cataloging particulars: prophecy as assembled fragments rather than divine declaration, wisdom made portable rather than temple-locked. The final image attempts to answer the thematic question non-literally, but "prophecy was stitched in silence, buttoned to the soul, and waiting—always waiting—to be unscrambled" is an explicit thesis statement that replaces resonance with declaration (−0.6). The buttons and echoes function as motifs that recur with purpose, though the closing summary ("The world thought prophecy was written in lightning. She knew it was stitched in silence") feels sermonic. The piece resists simplistic binaries and earns its insights through the character's patient work.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited throughout with a distinct perceptual signature—filtering prophecy through craft metaphors (spinning, stitching, mending sails). Psychic distance is controlled and diction stays consistent ("quietly inspired," "the humility of small things") with purposeful compression in lyric passages. No dialogue appears, so those bullets do not apply. The narrative certainty matches what the focalizer can know, and the free-indirect style remains clean. Rhythmic control is strong, modulating between contemplative stretches and the charged echo-speaks moment without head-hopping or filter-verb stacks.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Information density is high and figurative language is purposeful (sand as truth, buttons as choice archaeology), but template cadence appears in repeated sentence stems: "She [verb]" opens multiple paragraphs without variation, and several lines paraphrase adjacent content (e.g., multiple restatements of prophecy-as-assembly). The opening and closing paragraphs demonstrate strong rhythmic control, and the piece avoids filter-verb stacks. Proofreading is clean. However, the final two paragraphs loop thematic summary ("prophecy was written in lightning" / "stitched in silence") rather than advancing through image, and "quietly inspired" appears as a label across multiple beats without embodied cost in each instance (−0.6 for template cadence and paraphrase loops in non-closure beats).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of prophecy-as-craft, lost-button archaeology, and portable wisdom-jars offers a fresh angle on divination narratives. The warehouse-beneath-cliffs setting and the specific cataloging method (hue, wear, fracture) avoid generic fantasy tropes. However, the "quietly inspired artisan unscrambles cosmic truth through humble objects" template is recognizable, and the piece does not transform it with high-stakes moral calculus or an unexpected consequence. The emotional truth—patience and attention over grandeur—is earned, but the trajectory from solitary work to distributed teaching follows a predictable arc. The canyon-echo capture and button-as-decision-fragment are specific enough to avoid derivative labeling.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The hourglass turner is present throughout and her cataloging shapes the narrative texture, but her key decision—to distribute jars at crossroads—happens off-page in summary ("She began leaving small jars"). Early ritual (flipping the hourglass, arranging buttons) establishes her method but does not narrow options under pressure. The recognition moment when the echo speaks clearly is reactive observation rather than a choice-driven turn. She appears in the final image but without a visible pivot that alters tactics or forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The canyon echo jar is introduced early (paragraph 4), handled in multiple beats (she cross-references its murmurs, it shudders and speaks clearly, later it multiplies), and directly enables the climactic clarity moment. It returns in the final image with reweighted meaning (from solitary riddle to distributed tool). However, the jar's mechanics remain abstract—it "never lied, but never spoke plainly"—and its sudden clarity feels convenient rather than earned through the protagonist's cataloging work. The element shapes two key beats and participates in closure, meeting the two-gate threshold and earning mid-6 range, but swappability (any captured voice could serve) and the lack of visible cost tied to its use prevent higher scores.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Shared wisdom appears as both thematic claim and on-page action: the protagonist leaves jars at crossroads and teaches travelers to "listen to buttons." This action occurs in the story's second half and alters her tactics from solitary unscrambling to distributed pedagogy, meeting the Development gate. The concept shapes the resolution (hands reaching for jars to "weave tomorrow") and charges the final image. However, the cost of sharing is never dramatized—no resistance, no depletion, no visible tradeoff. The concept is signaled late (after the echo speaks) and its mechanics are summary-told rather than shown in a specific teaching scene. Two gates met (Development, Payoff) with causal pressure but abstract cost: mid-5 range.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Quietly inspired" appears as a paragraph-nine label ("She was quietly inspired—not by grandeur or revelation, but by the humility of small things") and recurs in paragraph 19 and the final spread as a descriptor for other hands. It frames her approach but does not constrain a specific on-page action with visible cost. The trait is consistent with her patient cataloging, but it functions as thematic coloring rather than a decision-shaping attribute. Ornamental use without causal pressure: low-3 range.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Unscramble" is introduced early (paragraph 5: "She'd unscramble his final words") and recurs as the story's central action. However, the unscrambling process itself—cross-referencing button characteristics against echo murmurs—is described rather than dramatized in a specific attempt. The echo's sudden clarity in paragraph 14 is not shown as the result of her cataloging breakthrough but arrives as environmental event. The action shapes the premise and reappears in the ending ("to unscramble their own fate"), meeting Setup and Payoff gates, but the missing middle dramatization of the method's mechanics caps the score. Two gates, lyric reprise, but swappable with "decode" or "interpret" without structural loss: mid-4 range.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Cataloging lost buttons is introduced paragraph 5, detailed in paragraphs 6–7 (hue, wear, fracture cross-referenced against echo murmurs), and taught to travelers in paragraph 23 (scuff speaks hesitation, missing shank speaks abandonment). The method shapes her daily ritual and enables the teaching beats, meeting Setup and Development gates. The buttons appear in the final image as tools for "unscrambling." However, the cataloging never produces an on-page breakthrough—the echo's clarity arrives without shown causality from button arrangement. The ivory button placement (paragraph 14) triggers the echo's speech, meeting all three gates, but the mechanics feel arbitrary (why this button?) rather than earned through prior pattern. Three gates met with moderate causal pressure but weak specificity: low-5 range.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The amber warehouse beneath cliffs is introduced paragraph 1 and detailed across paragraphs 11 and 21 (resin, rust, shelves of jars, high slits). It provides resources (the echo jar, the slate trays) and creates thematic contrast (underground patient work vs. overhead chaos), meeting Setup and Development gates. The warehouse becomes "a sanctuary for those who sought not answers, but tools" (paragraph 21), participating in closure. The cliffs' final trembling (paragraph 27) provides environmental punctuation. However, the setting does not constrain a tactical choice—she could catalog anywhere—and its properties (amber, beneath cliffs) are descriptive rather than mechanically significant. Three gates met with thematic resonance but low causal constraint: low-6 range.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>"As the truth unravels" appears in the title position (paragraph 12) and recurs in paragraphs 21 and 29 as framing device. It provides thematic urgency (kings issue edicts in vanishing ink, wars spark) but does not tighten on-page decisions—no countdown, no visible deadline pressure. The hourglass measures "the slow collapse of certainty" (paragraph 2) rather than tracking elapsed time, and the protagonist's work proceeds at her own contemplative pace. The timeframe sets atmospheric context and charges the final contrast (truth unraveling above / hands weaving below), meeting Setup and Payoff gates, but the lack of middle tactical pressure and clock-driven urgency keeps the score in mid-4 range. Two gates, thematic resonance, no tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"To spin a prophecy into raw possibility" is articulated paragraph 10 ("prophecy wasn't prediction—it was raw possibility") and enacted when she begins distributing jars (paragraphs 20–24). The desire drives her teaching and reappears in the closure claim (paragraph 25: "She spun prophecy into raw possibility by refusing to let wisdom remain locked"). However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choices—no scene shows her weighing the cost of sharing versus hoarding, no friction between personal revelation and public distribution. The desire shapes the story's second-half trajectory, meeting Development and Payoff gates, but the lack of on-page friction and visible tradeoff keeps the score below 5. Two gates, causal shaping, but told-only friction: high-4 range.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Unearthed silence" is embodied in the opening ("silence had the weight of forgotten vows") and sustained through "dust motes hung like suspended breath," "echoes, cataloged and corked," and the protagonist's patient, wordless cataloging. The tone modulates when the echo speaks clearly (paragraph 15) and again when she begins distributing jars, shifting from solitary contemplation to quiet pedagogy. The final image layers silence with action ("quietly inspired hands reached for jars") rather than breaking it, and the closing line ("waiting—always waiting—to be unscrambled") preserves the unearthed quality. However, "unearthed" specifically (implying excavation/discovery) is less active than "preserved" or "patient," and the tone is consistent rather than charged by pressure. Three gates met with coherent modulation and closure resonance: mid-5 range.</comment>
