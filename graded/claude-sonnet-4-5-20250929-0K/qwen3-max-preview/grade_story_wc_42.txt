<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elira exists primarily as a vessel for metaphysical abstraction rather than a character with contradictory impulses acting in scene. Her motivation "to harness the ephemeral" is declared but never dramatized through conflicting wants or visible cost-bearing choices. The piece offers label-only interiority ("luminous ache," "bittersweet throb") without embodied emotion or micro-choices that foreclose paths. The mentor's vanishing and childhood orchard are summary-only backstory that do not tilt present stance through on-page action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation Test: who and where are anchored early, but "when" remains vague ("Time of Shaking Foundations") without clock or constraint legibility; apply −0.4. The closure unit attempts Resonant Reconfiguration but the "restructuring" occurs through metaphor ("time braided," "grammar restructured") without visible cost or forecloses options—no decision, renunciation, or endurance with on-page price. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, yet no cadence shift or density break reweights the stake; the hand "slows" but "never stopped," leaving the change ambiguous. Cost proof test fails: no exact sentence shows what Elira loses or pays.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The lunar observatory, brass chronometer, glass dome, and plinth anchor spatial detail early and recur through the piece. However, the setting functions primarily as backdrop for metaphysical narration; it does not constrain a choice or alter tactics. The clouds "stilling" and stars "flickering" are effects, not pressures. The chronometer (object-as-setting) is handled in multiple beats and charges the final sequence, lifting the score into the 5-band despite limited tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"harness the ephemeral" / "restructure time's architecture"—is signaled early but remains abstract. No on-page reversal or tightening narrows options; the hand slows when Elira waits and remembers, without prior failure or visible trade-off. The "Time of Shaking Foundations" is environmental set-dressing, not a force that escalates or tests commitment. Agency is passive (waiting, listening) and the resolution occurs through metaphor rather than decision with felt cost. Escalation under Accumulative lens requires density shift or cadence break; none is legible here.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Theme ("escape velocity," "letting go," "tenderness over force") is stated repeatedly rather than earned through scene particulars. The final paragraph moralizes: "not by breaking free, but by becoming weightless within the flow"—a Thematic Echo that replaces dramatized cost with abstract thesis (−0.6). The leaf-falling motif recurs but does not constrain choice or accumulate pressure; it is invoked as solution without groundwork. No resonant, non-literal answer; instead, the text tells the reader what the story means.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Elira. However, register drifts into elevated abstraction ("restructuring energy, a soft command whispered to the fabric of causality") that feels authorial rather than character-bound. Perceptual signature is generic; Elira's observations ("luminous ache," "bittersweet throb") recur as interchangeable phrases rather than character-specific texture. Syntactic variety is present but rhythm does not modulate with emotional intensity—every beat carries the same lyric weight, flattening urgency. No dialogue to assess.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade: "not to freeze time, but to restructure it" / "not by thrust, but by tenderness; not by breaking free, but by becoming weightless" recur as template parallelism without added pressure (−0.6). Figurative density is high across most sentences ("luminous ache," "boiling clouds," "filaments of starlight," "mosaic of moments") without pattern-teaching or payoff, especially in peak beats (−0.5). Mixed metaphor: time "braided" then becomes "lattice," then "flow" without coherent vehicle (−0.4). Stock opener "She remembered" introduces backstory. Total artifacts in Q7: −1.5 baseline, touching closure area raises to −1.7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Core premise—lone technician repairs metaphysical device in liminal observatory—leans on familiar template (solitary mystic-engineer in liminal space achieves transcendence). The "sound of a leaf falling" and "escape velocity" motifs are invoked rather than transformed through grounded choice or non-obvious moral calculus. Emotional arc (loneliness → epiphany → cosmic integration) follows a well-worn mystical-SF path. No fresh inflection that grows from prior particulars; the ending grants cosmic resolution without visible trade-off or surprise rooted in character flaw.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Elira is present throughout but her choices do not create key turns. She climbs (off-page), places the hand on the plinth, closes her eyes, waits, and opens them—all passive or ritual gestures. No decision that narrows options or alters tactics. Observation dominates.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The spinning clock hand is introduced early, handled in multiple beats (tracing the casing, placing it on the plinth, its synchronization), and returns with reweighted meaning at closure ("the hand spun"). It enables the final "restructuring" and charges the ending image. However, its mechanics remain metaphorical; removing it would require re-anchoring the object but the plot structure (wait → memory → resolution) could persist with substitution.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Escape velocity" is named three times and glossed ("not about speed—it's about shedding the weight of expectation," "not by thrust, but by tenderness"). It functions as thematic label rather than shaping on-page stakes or altering tactics. No choice traces to the concept's mechanics or cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"Changelessly constant" is applied to the spinning hand ("changelessly constant, like the spinning hand that never slowed, never wavered") as description. It does not constrain or enable an action with visible cost; it is a trait-label that echoes theme without operational pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Restructure" is the declared action and appears in the ending ("she had restructured its grammar"). The turn—time braiding instead of straightening—is central, but the action itself is told rather than dramatized through specific moves. Removing "restructure" and substituting "harmonize" or "attune" would require only minor lexical edits; the underlying wait-and-synchronize pattern remains.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"The sound of a leaf falling" is signaled early ("by the sound of a leaf falling"), recalled from childhood memory, and identified as the "restructuring energy" that slows the hand. It functions in two beats (setup, climax) and is named in the final line. However, its mechanics are not tested or adapted; it appears as invoked memory rather than method with constraints. The camera's capture of the sound elevates closure linkage slightly.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The lunar observatory is established early, anchors spatial detail (glass dome, plinth, lenses), and recurs throughout. The shaking foundations provide environmental texture but do not alter Elira's tactics or constrain her choices. The setting frames the action but does not pressure outcome; she could perform the same ritual elsewhere with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Time of Shaking Foundations" names the timeframe and environmental shaking recurs at the climax. However, the shaking does not tighten decisions—Elira proceeds with her plan regardless—and no clock or deadline is tracked. The timeframe is atmospheric rather than tactical.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.0</grade><comment>"To harness the ephemeral" is declared as motivation in paragraph four and restated at closure ("the ephemeral, at last, harnessed"). It is told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants or visible costs. No on-page friction between this desire and an alternative impulse; the story asserts success without showing sacrifice or failure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Luminous ache" appears twice (paragraphs 7 and 18) and related phrases ("bittersweet throb") recur. The tone is consistent—lyric melancholy infused with wonder—and modulates slightly under pressure (dust, stars flickering). The final image ("luminous with ache, let it") charges the closure. However, the tone is static across beats rather than escalating; early and late paragraphs carry identical emotional weight, limiting dynamic range.</comment>
