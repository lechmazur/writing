<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The indexer's motivation is clear and consistent—tracing honest origins—and her tranquil perceptiveness is shown through observation (tilt of lectern, watermarks, decay patterns). However, she remains primarily a lens rather than an agent under pressure; her discoveries settle rather than shock, and no contradictory impulse complicates her resolve. The final stamp and notation feel ceremonial rather than a choice that forecloses a live path with visible cost. Embodied emotion is present but muted; the piece privileges intellectual cataloging over visceral struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land cleanly in the opening lines. The piece accumulates investigative discoveries—grain ledger, sealed vents, Master Index—that deepen the portrait of deliberate erasure, and the final stamp inscription offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (testimony preserved, stillness reclaimed). Cost is conceptual and relational (solidarity with the silenced) rather than a decisive change in the indexer's options, which keeps closure in the RR band. The lens holds; the tightening is meaningful but the price remains oblique.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The sunken library is vividly realized through moss-slick shelves, kelp-choked skylight, hidden vents, and silt; sensory detail is selective and filtered through the indexer's professional priorities. The setting constrains movement (water pressure, rotting wood groans) and supplies resources (marble tide tables, preserved Master Index) that shape her investigative path. The antique stamp and the circular desk pedestal anchor the final image, charging closure. Spatial choreography remains clear across the rotunda descent.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—tracing honest origins and reclaiming suppressed truth—is signaled early and coheres throughout. Pressure accumulates through investigative discoveries (ledger entries, architectural clues, the Master Index) that deepen the silhouette of deliberate erasure, narrowing interpretive options. The indexer's agency is observational and documentational rather than decisional; no live option is foreclosed by a trade-off choice. The stamp inscription at the end is a witness act with conceptual cost (solidarity, accountability) but does not test her commitment against a competing good or unavoidable harm on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—truth as testimony, stillness reclaimed as sanctuary rather than surrender—emerges organically from particulars (the Master Index's survival, the stamp as seal of accountability, "we documented... they buried us anyway"). The final inscription offers a resonant answer to the central question without moralizing. Subtext operates in the fused ledger, the bricked stairwells, the intentional preservation. However, some phrasing edges toward direct thematic statement ("not silence, but testimony"; "not as surrender, but as sanctuary") where a charged image would carry more weight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Single-POV control is stable; the indexer's perceptual signature—calibrated, methodical, attuned to architectural anomalies and archival logic—remains consistent and distinct. Diction fits her scholarly stance, though occasional register peaks ("silhouette of deliberate erasure," "give the silenced a syntax") read slightly elevated for a crisis moment. Psychic distance is controlled; no head-hopping. The piece avoids dialogue, which is apt for solitary archival work. Rhythm modulates with discoveries, and the final paragraph's cadence ("she would surface, she would speak") creates propulsion toward testimony.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear and propulsive, with vivid imagery (kelp, silt, bone stylus) and varied syntax. However, persistent filter verbs ("she knew," "she found," "she noticed") and synonym loops ("stillness reclaimed," "stillness had been reclaimed," "reclaimed stillness") dull immediacy in peak beats. Paraphrase cycles appear: "not just facts, but the weight of..." echoes earlier "not by chance, but by design" and "not to condemn, but to witness." Template cadence emerges in the final third with repeated "not X, but Y" constructions and "she [verb]" stems. These artifacts touch the closure sequence, applying the −1.7 artifact deduction and disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The sunken archive premise and the indexer's investigative method offer a fresh synthesis of drowned-city mystery and archival detective work. The "alternative hypothesis" framing and the Master Index's intentional preservation add specificity. However, the emotional arc—tranquil professional validates suppressed truth—follows a familiar template without bold risk or non-obvious moral calculus. The indexer faces no genuine obstacle or competing pressure; discoveries settle rather than upset. Transformation is present but limited; the core could transpose to other investigative frames with minor adjustments.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Setup: present from the opening line. Development: her perceptive method enables multiple investigative beats (ledger prying, vent tracing, Index discovery). Payoff: she inscribes the final page, but the act is witnessing rather than a choice that alters tactics or forecloses a live option. The character drives observation across beats but lacks a decision under competing pressure; agency is cataloging rather than transformation. Two of three gates plus beat involvement and causal enabling lift the score into mid-band, but swappability (any skilled archivist could perform these moves) and lack of visible trade-off prevent higher placement.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Setup: introduced early in satchel with evidentiary weight noted. Development: pressed into palm (tactile anchor), then returned to velvet; late appearance at closure to stamp the final page. Payoff: stamp seals the inscription and charges the final image as "seal and signature—not of authority, but of accountability." Three gates met. However, the object does not constrain a choice or enable a tactic under pressure; its role is ceremonial and symbolic. Specificity (insignia of last archivist) adds irreplaceability, but the lack of causal pressure (removing it would shift tone but not break story logic) caps the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Setup: "reclaimed stillness" appears in opening beat ("time here had pooled, not passed") and is defined explicitly in the attribute paragraph ("not passive calm, but active stillness"). Development: the concept shapes her investigative patience and perceptual method across beats. Payoff: final paragraphs state "stillness had been reclaimed—not as surrender, but as sanctuary" and link it to testimony. Three gates met. However, the concept functions primarily as thematic gloss rather than an on-page constraint that narrows options or alters tactics; it echoes rather than drives. The stated connection to testimony elevates it above ornamental, but swappability (could be "deliberate patience" or "methodical calm") and lack of causal pressure keep it mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Setup: defined early ("tranquilly perceptive—not passive calm, but active stillness: the quiet calibration of mind to environment"). Development: enables noticing tilt, watermark, decay patterns, and hidden vents across multiple beats; her method depends on this trait. Payoff: "she, tranquilly perceptive, had listened" in penultimate paragraph ties attribute to closure testimony. Three gates met with strong beat involvement. However, the trait is not tested against a competing impulse or cost; no scene shows impatience as a temptation or stillness as a sacrifice. The attribute enables without constraining, and its label-only reprise at closure reads more as thematic callback than causal necessity.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Setup: "readjust" appears early (spectacles, smudged from salt). Development: recurs once in the final sequence ("readjusted her course—not fleeing the dark, but mapping it"). Payoff: the second use charges her resolve but does not create a turn; it's a summary of stance rather than an action that alters tactics. Two of three gates (setup, payoff; middle development is weak). The action is replaceable with "refocus," "recalibrate," or "reorient" without structural loss. No causal pressure or visible cost tied to the gesture; it functions as a physical tic rather than a decisive move. Late penalty and swappability cap the score below 5.0.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Setup: "Her method—alternative hypothesis—was her compass" introduced at mid-story with explicit demonstration (invert "public safety" claims; test evacuation delay as intent). Development: she applies it to architectural clues (sealed vents, bricked stairwells) and tests theories against evidence. Payoff: "Her alternative hypotheses had led her not to conspiracy, but to consequence" in the final third ties method to thematic resolution. Three gates met. The method shapes her investigative beats and accumulates pressure, but it does not force a trade-off or constrain a choice under competing pressure. Specificity is moderate (scientific reasoning method), and the method is demonstrated rather than merely claimed, lifting the score into mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Setup: anchored in opening lines (silt-choked aisle, sunken city, forgotten library, blackout). Development: setting supplies resources (waterlogged tomes, marble tide tables, hidden vents, circular desk) and pressures (water groan, kelp-choked skylight, rotting wood) across multiple beats. Payoff: the Master Index's preservation through hollow-pillar vents is the climactic discovery; the setting's intentional design charges the closure testimony. Three gates met with high causal pressure, irreplaceability (the library's submersion is the silencing), and closure linkage. Removing this setting would collapse story logic and thematic core. Strong integration across all criteria.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Setup: "blackout above sealed them in silence" in opening line; "Cycle 7 of the Blackout" in the stamp notation. Payoff: "The blackout would end" in final sequence. Two gates (setup, payoff); middle development absent—the blackout does not tighten a decision or alter tactics on the page. The timeframe functions as atmospheric context (absence of light, suppression of memory) rather than a live clock. No causal pressure; easily swappable with "the flood," "the siege," or "the quarantine." Ornamental use and lack of middle involvement keep the score below 4.0.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Setup: "she had come... to trace honest origins—to peel back the sediment of myth and find the unvarnished truth" in opening beat. Development: her investigative moves (ledger, vents, Index) dramatize the desire; the grain-shipment revelation and Master Index discovery fulfill the tracing goal. Payoff: "Origins traced. Truth reclaimed" in the stamp inscription and "her motivation crystallized: not to condemn, but to witness" tie desire to closure testimony. Three gates met with strong beat involvement and causal linkage. However, the motivation is never dramatized in friction with a competing want or cost; no scene tests her commitment against a personal price or ethical trade-off. The absence of visible conflict keeps the score just above 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Setup: "dappled resolve" appears only in the final sequence ("her resolve was dappled—not unbroken, but patterned with clarity, shadow, and stubborn light"). Development: tone throughout is calm, methodical, and elegiac; no modulation under pressure—discoveries "settle" rather than shock. Payoff: "dappled with resolve" recurs in the penultimate paragraph. Two of three gates (no early setup; the label arrives late). The tone is coherent but static; "dappled" (patterned, mixed) is asserted rather than demonstrated through tonal shifts across beats. Swappable with "steady," "layered," or "tempered" without structural loss. Late introduction and lack of pressure-driven modulation cap the score near 6.0.</comment>
