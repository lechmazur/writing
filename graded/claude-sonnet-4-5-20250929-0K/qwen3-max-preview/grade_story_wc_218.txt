<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Arlen's motivation (interspecies respect) is clear and his systematic approach is established early, but the character operates in near-total isolation for most of the piece, rendering him more monument than person. His "gently systematic" unwinding of the trapped sparrow provides one embodied moment of choice under pressure, but the dying-man framing dilutes urgency—he faces no genuine internal conflict or trade-off because the terminal diagnosis pre-resolves all stakes. The villagers and animals remain props rather than sources of friction; relationships never pressure his choices, and the end arrives as a soft fade rather than a decision with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: dawn labor → sparrow rescue → spiral stair completion → death as closure image. The final moment (Arlen tying the diary to the branch, lying down, dying) delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis: he completes his monument and accepts death), and the cost is visible—his life ends. However, the Orientation Test is barely satisfied (barefoot in orchard, diagnosed six months ago) by ~120 words, and the piece never tightens options or forces a trade-off; Arlen's work proceeds without obstacle or escalation. The closure unit lands but feels inevitable from paragraph one, lacking a meaningful deepening or pressure point that narrows his path.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The orchard setting is vivid and purposeful: living stone pillars with moss-root hollows, copper-wrapped oaks forming archways and stairs, and the Whisper Arch all ground the world in tactile, recurring detail. The environment subtly constrains choice (Arlen climbs the Spiral Stair on his final month, ties the diary to the highest branch) and the spatial choreography of Pillar Seven, the moss bed between Pillars Three and Four, and the burial site under the Whisper Arch is clear and consistent. Sensory selection (mist at dawn, bees humming, auroras overhead) reflects Arlen's calm, unhurried focus, and the copper-wire method integrates into action rather than remaining decorative.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—completing the orchard as a monument to interspecies respect before Arlen dies—is signaled early and remains coherent, but the piece never escalates or tightens. No obstacle appears; the sparrow rescue is resolved in the same beat it arises, villagers bring tea without complication, and Arlen's work proceeds in an unbroken arc from dawn to death. The terminal diagnosis should impose a ticking clock, but time is vague ("final month," "years," "days later") and never forces a trade-off or forecloses an option. The ending delivers renunciation (Arlen lies down and dies), but the cost is pre-set by the diagnosis rather than earned through a protagonist choice that narrows his path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The theme of coexistence through patient, non-dominating architecture emerges organically from Arlen's copper-wire method and the diary's maxim ("Respect isn't earned by dominance. It's offered when you prove you belong in the design"). The final image—sparrows nesting in copper arms, learning respect "by living inside the design"—reweights the orchard as both literal structure and inheritance without stating a moral. However, the piece leans toward thematic declaration ("gently systematic dismantling of fear through purpose," "monument," "reintroducing species") rather than letting insight arise solely from action. The sparrow rescue and the doe birth are telling moments, but the resolution tilts into "poets wrote odes" epilogue rather than letting the final on-page image do the work.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The third-person narration maintains stable distance and a distinct perceptual signature—Arlen notices root-stone symbiosis, mycelium underfoot, copper warmth—that reflects his botanical focus. The prose modulates with emotional intensity (precise at the sparrow rescue, expansive at the aurora-lit death), and diction remains within a plausible naturalist-caretaker register. However, voice slips into essayistic abstraction at key turns ("brazen calm: no trembling hands, no frantic goodbyes—just a gently systematic dismantling of fear through purpose"; "The architectural secrets... weren't hidden in blueprints or vaults—they were written in bark"). The final paragraph shifts into obituary-omniscient ("Over the years... biologists studied... poets wrote"), a POV leap that undermines the established intimacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high (Page 73 sketch, Page 102 lizard note, copper conducting intention), but the piece carries recurring scaffold and paraphrase loops: "Not with hammers or chisels, but with copper wire" / "not just growth rates... but conversations"; "He didn't curse or rush; he sat cross-legged, gently systematic" / "his movements precise, unhurried, reverent." Template cadence appears in the villagers paragraph ("They expected grief, spectacle, maybe madness. What they found was...") and the final epilogue runs ("Children learned... biologists studied... poets wrote"). Mixed metaphor: "copper... whispered to the trees, urging them into new geometries" (trees don't have ears; geometric compulsion isn't auditory). The closing omniscient summary—"Over the years... a new generation of sparrows"—dilutes the prior image's charge with expository satisfaction.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The premise—terminal caretaker using copper wire to guide living architecture as interspecies monument—is specific and fresh, and the botanical diary as living document adds a purposeful detail. The "gently systematic" trait and the sparrow-rescue beat feel earned rather than ornamental. However, the dying-protagonist-finds-peace-through-nature-work template is widely used, and the piece does not transform it through moral friction or an unexpected calculus; Arlen faces no opposition, makes no difficult trade-off, and the ending (peaceful death, legacy confirmed, poets sing his praises) delivers the genre's expected comfort. The copper-wire method is distinctive, but the emotional arc—acceptance without struggle—follows the template's safest path.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Arlen (island caretaker) is present throughout and his choices structure the narrative: he wraps copper, rescues the sparrow, climbs the Spiral Stair, ties the diary, and lies down to die. However, most beats are systematic work rather than pressure-laden decisions; the sparrow rescue is the only moment where his action alters an immediate outcome. His final climb and diary-tying participate in the closure image but feel scripted by the terminal frame rather than forcing a trade-off. Present in setup, middle, and ending; drives two distinct beats (rescue, final ascent); causal pressure is light.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The botanical diary appears early (first paragraph: "fingers tracing the grooves"), returns in the sparrow-rescue beat ("That evening, he wrote"), and is tied to the highest branch as the closure act ("Let the rain read it... Let the roots remember"). It reweights from personal tool to inherited text, and the final image of weathered-but-legible pages signals transmission. However, the diary is mostly a reporting device rather than an object that constrains or enables; its contents (Page 73, Page 102) enrich texture but do not alter Arlen's tactics. Present in setup, middle, and ending; lyric reprise with clear reweighting; beat involvement limited.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Architectural secrets are declared as theme ("weren't hidden in blueprints... they were written in bark, revealed by patience, unlocked by collaboration") but never dramatized as a tactical problem or discovery. The copper-wire method and root-stone symbiosis are described, yet no secret is uncovered on the page that changes Arlen's approach or options. The concept functions as thematic overlay rather than stake-shaping force; swappable with "ecological wisdom" or "living design" without structural loss. Mentioned early and at closure, but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Gently systematic" is named in the opening and embodied in the sparrow rescue ("he sat cross-legged, gently systematic, and unwound the coil strand by strand") where it enables success and contrasts with rushing. The trait recurs in the villagers' observation ("movements precise, unhurried, reverent") and arguably shapes Arlen's entire approach, constraining him from frantic urgency. However, the trait is also label-heavy (appears twice as direct descriptor) and never faces a cost or trade-off—no moment where haste would help but his systematic nature forbids it. Present in setup and middle; one beat where it visibly enables; modest cost connection.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Remodel (via copper-wire wrapping) is Arlen's core action and appears in setup (wrapping oak branches), middle (securing Pillar Seven spiral), and closure (completed Spiral Stair, copper-rimmed hollows). The method generates the orchard's final state—archways, staircases, bat roosts—and the narrative depends on this continuous work. However, the remodeling itself never faces obstacle or variation; it proceeds in a single unbroken arc without tactical shift. The action is present and generative but not contested. Drives multiple beats; present at closure; causal pressure moderate; swappability low.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Copper wire wrapped around oak branches is introduced early ("twisting thin copper strands around living boughs") and its mechanics are explained (conducts intention, warmed by sun, guides growth). The method enables the Whisper Arch, Spiral Stair, and lizard-sunning branches; the sparrow is tangled in "loose wire," making the method a complication. At closure, Arlen's hand rests "on a copper coil" and the final image includes "copper arms" where sparrows nest. The method shapes multiple beats and the ending, but it never imposes a cost or forces a choice—more tool than constraint. Early signal; beat involvement high; closure linkage strong; causal pressure light.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The temple orchard with living stone pillars is anchored early and recurs throughout: Pillar Seven (sparrow rescue), Pillars Three and Four (death site), Whisper Arch (burial). The setting supplies resources (hollows for nests, moss bed, spatial anchors for the Spiral Stair) and charges the closure image (buried beneath the arch, diary above). However, the orchard never pressures or constrains Arlen's work; it is cooperative backdrop rather than obstacle or active force. Present in setup, middle, ending; multiple beats; closure linkage clear; tactical constraint absent.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The six-month terminal diagnosis is declared in the opening and frames the entire narrative, but time remains vague and untracked. "Final month," "years" (for villagers and biologists), "days later" (finding the body)—none of these tighten a decision or force a trade-off on the page. The diagnosis should impose urgency, yet Arlen works "at dawn... unhurried" with no visible pressure from the ticking clock. The timeframe is setup only; it never alters tactics or appears in a middle choice. Functional but replaceable; no escalation linked to the clock.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Fostering interspecies respect is Arlen's stated motivation ("His motivation was singular") and appears in his diary maxim, the sparrow rescue (proof of respect through gentle action), and the final image (species coexisting in the designed space). However, the motivation is declared more than dramatized; no moment shows Arlen choosing respect over a competing want or paying a cost to preserve it. The piece tells us this is his goal and illustrates harmony, but never tests the motive under friction. Present in setup and ending; thematic throughout; causal pressure light; cost connection weak.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Brazen calm is named early ("he chose brazen calm: no trembling hands, no frantic goodbyes") and maintained across beats—Arlen whistles while working, unwinding the sparrow without rush, smiling as raccoons investigate, feeling "no urgency, no regret" at death. The tone is consistent and coherent, modulating slightly (mist-veiled dawn, aurora-lit night) without breaking. It charges the closure image by contrast: calm in the face of death reweights his life's work as monument rather than desperation. However, the tone is also static; no moment where fear or grief threatens and must be suppressed. Coherent; present in setup, middle, ending; modest modulation; closure linkage clear.</comment>
