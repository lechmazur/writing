<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elira's core motivation is clear and her retrocognitive trait is dramatized through her physical interaction with the tessera. However, her internal contradiction—between the gentle radical's past passivity and present steel—is told rather than shown in simultaneous action. The renaming ritual feels more thematic performance than a choice under genuine competing pressure. The magistrate's daughter-laughter moment offers a micro-choice but his arc is compressed into summary.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the renaming ritual accumulates density through the survivors' participation, building to a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where Elira's new definition of mercy crystallizes communal purpose. Orientation anchors quickly (plaza, Elira, post-fire). The closure reconfigures the plaza's identity and Elira's relationship to her past, but the cost—what she forecloses by committing to "aberrant mercy"—remains conceptual and undramatized; we see purpose but not visible sacrifice or trade-off in the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The shattered plaza, ash, fractured arches, and mosaic stepping stone are vividly rendered and consistently present. The tessera's physical properties (cobalt blue, fractured edge, sharp enough to bite) constrain Elira's gesture and charge the closure when she tucks it into her belt as compass. Spatial choreography of survivors emerging and stepping forward is clear. The chipped patterns guide her retroactively but their mechanics—how fractures "echo" voices—lean abstract rather than tactile constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: redefining mercy from passive to active, justice-wielding force. Elira's kneeling refusal to rise before the magistrate and her placement of the tessera in his hand offer one meaningful pressure point that shifts his stance. However, the escalation is largely ceremonial; no live opposition tests her new mercy in action, and the survivors' participation feels unanimous rather than conflicted. The cost of her choice—what door she closes by renaming—is implied but not dramatized on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme of transformative mercy emerges through the renaming ritual and contrasts with "old mercy" (passive, permission-seeking). The tessera and fractured stepping stone accumulate meaning across beats. Subtext operates in Elira's gesture (placing the shard in the magistrate's hand) and the survivors' whispered renamings. The final image—mercy as practice, steel that bends—reweights prior material, though the articulation "It is steel that bends but does not break" borders on direct thematic statement. The piece resists easy moral but leans heavily on the prompt's "aberrant mercy" language in the closing beats.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV remains stable. Diction is elevated and lyric ("powdered grief," "struck bronze"), consistent with a post-catastrophe ritual tone. Free indirect style conveys Elira's perception cleanly. However, register drifts into abstraction during peak beats ("retrocognitively trapped," "cradle empathy in arms of steel") that feel prompt-adjacent rather than character-voice. Dialogue from the magistrate and survivors is minimal but functional. Psychic distance widens at the renaming sequence, adopting a choral quality that diffuses individual interiority.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and figurative language is dense but controlled in early beats ("ash clung...like powdered grief"). However, thematic articulation in the second half relies on parallel constructions and label-stacking: "It is cold to the cruel, warm to the broken. It sees the wound and does not look away—it names the wound, and then names the healer." Paraphrase loops appear in adjacent lines (mercy definitions repeat across three beats). The renaming list (beggar/keeper, orphan/seed, ruin/cradle) is purposeful but template-like. No major clarity breaks, yet density tilts toward ornament in the manifesto section.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The "gentle radical" and post-catastrophe renaming premise carry thematic weight but echo familiar reconstruction-narrative templates (ruins, collective ritual, redefined justice). The tessera as both relic and compass offers a specific inflection. However, the renaming action—while thematically apt—does not generate unexpected tactical pressure or a non-obvious moral calculus; it proceeds smoothly without resistance. The magistrate's shift is earned but predictable. The piece commits fully to its lyric register but does not transform the template through lived friction or a surprising cost.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elira's choices—kneeling to trace the mosaic, prying the tessera, refusing to rise, placing the shard in the magistrate's hand, announcing the new definition—drive all major beats and the closure. She is present throughout and her final gesture (tucking the tessera as compass) reweights her retrocognitive trap as forward momentum. However, her decisions face minimal opposition; the radical act is declarative rather than tested under conflicting pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The tessera is handled in at least four beats: prying it loose, letting its edge bite her palm, placing it in the magistrate's hand, and tucking it into her belt. Its physical properties (cobalt, fractured, sharp) matter in each use. The object seeds the renaming concept and charges the closure as "compass." It could not be swapped without losing the mosaic-fracture metaphor. Strong integration, though its mechanics (how a tessera unlocks renaming) remain metaphorical rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Aberrant mercy" is defined explicitly and shapes Elira's stakes: mercy must "break doors" and "rename the rules." The concept distinguishes her new practice from passive mercy and informs her announcement to the crowd. However, it is articulated more than enacted; we see no on-page door-breaking or tactical choice where aberrant mercy constrains her moves versus another approach. It operates as thematic frame rather than a decision-forcing rule.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Retrocognitively trapped" is named and described: "every step forward pulled her gaze backward, forcing her to relive...losses." It motivates her kneeling and tracing of the stepping stone. By the end she "smiled faintly; the past no longer dragged her down—it walked beside her." The trait enables her empathy but its cost—what she cannot do because of it—is not dramatized in a specific on-page trade-off. The resolution is told rather than shown through action.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Renaming drives the entire arc: Elira renames the tessera's meaning, then renames social categories (beggar, orphan, ruin), then redefines mercy itself. The magistrate and survivors join the renaming, creating the communal turn. The action structures every beat and the closure hinges on the plaza's identity shift. Removing renaming collapses the plot. The element is indispensable, though the act itself is largely ceremonial rather than tactically tested.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The chipped patterns on the stepping stone are introduced early and guide Elira's retrocognitive tracing: "Each fracture in the tile mirrored a wound in the city's soul." She uses the patterns to hear silenced voices. The method enables her selection of the tessera and her understanding of how to rebuild. However, the mechanics are abstract—fractures "echo" rather than mechanically constrain—and the method is not revisited at closure. Mid-band for early signal and middle involvement, but the link to the ending is thematic rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The plaza frames all action and its post-fire state (ash, shattered sky, skeletal minaret) constrains available materials and mood. The stepping stone and debris supply the tesserae that enable the renaming. The setting's destruction motivates the entire ritual and the closure image of communal humming "beneath its shattered sky" recharges the opening frame. The environment is essential to tone and stakes, though it does not force a tactical pivot within the scene.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"After the great fire" sets the inciting condition and the ash/ruin anchor the present moment. However, elapsed time within the scene is not tracked and no live clock pressures Elira's choices. The timeframe is a backdrop rather than a tightening constraint. Mid-band for setup and thematic presence, but it does not alter tactics or escalate urgency on the page.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"To cradle empathy in arms of steel" is articulated multiple times and directly motivates Elira's redefinition of mercy. She enacts it by refusing to beg permission and by wielding the tessera as both empathic connection (placing it in the magistrate's hand) and steel resolve (tucking it as compass). The friction between warmth and force is named but not dramatized in a moment where competing costs pull her in different directions. The motivation drives the arc but lacks on-page conflict between empathy and steel.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Tone blends mourning lyricism ("powdered grief," "ash-laden air") with steely resolve ("mercy...wielded justice like a blade"). The diction maintains "warm coldness" through contrasts: gentle radical, cold to cruel/warm to broken, steel that bends. Tone modulates from kneeling introspection to public declaration. However, the warmth and coldness are stated in parallel rather than tensioned within a single beat, and the final image leans more declarative than emotionally contradictory. Mid-band for coherence and purposeful contrast, but the tension is constructed rather than felt.</comment>
