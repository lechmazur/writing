<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The protagonist's interiority relies heavily on abstract declaration ("logically emotional to her marrow") rather than embodied contradiction. Her emotional states are told through elevated register ("trembled with awe," "grief, her love for the sea") that reads as performed rather than experienced under pressure. The climactic choice to sing/vibrate lacks visible cost or internal resistance—she adapts seamlessly without struggle, flattening what should be a high-stakes moment. Micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values are absent; she moves through beats without hesitation or tradeoff.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early enough. The closure unit attempts Resonant Reconfiguration via the Heartstone's "sonic absolution" wave, but the cost remains abstract—scavengers kneel "in revelation" without on-page consequence or visible price paid by the protagonist. The causal chain from key insertion to counter-frequency to absolution reads mechanical rather than earned by prior struggle. The lens appears hybrid (causal setup, accumulative imagery), but the ending leans on告 conceptual assertion ("reminded the world") rather than a concrete image that reweights prior stakes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The drift-ice marina and lighthouse setting supply vivid sensory anchors (pressure ridges, bioluminescent moss, mercury basin). Spatial choreography remains clear across moves. However, the environment functions primarily as backdrop; the ice "guiding" her steps and cracks sealing beneath her soles read as convenient rather than constraining choice. The Heartstone chamber's mercury and moss charge the atmosphere but do not alter her tactics at closure—she would sing/vibrate regardless of the basin's properties.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake (protect the Heartstone) is signaled early. The sonic harpoon attack provides external pressure, but the protagonist's counter-action unfolds without visible trade-off or narrowed options—she simply "adapted" and "became the buffer" without cost or failure. The scavengers' instant conversion to "harmonic grace" deflates the threat retroactively. One tightening occurs (assault peaks), but the resolution via "forgiving" absolution avoids agency-driven choice with felt price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The theme of harmony versus dissonance is stated overtly in the final paragraphs ("reminded the world that even violence could be answered not with force, but with frequency"). The Heartstone's "sonic absolution" functions as symbolic convenience rather than emerging from prior particulars. The closing lines ("no longer just an engineer, but a keeper of balance") deliver thesis rather than resonant image. Subtext is thin; the piece explains its own meaning instead of trusting the scene to carry it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-person limited. However, the prose drifts into elevated, nearly omniscient register ("logically emotional," "weaver of waves," "consonance") that exceeds the engineer's plausible lexicon under stress. Perceptual signature is generic; her way of noticing lacks character-specific bias. The narration over-explains emotional states ("her spirit trembled with awe") rather than trusting embodied action. No dialogue present to assess voice distinction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Heavy overwriting throughout: figurative density in nearly every sentence ("bleeding amber across fractured ice," "weaver of waves," "sonic entropy," "harmonic grace") without pattern-teaching or payoff. Paraphrase loops appear ("not to conquer the ice, but to converse with it" / "not defensively, but forgivingly"). Template cadence: "She adapted... She descended... She turned... She didn't panic. She adapted." Stock metaphors ("fierce as a glacier's birth") and therapy-speak ("logically emotional grace") cluster in peak beats. Register drift into abstract academic diction ("mediator," "transmuting," "sonic absolution") violates the immediacy of crisis. Artifacts touch the closure beat, triggering disqualification from 9+ and cap at 8.8 per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The core premise (sonic artifact + engineer guardian) follows a familiar template without transformation. The "vibrational matching" method and "sonic absolution" resolution read as convenient metaphysical solutions rather than grounded in prior world logic or character cost. The scavengers' instant moral conversion via frequency deflates tension. Emotional specificity is absent; the ending's "consonance" and "keeper of balance" labels replace lived detail with abstract thesis.</comment>
