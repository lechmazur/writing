<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The astronomer's motivation (encrypted devotion, frugal sacrifice) is established through concrete detail—sold cloak, barley cakes, traded inheritance—but interiority remains largely abstract and label-driven ("empirically ironic," "encrypted devotion"). The character observes and enacts ritual without visible internal contradiction or a choice that forecloses a path with felt cost; the final "Confirmed" reads as data collection rather than renunciation or stance crystallization. Embodied emotion is scarce; the prose tells us he "did not smile" and "did not weep" but offers no contradictory impulse acting in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who (astronomer), where (ziggurat terrace/Sky Chamber), and when (between regimes, Sirius's descent) within the opening lines. Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density builds through ritual preparation, schematic layering, and the tile's hum, culminating in the log entry and re-wrapping. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis)—he will return tomorrow with fresh chalk—but the cost is conceptual rather than visceral on the page; the piece asserts sacrifice in backstory without a present forfeiture that narrows options. The final image reweights prior material but the pressure feels more asserted than dramatized in the ending beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The ziggurat terrace, obsidian floor, bronze door, and crumbling stair are vivid and anchor the action throughout. The tile's placement "aligned with Sirius's descent" and the chalk diagrams drawn on obsidian ground the ritual in tactile, spatial detail. The setting constrains choice (he climbs alone "between regimes") and charges the final image (the chamber "bathed in indigo twilight"). Micro-setting (the tile, the chalk, the dais) functions as constraint and resonance vehicle, meeting the 9+ gate for Q3.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—seeking communion/revealing a frequency—is signaled early but remains abstract. Pressure accumulates through ritual layering (uncloaking, positioning, sketching, alignment) under the Accumulative lens, yet no reversal or tightening choice narrows live options on the page. The tile hums, he notes the wavelength, and re-wraps it; the loop is closed without a visible trade-off or cost that alters tactics. Agency is present (he climbs, aligns, records) but the final act reads as confirmation rather than a decision that forecloses a path with felt weight.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme—devotion encoded in arithmetic, the collision of rationality and mysticism—emerges through particulars (the magic square, the schematic representations, the resonance) and the final image of "encrypted devotion puls[ing] like a neutron star" reweights prior material. However, the closing paragraphs veer toward thematic statement: "unseen, unpraised, empirically ironic, and utterly essential" and "counts the infinite and calls it home" articulate the thesis rather than letting the image resonate. The conceptual cost (no monument, no coin) is asserted but not dramatized as a present forfeiture.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person close; no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and consistent ("threadbare robe," "dusky harmony," "syrup under moonlight") but register drifts into abstract philosophizing ("empirically ironic," "encrypted devotion," "covenant humming beneath their feet") that sits outside the astronomer's immediate sensory frame during high-pressure beats. Perceptual signature is present (he "adjusted his spectacles, noted the exact decibel") but the voice often narrates *about* him rather than through his embodied experience. Filter verbs ("thought," "whispered") are voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The prose is dense with figurative language and elevated diction throughout, creating a lyric texture but reducing propulsion. Multiple sentences in the opening and closing paragraphs stack metaphors ("constellations mapped in silence," "time slowed like syrup," "pulsed like a neutron star") without pattern-teaching or clear payoff tied to the closure beat. Paraphrase loops appear: paragraphs 5 and 8 both assert "empirically ironic" to similar effect; paragraphs 17 and 19 restate his frugality and future return. Sentence stems vary, but information density is low in reflective passages that summarize rather than advance. The overwriting penalty (density, register drift) and loop penalty together justify a score in the mid-5s.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The synthesis—frugal astronomer, magic square as cosmic interface, Babylonian observatory, encrypted devotion—is specific and non-obvious. The frame (between regimes, silent covenant) offers a fresh angle on the scientist-mystic archetype. However, the emotional and narrative arc could unfold with different proper nouns (another scholar, another relic, another site) without structural loss. The piece commits to its premise and follows its implications, but the transformation test reveals moderate swappability in the core emotional beats.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The frugal astronomer is present throughout and his choices (climbing, uncloaking, aligning, sketching, noting, re-wrapping) structure the narrative. Early signal is strong. However, these are ritual actions rather than decisions that alter tactics or foreclose paths; he enacts the sequence without visible friction or cost in the present. The trait (frugality) is asserted in backstory (sold cloak, barley cakes) but does not constrain an on-page choice. Two gates met (setup, closure presence); mid-band ceiling applies. Swappability is moderate (another scholar could perform the same acts). Lyric reprise (opening threadbare robe → closing "crust of bread") adds resonance but no causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The magic square tile is uncloaked (beat 1), placed and aligned (beat 2), hums in resonance (beat 3), and is re-wrapped (beat 4). Early signal and sustained involvement across the arc. It enables the resonance discovery and its properties (numerals summing to fifteen, alignment with Sirius) matter. Closure linkage is present (the tile "resting like a dormant god" in the final chamber image). However, the tile does not constrain a choice under pressure; it functions as ritual object rather than problem or lever. Three gates met; causal pressure is moderate. Specificity is high (magic square, numerals, alignment) but the tile could be swapped for another charged relic without breaking story logic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Encrypted devotion is named repeatedly and thematically central: "a love-letter to cosmic order, written in ratios," "devotion encrypted in arithmetic," "encrypted devotion pulsed like a neutron star." Early signal is strong. The concept shapes stakes (he seeks communion through calculation) but remains abstract; it does not constrain an on-page tactical choice or create visible friction. Middle development is weak (no beat where the encryption method alters his approach). Closure participation is thematic rather than dramatized (asserted in the final metaphor but not enacted with cost). Two gates met (setup, weak payoff); score trends toward mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Empirically ironic is used twice as a label ("empirically ironic perfection," "Empirically ironic, he thought") without constraining or enabling an on-page action. The trait describes a thematic posture (rational mind seeking magic) but does not generate a visible trade-off or cost. Setup is present (paragraph 3 and 8). Middle and closure use are ornamental (label-only in paragraph 8, absent from the ending beat). One gate met; cap 4.6. Swappability is high (could be replaced with "paradoxical" or "contradictory" without structural change). Deduct for label-only use (−0.3).</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Uncloaking occurs early (paragraph 2) and frames the ritual sequence. The action signals intentionality and sets the tone. However, it does not create a reversal or constrain later choices; the unveiling is procedural rather than decisive. Middle beats (alignment, sketching, resonance) trace to the tile's presence, not to the uncloak action itself. Closure participation is indirect (the re-wrapping mirrors the opening but does not reweight meaning). Two gates met (setup, weak echo at closure). Swappability is moderate (could be "revealed" or "placed" with minor edits). Lyric reprise adds resonance but no causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Schematic representations (diagrams of orbital resonance, harmonic lattices, nested triangles) appear in paragraphs 6 and 11. Early signal is present. The method matters thematically (visualization of cosmic mechanics) but the mechanics are not tested or altered under pressure. Middle development is weak (he sketches, the lines grow denser, but no friction or adaptation occurs). Closure participation is absent (the final image focuses on the tile and chamber, not the schematics). Two gates met (setup, middle mention); cap 6.0. The method is swappable (another calculation or diagram form could serve the same thematic role). Deduct for summary-only use (−0.3).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The ancient Babylonian palace reimagined as observatory is present throughout: ziggurat terrace, Sky Chamber, crumbling stair, obsidian floor, bronze door, pillars with forgotten gods. Early signal is strong. The setting constrains choice (he climbs alone "between regimes," "no court would fund") and supplies resources (the dais, the alignment window for Sirius). Closure linkage is vivid (the chamber "bathed in indigo twilight," the tile "resting like a dormant god," the bronze door closing). Three gates met; causal pressure is present (location enables the ritual, isolation is dramatized). Specificity is high (Babylonian, ziggurat, obsidian, Sirius alignment). Irreplaceability is strong (the setting's particulars matter).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Between regimes is established early (paragraph 4: "throne stood vacant," "priests argued") and contextualizes the astronomer's solitary access. The timeframe shapes stakes (no oversight, no funding) but does not tighten decisions or create a live clock. Middle development is weak (the passage of regimes is backdrop, not pressure). Closure participation is thematic (the palace absorbs the vibration "for the next interval between regimes") but does not impose cost or urgency in the present. Two gates met (setup, thematic echo at closure); cap 6.0. Time is vague rather than tracked. Deduct for lack of tactical constraint (−0.3).</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>To seal a covenant with the unknown is named directly (paragraph 4) and drives the astronomer's climb and ritual. Early signal is strong. The motivation shapes stakes (he seeks communion, not glory) but remains abstract; no on-page beat dramatizes friction between the covenant and a competing want. Middle development is present (he aligns, sketches, waits for the hum) but the steps are ritual rather than conflicted choice. Closure participation is thematic (he will return "with fresh chalk" to continue the covenant) but the cost is asserted in backstory (sold cloak, barley cakes) rather than paid in the present. Two gates met (setup, weak payoff). Swappability is moderate (another lofty goal—"commune with the cosmos," "unlock the mystery"—could substitute). Deduct for told-only motivation (−0.4).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Dusky harmony is named twice ("dusky harmony of shadow and calculation," "dusky harmony of collapsing empires and enduring math") and the tone—contemplative, layered, reverent—is coherent throughout. Early signal is present (paragraph 7). The tone modulates subtly with pressure (the hum, the notation, the re-wrapping) and charges the final image ("indigo twilight," "slow, sure turning"). However, the mood is largely static; no sharp tonal shift dramatizes the resonance discovery. Two gates met (setup, closure tone); the tone supports but does not transform the ending. Specificity is high ("dusky," "indigo," "violet sky") but the effect is atmospheric rather than causally active.</comment>
