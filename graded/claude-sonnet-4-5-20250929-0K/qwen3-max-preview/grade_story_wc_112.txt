<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elira's scientific obsession is clear and her mechanically warm demeanor is invoked repeatedly, but most of her interiority consists of abstract scientific claims ("prove that time moves sideways") rather than embodied contradiction. The encounter with her adjacent self offers a beat of recognition and terror, yet the decision to "adjust the lever's angle by 2.7 degrees" feels calibrated rather than emotionally costly—no visible struggle between conflicting impulses in that moment. The ending records findings with synth-tea steam, a quiet choice that fits Earned Stasis, but the path there lacks the micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early and remain stable. The dominant stake—proving lateral time—is signaled in the first third and drives the lever-pull at midpoint, which triggers the adjacency vision and the final recalibration. The piece reads as Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through sensor logs, glyph discovery, and the nexus convulsion, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing when Elira names the phenomenon ("Time doesn't move forward here. It breathes sideways"). Cost is conceptual—she maps adjacent presents no one else will understand—but the final image (synth-tea steam curling "like a question mark") charges the closure without a felt interpersonal or opportunity price on the page, keeping it mid-band.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The methane sea, titanium ribs, magnetic nexus, and twilight sky are vivid and consistent. The gantry climb and lever are handled concretely (magnetized boots, comet-iron glyphs), and the roosting xenomorphs respond to the nexus convulsion, so the environment reacts to pressure. However, the station functions more as atmospheric backdrop than constraint—no tool failure or spatial limit alters Elira's tactics. The final synth-tea moment is textured but does not meaningfully tighten the choice space, leaving the setting strong on mood but short of indispensable.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake (prove lateral time) is declared early and pursued through seventeen cycles of sensor work, culminating in the lever pull and adjacency vision. One meaningful tightening occurs when the other Elira whispers "Don't let go," forcing the 2.7-degree adjustment—a decision under pressure. Yet the escalation is intellectual rather than forced by scarcity or threat; no live option is foreclosed with visceral cost. The resolution (file saved, tea poured) registers as Earned Stasis with conceptual cost, but lacks the felt trade-off or loss that would lift it into high-band territory.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The core question—whether time can move laterally—emerges through the magnetic nexus, avian resonance logs, and holographic principles, avoiding direct statement. "Subdued Awakenings: Chronal Lateralization in Magnetic Twilight" and "Time doesn't move forward here. It breathes sideways" offer resonant phrasing that reweights the premise without moralizing. The roosting xenomorphs "unaware they were roosting not in space, but in the fold between moments" charges the final image with conceptual irony. However, the thematic answer remains somewhat cerebral and the synth-tea ending, while apt, does not embody a non-literal answer to the central question as viscerally as it might.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>POV remains single and stable, and the narrative distance is consistent. However, diction drifts repeatedly into elevated register that clashes with the focalizer's lived-in technical role: "mechanically warm resolve," "icy warmth—the paradox of certainty and wonder entwined," "the fold between moments." These phrases read as authorial ornament rather than Elira's specific perceptual signature. The other Elira's whisper ("Don't let go") carries tension, but the prose converges on lush metaphor throughout, flattening voice distinction under pressure and reducing the sense of a singular, internally motivated texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The prose is often vivid but suffers from pervasive overwriting and template cadence. "Mechanically warm" appears four times in similar constructions, creating a thematic loop. Figurative density is high without pattern-teaching: "Light fractured—not shattered, but peeled, like layers of an onion peeled through holographic principles" stacks vehicles awkwardly. Paraphrase loops appear ("The station exhaled… The station inhaled"; "not younger, not older—but adjacent" echoed by "not fading, but stepping out of phase"). The peak beat—lever pull and adjacency vision—is laden with metaphor that obscures rather than propels. Apply −1.0 for template stems, loops, and density without payoff, plus the line-artifact cap disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The premise—time moving sideways via magnetic nexus and holographic principles—offers a fresh SF angle, and "subdued awakenings" as nomenclature is specific. The adjacency encounter and the 2.7-degree lever adjustment show ingenuity in execution. However, the emotional arc (lone scientist proves controversial theory, logs findings quietly) follows a familiar template without bold transformation. The synth-tea epilogue and roosting xenomorphs are textured but not structurally indispensable, and the conceptual payoff remains cerebral rather than surprising in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elira appears throughout, climbs the gantry, pulls the lever, adjusts it by 2.7 degrees, and logs her findings. Her "obliging" nature is mentioned early but does not constrain a key choice; "sky mechanic" role colors her technical vocabulary but the climax depends on scientific curiosity, not repair obligation. The lever adjustment is a decision under pressure, but the character trait itself is more label than causal driver. Mid-band for presence across beats without indispensable cost tied to the specific trait.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The magnetic nexus is seeded in paragraph two ("suspended above the central atrium, pulsing like a dormant heart"), reappears when Elira climbs to the control panel, convulses at the lever pull, and "settled" after the adjustment. Its field lines tremble, and it acts as "a pivot… a fulcrum for time's lateral lean," directly enabling the adjacency vision. The nexus drives two distinct beats (lever pull, recalibration) and shapes the closure concept. Strong integration with visible function, though "at twilight" as a specific timing constraint is less causally enforced than the nexus itself.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Subdued awakenings" appears as the title of Elira's log entry in the final third, framing the discovered phenomenon retroactively. The concept of quiet, incremental realization is thematically present (xenomorphs stirring "not in panic, but in synchronized curiosity"), but it does not constrain choices or tactics on the page. The closure is indeed subdued, yet the label feels applied rather than dramatized through pressure. Functional thematic resonance but lacks causal force or visible cost tied to the concept.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Mechanically warm" is invoked four times: "mechanically warm demeanor" (paragraph 4), "mechanically warm resolve" (paragraph 10), "icy warmth" (paragraph 26), and "mechanically warm" scent (paragraph 23). All uses are descriptive labels without enabling or constraining action. No choice hinges on this trait; it colors tone but remains ornamental. Repeated mention does not equal integration; cap at 3.8 for swappability and label-only deployment.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The lever is discovered via data-crystal schematic (paragraph 12), gripped and pulled at paragraph 15 (triggering the nexus convulsion and adjacency vision), then adjusted by 2.7 degrees at paragraph 21 (causing the other Elira to vanish and the nexus to settle). Two distinct causal beats, both pivotal. The lever's comet-iron materiality and glyph markings add specificity. Removing the lever would break the plot's logic. Strong integration; just shy of 8.5 because the 2.7-degree adjustment, while purposeful, is more calibration than a choice with visible interpersonal or resource cost.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Through holographic principles" appears twice: in paragraph 7 (Elira's conviction that "the answer lay in the way the magnetic nexus bent light") and paragraph 17 ("layers of an onion peeled through holographic principles"). The method is mentioned but never explained or shown to constrain her approach; no sensor array, instrument, or tactic on the page depends on holographic mechanics. The phrase reads as ornamental scientific flavor rather than a functional means shaping attempts or outcomes.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The xenobiology research station is anchored early (methane sea, titanium ribs, central atrium with magnetic nexus) and remains spatially coherent. The gantry, control panel, and vents are used during the lever sequence, and the roosting xenomorphs stir at the nexus convulsion, showing environmental response. Elira's workstation returns at the end for data logging. The setting supplies the nexus and wings that enable the discovery, and the twilight atmosphere charges tone. However, no spatial constraint or resource limit alters her tactics; the station enables rather than pressures. Solid integration across beats and closure, one step below essential.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Within the hush of beating wings at rest" describes the roosting xenomorphs' state and the station's ambient twilight throughout. The timeframe is more atmospheric than constraining: seventeen cycles of prior work are summarized, and the present scene unfolds in untracked time. The xenomorphs stir once at the nexus convulsion, then fold back into rest, but this does not tighten Elira's decisions or impose a deadline. Present but primarily mood-setting; no live clock that alters moves.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The motivation "to prove that time moves sideways" is seeded in paragraph 5, reiterated in paragraph 7 ("She'd spent seventeen cycles recalibrating sensor arrays"), and drives the lever pull and adjacency encounter. At closure, Elira records her findings and logs the phrase "Time doesn't move forward here. It breathes sideways," fulfilling the goal conceptually. The desire is clear and sustained, but friction between wants and costs is muted—no dramatized struggle between proving the theory and another competing value. The final tea-sipping suggests satisfaction without visible trade-off, keeping it mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Icy warmth" and its variants ("mechanically warm," "icy air with mechanically warm resolve," "icy warmth—the paradox of certainty and wonder") recur throughout, establishing a consistent tonal register. The tone modulates slightly at the adjacency vision (terror, then crystallization), and the synth-tea steam "curling… like a question mark" carries the tone into the final image. However, the tone is more static descriptor than dynamic charge; it colors rather than reweights. Coherent across turns and present at closure, but does not decisively shape the ending's emotional cost or pressure.</comment>
