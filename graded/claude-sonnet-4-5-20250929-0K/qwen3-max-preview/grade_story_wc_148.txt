<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The boy's motivation is dramatized through physical action (slipping through, climbing, kneeling) and his final renunciation when he seals the truth into the lighthouse has visible cost. However, his interiority remains abstract—phrases like "heart hammering" and "voice raw as tide-scoured rock" feel generic rather than character-particular. The spectral witnesses are summoned but remain ornamental; they don't apply immediate pressure that forces the boy to choose between competing goods. His agency at closure (pressing the lattice into the lens) forecloses a path, but the internal contradictions that would make the choice difficult are never embodied on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the lighthouse beam now carries unsilenced truth, reweighting the premise of the "cry wolf" legacy with undeniable conceptual cost (the boy will be called mad, but the truth is sustained). The causal lens holds—each action (finding lattice, wedging it into mechanism, pressing it into lens) narrows options and changes what the light can do. Orientation anchors arrive late: "lighthouse prison" and "iron gate" appear early, but "who" remains unclear until the father's legacy is mentioned at line 4, past the ~120-word gate. Apply −0.3 for delayed anchoring that forces re-reading. The tightening is meaningful (spectral witnesses → sealing them into light), and the cost is felt in the final image of the boy slumped, called mad but triumphant.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The lighthouse prison, jagged reef, and lantern room constrain the boy's ascent and supply the mechanism (lens, rotating beam) that enables the final act. Sensory details—"brine and candle wax," "salt-crusted stones," "barnacle and brine"—are vivid and filtered through urgency. The lattice as micro-setting (the confessional object pressed into the lens housing) charges the final image by reweighting trapped confessions into broadcast truth. Spatial choreography is mostly clear (iron gate → narrow door → third landing → lantern room), though "the scuffs on a narrow door" is an odd phrasing that momentarily obscures entry. The copperlight repose recurs at key beats and modulates the tone without becoming a static descriptor.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—seal the truth before the search party arrives—is signaled early and tightens through the boy's climb and the arrival of spectral witnesses. His agency drives escalation: he chooses to wedge the lattice, then presses it into the lens, actions that narrow his options and transform the lighthouse's function. The search party's boots on gravel in the final third create a live clock that raises cost. One meaningful reversal occurs when the beam fractures into whispers, summoning witnesses rather than merely shining—this turn arises from the boy's choice and reweights his father's legacy. The cost is legible: he will be called mad, and he accepts it ("Let them come"). Minor slip: the spectral hands grasping the railing feel like atmosphere rather than a complication that forces a new choice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—truth sustained when belief is withheld—emerges from concrete particulars: the lattice from confessional, the fractured beam, the boy's kneeling "I believe you." The final image (truth woven into light, carried by every ship) offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. However, "The lighthouse never lies" in the penultimate line edges toward thematic statement rather than trusting the image alone. The copperlight repose recurs and reweights at closure, charging the final triumph with quiet cost. The piece resists tidy resolution—truth is sealed but the boy is dismissed as mad—yet the conceptual victory is undeniable. One late slip: "chasing hush into a prison" in the final third reads as authorial summary rather than earned insight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, with perceptual signature rooted in physicality ("breath shallow," "palms slick," "fingers trembling"). However, diction drifts into elevated register inconsistent with a boy under duress: "copperlight repose," "lattice that sustains impossibilities," "hover, suspended in mid-air like a held breath" feel authored rather than filtered through his terror. At peak stress (kneeling before the spectral hand), syntax remains ornate rather than compressing. Free indirect style is mostly clean, but "They'd call him mad, of course" and "The story was no longer his to tell" read as narratorial commentary rather than the boy's own thoughts. Voice is atmospheric and controlled but not character-particular.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Prose is rhythmically controlled and vivid, but overwriting clusters in high-pressure beats: "Wind gnawed at the jagged reef below, and above, the copperlight repose of dusk draped the tower in amber stillness, as if time itself hesitated to intrude" stacks metaphors (wind gnaws, dusk drapes, time hesitates) without advancing urgency. Paraphrase loop: "He hadn't come for redemption" / "belief wasn't required" / "Let them come"—three statements of defiance that restate stance without added pressure. Template cadence in the middle third: "He pried it loose... He climbed... He wedged... He knelt" uses identical stems across four beats. Filter-verb stack: "he knew," "he found," "he felt" within eight lines mid-climb. Stock metaphor: "noose of mistrust." Apply −0.9 for artifact spread and cap 9+ globally. Information density is high in the lattice and lens sequences, but figurative language in most sentences of the climb flattens propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of "cry wolf" legacy, confessional lattice, and lighthouse beam is specific and non-obvious; the transformation of disbelieved warnings into luminous truth feels earned in hindsight. The choice to seal witnesses into light rather than summon them for confrontation offers a fresh inflection on haunting and testimony. However, the core emotional arc—marginalized truth-teller proves truth through supernatural mechanism—is a familiar template, mitigated by the specific mechanics (lattice + lens + beam). Risk-taking in the accumulative, lyric design heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The piece commits fully to its premise and follows implications (boy accepts being called mad). Minor derivative note: spectral witnesses rising from water echoes genre conventions without strong transformation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The boy's choices—slipping through, climbing, wedging lattice, kneeling, pressing lattice into lens—drive all major turns. He is present in setup, middle (wedging), and closure (sealing). His kneeling "I believe you" and final pressing of the lattice into the lens are causal and irreplaceable; removing him would collapse the plot. Causal pressure is high: each action narrows options. Cost is visible (he will be called mad, slumps spent). Early signal is strong (iron gate, first paragraph). Beat involvement: at least four distinct beats (entry, finding lattice, summoning witnesses, sealing truth). Closure linkage is decisive. No swappability; his bloodline legacy is the premise. Minor friction: his interiority is more atmospheric than character-particular, which slightly weakens irreplaceability of his specific psychology.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The lattice appears on the third landing (early middle), is pried loose, wedged into the mechanism, glows with absorbed sorrow, then pressed into the lens to trap the spectral chorus—four distinct beats with escalating function. Its specific properties (wooden slats from confessional that hold trapped echoes) are irreplaceable and enable the fractured beam. It shapes the middle choice (wedging it to fracture light) and the closure action (pressing it into lens to seal truth). Cost is tied directly to it: the boy's exhaustion and the transformation of the beam. Early signal is solid (~25% mark). Causal pressure is high. Only friction: it is introduced after the door entry, not in the opening paragraph, so setup is delayed but still strong. Closure linkage is absolute.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Chasing hush" is mentioned once in the final paragraph as a label others will apply ("They'd say he chased hush into a prison"), but it does not shape on-page stakes or tactics. The boy's goal is to "thread a labyrinth with his own story" and "seal the truth," not to pursue silence. The concept is ornamental—a thematic echo rather than a driver of choices. No setup in the opening or middle. No cost tied to it. Swappable with "chasing ghosts" or similar. Late, summary-only use. Cap at 4.6 for missing setup and mid-development; score 4.1 for decorative mention without pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Sustains impossibilities" is attributed to the lattice twice: "This object, he knew, sustains impossibilities" and the lattice "glowing now, not with reflected sun, but with absorbed sorrow." The trait enables the beam to fracture into whispers and trap spectral voices, which is causal. However, it is told rather than demonstrated through a visible tradeoff—there is no on-page cost (e.g., the lattice breaking, the boy injured by its use). Present in middle and closure, but the label-only introduction at the third landing and lack of felt constraint lower the score. Causal linkage is moderate; closure involvement is strong. Cap at ~6.9 for told-only cost; score 5.8 for functional but insufficiently embodied pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Hover" appears once in a key image: the beam doesn't just shine—"it hover, suspended in mid-air like a held breath, illuminating not the waves, but the spaces between them." This image redefines the beam's function (from guidance to truth-carrying) and signals the summoning of witnesses, a major turn. It is irreplaceable in charging the closure effect. However, it is a single-beat moment rather than a repeated action; the boy does not enact "hover" himself—it describes the beam's behavior after he wedges the lattice. Present in middle, shapes closure meaning. Causal role is moderate (enables witness arrival). Score 7.4 for strong closure linkage and specificity, but single-beat involvement and lack of protagonist enactment limit higher reach.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Through the scuffs on a narrow door left ajar for decades" is the method of entry, mentioned in one line: "He slipped through the scuffs on a narrow door left ajar for decades." It enables access but is not signaled early (appears after the opening three paragraphs), does not shape attempts or tactics, and could be swapped with "through a rusted gate" or "broken window" without impact. No middle or closure involvement. Ornamental detail. Cap at 4.6 for missing setup; score 3.2 for functional but replaceable and single-mention use.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The lighthouse prison and jagged reef are anchored in the opening line, supply the climb (iron gate → door → third landing → lantern room), constrain the boy's movement, and provide the lens mechanism that enables closure. The reef summons the spectral witnesses ("shadows stirred... shapes rising"), and the lantern room's rotating lens is irreplaceable for the final sealing of truth. The setting shapes at least three beats (entry, climb, closure) and charges the final image (boy slumped by lens, boots on gravel below). Causal pressure is high; spatial choreography is clear. Specificity (lighthouse prison off reef, not generic tower) matters. Cost is tied to setting (exhaustion from climb, isolation enabling the act). Early signal, multi-beat involvement, closure decisive.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Before they find the bodies" anchors the timeframe in the opening paragraph and recurs at the lattice moment ("Before they find the bodies... he had to seal the truth"). The search party's arrival ("boots crunched on gravel") in the final third creates a live clock that tightens the boy's window. However, the bodies themselves are never found or shown, and the time pressure does not force a tactical trade-off—the boy completes his plan before interruption. Present in setup and closure; middle mentions the urgency. Causal role is moderate (hastens final act). Cost is implied (risk of discovery) but not felt on the page as a near-miss. Score 6.9 for two-gate presence and moderate causal pressure, but lack of on-page tightening (he finishes in time without sacrifice) limits higher reach.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"To thread a labyrinth with his own story" is stated in the opening paragraph and implicitly enacted when the boy seals the spectral chorus into the lighthouse beam, ensuring his truth (and theirs) becomes the story. The motivation is present in setup and payoff, but it does not create friction or cost—there is no on-page conflict between this desire and another want. The boy never wavers or confronts a trade-off that tests his commitment to this goal. Functional but told rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. Two-gate presence (setup, closure). Causal linkage is moderate. Cap at ~6.0 for two gates; score 5.4 for lack of embodied friction or choice-level pressure tied to this specific phrasing.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Copperlight repose" recurs at four points: opening ("copperlight repose of dusk"), the fractured beam carrying voices, the final settling over the boy ("copperlight repose settled over him like a shroud of quiet triumph"), and implicit in the beam's function. The tone is coherent and modulates from stillness to charged witness-summoning to triumphant closure. It charges the final image and reweights the opening dusk description. However, it occasionally reads as ornamental ("amber stillness, as if time itself hesitated") rather than pressure-driven. Present in setup, middle (beam), and closure. Causal role is atmospheric but meaningful. Closure linkage is strong. Score 7.1 for multi-beat presence and closure charge, with minor friction from decorative use in low-pressure transitions.</comment>
