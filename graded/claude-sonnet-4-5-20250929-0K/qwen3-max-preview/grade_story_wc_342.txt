<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's face blindness is rendered with specificity—she perceives "textures" and "pressure" rather than features—and drives her unique ability to decode the coin. Her motivation (mirroring the sky before demolition) is irrational and sacred, grounded in years of study. The midway revelation that her blindness is "not a barrier, but a lens" lands cleanly and reweights her self-perception with visible cost (years believing it a deficit). Minor slip: the laugh and smile feel slightly performed rather than contradictory under duress.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates density through the coin-decoding ritual and crescendos in the painted sky, then pivots on the realization ("it was not a barrier, but a lens") to achieve Resonant Reconfiguration. The closure—sitting beneath her painted heavens as the wrecking ball approaches—crystallizes Charged Poise: options have narrowed to endurance, and the cost (ephemeral art, no witnesses) is felt on the page. Orientation anchors arrive promptly (tree trunk library, demolition crews, face blindness). One meaningful deepening (the limit discovered) reweights the dominant stake with conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The hollowed tree trunk library supplies tactile anchors (bark-worn shelves, moss-crusted doors) and the demolition clock pressures every brushstroke. The coin's micro-topography—grooves, depressions, fissures—becomes a micro-setting that constrains her method and charges the final image. Sensory detail is filtered through her tactile bias (charcoal texture, bristle whisper, linseed oil). The painted ceiling reweights the space at closure, fulfilling the gate test: setting constrains method and charges the ending.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: to translate the coin's celestial cipher before dawn demolition. The ticking clock and her accelerated painting ("faster now, not in panic, but in communion") create one meaningful tightening. The cost—ephemeral art no one will see—is legible and accepted ("She didn't need witnesses"). The realization that her blindness enables rather than blocks her work deepens stakes with visible trade-off (years of self-doubt vs. mastery). Minor friction: the hydraulic lifts recur as ambient threat but don't force a tactical pivot.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the contrast between sight and touch, deficit and lens, preservation and transmutation. The coin's indentations literalize the idea that invisibility (to most eyes) holds legible truth for those trained to perceive differently. The closure image—eyes closed, smiling beneath doomed heavens—offers a resonant answer without moralizing: her art is "for translation, for transformation, for turning absence into atmosphere." The limit discovered (others' sight vs. her tactile truth) reweights the premise with conceptual cost. No thematic echo or stated moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited with stable focalization and a distinct perceptual signature: she "felt rather than saw," processed touch as texture and memory. Diction modulates under pressure ("whisper of bristles," "hush thickened"). The phrase "fractally precise accuracy" recurs and risks register drift into technical jargon, but remains voice-motivated. Minor slip: "the ghost-light of dead astronomers" and "dawn bruised the horizon" edge toward purple in adjacent beats, creating slight density overload. No head-hopping; psychic distance holds.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines layer sensory detail with internal shift. Rhythm varies and accelerates ("She painted faster now"). However, several beats exhibit mild overwriting: "swirling with the ghost-light of dead astronomers" and "a comet's tail arcing over the hollow's northern curve" stack figurative language in the closure paragraph without clear payoff. The phrase "a map of muscle and memory she felt rather than saw" is template-adjacent and repeated conceptually. No loops or scaffolding, but density in high-pressure beats crosses into ornamental. Apply −0.6 for figurative density in closure beats and minor template cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of face blindness, tactile star-mapping, and ephemeral art before demolition is specific and non-obvious. The premise transforms the "artist's final work" trope through the coin-cipher mechanism and the paradox that her disability enables mastery. Risk-taking (no witnesses, doomed art) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Minor friction: the "secret book safe" housing a centuries-old coin reads slightly convenience-plotted (why this coin, this guild?). The emotional truth (self-acceptance through craft) grounds the inventiveness.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The face blind portrait artist's trait drives method (tactile decoding), motivation (transmutation over preservation), and the midway revelation (blindness as lens). Her choice to paint despite futility and her acceptance of ephemeral art are both causally linked to her condition. Present in setup, middle painting sequence, and closure smile. High causal pressure and closure linkage; irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The secret book safe appears early, houses the coin, and is closed gently at the end—a purposeful bracket. It signals the guild's secrecy and frames the coin as volatile relic. However, the safe itself does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; it is a container. The coin does the causal work. The safe's reprise at closure reweights the act (returning the coin) but is not indispensable. Two-gate presence (setup, closure) with lyric resonance but no middle development. Cap at ~6.0 for missing middle beat; add +0.4 for closure bracket and specificity.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Discovering limits" is the story's hinge: she discovers that her blindness is not a deficit but a lens, and that others' sight is the true limit. This realization narrows her self-understanding and reweights the final image (sitting beneath doomed art with acceptance). The concept shapes stakes (why she can decode the coin) and the closure beat (the smile). Present in setup (years studying light), middle (midway revelation), and ending (limit articulated). High causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Fractally precise" describes her rendering ability and recurs as a phrase. It enables the coin-decoding (micro-fissures to nebula gradations) and charges her method with specificity. The trait constrains her to tactile perception and enables the star-chart painting. Present in setup, middle (charcoal gradations), and implicit at closure (the painted cosmos). Solid beat involvement and causal pressure. Minor friction: the term borders on label-only in one mention but is operationalized through the painting.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Craft (painting the ceiling) is the story's spine: setup (her history of rendering faces), middle (the painting sequence with charcoal and brushstrokes), and closure (sitting beneath the finished sky). Every major turn traces to this action: the coin-decoding method, the accelerating tempo, the final acceptance. Swapping "craft" for another action would break the story's logic. High irreplaceability, three-beat involvement, and closure dominance.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The method—tracing faint indentations on the coin—is signaled early, operationalized in the middle painting sequence (each groove to brushstroke, depression to pigment swirl), and implicit in the closure's painted cosmos. The coin's invisibility to sight but legibility to touch is the hinge that makes her face blindness an advantage. The mechanics matter: without tactile decoding, the star-chart cannot exist. Three-gate presence, high causal pressure, and indispensable specificity.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The tree trunk library supplies the hollowed chamber (painting surface), the bark-worn shelves (guild history), and the moss-crusted doors (demolition boundary). The setting pressures every brushstroke (dawn deadline) and provides the canvas (ceiling). Present in setup, middle (spatial anchors during painting), and closure (sitting beneath painted heavens). The hollow's curves and northern arc are specific. Strong beat involvement and closure linkage; setting constrains method and charges the final image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The timeframe—hush before dawn demolition—is signaled early (crews idle, "erased at dawn") and recurs (midnight passes, first hydraulic whine, dawn bruises horizon). It accelerates her painting ("faster now") and charges the closure (sitting as the wrecking ball approaches). However, the clock does not force a tactical pivot; she completes the work and accepts its doom without wrestling the deadline. Three-gate presence and solid causal pressure, but the time constraint could tighten choices more.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The motivation—to mirror the sky inside walls—is "simple, irrational, sacred" and grounded in years studying light through canopy gaps. It drives the entire painting sequence and reappears at closure ("Her art was never for display—it was for translation, for transformation"). The want conflicts with futility (no witnesses, demolition), creating friction. Present in setup, middle (painting as communion), and closure (acceptance of ephemeral art). High causal pressure and closure linkage; the cost (futility) is felt.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Heightened stillness is established early ("the only sound the whisper of bristles") and modulates under pressure: stillness deepens during the midway revelation, accelerates slightly ("She painted faster"), then settles into communion and final hush ("listening to the silence thicken"). The tone charges the closure image (eyes closed, smiling in stillness before the wrecking ball). Coherent through turns and integrated with the accumulative lens. Strong tonal control and closure linkage.</comment>
