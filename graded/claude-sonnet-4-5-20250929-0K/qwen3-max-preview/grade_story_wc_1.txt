<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's interiority is heavily laden with reflection and epiphany ("Survival, she had learned, was not triumph—it was subtraction"), yet micro-choices under pressure are absent; she simply executes a foregone conclusion. The "visitors came, eventually" passage shifts to external summary without dramatizing a single interaction or decision that tests her stance. The final gift-giving is asserted as character truth rather than earned through on-page conflict between want and cost. Embodied contradiction is replaced by thesis-statement interiority.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Orientation is established by ~120 words (canyon, stars, glass artist). The closure unit—gifting glass to those who "listen to the canyon's breath"—lands as conceptual repricing, but the cost is asserted ("not emptiness, but the echo of everything worth keeping") rather than dramatized through a visible forfeiture or choice. The story operates in Accumulative/Textural mode, yet the final reconfiguration relies on summary ("she realized") and visitors who arrive off-page, weakening the on-page proof of cost. The ledger's "map of survival" revelation is coincidence that complicates without forcing agency.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Canyon setting and frost patterns constrain the artist's medium and daily rhythm, anchoring the micro-setting effectively. Spatial choreography is clean (kiln, canyon floor, rocks), and the frost's crystalline filigree is filtered through the protagonist's craft-focused attention. The final image of glass sculptures "nestled among canyon stones" charges the ending by merging setting with purpose. Sensory selection leans heavily visual; other senses are underused in peak beats.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—discovering purpose in the pauses—is signaled early, but escalation is replaced by accretion without pressure. The ledger-to-frost "synchrony" moment is a revelation rather than a choice that narrows options. The protagonist's agency in the final third is summary: "she gathered shards… began fusing them… never sold them." No on-page scene dramatizes the trade-off between hiding and healing, or the cost of gifting rather than selling. The meaningful tightening required under Accumulative lens is absent; the story moves laterally through motifs without a visible price paid.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges from image (frost, ledger, glass) rather than thesis, but the final paragraph moralizes directly: "Purpose, she realized, wasn't a destination—it was the act of retracing." The protagonist's arc is inextricable from the thematic question, yet the answer is stated rather than embodied in a non-literal final image. Frost patterns and ledger tracings constrain her medium and accumulate resonance, but the closing epiphany flattens the prior accumulation into neat summary. The piece invites reflection yet hedges with explanation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with a lyric-textural voice that leans toward elevated diction ("drifting resonance of memory and land entwined"). Perceptual signature is glass-artist-focused (molten medium, frost filigree), yet under peak revelation the voice remains uniform rather than modulating with urgency. The prose often tells interiority ("She wanted to discover purpose") instead of trusting image. No dialogue appears. Sentence rhythm is controlled but tends toward parallelism that becomes template-like in the middle third ("Not backward… but forward"; "Not to hide… but to heal").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Multiple paraphrase loops and synonym churn weaken propulsion: "not triumph—it was subtraction" / "Subtract the noise"; "Not coincidence. / Synchrony"; "Not to hide, but to heal. / Not to forget, but to transform." Template cadence runs across the middle section ("No grand declarations. / No forced epiphanies. / Only the quiet accumulation…"). Stock metaphors appear without fresh inflection ("canyon taught her"; "purposes isn't a destination"). Information density is low in the visitor passage, which summarizes rather than dramatizes. Filter verbs and abstract nouns ("purpose," "meaning," "resonance") recur without concrete anchors in peak beats. These artifacts touch the closure image, triggering caps.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The premise—artist heals in canyon by studying frost patterns and embedding them in glass—reads as template artist-in-wilderness recovery without a non-obvious turn. The ledger-as-escape-route revelation is late and unmotivated by prior causal work. Emotional specificity is replaced by generic epiphany language ("survival was not triumph"; "purpose in the pauses"). The frost-to-ledger synchrony is coincidence rather than transformation earned through choice. The final gift economy is asserted rather than tested against a competing want.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The luminous glass artist is present throughout and frames the story, but her key choices—gathering shards, fusing them, gifting sculptures—are summarized rather than dramatized. No on-page decision alters tactics or forecloses a path with visible cost. She observes, realizes, and executes without friction. Present in closure (gifting glass) but her agency there is told, not shown in a single beat where stakes test her.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The charcoal smuggler's ledger strip appears in the opening (traced, felt, smoothed), returns when she matches it to the frost glyph, and is referenced in closure ("framed in a disc of her own glass… touched it before dawn"). Three beats, but its causal role is minimal: it reveals a route that leads "here," where she already is, and the reveal does not force a choice. The cost tied to it is conceptual (testament of rupture) rather than tactical. Charged reprise at closure lifts it into mid-high band, but swappability—any artifact from the fire could serve—caps it below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Scorched testament appears as metaphor in the opening ("its scorched testament: not of guilt, but of rupture") and is echoed in the closure framing ("born of scorched testament and quiet retracing"), but it does not shape stakes or constrain tactics on the page. The concept is thematic rather than mechanical. It does not alter options or force a trade-off. Present at both ends (lyric reprise), which qualifies it for mid-band, but ornamental use and lack of causal pressure cap it.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Steadily adaptive is declared twice ("Steadily adaptive, like her" and "the glass—steadily adaptive") but never dramatized through an on-page action with visible cost. The trait is told, not tested. No scene shows her adapting under pressure or choosing one tactic over another because of this quality. Label-only mention without embodied consequence.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Retrace is the story's structural and thematic spine: she retraces frost patterns daily, retraces the ledger route to the canyon, and the glass sculptures retrace her survival. Three distinct beats (daily frost sketching, ledger-cipher match, glass fusion with tracings) and the final image ("the act of retracing, again and again"). The action enables her medium and shapes the closure's conceptual repricing. Removing retrace would collapse the story's logic. Cost is conceptual (purpose through repetition) rather than tactical, and the action is more iterative than decisive, which keeps it below 8.5.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Patterns in morning frost are signaled early ("each daybreak, she rose before sun, kneeling to study the frost's crystalline filigree"), mechanically detailed (spirals, branching veins, glyphs), and drive the middle turn (frost glyph matches ledger script). The method enables her glass fusion and shapes the closure image (frost patterns pressed into glass). Three beats, causal pressure (the match forces recognition), and closure linkage (sculptures bear frost tracings). Specificity and irreplaceability are strong. Cost is implicit (daily discipline, no grand declarations) rather than dramatized as a trade-off, which nudges it below 8.5.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Quiet canyon under stars is present throughout, frames emotional tone, and supplies resources (sand, salvaged brick for kiln, canyon stones as display). The setting enables her solitude and the frost patterns (canyon rocks each dawn). It appears in the closure image (glass "nestled among canyon stones"). Three beats, but the setting does not constrain a choice or force a trade-off; it is supportive backdrop rather than pressure. Charged reprise and resource provision lift it into mid-band, but lack of tactical constraint caps it below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>After surviving the attempt is the temporal anchor and frames the story's existential stakes, but the timeframe does not tighten decisions or create a clock. "Visitors came, eventually" is vague and tracks no urgency. The passage of time (daily frost study, "that afternoon," "each morning") is iterative rather than progressive. Present in setup and closure framing, but does not constrain tactics or escalate pressure. Functional but replaceable; any post-trauma window would serve.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>To discover purpose in the pauses is declared early ("She wanted to discover purpose in the pauses") and restated in closure ("Purpose, she realized, wasn't a destination—it was the act of retracing"). The motivation frames the dominant stake and drives her daily ritual (studying frost, pressing patterns into glass). Two beats (daily practice, closure realization), but the desire is told rather than dramatized through friction between wants and costs. No on-page scene shows her tempted to rush, sell, or abandon the pauses. The motivation is thesis rather than conflict.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Drifting resonance appears as descriptor ("the glass glowed… with the drifting resonance of memory and land entwined") and closing image ("the glass… sang back to the world in drifting resonance"). Tone is coherent—lyric, meditative, unhurried—and modulates slightly at the ledger-cipher match (brief urgency: "trembling"), but remains largely static. The tone charges the final image by reinforcing the accumulative design. Present in middle and closure, but does not shift under pressure. Lyric reprise with thematic coherence qualifies for mid-band; lack of modulation under stress caps it.</comment>
