<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The restorer's motivation is clear and her methodology consistent throughout, with embodied action (needle work, physical positioning) grounding the POV. Internal contradiction appears minimally—she operates with certainty and competence, never doubting her ritual. The fisherman's confession provides a brief secondary voice, but the protagonist herself displays no meaningful struggle between competing impulses; her reverence deepens but never wavers. The final choice to continue her work is presented as inevitable rather than earned through on-page conflict.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who (mask restorer), where (prism sanctuary), and what (unraveling a net) within the opening lines. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through knot-by-knot progression, silence layering and releasing, culminating in the violent mid-scene knot and the final net's completion. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis)—she will continue this work tomorrow, the cost visible in "joints stiff" and the inexhaustible queue of knotted grief. The sanctuary's sigh and her refusal to look back reconfigure the premise with undeniable momentum.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The prism sanctuary is vividly rendered with sensory specificity (starlight bending into "liquid whispers," pooling at ankles) and constrains action: the pulsing prisms react to the knot's unraveling, dimming as if bracing for storm. The net itself functions as micro-setting, each knot a tactile constraint that the protagonist must navigate. Spatial choreography remains coherent (kneeling, needle slipping between fibers, rising with stiff joints). The sanctuary's exhaled breath at closure charges the final image, fulfilling the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—grounding restless spirits to restore balance—is signaled early and sustained. Escalation operates through knot-by-knot progression: fraying edge → boy's laugh → mother's lullaby → the blackened guilt-knot that "roars" and forces the fisherman's confession. That central knot provides the story's single meaningful tightening, narrowing options (hesitation, then piercing) with visible cost (violent unraveling, walls shaking). Agency is clear in the needle's deployment. However, after that climax the remaining knots deflate into summary, and no further tactical adjustment occurs.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—silence as layered, knotted, restless substance that must be released to restore balance—emerges organically from the net's mechanics and the protagonist's actions. The piece resists moralizing; insights arise through image (the net as "ledger of loss," silence "crystallized" in prisms). The final image of the sanctuary sighing and settling "into a peace it hadn't known since the first net was cast" offers resonant, non-literal closure. Minor thematic echo: "silence, properly tended, could heal even the deepest cuts" edges toward explicit statement but is embedded in action rather than detached summary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>POV distance is stable third-limited with strong perceptual signature: the restorer notices knots, prisms, embodied silence. Diction is elevated and lyric throughout ("moon-silk spun from the last sigh of a drowned lullaby"), consistent but occasionally clashing with tactile immediacy under stress. Filter verbs appear but remain voice-motivated. The fisherman's direct speech ("I cut the line") provides tonal contrast. However, the prose maintains uniform ornamental density even during the violent knot-break, where compression or syntactic shift would better reflect urgency. No head-hopping; focalization is clean.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>High figurative density pervades every beat without modulation: "swollen with salt and silence," "cathedral of captured starlight," "liquid whispers," "bright and brief...like breath on glass," "moths unsure of flame." In the climactic knot-piercing paragraph, metaphor stacks continue ("scream," "teeth," "heart," "roared," "gale of withheld truth") rather than compressing to direct action. Template cadence appears in the middle: "She didn't [X]. She'd done this before. Not here, not under starlight, but in..." Paraphrase loop: "She didn't thank her. Didn't need to." and "She would rest tonight. Tomorrow, another mask..." recycle stems. Information density is high, but propulsion is dulled by ornamental saturation. Applying −0.8 for figurative overload in peak beats and −0.4 for template/loop patterns.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The premise—spirit work conducted by unraveling a physical artifact's silence—offers a fresh synthesis of material ritual and metaphysical stakes. The prism sanctuary and moon-silk needle are specific, non-generic anchors. However, the emotional arc (competent artisan performs ritual, encounters difficult knot, persists, succeeds, continues) follows a familiar template without meaningful subversion. The fisherman's guilt-knot provides the story's single non-obvious turn, but the resolution (confession → fading) is straightforward. No bold structural risk; the piece commits fully to its lyric mode but does not transform its core beats in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The broken mask restorer is introduced in the opening line, drives every beat (kneeling, threading, piercing knots), and her final decision to continue tomorrow closes the piece. Her choice to pierce the blackened knot despite hesitation creates the story's key turn. Present in setup, development (multiple knot decisions), and payoff (walking into the night with certainty). Two beats of distinct choice: engaging the net and confronting the guilt-knot. Causal pressure is moderate; her competence means few options are truly foreclosed.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The tapestry needle appears in paragraph four ("slender and sharp as a vow...threaded with moon-silk"), is used to slip between fibers and pierce the blackened knot (two functional beats), and is tucked into her sleeve at the end "still humming with residual hush." Setup, development, and payoff present. However, the needle's properties (moon-silk thread, specific sharpness) do not constrain tactics or alter cost; any implement could perform the same function. The final "humming" detail charges the image but does not reweight prior action.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Interlaced hush is named in paragraph three and operates as the story's governing metaphor: silence is "layered, stitched, knotted," and the net is a physical instantiation. The concept shapes the restorer's method (release hoarded silence) and the sanctuary's atmospheric pressure (silence "crystallized, fractured into spectral hues"). Present in setup and thematically throughout, but does not create a tactical constraint—no on-page moment where interlacing itself narrows options or imposes cost distinct from "silence" alone. Functions more as thematic lens than causal agent.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Accumulates silence" appears explicitly in paragraph three and paragraph five, framing the net as a silence-hoarder and the sanctuary as a place where "silence didn't just accumulate; it crystallized." The attribute enables the restorer's work (she must release what has accumulated) and explains the spirits' persistence. However, the accumulation itself is not shown constraining a specific choice—she does not run out of capacity, face overflow, or adjust tactics due to volume. The cost is implicit (centuries of grief) rather than a visible trade-off tied to accumulation mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Exhume is named in paragraph three ("She had come to exhume...the interlaced hush") and governs the entire action: she is excavating and releasing knotted silence rather than destroying or preserving. The exhumation drives the unraveling sequence, the guilt-knot's violent release, and the final coiling of the harmless net. Present in setup (stated intent), development (each knot releases a voice or memory), and payoff (net placed in cedar chest as archive). The action redefines the stakes from destruction to reverent release, shaping every beat.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Unraveling knots in a centuries-old fisherman's net is signaled in the opening paragraph (frayed edge of the net) and paragraph six (the net as "ledger of loss, each knot a name"). The method is demonstrated beat-by-beat: edge knot releases a boy's laugh, middle knots yield lullabies and oaths, the blackened knot releases the fisherman's confession. The mechanics matter—tight versus frayed, pulsing versus static—and the final knot's surrender completes the net's transformation. Setup, development across multiple beats, and payoff all present. The method is irreplaceable; the story would collapse without the net's specific structure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The prism sanctuary is introduced in paragraph two and remains the sole location. The prisms actively respond to the protagonist's work: starlight dims when she approaches the blackened knot, then falls "warmer, clearer" after the net is finished. The sanctuary's architecture (arched like a cathedral, facets bending light) creates the story's sensory signature and the final image hinges on its exhaled sigh. Setup, development (prisms pulse in tandem with the knot's resistance), and payoff all present. The setting constrains perception (pooling light at ankles) and charges the closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Across sharing a secret" does not appear as a timeframe on the page. The story unfolds in a single ritual session (kneeling to rising, "joints stiff" marking elapsed effort) with no shared secret structuring the duration. The fisherman's confession ("I cut the line") is a secret released, not shared across time with the protagonist. If interpreted as the time it takes to release each knotted secret, the element is present only as metaphor and does not function as a clock or deadline constraining choices. Late, ornamental at best.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>To ground restless spirits is stated explicitly in paragraph sixteen ("Her motivation wasn't redemption or penance. It was balance. Restless spirits unmoored the world's quiet axis") and demonstrated throughout: each released spirit (boy, sailor, fisherman) is grounded, fading "inward—into the grounded quiet she'd carved." The motivation explains her patient knot-work and her refusal to look back. Setup (paragraph five: spirits cling to silence), development (each unraveling grounds a spirit), and payoff (sanctuary settles into peace) all present. Friction is minimal—she never doubts or struggles against the goal itself, only the difficulty of individual knots.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Lucid unrest is evoked throughout: "restless spirits," "the lucid unrest of a world made lighter," clarity amid accumulation ("prism-light like breath on glass"), and the sanctuary's crystallized silence. Tone remains consistently poised between clarity and disturbance, modulating slightly (quiet opening, violent mid-knot roar, exhaled stillness at close). The final image—"lucid unrest of a world made lighter, quieter, truer"—names the tone explicitly and charges it. Setup, development, and payoff present. However, the explicit naming in the final third reduces subtlety, and the tone does not shift dramatically under the story's peak pressure; it remains lyrically elevated throughout.</comment>
