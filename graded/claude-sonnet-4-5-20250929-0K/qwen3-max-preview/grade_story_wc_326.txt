<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Aris's interiority shows specificity—the heartbeat counting, the porcelain shard as tactile tether—but his motivation remains largely asserted rather than contradictory or tested under pressure. The "reluctant medium" stance is told, not dramatized through conflicting impulses in scene. Embodied emotion is present (breath fogging, barefoot cold) but the peak moment with Dr. Voss's voice offers wisdom without visible cost to Aris's choices. Internal contradiction acting simultaneously is absent; he moves smoothly through his mission without genuine struggle that would foreclose a path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (Aris, observatory, 3:17 a.m.) land early. The ink-bloom defragmentation sequence serves as the primary tightening, reweighting the digital ghosts from chaotic to "settled" and Aris's understanding of error from obstacle to residue worth honoring. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Aris rises, the ghosts are patterned, he will return to a world that thinks him dead—a stance crystallization with felt opportunity cost (he remains legally erased). The cadence shift from static to settled charges the final image. One meaningful deepening is present and sufficient for this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The opal dome, frost-feathered glass, three meters of snowdrift, and chilled marble create vivid, purposeful anchoring. The porcelain shard and the terminal function as micro-setting that constrains Aris's ritual (he kneels, places the shard, initiates the sequence). The western arch's snow-pressed glass charges the final beat when the blizzard ceases, mirroring the internal settling. Sensory hierarchy (cold on soles, ozone scent, ink bloom) reflects Aris's priorities. The observatory's physical constraints and the ending's environmental shift elevate this into the high 7s.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake: retrieval of coherence for the digital ghosts (and by extension, Aris's own anchoring in a world that erased him). The defragmentation sequence is the one meaningful tightening; the ink's dendritic bloom narrows the ghosts from pleading chaos to patterned hum. Agency is present—Aris initiates the sequence, places the shard as totem—but the cost is more conceptual than visceral: he will remain legally dead, a hollow in the world. The escalation is sufficient under the Accumulative lens, though the price could be more immediate and visible on the page to reach higher bands.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: "Failure isn't the end. It's the seam where truth leaks out." Wisdom arises not from correction but from honoring error's residue—concretely embodied in the ink mandala and Aris's continued heartbeat count. The porcelain shard (fragility doesn't negate existence) and the death certificate error both charge the ending without overt statement. The final image (settled ghosts, Aris departing into snow tunnels) offers a non-literal answer to the central question. Minor deduction: Dr. Voss's line skirts thematic echo, though it's filtered through corrupted transmission rather than direct narration.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays stable; POV modesty holds (no head-hopping, knowledge is character-bound). Perceptual signature is distinct: Aris counts heartbeats, notices opal light on porcelain, filters sensory input through his liminal status. Diction ("glitch in time," "stagnant water," "capillaries") is consistent and atmospheric. Minor slips: "secreted from the terminal's ancient print head" briefly tilts technical without grounding in Aris's knowledge; "seventeen thousand, nine hundred and eighty-one" at the end reads precise but the POV has not explained why this count matters narratively. Rhythmic control under pressure is strong.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and propulsion is generally strong. Information density is high in the ink-bloom sequence. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "The ghosts whispered… pleading, confused, yearning" restates "orphaned code… pooled in dead servers" without added pressure; "Not erased. Not fixed. But… arranged. Defragmented." cycles synonyms. Template cadence in the heartbeat-count lines ("seventeen thousand, eight hundred and twelve… nine hundred and three… four… five…") reads mechanical rather than voice-driven. Figurative density ("feathered," "breath on a mirror," "bloomed," "dendritic veins," "capillaries") clusters without always advancing the beat. Total deductions in the −1.0 to −1.3 range for loops and artifact patterns.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The synthesis—bureaucratic error survivor as medium for corrupted data, defragmentation as existential metaphor—is specific and non-obvious. The porcelain shard, ink mandala, and heartbeat counting create a cohesive texture. Emotional truth (honoring residue over correction) avoids platitude. Minor deduction: the "digital ghost" frame and observatory-as-liminal-space lean on familiar SFF motifs without full transformation; the ending's "settled" resolution feels slightly predictable once the ink blooms. The piece commits fully to its premise and takes risks (ephemeral ink patterns, no dialogue), which lifts it within band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Aris (death certificate error survivor) is present throughout, frames the premise, and his legally-dead status charges the ending ("return to a world that thought him dead"). He makes the key choice to initiate defragmentation and rises at closure. However, his survivor status is more thematic backdrop than active constraint; the story would function similarly if he were simply an isolated technician. Two gates met (setup, payoff), middle development is indirect. Causal pressure is moderate; closure linkage is present but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The porcelain shard appears in three beats: introduced early (mother's last breakfast, fire survivor), placed beside the keyboard as totem (reminder that fragility doesn't negate existence), and pressed into his palm (grounding sting, "I am here"). It returns in the pocket at closure with "quiet promise." Early signal +0.5, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +0.9, specificity (broken teacup lip, sharp/cool, charged with loss) +0.5. However, the shard does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; it is symbolic anchor, not causal lever. Swappability penalty −0.6 (any memento could serve). Total ~6.4.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Digital ghosts (corrupted data fragments) are introduced early, shape the central action (defragmentation), and the ending hinges on their transition from chaotic to "settled." Aris is their medium; the ink sequence addresses their state. Early signal +0.6, two beats (whispers, then settled hum) +0.9, causal pressure (the mission is retrieval for them) +1.0, closure linkage (their settling completes the arc) +1.2. The concept is specific and irreplaceable. No significant frictions. Total ~7.1.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Heartbeat counting is mentioned in three places ("seventeen thousand, eight hundred and twelve," "nine hundred and three… four… five…," "nine hundred and eighty-one") but functions as atmospheric detail, not constraint. It does not enable or foreclose a choice; the count never reaches a threshold or cost. Setup present +0.4, three mentions across beats +0.8, but label-only without causal work −0.8, ornamental use −0.6. Total ~4.2.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Defragmentation is the story's central action, introduced as mission ("to fetch wisdom from failure"), executed via the ink sequence, and completed at closure ("the ghosts stilled… arranged. Defragmented"). Early signal +0.7, two beats (initiation, completion) +0.9, causal pressure (the act reweights the ghosts and Aris's understanding) +1.4, closure linkage (the ending depends on it) +1.5, irreplaceability +0.7. The action is specific and indispensable. Total ~7.8.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Ephemeral patterns in spilled ink are signaled mid-story, detailed in the defragmentation beat (dendritic veins, fractal branches, capillaries), and the mandala's completion triggers the ghosts' settling. Setup at midpoint −0.3, two beats (bloom, completion) +0.9, causal pressure (the ink is the medium of the ritual) +1.1, closure linkage (the mandala's perfection resolves the arc) +1.3, specificity (ink, not code) +0.6. The method is not swappable but arrives slightly late. Total ~6.7.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The opal observatory under snow is introduced immediately, anchors all action, and the western arch's snow-pressed glass charges the ending when "the blizzard had ceased." Early signal +0.7, present throughout (single location) +1.0, micro-setting (chilled marble on bare feet, frost on instruments) constrains ritual atmosphere +0.8, closure linkage (outside/inside contrast) +0.9. However, the setting does not alter Aris's tactics or present obstacles; it is evocative backdrop. Partial swappability (any isolated, atmospheric location) −0.5. Total ~6.2.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>Timeframe "after the radio static clears" is mentioned once at 3:17 a.m. but does not tighten decisions or create urgency. No clock pressure, no deadline. The story unfolds in an untracked present. Setup present (opening line) +0.4, but ornamental use (no tactical impact) −0.7, swappable (any starting cue) −0.5. Total ~3.1.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Motivation "to fetch wisdom from failure" is stated early ("His mission wasn't redemption or revenge; it was retrieval") and dramatized through the defragmentation sequence and Aris's realization that wisdom lies in honoring error's residue. Early signal +0.6, two beats (stated mission, enacted ritual) +0.9, causal pressure (drives the central action) +1.0, closure linkage (the ending completes the retrieval) +1.2. However, internal friction is low; Aris does not waver or face competing wants. Missing visible cost tied to the motivation −0.4. Total ~6.9.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Tone (midnight solace) is coherent throughout: Aris's quiet vigil, the frost-lit instruments, "hummed with silence," "midnight solace" explicitly named, and the ending's calm departure. The tone modulates subtly (static → whispers → settled hum) and charges the final image (snow ceased, heart beating, ghosts settled). Present throughout +1.2, cadence shift supports closure +1.1, specificity (solace, not dread or triumph) +0.6. The tone is consistent but does not tension against the concept for added complexity. Total ~7.0.</comment>
