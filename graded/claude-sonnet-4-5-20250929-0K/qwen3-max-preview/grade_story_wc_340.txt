<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The servant remains observant throughout but agency is minimal—she climbs, reads, and reflects without facing a meaningful internal contradiction or cost that alters her trajectory. Emotion is largely told through poetic labels ("affectionate detachment," "warmly inquisitive") rather than embodied through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously under pressure. The "trembling" and "tears that hover" gesture toward feeling but stay decorative; no on-page micro-choice reveals a hierarchy of competing values with visible cost. The final acceptance is asserted, not earned through dramatized struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the ascent accumulates sensory fragments and textural density toward a thematic reweighting at the top. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (acceptance articulated through the diary's final passage and the servant's internalization), but cost remains abstract—no concrete path is foreclosed, no tactical option lost. The piece teaches its lyric pattern early and holds spatial coherence (elevator → observation deck), yet the ending reconfigures meaning through assertion rather than a visible before/after with felt price. Orientation is clean; causality is loose but acceptable under this lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The icebound spire, elevator shaft, and observation deck are vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (frost-rimmed seams, glacial bronze bell, whale-skin binding). Spatial choreography is clean across the climb. The goggles' cracked lenses and the light's prismatic scatter constrain the cipher's discovery, pushing this into the mid-7s. The frostbloom at floor three and the alcove at the peak charge the final image with environmental specificity. Minor issue: the cloud-sea and wind at the peak feel postcard-pretty rather than forcing a tactical adjustment.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—seeking joy beneath anguish—is signaled early but remains abstract throughout; no concrete on-page cost tests commitment. The servant encounters no obstacle, reversal, or rival interpretation; the goggles yield their secret on schedule without forcing a trade-off or tactical shift. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening would suffice, but here discovery feels inevitable rather than earned through pressure. The final passage is received, not won. No visible price paid; no option foreclosed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Theme—joy as sorrow's companion, memory as resilience—emerges from image and diary fragment rather than direct moralizing, which is strong. The goggles and frostbloom recur with shifted weight at closure. However, the final diary passage ("Joy hides not beneath, but within") edges toward a stated thesis, and the servant's acceptance lacks the friction or ambiguity that would deepen resonance. The piece invites reflection, but the answer is delivered rather than discovered through on-page struggle. Subtext operates in image but is diluted by poetic abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization is stable; psychic distance and tense remain consistent. Perceptual signature is present (the servant notices rivets, etchings, frost patterns) but lacks strong character-specific bias—her gaze reads generically poetic rather than filtered through occupation or personal history. Diction is elevated and lyric, matching the intended tone, though some constructions ("warmly inquisitive even in solitude," "affectionate detachment") tell rather than show. No dialogue to judge. Rhythmic control is strong; sentence variety supports the accumulative design. Minor slip: some filter verbs ("she saw," "she felt") dull immediacy in peak beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout—nearly every sentence carries metaphor or poetic construction ("cloth softer than snowfall," "breath on ice," "lanterns refusing to dim")—which becomes ornamental rather than pressure-driven in middle beats. Several paraphrase loops: lines 10–11 repeat the "unfolding" concept without adding pressure; lines 24–25 restate "not to be solved, but absorbed" in adjacent clauses. Template cadence: "She did not rush. She knelt. She breathed." reads as purposeful triplet, but similar structures recur. Information density is moderate; many lines do one job (describe) rather than two. Propulsion sags in the middle third where discovery is stretched across multiple beats without escalation. No major causality breaks, but scaffold and poetic padding lower the score.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The core premise—encrypted diary in airship captain's goggles discovered via light cipher during an elevator ascent—offers a fresh synthesis of elements, lifting the piece above generic templates. Execution, however, leans on familiar beats: the mentor's lost log, the cipher revealed by angled light, the wisdom-in-acceptance conclusion. Emotional specificity is modest; the servant's arc follows a predictable contemplative trajectory without bold risk or non-obvious moral calculus. The icebound-spire setting and lyric accumulation show craft, but the story does not transform its tropes into something that feels inevitable in hindsight. Swappability test: change the setting and object, and the emotional arc remains largely unchanged.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The ascending servant is present throughout and her climb frames the narrative, satisfying setup and timeframe. However, her agency is observational: she polishes, gazes, reads, and internalizes without making a key choice that alters tactics or forecloses a path. Development is minimal—she deciphers passively (light does the work) and accepts the diary's message without internal conflict. Closure participation is thematic (she carries the truth downward) but not causal. Swappable with "any seeker" archetype. Score reflects functional presence across beats but lack of decision-driven turns.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The airship captain's goggles appear early (line 5), return at the cipher discovery (lines 8–9, 16), rest on her brow at closure (line 22), and their "fractured view" reweights perception in the final descent (line 29). They enable the light-cipher mechanic and carry emotional charge as the mentor's legacy. Three distinct beats; causal role in discovery; closure linkage strong. Irreplaceability high—removal breaks the discovery method and thematic lens. Minor friction: middle use (lines 16–17) is somewhat static (humming while tracing) rather than forcing a tactical shift. Strong integration overall.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Encrypted diary discovery is the structural spine: teased in line 6 (final log rumored), cipher revealed at line 8, vellum fragment at line 10, full diary at line 21, read and internalized by line 26. Setup, development, and payoff all present. The encryption (spiral cipher, light-angle reveal) shapes the method and timing of discovery. However, the "encryption" is resolved without struggle or cost—light does the work, and the servant deciphers via hum and memory without obstacle. The concept frames stakes but does not narrow options or force a trade-off. Solid integration but lacks the pressure and cost for higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Warmly inquisitive" is named in line 3 but functions as a label rather than a trait that constrains or enables action. Her gaze "traces" and she "smiles" with "affectionate detachment," but no on-page choice hinges on curiosity versus caution, warmth versus reserve. The attribute colors tone but does not create a visible tradeoff or cost. Present across beats as descriptive texture; swappable with "gentle" or "thoughtful" without structural change. Setup only; no development or payoff that alters tactics.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Unfold" appears in line 10 (unfolding the goggles' strap to reveal vellum) and is echoed thematically in the diary's final instruction (line 24: "Unfold it gently"). Setup and closure reprise present; the physical act enables the first discovery. However, the action itself is not dramatized as a choice under pressure—it's a natural next step. Swappable with "examine" or "inspect" in most beats. The thematic callback at closure reweights meaning but does not transform prior material with undeniable cost. Lyric resonance is present but causal necessity is modest.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Through scattered light" is seeded at line 7 (sliver of light at fifth floor), becomes the discovery mechanism at line 8 (prismatic shards reveal the cipher), and is reinforced at line 16 (light shifts at floor nine, cipher glows amber). Setup, development, and payoff all on the page. The method is specific and its mechanics matter—the cipher is "invisible unless caught at the right angle." However, the light appears conveniently without the servant adjusting her position or timing; no struggle or alternate attempt. Causal role in one major beat (cipher reveal); closure participation indirect. Solid integration but lacks the felt cost or tactical constraint for higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The icebound spire is anchored early (line 3) and its verticality structures the entire ascent. The observation deck at the peak (line 20) provides the diary's resting place; the wind and cloud-sea charge the final image. The frozen environment enables the light-cipher mechanic (frost-rimmed seams, scattered light) and the alcove at the top supplies the payoff. Setup, development, and payoff present. The setting pressures choices modestly—verticality creates suspense, cold and wind appear at closure—but does not force a tactical adjustment or constrain a key decision. Spatial choreography is clean; micro-setting (goggles, elevator shaft) also contributes. Strong atmospheric integration; causal pressure moderate.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The ten-floor climb is named in line 2, tracked at floors five (line 7), seven (line 13), and nine (line 16), and concludes at the final floor (line 19). The timeframe structures the narrative and creates a gentle rising rhythm. However, the clock never tightens a decision—each floor is a milestone, not a pressure point. The servant does not race against time, miss a window, or adjust tactics due to the ascent's duration. Present and tracked; functional but replaceable with "a slow walk" or "a journey." Timeframe shapes pacing but does not alter moves or cost.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"To seek out the joy beneath anguish" is named in line 4 as the mission whispered by the wind. The diary fragments deliver the thematic answer (lines 11, 24, 27), and the servant's final internalization (lines 28–30) completes the arc. Setup and closure present; the motivation frames the quest. However, the desire is never dramatized as conflicted—no moment where seeking joy costs her something tangible, no friction between grief and acceptance. The motivation is told and fulfilled without on-page struggle or competing impulse. Thematic through-line is clear but lacks the friction and cost for higher integration.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Affectionate detachment" is named in line 12 and permeates the narration: the servant observes with warmth but no urgency, smiles without triumph, and reads "not to uncover tragedy, but to witness resilience" (line 26). The tone modulates subtly—intensity rises with the cipher's glow (line 16), softens at the seal-breaking (line 23)—and charges the final image where "gratitude, not distortion" reframes the fractured lenses (line 29). Coherent across turns; tone supports closure without stating theme. Strong integration. Minor issue: some moments (tears as "tiny lanterns") tip toward sentimentality, and the tone occasionally flattens pressure rather than sharpening it.</comment>
