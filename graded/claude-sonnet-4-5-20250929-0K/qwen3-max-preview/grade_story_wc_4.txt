<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The archivist remains at observational distance throughout, with no on-page choices that alter her situation or tactics. Interiority consists of label-only reflections ("she believed," "she knew") without embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. The photographs receive more dramatic attention than the protagonist's agency. No meaningful change or credible endurance with visible cost occurs; she simply repeats tomorrow what she did today.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation Test penalty applied: who/where/when anchors arrive late (~paragraph 3) without purposeful disorientation that pays off at closure (−0.4). No on-page closure effect: the protagonist will return tomorrow to do the same work with no decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing that forecloses a path or reweights meaning. The ending is pure repetition without visible cost or stance crystallization. Drive lens remains unclear—attempts at accumulative texture fail to cohere into a meaningful tightening or cadence shift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Lavender field and factory ruins are vividly described but function as postcard backdrop. The dove gray case is opened and closed without constraining choice. Spatial choreography is coherent, and sensory detail is selective, but no environmental element meaningfully shapes a decision or charges the final image—she simply leaves as she arrived.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>No dominant stake dramatized on the page; "collective healing" remains abstract. The protagonist faces no opposition, makes no tightening choice, and experiences no reversal. Photograph examination is pure observation without tension or cost. The promised return tomorrow confirms static repetition rather than escalation or transformation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Theme of healing-through-curation is stated rather than earned through specific conflict. The arc motif (kites, spines, vines) is announced by the protagonist herself ("let the arc complete itself"), creating thematic echo that replaces scene pressure (−0.6). Photographs offer potential symbolic resonance but are summarized, not dramatized. The ending restates the opening premise without reweighting prior material.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Narrative voice maintains consistent elevation and lyric rhythm, but the register drifts into abstract philosophizing ("tension could become grace if held with enough tenderness") that exceeds the POV's lived moment. Filter verbs ("she knew," "she believed") stack without voice motivation, dulling immediacy. Distance remains stable. The single line of dialogue to lavender feels whimsical but does not pursue a goal or carry subtext.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Pervasive paraphrase loops and template cadence: "She placed... then withdrew," "More photographs... More arcs... More silences" creates mechanical parallelism. Figurative language appears in nearly every sentence of high-focus beats without pattern payoff (density penalty −0.5). Stock metaphors ("stubborn hope," "quiet magic") and elevated diction ("transmute," "alchemy") clash with scene immediacy (register drift −0.4). Sentence openings recycle "She [verb]" across a dozen lines (template cadence −0.5). Artifacts touch the final third, disallowing 9+ and capping high-band entries at 8.8 globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Core premise—archivist curates emotion through photographs in poetic ruin—follows a familiar lyric-essay template without transformation. The character performs aesthetic labor but makes no choices that test the concept's implications. Metaphorical language (arcs, vines, alchemy) is decorative rather than integrated into causal pressure. Risk-averse execution avoids conflict in favor of mood.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>Character is present throughout but makes no decision that alters tactics or stakes. Observation and arrangement occur off-page or in summary. No key turn traces to her agency.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Case appears in opening, is opened mid-piece, and closed at dusk. Handled in three beats but with static function—it holds photographs without evolving meaning or constraining choice. Closure reprise is ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Collective healing" is declared as motivation but never dramatized as a stake or choice on the page. Functions as thematic label only.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"Perceptively calm" is label-only. No on-page action demonstrates this trait constraining or enabling a choice with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Linger" is performed across multiple photograph beats and named explicitly. It shapes the rhythm of observation but does not create a turn or redefine options—easily swappable with "study" or "contemplate."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Photographs appear and are described in the middle section. The arcs within them are traced but do not alter the protagonist's tactics or generate new pressure. Method is present but functional rather than indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Lavender field and ruins anchor the piece spatially and supply sensory detail. They frame the work but do not pressure a choice or supply a resource that affects outcome. Postcard use, not micro-setting constraint.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>Vines climbing and dusk arrival suggest elapsed time, but no clock tightens decisions. Time is atmospheric rather than tactical.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Motivation is stated early and repeated but never tested by friction or cost. The protagonist pursues this desire without obstacle, making it ornamental rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Tone blends whimsy (talking to lavender, "quiet magic") with earnest elevation consistently. It modulates with the photograph beats and charges the lyric final image, though no pressure tests the tone's limits.</comment>
