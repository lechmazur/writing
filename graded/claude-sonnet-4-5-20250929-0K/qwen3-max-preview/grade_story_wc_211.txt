<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elira's interiority is vividly embodied through sensory detail ("velvet disquiet spreading through her bones") and her gift functions as both trait and curse. However, her final choice to "awaken" the orchard and release petals feels more announced than earned by prior internal conflict—the shift from archivist to activist happens via exposition ("she understood then") rather than through dramatized struggle. The businessman's smile provides a micro-consequence, but Elira herself pays no visible cost for crossing this threshold. Motivation remains clear throughout, but the peak choice lacks contradictory impulses acting in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes a coherent Accumulative/Textural lens: the orchard hums, petals fall, memory spills into air, building density toward the release of emotional spores. Orientation anchors (Elira, rooftop garden, post-foghorn dawn) land early. The closure—releasing petals to reintroduce archived feeling into the city—qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), reweighting her role from passive archivist to active cultivator. Cost is present but oblique: the city's forgetting accelerates even as she seeds empathy, and she commits to an indefinite cycle ("She would keep archiving. She would keep speaking."). The prophecy mechanism and the orchard's responsiveness are taught, but the causal link between child-Elira's words and the garden's dormancy feels asserted rather than explored, creating minor motivational drift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The skyscraper orchard is rendered with vivid, purposeful detail: gnarled plum trees through cracked marble, roots drinking from rain-catchers shaped like forgotten gods, petals holding lullabies. Setting directly enables the climactic action—petals become vessels for the Field Trip memory, released to transform street-level affect. Spatial choreography remains clean across the elevator ascent, rooftop ritual, descent, and street release. The orchard's infrastructure (brass elevator, portable phonograph, copper-lined pouch) integrates smoothly into Elira's choices. Sensory detail is filtered through her archival lens without lapsing into catalog mode.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preservation of emotional truth against civic sterilization—is signaled early and remains coherent. The accidental prophecy provides a meaningful tightening: Elira shifts from passive archiving to active awakening, narrowing her options to this exact ritual. However, escalation lacks a visible opposing force or complication; the orchard responds immediately, the petal dissolves on cue, and no resistant element tests her commitment. The businessman's smile serves as proof of concept rather than a cost-bearing consequence. The piece achieves one deepening but does not force a trade-off or foreclose a live path with on-page friction.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—memory as living substrate, emotion as cultivable spore—emerges organically from the orchard's architecture and Elira's ritual, avoiding direct statement. The Field Trip cylinder and child-prophecy reprise create thematic charge without moralizing. The final image ("roots threading deeper into the building's steel bones, branches reaching toward a sky slowly clearing of smog—and forgetting") offers a resonant, non-literal answer: preservation and loss coexist, the orchard breathes against the city's amnesia. Subtext operates in the velvet disquiet, the municipal decree post-Smog, and the unnoticed change. Minor thematic drift: "velvet disquiet" as tone is announced late and not fully integrated into prior action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable and Elira's perceptual signature—dead languages, sensory immersion, archival idiom—is distinct. Diction stays elevated but character-consistent ("velvet disquiet," "cotton-candy clouds," "pea-soup gloom"). The immersion ritual is narrated with controlled psychic distance, and filter verbs ("felt," "realized," "understood") are voice-motivated. However, several key beats rely on expository interiority that tells rather than shows: "she understood then: the emotional patterns weren't merely stored here; they were cultivated" unpacks the premise mid-scene rather than letting action dramatize it. The final paragraph's summary cadence ("She would keep archiving. She would keep speaking.") deflates the prior image's charge.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Prose is lyric and textured with strong figurative control ("dissolved time like sugar in tea," "slow snow"). Information density is high in the opening paragraphs. However, the middle section accumulates minor scaffold: "It was an accidental prophecy" labels what the prior line demonstrated; "She understood then" and "The response was not words, but warmth" are expository bridges that could be cut. The orchard's hum and petal-drift sequence repeats similar action beats without variation. Template cadence appears in adjacent paragraphs: "She [verb]. [Noun] [verb]." loops through the climax. No major loops touch the closure, but cumulative minor redundancy and filter-verb stacks in peak beats ("felt," "realized," "understood") apply −0.8 in Q7 under the patterned-artifact pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of skyscraper orchard, wax-cylinder archive, and municipal emotional ecosystem is specific and non-obvious, avoiding template urban-fantasy premises. The accidental prophecy—spoken by child-Elira without intent—offers a fresh inflection on fate-versus-choice. Elira's dead-language gift and the orchard's response in pre-cuneiform syllables deepen the premise. However, the emotional-spore release and the businessman's inexplicable smile echo familiar "one small act changes the city" beats. The piece commits fully to its premise but does not take bold structural risks; the two-part structure (ritual, then release) is competent rather than ingenious.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elira's choices—playing the cylinder, kneeling to whisper in dead languages, releasing petals—drive all major beats and the closure. She is on the page throughout, and her shift from passive archivist to active cultivator is the story's spine. However, her final choice is more announced than dramatized under pressure; she acts without visible friction or cost. Subtracting −0.6 for low dramatized friction at the peak choice and −0.3 for the lack of a visible tradeoff keeps the score in the 7.0–7.4 range.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The wax cylinder appears early ("Field Trip, Class 3-B"), is handled and immersed in the ritual, played on the phonograph, and labeled for a new recording at the end. It enables the peak beat (child-prophecy triggers orchard awakening) and returns with reweighted meaning (archive becomes activation). However, its exact properties—why this cylinder versus another—are not explored; it is functionally interchangeable with any memory vessel. Present in setup, middle, and closure, but specificity and irreplaceability remain mid-level. Early signal +0.5, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.0, swappability −0.5, no unique cost −0.4 yields ~6.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The accidental prophecy ("When the horn falls quiet, the orchard will remember what the city forgot") is seeded early, discovered mid-scene, and shapes Elira's shift from archiving to awakening. It alters her tactics and charges the closure by retroactively justifying the orchard's existence. However, the prophecy's mechanics—how child-Elira knew, why it matters now—are told rather than dramatized, and the orchard's response feels preordained rather than earned. Setup +0.6, middle choice +0.4, closure +0.9, causal pressure +0.6, told-not-shown −0.8, late development −0.3 yields ~5.9.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elira's ability to speak dead languages (Etruscan, Linear A, Sumerian) is mentioned early and used in the climactic ritual when she kneels and whispers to the orchard. The orchard responds "in syllables older than cuneiform," validating the trait's function. However, the cost or constraint of this gift is never dramatized—it is described as a "curse" but never limits or complicates her choices on the page. The trait enables one beat but remains largely ornamental. Early signal +0.4, one beat +0.4, label-only −0.5, no cost −0.6 yields ~4.2.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Immersion—"not metaphorically, but bodily, through a ritual of scent, touch, and sound"—is the story's hinge action. It appears early, is described with sensory specificity, transports Elira into the Field Trip memory where she hears her own prophecy, and directly triggers the orchard's awakening. Removing this action would collapse the story's logic. The ritual's mechanics (scent, touch, sound) are specified and constrain the beat. Early signal +0.7, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage +1.5, specificity +0.6, no swappability yields ~8.1.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The Field Trip memory is labeled early ("Class 3-B, April 12, 1987"), Elira immerses herself in it, and the child-prophecy embedded within reshapes her understanding and tactics. The memory is not merely backdrop—it supplies the exact frequency ("Miko's giggle and her own childish oracle") that awakens the orchard. The method is signaled, used, and integral to closure. However, the specifics of the memory (Miko, Mrs. Trumble, foghorn lesson) could be swapped for another third-grade moment without structural loss. Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.0, closure +1.2, mild swappability −0.4 yields ~7.6.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The rooftop orchard is introduced in paragraph two, anchors all action, and its properties—gnarled trees through marble, roots drinking from rain-catchers, petals holding emotional echoes—directly enable the climax. The orchard hums, sheds petals, and those petals become the story's resolution mechanism. Setting is not merely scenic; it is the story's logic. Early signal +0.8, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.5, closure linkage +1.8, irreplaceability +0.7 yields ~8.3.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The foghorn's silence opens the story and frames the timeframe ("at dawn," "after the Great Smog of '79"), and the prophecy links the horn's silence to the orchard's awakening. However, time itself does not tighten decisions—there is no clock, no urgency, no deadline that alters Elira's tactics. The foghorn functions more as thematic marker than temporal constraint. Early signal +0.5, thematic closure linkage +0.7, no pressure from time −0.6, no tracked urgency −0.4 yields ~5.4.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elira's motivation to archive emotional patterns is stated early, dramatized through her ritual with the cylinder, and tested when the prophecy shifts her purpose from preservation to awakening. The friction between archiving (passive) and awakening (active) creates meaningful tension, and her final commitment to "keep archiving" and "keep speaking" shows the cost of her new dual role. The desire is not merely told; it shapes her choices across setup, middle, and closure. Early signal +0.7, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.0, closure +1.3, friction +0.6 yields ~7.8.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Velvet disquiet is named explicitly late ("That was the nature of velvet disquiet: soft, pervasive, transformative without spectacle") and describes the story's affective register—hushed dread, liminal unease, quiet transformation. The tone is coherent through Elira's ritual and the petal release, and it charges the final image of roots threading into steel and sky clearing of "smog—and forgetting." However, the label arrives after the tone has already been established, and its explicit naming feels more like a theme statement than a modulating pressure. Coherent execution +0.8, closure charge +0.9, late explicit label −0.5, told-not-shown −0.4 yields ~6.1.</comment>
