<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The druid's motivations are established—finder of lost truths confronting her own buried memories—but her transformation relies heavily on summary exposition of past relationships rather than embodied present struggle. The seed's invasion is described through abstract anatomical mapping ("roots unfurled beneath her flesh, mapping veins") rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The final "unbending" reads as told revelation rather than a choice earned through opposing desires: she kneels, the seed awakens, and epiphany arrives without dramatized resistance or cost-visible refusal.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation is established (druid at cursed lake after failed magic trick), and closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration through the seed's revelation process. However, the accumulative lens remains ambiguous—the expanding circles feel more metaphorical than tactical, and the causal chain from kneeling to transformation to "catching" light lacks clear because/therefore linkage. The cost is asserted ("She was no longer guarded. She was revealed") but not dramatically foregrounded in a specific forfeiture or changed option. The piece teaches a lyric pattern but the closure unit remains somewhat diffuse.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The orchard vortex is vividly rendered with specific images (inverted branches, petals like stained glass shards, faces in ice) that sustain atmosphere throughout. The lake surface holding her weight and the ice pressing against her palm provide tactile anchor points that constrain movement. The environment charges the final image when "the lake drained into sky" and "orchard bloomed upward," meeting the 9+ gate requirement of setting shaping closure, though the spatial logic of walking on a vortex eye remains somewhat abstract.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—confronting buried truths—is signaled early and sustained, but escalation operates through accretion of visions rather than narrowing tactical options. The seed's method ("through expanding circles") describes the process but doesn't dramatize a choice that forecloses a path. The druid's agency reads passive: she kneels, the seed acts, visions arrive, transformation completes. No reversal or tightening alters her available moves; the journey from guarded to revealed lacks a visible price paid in renounced capability or relationship.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme—truth beneath mirrors, unbending as return to authentic shape—emerges clearly through the orchard imagery and the seed's revelatory function. "Mirrors lie...They show surfaces polished for survival, not souls stripped raw" states the theme somewhat directly but is earned by prior visions. The final image of walking back "toward the world that had forgotten how to confess" with "warlike serenity" offers resonance, though "not to hide. Not to fight. But to unbend others" edges toward mission-statement summary rather than image-driven implication.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and sustained: archaic-lyric register ("cloak woven from thorn-vines and silence," "eyes unreadable as obsidian mirrors") remains consistent throughout without register drift. Perceptual signature is strong—she notices confessions, frozen truths, armored hearts—rooted in her role as finder. However, peak emotional beats rely on elevated abstractions ("final circle reached her heart, and the last lock fell open") rather than compression or rhythm shift that reflects crisis. Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout ("fortress of moss and marrow," "hymns of warriors who'd laid down arms") with occasional mixed vehicles ("ribs crack—not with pain, but release" alongside "final lock fell open" mixing bone and mechanism). Several paraphrase loops: "not destruction...unbending," "not the unbending of iron...but of willow" restate the same concept across adjacent lines. Template cadence appears in the catalog of visions ("She saw the child...She saw the lover...She saw the enemy"). Rhythm remains uniform rather than modulating with pressure. No causality breaks, but artifacts dull momentum in middle beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The seed-as-catalyst-for-self-revelation and the frozen-confession motif offer archetypal resonance but not fresh synthesis; the emotional arc follows a familiar descent-and-transformation template common in fantasy introspection pieces. "Warlike serenity" and "unbending through expanding circles" provide specific idiom, and the orchard-vortex-as-curse image is vivid, but the journey from guarded to revealed follows predictable stations (kneel, roots spread, visions arrive, release, ascend). The protagonist's method of finding lost things in others could have been tested or subverted in her own crisis for a sharper turn.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The guarded druid is present and her findership role frames the premise, but her guardedness manifests as static description ("guarded heart a fortress") rather than choice under pressure. She walks, kneels, and breathes—observation-dominant actions. The transformation happens to her via the seed's agency; she does not decide to unbend or wrestle with resistance in a dramatized beat. Late first paragraph introduction; middle development is passive reception of visions; closure participation is being transformed rather than choosing transformation. Two-gate presence (setup, payoff) caps eligibility ~6.0, but passivity and ornamental guardedness lower the score. Swappable trait: "cautious" or "armored" scholar would function similarly.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The flesh-eating plant seed appears early ("pouch at her belt, where the flesh-eating plant seed pulsed"), is handled at the vortex's eye when "she felt the seed awaken," and drives the middle transformation sequence as roots map her scars and spread in circles. It returns in the final image as "crown of thorns and petals fused to her brow, its hunger sated—not by flesh, but by truth," reweighting its initial threat. Three beats: belt/anticipation, activation/rooting, crown/sated. Causal pressure: it enables the unbending. Closure linkage: becomes the crown. Specificity: "hunger sated by truth" distinguishes it from generic catalyst. Small friction: the mechanics of how kneeling triggers sprouting lack clarity.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Frozen confession structures the setting (faces in ice, "confessions froze mid-breath, suspended like fruit") and supplies the thematic image. The vortex contains frozen confessions that "began to thaw" at closure, and the druid's mission becomes "to unbend others, one frozen confession at a time." However, the concept does not constrain her choices—she does not have to thaw a specific confession or pay a price to access them; they are backdrop and metaphor rather than tactical obstacle. Setup clear; middle is observational; closure reprises the image. Two-gate lyric use eligible ~6.0; thematic weight and closure callback push higher, but lack of choice-constraint limits the score.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Finds lost things—not trinkets or runaway pets, but truths buried beneath lies" is established early as character label and frames her presence at the lake. However, the trait does not enable a specific on-page action with cost or tradeoff: she does not search, deduce, or navigate using findership skills. The visions arrive via the seed's expanding circles, not her agency. The trait colors motivation but remains ornamental. Setup present; no middle development where finding constrains tactics; closure mission restates the trait without cost. Two gates weakly met; swappable with "seeker" or "revealer." Late-element and label-only deductions apply.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Unbend" is signaled early ("Its purpose was not destruction. It was unbending"), structures the middle transformation ("unbending of iron...unbending...of willow"), and becomes the closure mission ("to unbend others"). The action is metaphorical rather than physical, which reduces its constraint on tactics, but it defines the transformation's nature and the protagonist's renewed purpose. Three beats: concept introduction, self-application, outward mission. Causal role: the unbending reframes her guardedness. Closure linkage strong. Specificity moderate: the willow/iron contrast sharpens it, but "heal" or "reveal" could substitute with minor edits. No direct cost tied to unbending itself—cost is tied to the seed's process.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Through expanding circles" is introduced as the seed's method in the middle section ("It would bloom outward...each petal a question, each root a reckoning, until the center...had nowhere left to hide") and governs the transformation sequence: circles spread from wrist to arm to chest to heart. The method shapes the pacing and imagery of the unbending. However, it does not present a tactical obstacle—she does not resist the circles or pay escalating cost per ring. Setup at midpoint; middle development structures the sequence; closure references "expanding circles, one frozen confession at a time." Two gates plus lyric callback; method matters for pacing but not for choice. Swappable with "layer by layer" or "inward spiral."</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The swirling orchard vortex at the heart of the cursed lake is present from the opening, supplies vivid imagery throughout (inverted branches, frozen blossoms, ice with faces, petals like shards), and transforms at closure when "orchard bloomed upward, roots becoming branches" and "lake drained into sky." The setting constrains movement (she walks on the surface, reaches the eye, kneels) and charges the final collapse into "a single point of light" she catches. Three beats: approach, center engagement, transformation. Causal pressure: she must reach the eye to activate the seed. Closure linkage strong. Specificity high: the vortex's dual nature (orchard and whirlpool) is irreplaceable. Small friction: spatial logic (walking on churning water-orchard) remains abstract.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"After the magic trick fails" frames the inciting event and explains her presence, but time as a constraint does not shape on-page decisions. The narrative unfolds in a single continuous sequence without urgency, deadline, or temporal cost. The vortex is described as "time bent but did not break," which thematizes time but does not make it press her choices. Setup clear (post-failure arrival); no middle clock that alters tactics; closure does not reference time. One gate (setup); replaceable with "after the conjurer vanished" or "following the summoning." The timeframe orients but does not tighten.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"To discover what mirrors don't show" is thematized throughout: "Mirrors lie...They show surfaces polished for survival, not souls stripped raw" and the visions reveal hidden truths (child screaming into obedient mirror, lover's trembling hands unseen, enemy's relief at death). However, the motivation is told more than dramatized in choice friction. She does not hesitate, weigh cost, or struggle against the revelation—she kneels, submits, and transforms. The want is consistent but not conflicted on the page with a competing desire. Setup in opening reflection; middle supplies visions tied to the theme; closure restates discovery as mission. Two gates; thematic charge strong; lack of on-page friction (want vs. fear dramatized in choice) limits score.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Warlike serenity" appears late ("warlike in their serenity, hymns of warriors who'd laid down arms") and is restated at closure ("Warlike serenity settled in her bones—not the absence of battle, but the presence of peace forged in its aftermath"). The tone is sustained in the controlled, formal diction and the paradox of violent transformation without screaming. However, the tone does not modulate with escalating pressure—the register remains elevated and measured throughout kneeling, rooting, cracking ribs, and ascent. Setup delayed to second half; development implicit in voice steadiness; closure restates and defines. Two gates; tone charges final image; static application and late signal prevent higher score.</comment>
