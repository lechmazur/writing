<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elias is credibly rendered through concrete habits (pressure gradients, wind vectors, courtyard bench routine) and micro-choices under pressure (checking the cache, selecting tools). Internal contradiction surfaces briefly when solitude shifts to movement, though the trait "credibly curious" remains label-only rather than embodied through contradictory impulses. The closing reflection "solitude had nurtured his integrity; now, movement would weaponize it" reads thematic rather than a dramatized choice with visible cost. No head-hopping or knowledge leaps; interiority is clean and character-particular.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: Situational (Elias faces mounting pressure that crystallizes his stance). Orientation anchors are present early: courtyard, dusk, Elias home from work. The closure qualifies as Charged Poise—he steps into the rail yard with tools and covenant, options reweighted, cost felt in the forfeiture of official channels and the embrace of lateral investigation. One meaningful tightening: the message tube narrows options from passive observation to active, unsanctioned inquiry. Cost is legible ("letting his meticulous nature become his camouflage," abandoning Bureau safety). No causality breaks; the sequence of discovery → decision → movement holds under the situational lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The courtyard is vividly anchored (wisteria arbor, stone bench, ivy, jasmine, loose brick cache) and constrains Elias's choice: the hidden cache enables his departure, the courtyard's tranquility steadies him before the decision. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (damp earth, jasmine, barometric drift). The rail yard gate in the final beat charges the ending image. Spatial choreography is clean throughout; the environment subtly mirrors internal states (quiet dusk versus "unseen tension"). Minor: occupational tools (monocular, barometer) appear but function primarily as props rather than constraining tactics at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: whether Elias will investigate the quarantine breach and forfeit Bureau safety. The message tube tightens pressure by naming Sector 7-C and "rewriting the maps," forcing a binary: report or investigate laterally. One meaningful deepening when he decides "I would not report this" and shifts to tracing witnesses—options narrow and tactics change. Agency is clear (decision to move east, gather tools, follow pigeon path backward). Visible cost: forfeiture of official channels, acceptance of surveillance risk, solitude weaponized. Coincidence complicates (unsummoned pigeon) but does not resolve; the protagonist's stance crystallization drives closure under the situational lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme—truth under erasure, integrity versus institutional compromise—emerges through Elias's storm-recording vocation, the Bureau's lies, and his choice to restore balance via lateral investigation. The carrier tube and field journal recur with reweighted meaning (data as honesty, pigeon as covenant). The final image ("stepped forward into the quiet dark") offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Minor deduction: "He'd always nurtured integrity in solitude—believing truth was best preserved away from committees and compromises" edges toward direct statement rather than fully emerging from scene pressure. The closing line "Not with rage, but with records" flirts with thematic echo but remains grounded in character action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and tight to Elias's perceptual signature: meteorological detail (pressure gradients, barometric drift), occupational idiom, selective attention (wind direction, moss on trousers). Distance is controlled; no head-hopping or unmotivated register shifts. Diction remains character-particular ("credibly curious," "rogue quarantine zone," "erasure, a rewriting of reality's edges"). Rhythm modulates purposefully: longer reflective passages in the courtyard, shorter clipped sentences at the rail yard gate. Minor: "credibly curious rather than paranoid" and "progressing laterally" feel slightly elevated for interior thought under stress, though they remain within Elias's lexicon as a Bureau analyst. No dialogue present to judge.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies; information density is high (each line advances character, world, or pressure). Opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes cleanly. Minor loop detected: "He'd move quietly, laterally" echoes "by progressing laterally" within three paragraphs, and "He didn't hurry. Rushing invited mistakes" restates the same caution without added pressure (−0.2 paraphrase-loop deduction). A few filter-verb stacks appear ("He intuited," "He remembered," "He smiled faintly") but do not cluster in high-pressure beats. "Credibly curious" and "progressing laterally" read slightly template-y as key descriptors. No metaphor muddle or scaffold; clarity and propulsion are strong. Paragraph structure varies purposefully.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of atmospheric anomaly recorder + rogue quarantine zone + pigeon-based investigation is specific and non-obvious. Elias's occupational detail (Meteorological Integrity Bureau, pressure gradients) grounds the premise. The choice to investigate laterally rather than report transforms a familiar whistleblower frame. Minor: the core conflict (institutional cover-up, lone truth-seeker, vanished witnesses) follows a recognizable template; transformation comes through meteorological specificity and the pigeon covenant, but the emotional arc (solitude → movement, integrity → action) is not entirely fresh. "Layered tranquility" and "letting his meticulous nature become his camouflage" offer memorable phrases. Risk-taking is moderate; no bold structural gambles, though the situational lens and Charged Poise ending fit the material well.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elias (meticulous storm recorder) is present throughout and his occupational habits constrain his approach: he sketches courtyard layout, notes wind direction, cross-references data, gathers instruments. His meticulous nature shapes tactics ("letting his meticulous nature become his camouflage"). The decision to investigate rather than report is the key turn. Touches three gates: setup (opens in his POV), development (decision beat mid-story), closure (steps into rail yard with tools and plan). Cost is legible: forfeiture of Bureau safety. Strong beat involvement and causal pressure; the trait is integral to tactics and closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The carrier pigeon's message tube appears in beat two (discovery in ivy), reappears in Elias's satchel and pocket multiple times, and charges the final paragraph ("nestled beside his instruments, was more than metal and paper—it was a covenant"). Functionally used: he unscrews it, reads the message, tucks it into his coat, later into his satchel, and it warms in his pocket. The tube reweights from warning to invitation/covenant. Touches all three gates strongly. High closure linkage and specificity. Minor: the tube itself (brass, tarnished, Bureau insignia) does not constrain a choice through its unique properties beyond delivering the message; it is the message content that narrows options.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The rogue quarantine zone is named in the message ("Quarantine breached. Sector 7-C") and motivates Elias's decision to investigate. It shapes stakes: the zone is an erasure, the Bureau's models are lies, and Elias's storm data integrity is compromised. Present in setup (bulletin memory), development (message discovery), and closure (investigation target). The concept alters tactics (lateral investigation, avoiding grids). Cost: forfeiture of official safety. Functional across beats but slightly abstract; the zone's mechanics (invisible borders, vanished citizens) are recalled rather than dramatized. Causal pressure is moderate: the concept justifies the investigation but does not constrain on-page choices through unique properties.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Credibly curious" appears twice as a label: once in paragraph three ("credibly curious rather than paranoid") and echoed thematically in paragraph twenty-one ("counted on his credibly curious nature"). The trait does not constrain or enable a specific on-page action with visible cost; Elias's investigative choice stems from his integrity and professional habits, not from curiosity per se. The attribute is told rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses or a trade-off. Present in setup and mentioned at closure but ornamental. Swappable with "cautious" or "methodical" without structural impact. Late full articulation and label-only use lower the score.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Intuit" appears once explicitly ("He intuited that the pigeon hadn't been sent by accident") and is echoed in the closing sequence ("intuiting each turn, each pause, each breath"). The action describes Elias's inference method but does not drive a major turn; the discovery of the tube and the decision to investigate are the key beats, and both could proceed without explicit intuition. The trait colors his approach (trust in instincts, lateral thinking) but is not causally indispensable. Present in development and closure mention but functional role is limited. Swappable with "deduce" or "conclude" without breaking structure. Mid-band functional use without strong causal necessity.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"By progressing laterally" is signaled mid-story ("progressing laterally: tracing unofficial threads, forgotten archives, silenced witnesses") and becomes his tactical method. It shapes his plan: avoid main roads, move between surveillance cracks, interview handlers, cross-reference logs. The method is echoed at closure ("By progressing laterally, he slipped between the cracks") and charged as camouflage. Touches development and closure; the mechanics (unofficial threads, grounded handlers, rail yard) alter tactics. Cost: slower, riskier path than official reporting. Functional across beats with moderate causal pressure. The concept is somewhat abstract; the on-page demonstration is limited to one walk east. Swappability is moderate; "investigate covertly" would serve similarly.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The quiet courtyard at dusk anchors the entire first half: wisteria arbor, stone bench, ivy (where tube is found), loose brick cache (supplies tools), jasmine scent (steadies him). The setting enables discovery (tube in ivy) and decision (cache provides means). Dusk time pressure is light but present. The courtyard's tranquility contrasts with "unseen tension" and charges Elias's shift from passive observer to active investigator. Touches all three gates strongly: setup (location anchor), development (discovery and cache), closure (departure from courtyard into rail yard). Spatial choreography is clean. The micro-setting (bench, arbor, brick) constrains choices and charges the before/after image. High integration.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"After being followed home" is the inciting circumstance (paragraph one: "sensation of being followed home"). The timeframe sets initial tension but does not tighten decisions or tactics beyond the opening beat. Once Elias discovers the tube, the "followed" pressure dissipates; no pursuer materializes, and the rest of the story unfolds without time constraint. The element is present in setup but absent from development and closure. No visible clock or escalating urgency tied to being followed. The timeframe does not alter later moves or cost. Functional but replaceable; the story's pressure stems from the message content, not the pursuit. Swappable with "after a long day" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"To nurture integrity in solitude" is articulated mid-story ("He'd always nurtured integrity in solitude—believing truth was best preserved away from committees and compromises") and reweighted at closure ("Solitude had nurtured his integrity; now, movement would weaponize it"). The motivation drives the key decision: refuse to report, investigate laterally, preserve truth outside official channels. Friction surfaces when solitude (preferred mode) must yield to movement and risk. Touches setup (implicit in his habits), development (articulated during decision), and closure (reweighted). Cost: forfeiture of isolation, acceptance of surveillance. The motivation is more told than dramatized through contradictory on-page impulses. Moderate causal pressure and closure linkage; the phrasing is slightly abstract and label-like.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Layered tranquility" is named once in paragraph fifteen ("letting the layered tranquility of the courtyard steady him") and evoked throughout: rustling leaves, wind bell, jasmine, damp earth, violet dusk. The tone steadies Elias before the decision and contrasts with "unseen tension" and "quiet dark" at closure. Coherent through turns; the tranquility does not flatten under pressure but modulates (courtyard calm → rail yard shadows). The tone charges the final image ("stepped forward into the quiet dark") by reconfiguring calm as resolve rather than passivity. Touches setup (courtyard atmosphere), development (steadying moment), and closure (quiet dark). The tone supports stakes but does not directly constrain choice. Purposeful and consistent; minor: the label "layered tranquility" itself appears only once and is slightly ornamental.</comment>
