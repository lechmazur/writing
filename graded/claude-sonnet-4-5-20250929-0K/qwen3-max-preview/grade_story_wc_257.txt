<comment>The maker's interiority is vivid and concrete ("grief had scraped her soul to marrow"), and her method—folding origami with coordinates—embodies her motivation with specificity. However, she remains largely alone throughout, with no on-page conflict that tests her resolve or forces a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. The ending action (placing the locket in a crane, leaving it) reads as continuation rather than transformation; no prior impulse is renounced or altered. Backstory and reflection dominate without micro-choices that tilt present stance, flattening pressure.</comment>

<comment>Orientation is delayed: who she is and what she does emerge gradually, and the "timeless observatory" remains abstract (no spatial anchors by ~120 words). The piece operates in Accumulative mode—density and resonance rather than causal linkage—but the closure lacks a decisive reweighting or visible cost; she performs her ritual as she has before, someone unfolds a crane offstage, and she continues. No on-page alteration of options or knowledge occurs. The final act (burnishing coordinates, leaving the locket) mirrors prior actions without a cadence shift or deepening that charges the ending with felt consequence.</comment>

<comment>The observatory is evocative ("curtains of intention," dust-sheeted mirrors) but remains a backdrop; no on-page choice is constrained by the space, and the protagonist works alone at a bench with tools that do not alter tactics. The locket, stencil, and origami appear across beats, but their handling is ceremonial rather than pressured. Sensory detail is selective and poetic, yet the setting does not impose friction or resource limits that shape the final image.</comment>

<comment>The dominant stake—offering solace to strangers through coordinates and origami—is signaled early, but no escalation or tightening occurs. She traces the locket, draws the stencil, folds the crane, and leaves it; each step is meditative repetition without a reversal, cost, or choice that narrows options. The offstage discovery ("someone had unfolded one of her offerings") does not alter her course. No agency-driven decision forecloses a path or demonstrates a trade-off with legible consequence.</comment>

<comment>Theme—grief rerouted into meaning-making, the genuinely artificial as sacred—emerges organically from image and action without stated moral. The tension between "raw truth is too jagged to hold" and the care she invests in constructed vessels carries conceptual weight. The final image (locket inside crane, left on library steps) invites reflection on the nature of offering and transformation. However, the thematic resonance is somewhat announced ("authenticity need not stem from nature") rather than purely embodied, and the ending does not reweight prior material with undeniable pressure; it restates the established ritual.</comment>

<comment>Voice is consistent, lyric, and controlled: "grief, properly tended, might sprout unexpected petals" and "curtains of intention" reflect a poetic register that fits the protagonist's craft and solitude. Diction remains stable under emotional pressure, and the perceptual signature (noticing coordinates, ephemera, resonance) is character-specific. However, some phrasing leans toward abstraction ("the magnetism of unfinished stories," "the gravity of grief") that softens immediacy, and the absence of dialogue or a second character limits the test of voice distinction.</comment>

<grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is rhythmically varied and imagistic, with strong verbs ("burnishing," "wept," "cradle") and concrete nouns (vellum, brass, origami). Several passages approach paraphrase loops: "She believed sorrow could be rerouted, not erased; that grief, properly tended, might sprout unexpected petals" closely echoes "to teach withering to bloom again," and the curtain mechanics are explained twice in adjacent paragraphs. Filter verbs ("she felt," "she called") stack in reflective beats, dulling immediacy. No single artifact obscures closure, but the cumulative effect reduces density and propulsion in the middle third.</comment>

<comment>The synthesis of mourning jewelry, origami coordinates, and a timeless observatory offers a specific, non-obvious frame. The "genuinely artificial as sacred" concept transforms the familiar trope of grief-work into something tactile and particular. However, the emotional arc—solitary maker performing a ritual of offering—follows a contemplative template without a turn or risk that tests the premise. The ending reprises the opening gesture without transformation, and the protagonist's safety from complication or error limits the boldness of execution.</comment>
