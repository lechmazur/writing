<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The priest is characterized through vivid sensory particulars (cassock from audio tape, indigo palette) and his interiority shows sophisticated philosophical awareness. However, the protagonist remains more conceptual vessel than embodied individual—his micro-choices feel predetermined by the allegorical design rather than motivated by contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final renunciation (painting the question mark, dispersing the possession) reads as intellectually inevitable rather than emotionally costly, and the body under stress remains abstract despite the ornate framing.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches its pattern early (rhetorical excavation as defense) and maintains coherent symbolic pressure through layered questions and the indigo palette. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing when the priest realizes the possession "wasn't invading—it was answering," then disperses it into the question itself. The cost is conceptual (the possessed entity unraveled into stillness) and legible in the final image, though the emotional or relational price remains oblique. Orientation is secure by the second paragraph.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The dimensional anchor is vividly rendered through purposeful sensory choices (static and incense, heat-mirage walls, velvet moss silence) that create a coherent otherworldly atmosphere. The indigo palette functions as micro-setting, appearing in three beats and charging the climax when its drop creates the "unasked" glyph. However, the environment largely serves as backdrop; spatial properties (vortex, frayed time) are described but don't materially constrain the priest's rhetorical moves or alter his tactical options during peak pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—prevent possession by illuminating hidden assumptions—is signaled early and escalates through three distinct rhetorical gambits that deepen understanding. The priest's agency drives the tightening (each question warps geometry, confuses the entity, ultimately disperses it), and the conceptual cost is legible when the possession "unravels...into the very stillness it had sought to dominate." Under the Accumulative lens, the pattern of charged questions constitutes meaningful escalation. However, the victory feels intellectually foreordained rather than hard-won with visible tradeoffs; no live option is foreclosed with felt personal sacrifice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the priest's rhetorical method: unexamined assumptions shelter dangerous certainties, and questions themselves can be weapons or doorways. The realization that "the possession wasn't invading—it was answering" reweights all prior interrogation without stating a moral. The indigo palette and silence-as-architecture motifs recur with shifting valence, and the final image (possession dispersed into the question itself) offers a resonant, non-literal answer. Avoids didacticism; the conceptual cost—that certainty-hunger can be one's own trap—lands through implication.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains a consistent elevated register with vivid figurative language ("gravity whispered," "silence clung like velvet moss," "scalpel wrapped in velvet"). POV distance is stable third-limited. However, the diction often drifts into ornamental abstraction that obscures immediate perception—"sylloquisms," "labyrinths of implication," "substrate"—creating register mismatch with embodied crisis. Dialogue (the priest's questions) serves the allegorical design but lacks natural speech rhythm. Under peak pressure, the prose remains uniformly elevated rather than compressing or sharpening, which flattens urgency.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Figurative density is high and mostly coherent (audio-tape cassock, indigo as "Assumption's Veil," silence as architecture), but several metaphors strain clarity: "decorates with silence...each pause a column" and "time frayed into filaments of might-have-been" read as ornamental rather than propulsive. Template cadence appears in the question sequences ("If silence is...If stillness..."). Paraphrase loop: the priest's mission is stated twice in adjacent paragraphs ("not exorcism, but illumination" / "to reveal hidden assumptions"). The final third maintains the same elevated register without tightening, reducing momentum. Apply −0.6 for density and loop issues; −0.3 for template stems in peak beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of priest-as-philosopher, possession-as-conceptual-hunger, and rhetoric-as-exorcism offers a fresh angle on possession narratives. The indigo palette and silence-as-weapon are specific, vivid choices. However, the allegorical frame constrains emotional risk—every element serves the central conceit so neatly that the outcome feels intellectually predetermined. The final turn (possession unraveling into the question) is clever but lacks the lived particularity or moral ambiguity that would make it feel inevitable rather than constructed. The piece commits fully to its premise but doesn't transform familiar philosophical territory into urgent human stakes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The loop pedal priest is present throughout and his rhetorical questions drive three distinct beats (warping geometry, faltering possession, dispersing entity). His final decision—painting the question mark—directly causes closure. However, "loop pedal" remains decorative; the cassock "stitched from frayed audio tape" is mentioned once without mechanical consequence. The priest's choices feel more like executing a philosophical argument than navigating contradictory impulses under pressure. Scores mid-6s for sustained presence and causal involvement, but the unique "loop pedal" trait doesn't materially constrain tactics.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The palette appears in four beats: introduced on his lap, pulsing with the possession's heartbeat, weeping a drop that creates the glyph, and finally empty at closure. The indigo color ("Assumption's Veil") has thematic resonance and the dropped pigment enables the climactic trap. However, until the final third, the palette is "unused yet radiating latent meaning"—described rather than handled. The act of painting the question mark is causal and charges closure, but the object's passivity through the middle reduces its irreplaceability; a different symbolic tool could serve similar functions with modest edits.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Unraveled stillness" is named in the opening and shapes the conceptual stakes (the possession seeks to dominate stillness). The priest "decorates with silence" as architecture, and the climax disperses the entity "into the very stillness it had sought to dominate." The concept appears in the title action ("plumb the hollows beneath this unraveled stillness") and structures the priest's defensive method. However, it functions primarily as thematic frame rather than tactical constraint—the priest's rhetorical moves don't visibly adapt to properties of stillness. Present across beats and reflected in closure, but doesn't alter on-page options as concretely as required for higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Decorates with silence" is described in the fifth paragraph: "each pause a column, each withheld breath a vaulted ceiling." The metaphor is vivid and thematically apt, positioning silence as the priest's medium. However, the trait is asserted rather than dramatized—we don't see him choose to withhold speech at a cost or enable a tactic through strategic pause. The concept echoes in the final painted "question mark...in negation, in anti-sound," but this is payoff for the palette, not for silence-as-decoration. Present with thematic resonance but lacking visible tradeoff or beat-level constraint.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Plumb" appears in the title action ("plumb the hollows beneath this unraveled stillness") and again when the priest uses questions to excavate: "not with tools, but through rhetorical devices: questions that spiral, metaphors that collapse, paradoxes that bloom like wounds." The method of probing/excavating drives the interrogation beats and the priest describes his questions as "plumb lines dropped into the dark" in the final paragraph. However, the literal action of plumbing (sounding depth, measuring) is used metaphorically throughout; no specific plumbing tool or technique constrains tactics. The concept shapes the overall method but is swappable with "probe," "excavate," or "interrogate" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Rhetorical devices" are named explicitly in paragraph three and demonstrated across three beats: questions that warp geometry, paradoxes that trap the possession in definitional loops, and the final painted question mark as "grammar of silence." The method is signaled early, taught through examples (syllogisms, ownership paradox, motion vs. exhaustion), and directly causes the climax when the possession is "pulled...into the question itself." The mechanics matter—each rhetorical move has distinct effect. However, the devices remain somewhat interchangeable (any philosophical trap might work); stronger specificity about how *this* device uniquely constrains would push higher.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dimensional anchor is introduced in the opening line and described across multiple beats: "chamber suspended between folds of fractured time," walls that shimmer, a "center vortex where time frayed into filaments." The setting provides atmosphere and the vortex is the spatial target of the priest's final move. However, the anchor's dimensional properties don't materially constrain the priest's tactics—he could deliver the same rhetorical interrogations in a conventional chapel. The "chamber shuddered" reaction shows environmental response but not pressure that alters options. Present throughout and thematically apt, but postcard function outweighs tactical necessity.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Before the possession completes" is stated in the title line and closing line ("Before the next possession stirs"), framing urgency. The possession's progress is tracked: "slow possession creeping," "possession faltered," "unraveled." However, the timeframe never tightens tactics on the page—no moment where the priest must choose faster or differently because time is running out. The priest works methodically through his rhetorical sequence without visible acceleration. The temporal frame is present as setup and bookend but doesn't function as live clock pressure during escalation. Caps at mid-4s for stated presence without beat-level constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The motivation "to illuminate hidden assumptions" is stated explicitly ("His mission was not exorcism, but illumination—to reveal hidden assumptions by dismantling the language that shelters them") and demonstrated through the priest's rhetorical questions that expose the possession's dependence on "unchallenged axioms." The priest pursues this goal consistently across three beats and achieves it at closure when the entity is trapped in definitional paradox. However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized as conflicted desire—no moment where the priest is tempted to shortcut illumination for faster exorcism, or where the cost of prolonged interrogation tests his commitment. Functional and causal but lacks friction between want and fear.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Muffled clarity" is enacted through the prose: dense figurative language that requires parsing ("silence clung like velvet moss," "thresholds waiting to be misread") paired with precise conceptual articulation. The priest's realization—"muffled clarity settling over him like a second skin"—names the tone explicitly at the turn. The tone is coherent throughout and the "deeper, richer" silence at closure modulates the initial oppressive atmosphere into cathedral resonance. However, the uniform elevation doesn't shift under peak pressure; the same ornate register persists whether describing setup or climax. Tone charges the final image but lacks dynamic modulation across escalation.</comment>
