<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The copyist's motivation is established early and her actions are consistent—transcribing, weeping, transmitting—but her internal experience remains largely decorative rather than conflicted. The tears-as-catalyst moment ("Her tears, she realized, were the final catalyst") reads as sudden realization rather than earned through prior contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Embodied emotion is present (ink-stained fingers, heart thudding) but the character's struggle never fractures into genuine internal conflict; she moves smoothly from passive receiver to active broadcaster without visible cost or renunciation of a competing path. The final choice to transmit her own broadcast feels inevitable from her established traits rather than a decision that forecloses another live option.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors appear late: who she is (copyist) and her motivation emerge gradually across the first third rather than by ~120 words, though the alcove setting is clear early. The piece operates in Accumulative/Textural mode—density increases through the pirate broadcasts, dust-memories coalesce, and the final transmission reweights her role from scribe to broadcaster—but the closure effect, while present, carries minimal felt cost on the page; she "waited, thistled calm" without dramatizing what she risks or forecloses by transmitting. The final image gestures toward reciprocity ("another alcove would warm") but does not make the personal or social price undeniable. Causality is loose: the radio becomes transmitter without prior setup of that capability, and the tears-as-code feels convenient rather than earned through prior constraint.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The ember alcove is vivid and purposeful: embers flare in response to her tears, mist thickens at the threshold, and the shortwave dial's warmth guides her tuning. The setting constrains her ritual (tuning only after midnight when mist thickens) and charges the closure image (another alcove warming). Sensory detail is selective and filtered through her copyist's attention (staves, vellum, moth-wing thread). Spatial choreography is clear throughout, and the alcove functions as both literal workspace and metaphorical incubator for resurrection, satisfying the micro-setting standard for this length.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—teaching dust to tell stories—is signaled early and remains coherent, but escalation under the Accumulative lens is minimal: she transcribes broadcasts, then realizes tears activate transmission, then transmits her own score. The pirate signal burning "hotter than ever" and singing about her is the lone tightening, but it feels externally granted rather than protagonist-driven. The final transmission is an expansion, not a narrowing of options; she gains capability without visible trade-off. No live option is foreclosed, and the cost (waiting, calm) is abstract rather than a dramatized loss of stamina, safety, or prior path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the mechanics of dust-memory and pirate signals as carrier pigeons across the famine's void; the piece resists moralizing and sustains the central question of how forgotten things remember. The final image ("another alcove would warm") offers a resonant, non-literal answer rooted in reciprocity and transmission rather than solitary archiving. The tears-as-activation code and the singing-about-her moment flirt with symbolic convenience, but the piece earns thematic depth through the specificity of ember-light, moth-wing thread, and the dotted-rhyme lyric. No thematic echo or diagnosis mars the closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV distance is stable third-close; the copyist's perceptual signature (note-by-note precision, dust-motes, phantom flour) is consistent and voice-motivated. The prose carries a lyric, incantatory texture through balanced syntax and selective compression ("thistled calm settling in her bones like mist after rain"). However, the piece withholds the radio-as-transmitter fact until late for suspense rather than integrating it into her knowledge, creating a mild filter violation. The lyrics embedded in the broadcasts ("The moon wears boots of river clay") are vivid and distinct, but no second character speaks on the page, so voice distinction is not tested. Minor diction elevation ("phosphorescence," "coalesced") fits the archival tone without breaking character lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully, and figurative density is high but controlled: "mist curling at the threshold like a sigh," "moth-wing thread," "thistled calm." However, the piece carries paraphrase loops ("not just melody, but meaning" / "not just play; they summoned") and template cadence in the lyric-listing sequences ("a child's lullaby lost in war, a sailor's last toast..."). The opening paragraph front-loads four metaphors in rapid succession without pattern-teaching, and the final broadcast lyric ("The copyist weeps in measured time / and wakes the dust with dotted rhyme") reads as thematic echo rather than embodied pressure. Information density is high, but scaffold phrases ("She understood then," "She realized") summarize rather than dramatize key turns. No loops touch the closure beat directly, capping deduction at −0.8 under the non-closure accumulation rule.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The premise—pirate broadcasts as carrier pigeons for dust-memory resurrection—is fresh and conceptually coherent, and the shortwave-radio-as-transmitter twist transforms her from passive scribe to network node. However, the core frame (artist preserving stories during cultural apocalypse, discovery of secret transmission network) follows familiar template beats: isolated archivist, mysterious signal, realization of her role, joining the network. The piece personalizes through the alcove's ember-light, moth-wing stitching, and the tears-as-code mechanic, but the emotional arc (diligent → enlightened → active) remains predictable. The final transmission feels additive rather than a synthesis that reweights prior material in hindsight. Derivative premise adjustment −0.6 for the archivist-network template, partially offset by the dust-resurrection specificity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The diligent orchestra copyist is present throughout and her transcription work frames every beat, but her choices are largely reactive: she transcribes what the broadcasts offer, realizes tears activate transmission, then transmits. The final decision to compose and broadcast her own score is the lone agency moment, appearing late (final sixth) and feeling like an expansion rather than a turn that narrows prior options. Her occupation constrains her method (notation, staves, orchestral scores) and is seeded early, satisfying setup and development gates. However, the closure choice is not causally foregrounded—she could have remained a receiver—and no prior path is visibly foreclosed. Score ~5.8: shapes the middle via transcription work and occupational lens, but closure participation is additive rather than indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The shortwave radio dial glow appears in paragraph 7, is used to guide tuning (heat pulse when broadcasts near), burns hot to signal the critical transmission, and is cloaked again at the end as beacon for others. It constrains her ritual (tuning only when the glow pulses) and charges the final image ("set the dial to pulse its secret glow as beacon"). Present in three distinct beats (guidance, revelation, transmission) and participates in closure by becoming transmitter rather than mere receiver. The glow's secretly luminous attribute (warmth for fingertips, not eyes) is integrated and irreplaceable. Score ~7.6: essential across beats and ending, with causal pressure and closure linkage, but not indispensable—another object could serve as beacon with edits.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Pirate broadcast is seeded early (paragraph 9), drives the middle revelation (singing about her), and the final transmission joins the network of "scattered, silent scribes." It shapes her tactics (listening only after midnight, transcribing elusive lyrics) and reweights her role from receiver to transmitter. However, the mechanics are told rather than dramatized: "the pirate broadcasts weren't random... sent by others like her" is summary. The concept is present in closure (she becomes a broadcaster) but the reciprocal network effect is implied rather than shown with visible cost. Score ~6.9: shapes two beats and contributes to ending, but summary-only middle weakens causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Secretly luminous is introduced in paragraph 7 ("its phosphorescence hidden beneath a cloth") and specified as heat-not-light ("not meant for eyes, but for fingertips"). It enables her covert tuning ritual and intensifies at the critical broadcast. The attribute constrains her method (she must cloak it, calibrate warmth) and is unique to this radio, but does not create a visible trade-off or cost—secrecy is aesthetic rather than tactical. Present in setup, development (guides tuning), and closure (becomes beacon), but the "secretly" aspect does not alter a choice under pressure. Score ~6.4: shapes beats and ending, but lacks the cost or irreplaceability for higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Cloak as action appears in paragraph 10 (cloaking listening in routine), paragraph 7 (hidden beneath cloth), and the ending (cloaked transmission in birdcall frequencies). It recurs but remains ornamental: the cloaking does not prevent discovery, enable a tactic, or incur cost. The piece never dramatizes a threat that the cloaking protects against; "after the story famine" implies surveillance, but no on-page pressure tests the cloak. The final cloaking of transmission in birdcall is functional but swappable (encryption, frequency-hopping, etc.). Score ~5.2: recurs across beats but is replaceable and does not drive a turn.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elusive song lyrics appear in paragraph 15 ("phrases that slipped memory like minnows"), drive the transcription work, and are described as "carrier pigeons" that dissolve unless written down. The method shapes her middle tactics (scrambling for pen, mapping frequencies) and the final transmission uses the same lyric form. The elusiveness is functional—lyrics that persist would not require her copyist skill—and is seeded early enough (paragraph 15, ~40% mark). However, the mechanics are told ("dissolve upon repetition unless written down") rather than shown through a failed attempt. Score ~7.1: shapes two beats and closure, with causal pressure and irreplaceability, but summary-only mechanics prevent higher band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Ember alcove in mist is established in the opening line and recurs throughout: embers flare when she cries, mist thickens at midnight, and the final image anticipates "another alcove would warm." The setting constrains her ritual (tuning after embers sigh into charcoal) and charges the closure through the warming-alcove network image. Micro-setting qualifies: the alcove is both workspace and metaphorical incubator. However, the mist and embers do not alter a tactic or create a visible cost; they atmosphere rather than pressure. Score ~6.8: present across beats and in closure image, but setting enriches rather than constrains choice.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>After the story famine is mentioned in paragraph 3 ("the world had forgotten how to whisper tales") and implies a cultural collapse, but the timeframe does not tighten decisions or create urgency. No on-page clock or deadline forces her hand; she tunes "weekly," composes, and waits "thistled calm" without time pressure. The famine is backdrop rather than active constraint. Present in setup but absent from development and closure. Score ~4.8: functional context but replaceable and does not shape tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>To teach dust to tell stories is stated in paragraph 5 and recurs as thematic anchor: "dust remembering," "dust swirled into miniature theaters," "wakes the dust with dotted rhyme." The motivation shapes her transcription work and final transmission, but is never tested by a competing desire or cost. She wants to resurrect stories and does so without friction; no scene dramatizes a moment where teaching dust costs her safety, comfort, or another goal. The desire is told and reiterated rather than conflicted in choices. Score ~6.2: shapes beats and ending but lacks friction between wants and costs.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Thistled calm appears only in the final sentence ("thistled calm settling in her bones like mist after rain") and does not modulate with earlier pressure. The tone throughout is lyric, measured, and elegiac—consistent but static. "Thistled" (prickly, wary) contradicts the pervasive serenity and is not earned by prior on-page tension. The piece never establishes a threat or urgency that would justify wariness; she moves smoothly from transcription to revelation to transmission without tonal friction. Score ~5.9: late appearance, no development, and the "thistled" modifier is ornamental rather than charged by pressure.</comment>
