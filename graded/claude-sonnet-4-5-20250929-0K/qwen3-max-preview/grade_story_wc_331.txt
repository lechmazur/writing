<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The librarian's interior life is specific and embodied through sensory detail (chalk-dust tang, scarf texture), but her choices lack visible cost. The final act of singing to story-orbs feels unmotivated—no prior beat dramatizes why this action matters to her beyond abstract mission fulfillment. The grandmother's backstory anchors motive but the protagonist's present stakes (what she personally risks or loses) remain abstract. Embodiment is strong; causal pressure on her choices is thin.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (she reawakens stories, patrons feel warmer pages)—but the cost is conceptual only, not felt on the page. The seven-year search and the scarf's activation create setup, but the amphitheater sequence unfolds without resistance or trade-off. One meaningful deepening occurs (stepping through tessellation into the story-place), yet no visible price alters her tactics or forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The scientific poetry library is vividly particular (equations as sonnets, Non-Euclidean Lullabies shelf, hyperbolic tessellations), and the scarf as micro-setting object constrains the activation sequence. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (chalk-dust, silk ripple, story-core hum). The amphitheater's impossible geometry charges the closure image. The scarf's texture and the scroll's faint pulse under lamplight are tactile and purposeful.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (find the place where stories live) is signaled early. One tightening: stepping through the tessellation into the amphitheater. But no on-page opposition or cost—she succeeds without friction, the scarf works, the orbs respond. Agency is present (she chooses to step through, to sing) but consequences are satisfaction, not sacrifice. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure should deepen via pattern or cadence shift; here the final beat adds wonder but not weight.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme (analog memory as sanctuary, love sustaining narrative) emerges from concrete particulars: the scarf's frayed edges, the Data Collapse, the grandmother's equations. The ending offers a resonant image (warmer pages) rather than a stated moral. Subtext operates in the scarf's shiver and the patrons' blink. The recursive motif (stories dreaming, grandmother's claim about spacetime memories) charges the final act. Minor slip: "not obsolescence but sanctuary" edges toward thesis statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with strong perceptual signature (humming Poincaré, alphabetizing by emotional resonance). Diction is lyric-elevated and consistent ("shadow threading," "narrative topology," "hyperbolic suspension"). No dialogue to assess. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (tight on scarf texture, wide on amphitheater scale). Brief filter-verb stack in the middle passage ("She understood then") but voice remains distinct. No head-hopping; the experimental compression (unspooling amphitheater in one paragraph) is taught and legible.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is high. Two textural artifacts lower the score: decorative doublets ("not stored, not archived"; "not metaphorically, not sentimentally") and one paraphrase loop (scarf description recycled across two beats without new pressure). Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent; "memory: sudden, seamless, saturated" uses alliteration purposefully. Sentence openings vary. The final paragraph resets satisfaction too tidily ("utterly satisfied") after no visible cost. No major clarity breaks.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The synthesis (scientific poetry library + hyperbolic geometry as narrative topology + analog refuge post-digital collapse) is specific and non-obvious. The grandmother physicist who writes love letters in equations is fresh. Risk: the piece leans into lyric wonder without dramatizing friction. The orbs and amphitheater feel inevitable in hindsight given the setup. Minor proximity concern: "place where stories live" echoes meta-fictional templates, but the hyperbolic geometry anchor transforms it.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The odd-hour librarian is present throughout and makes two key choices: entering the Restricted Stacks and stepping through the tessellation. Her quirks (alphabetizing by emotional resonance) are demonstrated early. She drives the closure by singing to the orbs. However, her choices lack visible cost or trade-off—she acts without resistance. Setup strong, middle involvement clear, closure participation present but not indispensable (the story could function with a generic seeker). Causal pressure is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The tattered silk scarf is handled in multiple beats: tucked in pocket (setup), described with texture and history (early third), draped over scroll (activation), shivering and knitting symbols (middle turn), glowing and stitching her into the story-field (closure). It enables the activation axiom and charges the final image. The frayed-to-lavender detail recurs with meaning. Swappability test: the scarf's specific properties (grandmother's stitching, analog survival) matter. Strong closure linkage and beat involvement; cost connection is conceptual (heirloom as key) rather than felt loss.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Analog memories frame the premise (Data Collapse, ink vs. digital, scarf as sole survivor) and constrain the librarian's method (seeking physical locus, using silk artifact). The concept shapes the seven-year search and the choice to enter analog story-space. Closure shows analog memory reawakening stories. However, the concept is more thematic spine than tactical constraint—it doesn't force a difficult on-page choice with visible cost. Setup early, middle presence via scarf use, closure participation clear. Causal pressure moderate; irreplaceability high.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Sanely eccentric" is demonstrated (alphabetizing by emotional resonance, humming Poincaré) but these quirks don't constrain or enable a consequential choice. The trait colors voice and establishes character but remains ornamental—she could perform the same actions without this specific attribute. Setup present, middle beat involvement weak (logic "no one else bothered to trace" is told, not tested), closure unaffected. Label-only in key moments; no visible trade-off tied to this trait.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Reawaken" is the stated action in the climax ("she had come to reawaken them") and she enacts it by singing in Riemannian intervals, causing orbs to glow brighter and patrons' pages to feel warmer. Setup strong (seven-year search), closure direct. But the action itself is not dramatized with friction—she sings, they respond, done. Swappability moderate (could be "reconnect" or "restore" with minor edits). The action defines the ending but lacks cost or complication. Two-gate coverage (setup, payoff) with thin middle development.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Hyperbolic geometry is signaled early (grandmother's hem-stitching, brittle scroll with tessellations), used as the literal doorway (tracing equations, draping scarf, stepping through), and named in the activation axiom. It shapes the method of entry and the amphitheater's form (spiraling shelves, impossible vaults). However, the mechanics are summary rather than tactile—no problem-solving or failed attempt. Setup present, middle involvement moderate (scroll traced, axiom spoken), closure environment shaped by it. Causal pressure moderate; specificity high but cost absent.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The scientific poetry library is introduced immediately, detailed with specificity (equations as sonnets, Non-Euclidean Lullabies shelf), and the Restricted Stacks supply the scroll that enables the journey. The setting transitions to the amphitheater (story-cores, hyperbolic vaults) which houses the closure action. Patrons outside provide a framing pressure (sensing shift, dismissing it). The library's unique logic (narrative topology, analog sanctuary) is indispensable. Setup strong, middle beat (entering Restricted Stacks) clear, closure deeply tied to setting. Spatial choreography remains coherent across the fold.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"While patrons browse" frames the action but exerts no pressure. Patrons pause once ("sensing a shift") then dismiss it; no clock tightens her choices. The timeframe could be "during closing hour" or "at midnight" with no structural change. Present as atmospheric detail but replaceable. Setup weak (one clause), middle absent, closure unaffected (patrons blink afterward but their browsing doesn't constrain her). No causal work; ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The motivation to find the place where stories live drives the seven-year search, the scroll consultation, and the decision to step through. It is declared early and fulfilled at closure (she reaches the amphitheater, understands her purpose). However, the motivation is told more than dramatized in friction—no on-page moment where competing desires pull her or where the cost of seeking is tested. Setup strong, middle involvement present (scroll search, activation), closure direct. Desire clear; conflict around it thin.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>"Observed solitude" is coherent: the librarian moves unnoticed, her grandmother's memory is private, the amphitheater sequence is solo, and she returns to hum alone. Tone modulates subtly (quiet patience → wonder at the amphitheater → satisfaction at return) without breaking mood. The final image (humming softly, sanely eccentric) mirrors the opening's solitary threading. Tone charges the closure by sustaining quiet intimacy rather than triumph. Minor slip: "utterly satisfied" edges toward sentiment that the rest of the piece avoids.</comment>
