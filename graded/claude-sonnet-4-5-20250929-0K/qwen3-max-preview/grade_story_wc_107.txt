<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The glassblower's interiority relies heavily on abstract philosophical narration ("tyranny of productivity," "reverence begins with tending") rather than embodied emotion or contradictory impulses acting in scene. Her choices—sweeping, sitting, placing spheres—are rituals announced rather than decisions under pressure that foreclose paths with visible cost. The final "pliant, glowing, and gloriously, quietly, melting" heart reads as declared transformation without the on-page struggle or micro-choices that would earn it. No secondary character pressures her stance, leaving motivation abstract.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who and where early; the temporal frame ("during ice melting") remains atmospheric rather than a tightening constraint. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: sphere-creation builds density and the final reprise of the bookmark and child reweights the opening abandonment motif. However, the closure lacks visible cost—the glassblower smiles, her heart already transformed, with no path foreclosed or price paid on the page. The child's future discovery is projected, not dramatized, weakening the RR's on-page legibility.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The abandoned control room supplies vivid, purposeful detail—rusted chair, cracked console, dripping eaves—that charges atmosphere and supports the thawing motif. The scavenged furnace and glass rods anchor her craft in tactile specificity. Yet the setting does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; she moves freely through the space without friction. The final image (spheres catching light, chimes) enriches mood but does not hinge on spatial logic, capping the score below the 9-band gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—crafting safe zones for inquiry—is signaled early but never tested by opposition or scarcity. She announces rituals, places spheres, and departs without encountering resistance, resource limits, or a decision that narrows options. The ice melting outside provides textural parallelism but does not escalate pressure. No reversal or tightening occurs; the narrative arc is declarative performance rather than conflict-driven escalation, leaving cost abstract and agency largely ceremonial.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The thawing motif (ice, heart, systems) recurs purposefully and the bookmark-in-glass image carries quiet resonance. However, theme emerges more through authorial framing ("safe zones for inquiry," "wonder might thaw frozen assumptions") than through specific conflict and choice. The final paragraph's explicit thematic summary ("gloriously, quietly, melting") states what the preceding action has already shown, edging toward redundancy. The child's future question offers a non-literal answer but arrives as projection rather than dramatized consequence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and lyric, with elevated diction ("calloused from years at the furnace," "slush-laden streets") controlled throughout. Yet the register often drifts into workshop-speak ("reverence begins with tending," "pause is protocol") and the dramatically narrated announcements feel artificial rather than character-particular perception under pressure. Psychic distance remains stable single-POV, but the recursive announcement structure ("First…Now…Today…") reads as template cadence. No dialogue appears; POV modesty is intact but the prose leans declarative rather than pressured.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and figurative language is dense but largely coherent ("breath curling like steam," "quiet glow of molten silica"). However, the piece carries paraphrase loops: "not to reclaim power, but to abandon it" is restated across multiple beats without advancing pressure. The recursive "not X, but Y" template appears in five adjacent paragraphs, flattening propulsion. Metaphor density in the final third ("fossilized prayer," "weightless gravity") borders on overwriting without pattern-teaching payoff. Pronoun references and spatial choreography remain clear; no causality breaks occur.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The glassblower-as-ritual-maker synthesis and the control-room-as-sanctuary premise offer a fresh angle on post-crisis world-building. The bookmark suspended in glass and the projected child's discovery provide memorable particulars. Yet the overall arc—solitary artisan leaves transformative objects behind—follows a familiar template without sharp complication or non-obvious moral calculus. The lack of on-page resistance or cost limits ingenuity; the premise is executed with care but does not take structural or emotional risk that heightens stakes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The glassblower is present throughout and her actions (building furnace, crafting spheres, placing them) drive all beats. However, her choices are ritualistic announcements rather than decisions under pressure that narrow options. She encounters no friction or cost; her final departure is as uncontested as her arrival. Setup and development are strong, but closure participation is ceremonial rather than causal, capping the score mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The bookmark appears in paragraph three (setup), is sealed inside a sphere mid-story (development), and is referenced in the penultimate paragraph and seen by the projected child at closure (payoff). All three gates are met. It carries thematic weight (memory, knowledge) and its encasement is a purposeful choice. Yet it does not constrain a decision or bear visible cost; its function remains symbolic rather than tactically necessary, limiting the score to the middle integration band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The thawing heart operates as the story's conceptual spine, shaping the glassblower's motivation and charging the ice-melt timeframe and final image. It appears in the opening (frozen assumptions), middle (structural thaw), and closing (heart "pliant, glowing, and gloriously, quietly, melting"). However, it remains largely metaphorical; no on-page choice hinges on heart-state or demonstrates cost tied to thawing. The concept orients theme but does not alter tactics, holding the score in the mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"Thoughtfully spirited" is used as a label in two paragraphs ("Her voice, thoughtfully spirited" and "She walked…thoughtfully spirited") but does not constrain or enable a specific action with visible tradeoff. The trait describes tone rather than driving a choice or complicating a move. It appears but remains ornamental, scoring low for integration.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Abandonment frames the opening ("not to reclaim power, but to abandon it"), motivates the glass-sphere ritual (leaving vessels for others), and defines closure (she departs, leaving the room behind). The action is causally central to the arc and shapes her motives across all beats. However, no specific cost or friction arises from abandoning; she could as easily "gift" or "initiate" with similar narrative logic. Strong integration with minor replaceability holds the score in the 7-band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Dramatically narrating mundane tasks appears in the opening third (sweeping, sitting, feeding the furnace) and structures several beats. The method is signaled and visible. Yet it does not shape outcome or constrain a choice; it is performative style rather than tactical necessity. Removing the narration would shift tone but not alter the glassblower's success or the story's closure, capping the score at functional-but-replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The control room is established early, supplies vivid micro-setting (console, chair, emergency hatch), and hosts all action. The scavenged furnace and placement of spheres use the room's geography. Closure references the room's chimes and the child's eventual entry. However, the space imposes no constraint or resource limit; she moves freely and departs when ready. The room enriches atmosphere and serves as stage but does not pressure tactics, holding the score in the low-7 neighborhood.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Ice melting bookends the story (opening drip-drip, closing meltwater) and provides textural parallelism to the thawing-heart motif. The timeframe is atmospheric and present but does not tighten decisions or impose a deadline. She works at her own pace with no urgency or clock pressure. The element contributes thematic resonance but lacks causal force, scoring functional without tactical impact.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Crafting safe zones for inquiry is stated in the opening and dramatized through sphere-making and placement across multiple beats. The glassblower's actions consistently serve this motive. Closure reiterates the goal ("Hold space. Hold light.") and projects its fulfillment via the child. However, the motive is never conflicted or tested; no competing desire or cost challenges her intent. Setup, development, and payoff are present, but friction is absent, capping the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Tone balances lyric gravity ("fossilized prayer," "weightless gravity") with quiet ceremony, maintaining coherence across the arc. The piece avoids melodrama and sustains a contemplative register. However, the tone remains largely static; emotional modulation under pressure is minimal because no significant opposition arises. The final image charges the motif but does not shift tone in response to cost or reversal, holding the score in the mid-integration band.</comment>
