<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation is established through consistent action (measuring, waiting, recalibrating) and her stance against false alarms is embodied in the sensor work. However, interiority remains thin—her choices are narrated rather than felt through embodied contradiction or struggle. The smile at "Not yet" offers a glimpse of personality, but the piece leans heavily on lyric description over psychological depth under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly within the opening paragraph. The closure registers as Resonant Reconfiguration (trust restored, villagers listen rather than panic) with conceptual cost legible in the 17-year gap and the tester's patient ritual. However, the causal chain is more textural than because/therefore—sensors trigger the bell, but the protagonist's agency at the peak moment is passive observation rather than active decision, weakening the felt cost at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The sanctuary setting and the rope as micro-setting constrain the protagonist's work and charge the final image (rope "curled at her feet like a contented cat"). Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful (wind-polished stone dust, salt-thick rope, dew-point dips). The mountain's physical presence shapes the bell's mechanics and the spatial choreography remains clear throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—restoring credible storm warning without false alarm—is signaled early and coheres through the sensor installation. The rope's tremor ("Not yet") provides one meaningful tightening. However, escalation is muted: the storm arrives with reverence rather than testing her system under duress, and no live trade-off or visible price is paid at the climax. The resolution feels predetermined rather than earned through protagonist struggle.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme (listening over noise, trust over panic) emerges organically from the protagonist's methods and the Great False Dawn backstory. The bell's resonant toll and villagers' reception offer a non-literal answer without moralizing. The final image of rain as "promise" and the protagonist descending to "listen" charges the closure with thematic weight, though the subtlety borders on under-dramatization of cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with a consistent lyric register. Perceptual signature is present (tracking "microclimate variations with the patience of glaciers") and diction remains elevated but voice-consistent. However, the prose occasionally drifts into purple lyricism ("prayer caught mid-breath," "blessing") that risks ornament over urgency. No dialogue appears; the single-character design maintains clean focalization.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and opening/closing lines anchor voice and stakes effectively. However, figurative density is high throughout without clear pattern-teaching or payoff tied to pressure beats—"prayer caught mid-breath," "needle stitching heaven to earth," "serpent," "contented cat" stack within a short span. Some phrases border on stock ("ghost of vibrations past"). Information density is uneven; the sensor mechanics are narrated rather than dramatized, creating exposition drag mid-piece.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The premise (storm-warning ritual replacing mechanical sirens) offers a fresh angle, and the specificity of barometric levers and dew-point calibration grounds the concept. The 17-year backstory (Great False Dawn) adds earned weight. However, the transformation of the trope is moderate—the quiet, reverent resolution and the protagonist's solitary competence read as familiar beats in contemplative literary fiction. Risk-taking is present but measured.</comment>
