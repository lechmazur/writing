<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elira's interior is filtered through elevated diction ("semantic blooms," "verb root splitting") that reads more like thematic exposition than embodied thought under pressure. The botanical diary functions as a prop for exposition rather than revealing contradictory impulses. Kael's realization at the end feels delivered rather than earned through prior struggle. The lack of embodied emotion or micro-choices that cost something specific prevents higher scoring.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes a Conceptual Repricing closure where the lexicon's lesson reweights the rescue premise, but the cost remains abstract—no visible forfeiture or tactical shift on the page. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive late, past the 120-word mark, with "after the time traveler arrived" and the mountain bookstore clarified only through accumulation. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural, taught through layered imagery, but the final reconfiguration lacks a felt price that alters Elira or Kael's options in a legible way.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The mountain bookstore supplies vivid images (shelves spiraling, books growing like vines, gravity stuttering) but these details rarely constrain choices or supply resources that alter tactics. The botanical diary appears as a handled object in two beats (tracing verb roots, placing it in the hollow) but its properties don't shape the outcome—any token could have served. The shimmering absence and hollow function as lyric setting elements that charge the final image without materially narrowing options.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding/understanding the library of unlearned lessons—is signaled but never tested with a visible trade-off. Kael's chrono-core fracture and Elira's listening constitute observation, not agency that forecloses a path. The shift from "extract" to "renegotiate" arrives as dialogue insight rather than a choice with on-page cost. No reversal forces a sacrifice or alters tactics; the mountain simply "listens" and realigns without resistance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The theme—rescue as reconciliation rather than removal—is stated directly in the lexicon's sentence rather than emerging from dramatized particulars. "I am the lesson you refused to learn: that rescue is not removal, but reconciliation" functions as explicit moralizing in place of resonant image. The botanical diary's "semantic blooms" and "gaps" recur but remain abstractions without grounding in specific event or cost. The final image offers a conceptual answer without non-literal texture.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains elevated, figurative diction throughout ("linguistic strata," "syntax that bent causality") but this register reads as authorial rather than filtered through Elira's embodied perception under pressure. Dialogue between Elira and Kael is functional and carries subtext but lacks distinct idiom—both speak in similarly polished, abstract phrasing. Psychic distance remains stable, though the piece leans toward tell-heavy interiority ("she knew," "he realized") instead of letting inference emerge.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops appear in adjacent lines: "The library of unlearned lessons doesn't hide—it waits to be misread" followed immediately by Kael restating the concept. Template cadence runs in the opening: "She had come... she knew... Her fingers... Tucked under her arm..." Each paragraph opens with similar pronoun + action stems. Stock metaphors ("semantic blooms," "verb roots") cluster without fresh vehicle logic. Figurative density in high-pressure beats (the climax negotiation) obscures rather than sharpens causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The core premise—a linguist rescuing a sentient lexicon from a collapsing timestream—reads as a high-concept stack without transformation through lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The "rescue is reconciliation" turn echoes widely used writing-prompt templates. The botanical diary of "semantic blooms" and the mountain that "listens" feel like ornamental quirks rather than irreplaceable elements that constrain choice. The proximity to meta-commentary about stories and lessons reduces narrative urgency.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elira appears throughout but her decisions (kneeling, opening the diary, placing it in the hollow) function as ritualistic observation rather than choices that narrow options or create turns. She articulates insights to Kael but does not alter tactics under pressure. Present in closure but not causally active there.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The botanical diary is handled in three beats: carried under her arm, opened to reference "renegotiate the subject," and placed in the hollow. Its final use charges the closure image when letters bloom from the page, but the diary's specific properties (pressed petals, semantic records) do not constrain earlier choices or enable a tactic unavailable without it. Swappable with any token object that "speaks" to the lexicon.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The rescue mission frames the inciting situation (Kael's failed extraction) and Elira's reframing ("rescue is not removal, but reconciliation") shifts understanding at closure. The concept shapes stakes and the final negotiation beat, but the mechanics of renegotiation remain abstract—no on-page tactical cost tied to this reframing. Present in setup, middle dialogue, and closure, earning mid-band integration.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>"Carefully resourceful" is stated in exposition ("she carried no weapons, no spells of force, only questions") but this trait does not constrain or enable an on-page action with visible cost. Her three nights of research are summarized; her patience and question-asking are asserted rather than tested. Label-only mention without dramatized trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Renegotiate" is signaled in the botanical diary script ("renegotiate the subject"), articulated in Elira's dialogue turn ("Then we don't extract. We renegotiate"), and enacted when she places the diary in the hollow to initiate dialogue with the lexicon. This action redefines the mission from extraction to reconciliation and is present at closure. The verb itself is irreplaceable, though the mechanics of renegotiation remain abstract.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"By researching gaps" is established in backstory (three nights studying bibliographic absences) and referenced when Elira states "It's in the gaps." The method frames her approach but does not shape on-page attempts or alter tactics under pressure. The research itself is summarized rather than dramatized. Present in setup and thematic closure moment but mechanically inert.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The labyrinthine bookstore occupying a mountain is vividly described and provides the spatial container for all action. Gravity stuttering and shelves rearranging add texture but do not constrain Elira's path or force a choice. The hollow in the rockface serves as the ritual site for closure. Setting is present throughout and participates in the final image (shelves realign, mountain exhales) but does not pressure tactics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"After the time traveler arrives" establishes the inciting temporal frame but does not function as a live clock that tightens decisions. No urgency or deadline pressures Elira's moves; the collapsed timestream is referenced but not felt on the page. Time remains vague and untracked, trending ornamental rather than tactical.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The motivation to find the library of unlearned lessons is declared early and drives Elira's journey into the mountain. However, it is pursued through observation and dialogue rather than conflicted choices with visible cost. The desire is told rather than tested; no friction between wanting to find and the price of finding appears on the page. Present in setup and thematically linked to closure but not dramatized under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>"Unheard symphony" appears in Elira's final line ("the unheard symphony needs conductors, not saviors") but does not modulate through earlier beats. Tone remains elevated and figurative throughout without pressure-driven shifts. The phrase functions as thematic decoration rather than a coherent tonal arc that charges the closure image. Single static register trends mid-low.</comment>
