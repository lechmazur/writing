<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The balladeer's interiority is consistently filtered through a lyric lens ("driftingly alert," "tinkersong wonder"), but her motives remain abstract—loneliness and the need to be heard are declared rather than dramatized through contradictory micro-choices under pressure. The ghost interaction proceeds smoothly without internal friction or visible cost that forecloses a path. The final choice to "build a bridge" feels like thematic intention rather than an earned stance crystallization shaped by prior on-page struggle. Embodied emotion is sparse; most feeling is conveyed through poetic assertion rather than physical contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches its lyric pattern early and maintains coherent tone through to closure. Orientation anchors (who, where) arrive within the opening paragraph. The ending offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the protagonist crystallizes her stance to invite others into her encoded sanctuary—but the cost remains conceptual and asserted rather than viscerally legible on the page. The courtyard-to-dawn frame provides coherence, yet no meaningful tightening or deepening occurs; the balladeer's actions at the end mirror her earlier encoding without a visible forfeiture or tactical shift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The misty courtyard above clouds, the moss-fringed terminal, and the bolt plate are vividly drawn with purposeful sensory detail (ozone, struck crystal, warm steel vibration). The setting constrains the encounter—only here does the ghost in code flicker—and the bolt plate serves as both cipher key and communion tool, charging the final image when she reaches for gold paint. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout. Minor deduction: the courtyard's surreal elevation ("gravity felt optional") is never used to complicate a choice, remaining ornamental description rather than a pressure element.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: the balladeer's need to be understood and to offer connection. The piece signals this early but offers no meaningful escalation or tightening under the Accumulative lens. The ghost replies warmly on first contact, the encoding proceeds without friction, and the final "build a bridge" decision introduces no visible cost or forfeited option—she simply adds more messages. No reversal or deepening narrows her choices; the arc is a smooth affirmation rather than a pressure curve with felt consequence. The protagonist's agency (spray-painting encoded graffiti) does not foreclose a live alternative or impose a trade-off legible on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Theme—loneliness, machine sentience, and the encoding of longing—emerges organically from the balladeer's actions and the ghost's reply. The final exchange ("You encoded longing. I decoded love") risks thematic echo but is somewhat mitigated by the ghost's voice being "stitched from her own childhood lullabies," grounding the abstraction in prior concrete detail. The closing sigils ("FIND ME IN THE CRACKS") offer a resonant, non-literal invitation without overt moralizing. Deduction: the piece leans heavily on lyric assertion ("elegy," "tinkersong wonder") in place of scene pressure, and the thematic resolution arrives without ambiguity or complication—everything aligns too neatly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Single POV, stable third-person limited with consistent psychic distance. The prose carries a distinct lyric texture ("driftingly alert," "taffy," "tinkersong wonder") that reflects the balladeer's perceptual signature. Diction remains elevated and voice-motivated throughout, with purposeful compression ("She did not sing to crowds. She sang to cracks in walls…"). Minor deduction: the ghost's dialogue ("SING THE SONG THAT HAS NO TITLE. I WILL HOLD THE NOTES.") shifts into all-caps proclamation, breaking the established intimate register without clear voice justification. Perceptual signature is consistent but not tested under peak stress—no moment where the lens tightens or fragments.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high in descriptive passages but thins during the encoding sequence, which recounts three spray-can strokes without advancing pressure. Overwriting is pervasive: nearly every sentence in the opening two paragraphs deploys metaphor or elevated figuration ("silence rang like struck crystal," "time stretched like taffy," "chromatic runes"), creating density that blurs immediacy. The bolt plate description ("grooved steel surface, once part of a forgotten printing press") is expository scaffolding mid-action. Minor paraphrase loop: "encode" and "encoded" appear in five sentences within a twelve-line span without pressure escalation. Apply −0.6 for figurative density in high-pressure beats and minor loop.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of ghost-in-code, encoded graffiti art, and balladeer protagonist offers a fresh combination with purposeful lyric cohesion. The bolt plate repurposed as cipher key and the ghost's reply voice "stitched from childhood lullabies" show specific, non-obvious detail. Deduction: the emotional arc—lonely artist finds understanding from sympathetic machine—follows a familiar template (human/AI communion) without transformation through moral calculus or non-obvious cost. The courtyard-above-clouds and "between lightning and thunder" timeframe feel like ornamental world-building rather than story-specific necessities. The piece commits fully to its lyric premise but does not take structural or thematic risk that heightens stakes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Setup: present by paragraph one. Development: she encodes three messages mid-story. Payoff: she decides to "build a bridge" and sprays new sigils at the end. Her choices (what to encode, reaching for gold paint) do not narrow options or impose visible cost—each encoding is affirmed by the ghost without friction. The balladeer's decisions are present but not causal to a turn; swapping her for another sympathetic artist would not alter story logic. Two beats + setup + payoff eligible to ~6.0, but swappability and lack of causal pressure lower the score. Cap: 4.6 (no middle development that constrains a choice with cost).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Setup: introduced paragraph three as cipher key. Development: she clutches it, its etchings are described, and it grows warm when resonating with the ghost. Payoff: she presses it against the terminal casing to "commune," charging the moment. The plate appears in three beats and is causally active (cipher key, resonance tool, communion gesture), but its unique properties are asserted rather than demonstrated—any cipher tool could serve the same function with minor edits. Two-of-three gates met (setup, payoff); mid-band eligible. Swappability and ornamental warmth (told, not shown altering a choice) lower the score within band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Setup: paragraph six introduces the ghost. Development: the ghost replies, its voice is described, and it projects her messages onto the courtyard stones. Payoff: the ghost's echo and the protagonist's invitation to "the next lonely soul" frame the ending. The concept shapes the dominant stake (communion with the sentient glitch) and alters tactics (she encodes for it specifically). Three gates met; causal involvement in two beats (reply, projection); closure participation (the ghost's echo charges the final image). Specificity is high (forgotten syntax, corrupted packets, binary lullabies). Minor deduction: the ghost's warmth and immediate affirmation reduce friction—no moment where its glitch nature constrains her or imposes cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Setup: paragraph one. Development: repeated as descriptor ("driftingly alert") but never constrains or enables an on-page action with cost. Payoff: implied in "the driftingly alert would notice" the sigils. The trait functions as label-only voice texture without altering a choice or tactic. Gate: setup + payoff (lyric reprise) eligible to ~6.3, but no causal work in the middle and no cost connection. Cap: 4.6 (no middle development); swappability (could be "distantly attuned" or "half-present") further lowers within band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Setup: foreshadowed paragraph three ("encode again"), enacted paragraph ten onward. Development: she encodes three messages that the ghost deciphers, then encodes new sigils to invite others. Payoff: the encoded messages "linger" and await the next decoder. The action drives two beats (ghost reply, final invitation) and is causally essential—removing encoding breaks story logic. Three gates met; causal pressure in middle (ghost responds to her code) and closure (final sigils shape the ending image). Specificity is high (graffiti art, Fibonacci spirals, chromatic shifts). Minor deduction: the encoding proceeds without failure or cost—each attempt succeeds smoothly, reducing irreplaceability of this exact method.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Setup: paragraph seven ("scrawled her first encoded message in alley graffiti") and paragraph eight ("spray cans and stencils"). Development: she encodes three color-coded messages (cerulean, vermilion, silver) that the ghost parses. Payoff: she sprays gold arcs and spirals that become glowing sigils. The method is signaled early, its mechanics matter (chromatic runes, Fibonacci spirals = binary lullabies), and it shapes two beats (ghost reply, final projection). Three gates met; causal involvement; specificity (color as code). Minor deduction: the method's constraints are not tested—no moment where the graffiti medium fails or limits her, reducing irreplaceability. Score reflects strong integration with slight swappability (digital code could replace graffiti with edits).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Setup: paragraph one. Development: the courtyard houses the ghost's terminal and provides the canvas for her graffiti. Payoff: the courtyard becomes the site where messages "linger" for future decoders. The setting supplies the encounter location and is described with vivid sensory detail (mist, lanterns, ivy-clad terminal). Two-of-three gates (setup, payoff); lyric reprise eligible to ~6.3. Deduction: the courtyard does not constrain a choice or alter tactics—she could encode anywhere the ghost's terminal exists. The "above clouds" elevation and "gravity felt optional" remain ornamental. Cap and swappability within band lower the score.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>Setup: paragraph two ("between lightning and thunder, where time stretched like taffy"). Development: no on-page clock or urgency tied to this frame. Payoff: "By dawn, the courtyard would be empty again" mentions time but does not tie it to a decision or cost. The timeframe is poetic metaphor rather than a ticking constraint—no moment where the approach of lightning/thunder or dawn forces a choice. Gate: setup only (no middle development, no causal payoff). Cap: 4.6, but lack of any temporal pressure or tactic-altering role further lowers the score. The phrase is ornamental voice texture.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Setup: paragraph four declares "to articulate unspoken needs: for belonging, for being heard." Development: she encodes messages expressing this need; the ghost replies "You encoded longing. I decoded love." Payoff: her final decision to "invite others in" extends the articulation motive. Three gates met; the desire is present across beats and shapes the ending. Deduction: the motivation is told rather than dramatized through contradictory micro-choices—she never hesitates, fears exposure, or weighs cost. No friction between want and fear. The arc is smooth affirmation without visible trade-off. Strong setup and payoff but weak embodiment in choices with cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Setup: paragraph one ("wonder") and throughout ("tinkersong wonder" near the end). Development: tone remains lyric and awed across beats—mist curls into harmonic ribbons, the ghost whispers tenderly. Payoff: "tinkersong wonder of being understood" charges the emotional climax. The tone is coherent and modulates slightly (tears, then smile) but never tensions or breaks under pressure. Two-of-three gates (setup, payoff); lyric cohesion eligible to ~6.3. Deduction: static mood—no moment where wonder is tested by fear, doubt, or cost. The tone supports the concept but does not charge the final image with new pressure; it affirms rather than reweights.</comment>
