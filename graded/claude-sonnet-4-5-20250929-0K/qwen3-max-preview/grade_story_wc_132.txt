<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's internal arc is present but heavily weighted toward reflection over embodied action. Her motivation to study plants is told more than shown in pressure-driven choices—most micro-decisions (kneeling, whispering, lowering tools) read as passive observation rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final transformation feels asserted ("she understood then") rather than earned through causally linked on-page struggle, and the ending shift from scientist to "participant" lacks visible cost that forecloses a path. Diagnostic label-speak ("photosynthetic sentience," "vegetal will") in peak beats weakens interiority.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive promptly. The story attempts an Accumulative/Textural lens but the closure—Lindy's transmutation and the protagonist's behavioral shift—occurs off-page during the storm interlude; we see only the aftermath ("Lindy was gone—not fallen, but transmuted"). The dominant stake (decoding the leaf's persistence) is signaled early but the resolution bypasses causal linkage: the protagonist's weeping and page-tearing do not mechanically cause the leaf's glow or transformation, and no on-page cost is legible at the moment of change. The final image reconfigures the nursery arrangement, but the conceptual price—what she forfeited to arrive there—remains vague.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The mossy trellis is introduced early and returns at closure, and the rain/storm weather tangibly affects the protagonist's actions (sitting cross-legged, rain soaking her). Sensory detail is vivid and selective ("veins glowing faintly under the overcast like living filaments," "subterranean whisper of roots"). The setting subtly mirrors internal state (storm as baptism), though the connection occasionally tips toward overt symbolism. The final image (trellis with new shoot, moss-woven cradle) charges the closure without becoming postcard description.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding Lindy's defiance—is signaled early. However, escalation relies on the protagonist's internal softening rather than external pressure narrowing her options; no second character or resource scarcity forces her hand. The turning point (lowering the clippers) is a renunciation, but its cost is abstract: we do not see what she loses by abandoning her research beyond vague references to rent and colleagues. The storm and leaf's glow complicate but do not dramatize a trade-off with visible price. One meaningful tightening is present but lacks felt consequence scaled to the length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme—relationship as reciprocity rather than extraction—emerges through concrete images (tearing journal pages, leaf transmutation, nursery rearrangement) without overt moralizing. The ending reconfigures prior material (pinned slides, artificial suns) through the protagonist's embodied shift. Subtext operates in gesture and silence ("she simply touched the new growth"). Minor slip: the line "I stopped trying to fix what was never broken" edges toward a stated moral, though it is brief and filtered through dialogue. The final image (linden's successor glowing beside her, keeping time with her breath) offers resonant, non-literal closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable in third-person limited with controlled distance. Perceptual signature is consistent (scientific terms filtered through awe: "chlorophyll-green defiance," "liquid circuitry"). However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register that clashes with the narrator's lexicon under peak stress ("reluctant metamorphosis," "photosynthetic sentience" in candlelight reflection). Filter verbs ("she knew," "she understood") appear frequently in high-pressure beats, dulling immediacy. The closing dialogue feels natural and goal-driven. Psychic distance shifts are intentional, deepening during the storm sequence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high in places. However, paraphrase loops appear: "She didn't reach for her tools. / She didn't take measurements" repeats the same restraint without added pressure. Template cadence runs appear in the storm sequence: "She closed her eyes… She stopped trying… She stopped pretending… She wept." Stock metaphors ("baptism of release," "synapses mid-thought") and elevated diction ("circuitously sincere" used twice as a phrase-tag) clutter peak beats. The figurative density in the glow sequence (veins as filaments, cradle, hammocks) reads purposeful but occasionally mixed (moss "stirred, tendrils lifting" mixes plant and animal). No catastrophic opacity, but cumulative artifact load lowers momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The premise—scientist learns to stop dissecting nature and start belonging—is familiar (template: academic detachment redeemed by mystical encounter). The linden leaf's glow and transmutation are specific details, but the emotional arc (obsessive researcher softened by epiphany) does not transform the template through non-obvious moral calculus or lived friction. The ending's nursery rearrangement ("conversation compatibility," poems replacing labels) gestures toward fresh texture but reads more as whimsical illustration than inevitable consequence. The turn feels preordained rather than discovered in hindsight through prior causality.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plant nursery owner is present throughout and her choices (naming Lindy, bringing microscope, lowering clippers, tearing pages) create beats. However, most choices are renunciations or internal shifts rather than decisions that alter external tactics with visible cost. The climactic turn (releasing control) is more realization than action. Setup early, middle involvement present, but closure participation is passive (she sits, hums, explains). Two beats (clippers, page-tearing) constrain choice, but swappability is moderate—another researcher archetype could serve similar function with minor edits. Late in mid-band due to setup strength and beat count, but causal pressure and cost clarity are weak.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Linden leaf appears early (setup strong), is handled in multiple beats (field journal naming, microscope approach, glow observation), and returns transformed at closure (transmuted shoot). The leaf's defiance shapes the protagonist's escalating curiosity and final renunciation. However, its properties (why it glows, what triggers transmutation) remain vague, limiting irreplaceability—another anomalous plant part could substitute with moderate edits. Closure linkage is strong (new shoot is the final image), and cost connection is present (she tears notes about it). Three beats, causal pressure moderate, closure decisive. High in 7-band but lacks the specificity and unique mechanics for 8.5+.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Reluctant metamorphosis is signaled early ("Lindy was undergoing reluctant metamorphosis") and structures the thematic question. The concept shapes the protagonist's middle actions (nightly theory reconstruction, microscope approach) and appears in the climactic realization ("The metamorphosis wasn't reluctant in the leaf—it was reluctant in her"). However, the mechanics of metamorphosis—how releasing control enables it—are asserted rather than demonstrated through visible cause-effect. Setup and payoff are strong, middle development is thematic more than tactical. Causal pressure is moderate; the concept reweights meaning at closure but does not constrain on-page choices with hard trade-offs. Solid mid-band with strong thematic integration but limited tactical necessity.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Circuitously sincere appears twice as a descriptor (naming Lindy, final dialogue tag) but does not constrain or enable an on-page action with cost. The trait is label-only—it characterizes her self-aware whimsy but does not create friction, narrow options, or generate a trade-off. Setup is present (naming rationale), closure cameo exists, but no middle beat involvement. Swappable with "self-deprecating" or "protective irony" without structural change. Ornamental use; cap at 3.8 per swappability rule.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Reconstruct appears early ("She reconstructed her theories nightly") and drives middle beats (scribbling in candlelight, cross-referencing folklore, bringing microscope). The action escalates her obsession and sets up the turning point (realizing reconstruction is futile, tearing pages). At closure, the nursery rearrangement implicitly rejects reconstruction in favor of organic participation. Three beats, causal pressure clear, cost visible (abandoned research, dissolved notes). However, the action is somewhat swappable—"analyze," "catalog," or "theorize" could serve similar function with minor edits. Strong setup, middle, and payoff, but moderate specificity. High 7-band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Releasing control is signaled in the middle ("she released control") and is the explicit method at the climactic turn. The mechanics matter: she stops dissecting, weeps, tears pages, which then triggers the glow and transmutation. Closure directly links to this method (she sits "no longer owner but participant"). However, the method arrives suddenly in the storm sequence without prior tactical attempts—she does not struggle with partial releases or incremental losses of control before the full turn. Setup is weak (method not seeded early), middle involvement strong, payoff decisive. Two beats, causal pressure moderate, but late signal and lack of early friction lower the score. Mid 5-band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Mossy trellis after rain is the physical anchor throughout: she kneels beside it (opening), returns each dawn, sits beneath it during the storm, and it remains the site of the new shoot (closure). The setting provides spatial continuity and the moss "woven into a cradle" subtly supports the transformed leaf. However, the trellis does not constrain choice or supply resources that alter tactics—it is backdrop rather than obstacle. Rain affects mood and sensory texture but does not tighten decisions. Setup strong, closure participation strong, but middle development is atmospheric rather than causal. Solid presence with thematic charge but limited tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Storm season is signaled early ("Storm season had arrived") and frames the narrative window. The storm's arrival during the microscope beat complicates timing and the downpour is present during the climactic turn. However, the timeframe does not create a ticking clock or tighten decisions—she could wait out the storm or return another day without consequence. The element is present across beats but functionally decorative; it sets atmosphere more than it narrows options. Setup and closure participation present, but causal pressure weak. Mid 4-band due to consistent presence but lack of tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>To study plant behaviors is stated early and motivates her nightly reconstruction and microscope approach. However, the motivation is mostly told ("she'd spent years studying plant behaviors") rather than dramatized through conflicted choices. The desire does not face a hard on-page test—no competing want (profit, fame, relationships) is concretely dramatized, only mentioned ("colleagues called her obsessive"). The final shift away from study is a renunciation, but the cost (abandoned research, late rent) is vague. Setup strong, middle involvement moderate, closure participation clear, but friction between wants and costs is told more than shown. Low 5-band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Sustaining transformation is the organizing tone: the narrative opens with quiet observation, deepens through reflective passages, and closes with gentle resolution. Tone modulates with pressure (rain sequence intensifies, final image breathes calm) and charges the closure image (new shoot, humming, "keeping time with her breath"). Coherence is strong throughout turns. However, the tone occasionally flattens into a single static mood of reverent wonder, especially in the middle passages where repetitive syntactic patterns (She stopped… She stopped… She wept…) create a meditative drumbeat rather than escalating tension. Tone supports the ending but does not sharply inflect under peak stress. Mid 6-band due to coherence and payoff, but limited modulation range under pressure.</comment>
