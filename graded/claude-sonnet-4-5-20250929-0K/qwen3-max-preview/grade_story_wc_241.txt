<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's interiority is concrete and specific—the flunked calculus as rebellion, the shift post-heart-attack—but her choices never narrow meaningfully on the page. The father's bedside recognition and clover exchange offer embodied emotion, yet the scrawl network operates mostly as reflection rather than forcing live trade-offs. Internal contradiction is asserted ("rebellion without responsibility") but not dramatized through simultaneous impulses in a single beat. The ending ("Begin again") reads as declaration rather than earned through a foreclosed path with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens inferred as Accumulative/Textural: the scrawls and lantern accrue symbolic weight, and the final image ("Begin again") seeks resonance through pattern. Orientation anchors who/where/when by ~120 words (library, Elara, post-heart-attack). However, closure lacks on-page cost: the green-ink line reframes but does not foreclose a path or crystallize a trade-off with felt price. The father's clover and marker exchange is a micro turn, but it doesn't tighten options—it affirms connection without dramatized consequence. Escalation is textural (more scrawls, deeper interpretation) but never forces a renunciation or alters tactics in a visible way.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The rainwashed library, mica lantern, and subway seats are vivid and purposeful: the lantern's "paradoxical glow" filters perception, the grate and bench-slat placement shapes Elara's scrawl tactics, and the father's rehab ward beeping "like slot machines" anchors character priority. Sensory detail is selective and voice-filtered. However, the lantern's constraint on choice is implied (she "gets close to truth" when it shimmers) rather than forcing a visible fork in action. The micro-setting charges atmosphere but doesn't lock a final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—widening perspective responsibly—is signaled early and sustained. The scrawl network provides a series of interpretive puzzles, and the father's recognition offers relational pressure. Yet escalation under the Accumulative lens remains additive rather than tightening: each scrawl is another node, not a narrowing of options. The ending's "Begin again" line and clover exchange feel affirming rather than forcing a sacrifice or foreclosing an alternate path. No visible price paid on the page; the cost is conceptual and oblique, not dramatized through a renunciation or lost resource.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme—holding contradiction, traversing mentally, redefining success—emerges organically from image and action rather than thesis. The lantern's "lucid contradictions" and scrawls like "P(failure) = 0 if you redefine success" avoid platitude by grounding abstractions in concrete ritual (photographing, decoding, leaving chalk). The final "Begin again" paired with green ink and the father's clover offers a resonant, non-literal answer. Minor slip: "clover melancholy" is named rather than fully embodied, and "widening ≠ escaping" on the bedside table edges toward moralizing label, though it's framed as scrawl rather than authorial summary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Single POV, stable distance, distinct perceptual signature: Elara notices probability runes, fractures light "just so," interprets glyphs as conditional probabilities. Diction is controlled and voice-specific ("theoretically rebellious," "clover melancholy," "entropy"). Experimental compression (scrawls as nodes, lantern shimmer as truth-signal) is taught early and sustained. Minor slip: the father's interior ("flinch—not from pain, but from recognition") briefly exceeds Elara's knowledge unless she infers it from his visible reaction; the line could be tightened to stay strictly within her lens. No dialogue present to evaluate subtext or distinction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies, information density is high, figurative language is purposeful ("shadows that moved against the wind's direction," "beeping like slot machines"). Clear propulsion through the scrawl discoveries and father's arc. Minor artifacts: "She'd begun noticing" and "She began to traverse" are scaffold phrases that could be cut; "the kind that widens perspectives responsibly" borders on exposition. The phrase "clover melancholy settled over her—not sadness, exactly" is a tell-then-show hedge. Paraphrase loop: "traverse" recurs in similar constructions across three beats without pattern-teaching. No severe muddling, but cumulative minor slips pull the score below 7.5.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of probability theory, mystical scrawls, and post-trauma mental traversal is specific and non-obvious; the lantern as "truth-lens" and subway glyphs as probabilistic runes avoid stock imagery. The daughter-of-gambler-and-professor premise grounds the abstractions in lived detail. The ending's green-ink "Begin again" and clover exchange feel earned rather than convenient. Minor conventionality: the scrawl-as-breadcrumb network and "others who walked the edge" echo familiar mentorship-in-absence tropes. Risk-taking in voice and structure (accumulative, reflection-heavy) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; warrants a modest within-band lift.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elara (daughter of gambler and probability professor) is present throughout, her backstory frames her lens (flunked stochastic calculus, post-heart-attack shift), and she makes the choice to leave scrawls and bring the lantern to her father. However, her key decisions don't create sharp turns—interpreting scrawls and writing "Begin again" are accretive moves rather than forks that foreclose paths. The character shapes tone and theme but not plot pivots with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The mica-pane lantern appears in beat one (stolen from father's study), beat two (library use to decode scrawls), beat three (shimmer when "close to truth"), and beat four (father holds it, sees shadows). It constrains perception ("fracture the light just so") and charges the final image (glows "with new warmth," shadows "like invitations"). Specificity (mica, flaking edges) matters. However, the lantern's mechanics remain impressionistic—how exactly it "shimmers" when truth is near isn't dramatized as a fork in action. Strong integration, not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Lucid contradictions" is named early (lantern shadows moving "against the wind's direction," "illuminate corners already bright") and recurs in the final scrawl transcription ("hold contradiction without flinching"). It shapes Elara's interpretive method (treating contradictions as invitations) and charges thematic resonance. Yet the concept doesn't alter on-page tactics—no beat where contradiction forces a choice between two incompatible goods. It operates more as theme than stake-shaping pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Theoretically rebellious" is introduced early (flunked calculus on purpose) and motivates her shift post-heart-attack ("rebellion without responsibility was just another losing bet"). However, it remains largely label and backstory; no on-page scene where her rebellious impulse clashes with a responsible choice in real time. The trait primes her arc but doesn't constrain a present action with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Traverse" appears in beat one ("needed to traverse… mentally"), recurs in subway-seat scrawl ("P(success) undefined until you traverse"), and frames the ending reflection. It motivates her interpretive practice (traversing "the city's underbelly… with focus") and the father's solo journey note. Yet the action is primarily mental/metaphorical; no on-page moment where a physical or decisional traversal redefines options. The concept is load-bearing thematically but doesn't pivot plot.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Interpreting cryptic scrawls is introduced early (subway seats, "7→∞ if ¬trust"), developed across multiple beats (photographing, decoding as probabilistic runes, distinguishing signal from noise), and leads to her leaving scrawls and receiving a reply. The method enables the central activity and produces the micro-turn (someone responds). However, the mechanics remain abstract—how she decodes "∆entropy = regret × velocity" into actionable insight isn't shown. Strong integration, but the specificity of the method doesn't force a choice at closure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The rainwashed library at midsummer is vividly established (wet paper, old cedar, condensation, thunder) and serves as sanctuary framing the opening and ending beats. Sensory detail is strong. However, the setting doesn't constrain choice—Elara could interpret scrawls anywhere. The library provides atmosphere and ritual space but not tactical pressure. The subway seats and rehab ward do more work shaping access and context.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"After the heart attack" is signaled immediately (lantern stolen post-attack, father in rehab ward) and motivates Elara's shift from aimless rebellion to responsible widening. It tightens urgency (father recovering, monitors beeping) and enables the bedside exchange. The timeframe shapes stakes and provides emotional cost (father's fragility, Elara's regret). However, it's a causal anchor rather than a live countdown; no moment where time running out alters tactics on the page.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"To widen perspectives responsibly" is dramatized in her scrawl practice (leaving breadcrumbs, not where "authorities would erase them first"), the bedside marker message ("Widening ≠ escaping. Responsibility ≠ surrender"), and the ending's green-ink line. The motivation drives her interpretive ethics and shapes the father exchange. Yet it's never tested by a live friction—no beat where widening clashes with responsibility, forcing a visible trade-off. The desire is stated and affirmed rather than pressured.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Clover melancholy" is named once and embodied through "quiet ache for all the paths not taken, softened by the green resilience of small, overlooked things," the pressed clover from the father, and the green-ink "Begin again." Tone is coherent, modulates with pressure (urgent interpretation, bedside tenderness, final warmth), and charges the ending image (clover/green as forgiveness and renewal). The tone integrates motif and emotional arc without forcing. Strong lyric reprise lifts it past mid-band.</comment>
