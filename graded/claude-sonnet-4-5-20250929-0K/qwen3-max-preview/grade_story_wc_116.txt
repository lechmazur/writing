<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The keeper's motivation "to witness change without judgment" is stated but not tested through contradictory impulses in scene. Interior life consists largely of poetic observation rather than embodied emotion or micro-choices under pressure. The weeping moment ("not for loss, but for beauty") reads as a thesis statement rather than dramatized emotional complexity. The final act of writing to "release" weight lacks visible cost or a path foreclosed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors appear late (the keeper's role and the obsidian refuge are named early, but spatial and temporal grounding remains vague past 120 words). The piece operates in Accumulative/Textural mode: density increases through layered imagery and the final act of writing offers a reconfiguration of stance. However, the cost remains conceptual and oblique—what option was foreclosed by witnessing is not legible on the page. One meaningful deepening occurs (entry into the refuge's interior and emergence), but the before/after change in the keeper's capabilities or choices is asserted rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The overgrown library and obsidian refuge supply vivid, purposeful sensory detail filtered through a meditative POV. The origami swan and the refuge's surface constrain the keeper's method of entry, charging the closure sequence. Spatial choreography within the catacombs is impressionistic rather than mappable, but the POV's priorities (observation over navigation) justify the approach. The river's final mention reweights the refuge's interior vision with a grounding exterior anchor.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—witnessing without judgment—is signaled early but never tested by a live dilemma or trade-off. The keeper moves through the space and the refuge's vision without encountering opposition, temptation, or a choice that narrows options. The weeping and the act of writing are presented as fulfillment rather than escalation with cost. Under Accumulative/Textural lens, one deepening (entry into the refuge) occurs, but the tightening or foreclosed path required for higher scores is absent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme—impermanence, observation, regenerative silence—emerges organically from imagery and the keeper's actions. The final line ("to witness without judgment was the rarest form of love") risks overt statement but is partially earned by the prior vision sequence. The refuge's interior vision of civilizations dissolving carries genuine resonance. However, the piece leans toward thesis illustration rather than a question dramatized through conflicting pressures, and the closing smile feels too tidy for the existential weight carried.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with a lyric, meditative register throughout. Diction is consistent, heightened, and purposeful: "reality grips loosely," "the quietude between heartbeats." No head-hopping. The narrative voice remains singular and controlled under pressure. Psychic distance holds; thekeeper's perceptual signature (observation over action) is character-specific. Brief filter-verb clusters ("feeling the pulse," "saw civilizations rise") do not obscure immediacy in this reflective mode.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Figurative density is high and sustained: nearly every sentence carries metaphor or elevated diction ("silence wasn't absence—it was regenerative silence," "forests grew teeth," "lovers became constellations"). In peak beats (the refuge vision, the final paragraph), the layered imagery occasionally muddles clarity without adding pressure. Minor paraphrase loops appear ("not broken, not healed, but softened" / "no grief, no hope. Only witnessing. Only silence"). Sentence openings show good variety; rhythm modulates purposefully. Information density is moderate—many lines serve atmosphere more than plot or character agency.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The premise—archive as living entropy, observer as custodian of flux—offers a fresh philosophical angle. The origami swan as passage mechanism is specific and memorable. However, the emotional arc (reverent witness → tears → serene acceptance) follows a predictable contemplative template. The keeper's stance does not shift in an unexpected direction; the story commits fully to its lyric mode without subverting or complicating the initial frame. Transformation test: swapping names and the specific refuge object would preserve most of the thematic and emotional work.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The chronicle keeper is present throughout and performs actions (kneeling, unfolding the swan, writing), but makes no choice that narrows options or alters tactics. Observation dominates; the decision to enter the refuge and later to write are presented as ritual fulfillment rather than dilemmas. Setup and closure participation are present, but middle development lacks a constraining choice.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The obsidian refuge appears early (setup), is handled in the kneeling beat, serves as the portal for the vision sequence (development), and is referenced in the closing paragraph (closure participation). Its surface "reflected not the world, but the quietude between heartbeats" reweights meaning at the end. However, the refuge does not constrain a choice or impose a visible cost—it enables vision without friction. Two beats plus closure participation and a charged reprise support mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Regenerative silence is named early and recurs as a framing concept. It shapes the keeper's interpretive lens and the library's atmosphere. However, it does not alter tactics or create a live trade-off on the page—it remains thematic rather than causal. The ending invokes it again ("silence, regenerative and deep"), offering a reprise that reweights the stake modestly. Setup and lyric payoff are present, but middle development as pressure is absent.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Grips reality loosely" is attributed to the catacombs and echoed in the keeper's final stance. It describes tone and worldview but does not enable or constrain a specific action with cost. The keeper's ability to enter the refuge and return unchanged could be read as an instance of this trait, but the mechanics are attributed to the swan rather than the keeper's attribute. Label-only use with modest thematic integration.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Burrow" appears in the opening line (setup) and is invoked again when the keeper steps into the refuge's fold (development). The action is specific and irreplaceable—"enter" or "step through" would not carry the same connotation of digging into hidden layers. However, it does not drive a reversal or create visible cost; it enables access without friction. Two beats and specificity support upper-5s, but lack of causal pressure or closure cost caps higher range.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The origami swan is introduced in the second half (late setup, −0.3), its folds described in detail, and the keeper's act of unfolding and stepping into the fold constitutes the passage into the refuge (development and closure participation). Its mechanics—"Turn left at the sigh," "Trust the weightlessness"—are cryptic as specified and shape the method of entry. Specificity and irreplaceability are strong. Late introduction and single-beat use limit the score, but the charged return in the stepping-through moment supports low-6s.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The overgrown library and catacombs are established early (setup), supply atmosphere and constraint (the keeper moves through brittle scrolls, leaning shelves), and frame the closing return ("crumbling library," "nestled in moss and memory"). The collapsed dome opens to sky, altering the refuge's visibility. The setting shapes the keeper's reverent movement and the tone of decay-as-regeneration, constraining action modestly and charging the final image. Three gates met; causal pressure moderate; closure linkage clear.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Across the drift of untold seasons" appears in the refuge vision sequence, describing the interior temporal experience. It does not constrain the keeper's choices or create urgency—time is suspension rather than pressure. The phrase reweights the vision's scale but does not alter tactics. Setup (implied in "drift of seasons" imagery) and development (the vision sequence) are present; closure participation is oblique. Lyric reprise without causal pressure supports mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"To witness change without judgment" is stated explicitly in paragraph 4 (setup) and echoed in the final line as "the rarest form of love" (closure participation). The keeper's actions (kneeling, weeping, writing) enact the motivation. However, the desire is not dramatized through conflicting impulses or a moment where judgment tempts the keeper. Told and enacted, but not tested. Setup, enactment, and thematic payoff support low-6s; lack of friction caps higher range.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Crumbling peace" is instantiated early in the library's decay and regenerative silence, modulates through the refuge vision's elegiac beauty, and is named explicitly in the penultimate paragraph. Tone coheres across turns and charges the final image (the keeper's smile, the lullaby simile). The oxymoron—decay as peace—grounds both atmosphere and theme. Setup, modulation under pressure, and closure charge all present; coherence and reprise strong.</comment>
