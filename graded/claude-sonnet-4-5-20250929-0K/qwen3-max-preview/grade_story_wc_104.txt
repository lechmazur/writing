<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's physical and sensory details are vivid (calloused fingers, chains clinking), but her interior life remains largely opaque—we see her expertise without genuine struggle or internal contradiction. The mission unfolds with competent execution rather than difficult choices that reveal hierarchy of values. Micro-choices exist (pressing spores into cracks, planting the arrow as marker) but feel more symbolic than emotionally costly. The ending reconfiguration lacks visible internal friction; she walks away transformed in metaphor but not through on-page psychological price.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors arrive within the first paragraph (chained liberator, carnival, raiders). The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with lyric compression and charged final images. Closure arrives as Conceptual Repricing: the liberator's walk scatters seeds and reweights the opening captivity into inevitability ("quiet, inevitable, and utterly transformative"). However, the cost remains more asserted than felt—no on-page sentence shows what she forfeits or loses by walking into dawn with chains still on. The mechanics of vault-opening and seed-scattering advance causally, but the final image's cost is oblique rather than undeniable.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The carnival setting supplies vivid sensory anchors (dust-choked gloom, grinning clown mural, broken ticket counters) and the vault's cryo-tubes constrain her method. The piano-lock mechanism matters tactically, shaping her decoding sequence. Spatial choreography remains clear across moves. However, the setting functions more as atmospheric backdrop than active constraint at closure—her final walk occurs "into the wind" without micro-geography that alters her path or forces a trade-off.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake (breach vault, scatter seeds before dawn) is signaled early and remains coherent. One meaningful tightening occurs: the piano-key puzzle narrows her options and the vault opens, deepening access. Yet the resolution feels frictionless—no on-page reversal forces her to sacrifice one goal for another, and the raiders mentioned early never materialize to test her. The escalation is present in density and task completion but lacks a visible price that forecloses a live option. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure accumulates through tactical steps, but cost at closure is oblique.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme of resilience-as-planting emerges from concrete images (spores in cracks, seeds in sleeves, arrow as marker) without overt thesis statements. The final simile ("like soil after rain: quiet, inevitable, and utterly transformative") charges the closure image and reweights prior captivity into agency. However, the piece edges toward symbolic convenience—key, arrow, spores all recur as thematic tokens rather than constraining choices. The melody-left-waiting motif is evocative but arrives late, reducing its weight. Strong lyric resonance, but the question of cost versus hope remains more stated than dramatized.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>POV distance is stable third-limited; perceptual signature (dust motes like pollen, spores as heartbeat) is consistent and lyric. Sentence fragments and compression serve the accumulative design. However, register drifts into elevated diction in peak beats: "the dignity of a falling monarch," "staggering grace…utterly transformative" reads slightly outside the focalizer's idiom under stress. The closing paragraph's metaphoric density ("Each step cracked the earth. Each breath carried spores") borders on over-writing for a high-pressure exit. Rhythmic control is strong, but the voice occasionally prioritizes lyric texture over embodied urgency.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Information density is high; most sentences carry image, action, or thematic weight. Syntactic variety supports rhythm. However, figurative language saturates high-pressure beats without always clarifying—"staggering grace…not because she moved like a dancer, but because she moved like soil after rain" is striking but muddles the vehicle. Template openings recur: "She knelt," "She pressed," "She stepped," "She began to walk" across consecutive paragraphs. Paraphrase loop in final third: "They'd find music instead. And green. Always, eventually, green" repeats the inevitability claim without added detail. Line-level craft is strong but artifacts touch the closure beats, triggering mid-band placement and disallowing 9+.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of seed-vault heist, piano-lock puzzle, and post-apocalyptic gardener offers specific texture and avoids pure template. The arrow with beetle-wing fletching and acorn key are memorable particulars. However, the "hope-planting in dystopia" frame is familiar, and transformation relies more on lyric assertion ("green…always, eventually, green") than non-obvious moral calculus or lived friction. The piano-key cipher and mycorrhizal spores add verifiable detail, lifting freshness. Risk-taking in accumulative structure and compressed time is evident, but the ending's metaphoric closure feels slightly safe—transformation is promised rather than paid for on the page.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The chained liberator is present throughout and her choices (decode keys, plant arrow, scatter seeds, walk into dawn) create beats. However, most choices are tactical completions of a pre-set plan rather than decisions under conflicting pressure. Setup and development gates are met; closure participation is present but passive (she walks away). Her chains remain on at the end, a charged image, but no on-page choice alters her stance or forecloses a path with visible cost. Mid-band for involvement across beats; lacks causal pressure that narrows options.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The arrow appears early (tucked in belt, first third) and returns at vault threshold (planted upright as marker) and again in the closing move (acorn key placed in its hollow shaft). Three touches across setup, middle, and closure. The iridescent fletching is specific and visually charged. However, its function remains symbolic marker rather than tool that constrains a choice—she never draws it, and its role in the ending is decorative rather than causal. Lyric reprise reweights its meaning (signal to future finders) but does not impose cost. Eligible for mid-6s on recurrence and closure linkage, but symbolic use and lack of causal pressure cap it lower.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The seed vault frames the mission and drives the entire middle sequence: decoding the piano lock, opening the vault, filling pack and pockets with cryo-tubes. Setup, development, and closure gates all met. The vault's contents (drought-resistant millet, nitrogen-fixing beans) are specific and her scattering action charges the final image. The stakes are inseparable from vault access. Causal pressure is strong—without the vault, the plot collapses. Closure linkage is direct: seeds against her ribs, spores on her breath as she walks. High integration; irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Patience and strategy are label-mentioned early ("Patience had kept her alive. Strategy had brought her here") and visible in the piano-key decoding beat (she hums, traces patterns, presses keys gently). However, the trait is more told than dramatically tested—no on-page moment where impatience would cost her, or where her patience forecloses a faster, riskier option. Setup present, middle development mild, closure participation absent. Swappable with "careful" or "methodical" without structural loss. Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Impede" appears in the early description ("She didn't draw it to kill, but to impede—not with violence, but with precision") but the action never dramatizes on the page. She never impedes anyone; raiders are mentioned but do not arrive. The piano-lock could be read as impedance (she overcomes it), but the prompt likely intended her to impede others. Late clarification ("The raiders would come at first light…They'd find music instead") is summary-only and off-page. Swappable with "plant" or "signal" with minor edits. Ornamental or misfired use.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The piano-bench key arrangement is signaled early (second third: "seven tarnished brass skeleton keys…Each key's position…corresponded to notes"), developed in the decoding beat (she traces patterns, presses C, E-flat, G, B-flat), and directly opens the vault. Three-gate pass. Mechanics matter: the cipher determines access, and her knowledge of the gardener's journals enables the solve. Causal pressure is strong; without this method, the vault stays sealed. However, the solve feels frictionless—no failed attempt or cost tied to the method itself. High integration on setup/development/payoff; lacks visible struggle or trade-off during execution, capping it below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The carnival prize redemption center is anchored early (first sentence), supplies the piano lock and clown mural as tactical obstacles, and recurs in closure ("stepped back into the carnival's corpse"). Setup, development, and closure gates met. The decaying arcade texture (plush toys, ticket counters, dust) is vivid and the piano-as-lock mechanism is setting-dependent. Spatial choreography is clear. However, the setting does not constrain her final choice—she walks out into generic "wind" and "wasteland" without the carnival geography affecting her path. Solid integration across beats; closure linkage is present but the final image pivots away from the location's specificity.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The wall's fall "tomorrow" is declared early and restated ("Dawn was a rumor on the horizon. […] The raiders would come at first light"). However, the timeframe never tightens tactics on the page—she completes each task without time pressure forcing a trade-off or error. No moment where the approaching dawn costs her a choice or accelerates her moves. Setup gate met, middle and closure participation weak. The clock is asserted but not felt. Functional mention without causal grip.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The motivation ("plant resilience in dry soil—in hearts, in bellies, in futures") is present early and dramatized through her scattering action (fills pack, pockets, sleeves; presses spores into cracks; whispers seed names). Setup, development, and closure gates met. Her final walk embodies the desire. However, the motivation is never conflicted—no on-page friction between this want and another cost (escape, survival, a person left behind). Desire drives action but lacks contradictory impulses that would deepen the choice. Solid integration; could reach higher with visible trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The phrase "staggering grace" appears in the opening and closing paragraphs, explicitly defined as "not because she moved like a dancer, but because she moved like soil after rain: quiet, inevitable, and utterly transformative." Tone is coherent and lyric throughout, with rhythmic compression and charged images. However, the tone remains static—it does not modulate under pressure; the vault-opening and final walk carry the same elevated register. The final reprise restates rather than reweights. Purposeful lyric consistency but lacks tonal shift that would charge the closure more deeply. Mid-band for coherence and early-final frame; static mood caps it.</comment>
