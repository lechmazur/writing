<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The painter exists as a vessel for imagery rather than a character with interior contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. Her motives are told in abstract terms ("borrowed heartbeat," "unguarded rhythm of hope") without dramatized stakes or embodied cost. The phrase "perceptively calm, as if she'd expected this all along" tells rather than shows stance, and no decision point alters her path. No relationship pressure exists, and the closure smile arrives without earned tension or visible forfeiture.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed: "who" remains "the elusive mirage painter" without grounding identity, and the terrace location lacks spatial anchors beyond "marble tiles" and "prism parapet" until well past 120 words (−0.4). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (density of image, pattern of mirrors revealing possibilities), but no meaningful tightening or cost appears—mirrors "shiver" and "crack" without resistance, and the painter simply withdraws her hand and leaves. The ending offers no legible before/after in her stance or situation; she was already complete, she remains complete. Closure form is absent: no Decisive Change, no Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost, no Conceptual Repricing that reweights prior material.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Vivid sensory particulars ("marble tiles still wept," "spectral ribbons," "tarnished" mirrors) establish mood, but the terrace functions as backdrop rather than constraint. No spatial detail narrows choice or alters tactics; the prism parapet is handled once without consequence, and mirrors respond without environmental friction. The dusky spring setting charges the final image lyrically, lifting the score into the mid-5s, but does not meet the 9+ gate of constraining a choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"to persuade mirrors to show possibilities"—is declared but never tested. No opposition arises; mirrors comply immediately after her song. The borrowed heartbeat mechanism involves no cost, trade-off, or narrowing of options; she "took it gently" and "returned it—not spent, not diminished, but amplified." Agency is absent: the painter performs a ritual, and the world yields. No reversal or deepening occurs under the Accumulative lens; the ending dissolves her form without visible price or foreclosed path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>A coherent theme of transformation and gentle intervention emerges from the mirage-painting conceit and the mirrors showing "what could unfold." The lullaby motif and the third mirror's reveal ("younger, standing beside a crib") create a recursive pattern that reweights prior material. However, the final paragraph moralizes explicitly: "Her work was not to linger, but to leave traces—to seed the world with gentle fractures where light could enter" (−0.6 for thematic echo in closure). The ending offers reflection rather than earned insight from dramatized struggle.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-person limited with a lyric register ("not with wind, not with magic, but with release"). Diction is elevated and consistent, creating a distinct textural signature. However, filter verbs cluster in high-pressure beats ("She did not seek," "She sought to persuade"), and the prose often tells interiority rather than enacting it ("as if she'd expected this all along"). No dialogue appears. Perceptual signature is poetic but generic; the focalizer notices beauty and mystery without character-specific bias.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Overwriting pervades: nearly every sentence carries figurative language ("trembling halos," "silent pact with gravity and light," "hollow between her ribs where the borrowed heartbeat echoed") without pattern-teaching or payoff (−0.6). Paraphrase loops appear: "Not with wind—the air was still" / "Not with wind, not with magic, but with release" / "not with smoke or spell, but with the quiet grace" recycles negation structure across closure beats (−0.4). The opening anchors voice, but scaffold phrases ("One by one," "This was her canvas") stall momentum. Metaphors often contradict: borrowed heartbeat "echoed" in a "hollow between her ribs" mixes acoustics with anatomy implausibly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The mirage-painter premise and borrowed-heartbeat conceit are evocative but ungrounded in causal mechanics or fresh transformation. The mirrors-showing-possibilities turn is a familiar metaphor executed lyrically but without subversion or specific lived detail that makes it feel inevitable. The story reads as a meditation on a template mystical-artist archetype rather than a synthesis with irreplaceable particulars. The tarnished mirrors and lullaby code are mentioned but never developed into a non-obvious payoff.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>The painter is present throughout and performs the central action (kneeling, pressing palm, humming, withdrawing), but no on-page choice alters tactics or creates a turn. She observes her own ritual and departs; the mirrors respond without her needing to adjust. No cost or friction is tied to her agency. Setup and closure participation are present, but middle development as decision-making is absent (missing middle gate → cap 3.4; ornamental use −0.8; final 2.4).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The prism parapet appears early ("She knelt beside the prism parapet after rain") and is handled once ("pressed her palm to its cool surface"). Its "ancient glyphs that fractured sunlight into spectral ribbons" shape the visual logic of light-bending, and the final image of mirrors gleaming ties back to the prism's refractive premise. However, it is not handled again or used to constrain a choice; it serves as atmospheric anchor rather than causal lever. Setup and closure linkage present; middle development weak (two gates → cap ~6.0; modest causal pressure +0.3; lyric reprise −0.3 for single touch; final 5.8).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The borrowed heartbeat is introduced early ("with borrowed heartbeat: the thrum of another's pulse, borrowed and returned") and appears in two beats (taking from the child, returning it at the end). It shapes the painter's method but imposes no visible cost or constraint; she takes it "gently" and returns it "not spent, not diminished, but amplified." The concept remains thematic rather than tactical. Setup and payoff present; middle causal pressure absent (two gates → ~6.0; ornamental treatment −0.8; swappable with "borrowed breath" or similar −0.5; final 4.2).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Perceptively calm" appears once as a label ("perceptively calm, as if she'd expected this all along") without constraining or enabling an on-page action with cost. It describes her demeanor but does not shape a choice or tactic. Label-only use; missing all three gates (setup weak, no middle development, no closure linkage → cap 2.8; label-only −0.3; final 2.1).</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"Grace" appears in the opening ("She moved with grace, not as performance but as breath") and the final sentence ("with the quiet grace of a shadow yielding to dusk"), framing her presence. However, no turn or tactic traces to grace as a specific action; it remains a quality rather than a decision or move. Setup and closure reprise present; middle development as causal action absent (two gates → ~6.0; lyric reprise only +0.2; swappable with "fluidity" or "ease" −0.6; ornamental −0.5; final 3.7).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The coded lullabies appear in two beats: introduced in exposition ("Through coded lullabies in children's songs, she wove her intent") and enacted on the page ("Each note she hummed now vibrated through the prism parapet"). The method is signaled and its mechanics matter (vibration bending light and memory). However, it is not tested or adjusted; the lullaby succeeds immediately without friction. Setup and middle use present; closure participation indirect (all three gates → eligible ≥6.1; one distinct beat +0.4; causal pressure modest +0.3; swappable with "incantation" −0.4; final 5.3).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The echoing terrace in spring is anchored early ("stood barefoot on the echoing terrace in spring") and supplies key props (marble tiles, prism parapet, mirrors, garden mist). The setting enables the painter's ritual and the final image of bells tolling in the valley below. However, the terrace does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; it provides ambiance and stage rather than pressure. Setup, middle involvement, and closure linkage present (all three gates → eligible ≥6.1; closure shaping +0.5; spatial detail +0.3; no constraint penalty −0.4; final 6.2).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The timeframe "over the hush before bells ring" is signaled midway ("that suspended moment when time forgets to tick") and resolved at the end ("As the first bell tolled in the valley below"). It creates a lyric bracket but does not tighten decisions or alter tactics on the page. Setup delayed (second third −0.3); payoff present; no middle pressure (two gates → cap ~6.0; lyric closure +0.5; no causal tightening −0.7; final 4.8).</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The motivation "to persuade mirrors to show possibilities" is declared explicitly in exposition ("She sought to persuade mirrors to show possibilities") and enacted in the mirror sequence ("One by one, the mirrors shivered"). However, the desire faces no friction or cost; the mirrors comply without resistance, and no internal conflict dramatizes the want versus a fear or price. Told-only motivation; no on-page choice tests commitment (setup weak, middle absent, closure achieved without struggle → cap 3.0 for resolving without creation; lenient lift for thematic clarity +1.6; final 4.6).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Dusky harmony is woven throughout: "slant of dusk," "dusky harmony of spring's last sigh," "quiet grace of a shadow yielding to dusk." The tone remains elegiac and still, modulating subtly from anticipation (opening terrace) to fulfillment (mirrors revealing) to release (final dissolution). It charges the final image directly and coheres across beats. Setup early +0.5; closure linkage strong +1.2; coherent modulation +0.8; static in middle beats −0.4; final 6.7.</comment>
