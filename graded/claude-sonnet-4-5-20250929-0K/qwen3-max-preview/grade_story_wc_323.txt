<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elira's motivation is clear and her trait of "balanced curiosity" is gestured at through the First Contact backstory, but interiority remains largely declarative rather than embodied. The classroom beats show professional competence without internal contradiction or struggle that would force difficult micro-choices. The anchor chain link moment offers a promising gesture toward embodied reflection, but the subsequent lecture feels like exposition of character thesis rather than discovery under pressure. No meaningful cost or renunciation is dramatized; she teaches, reflects, and continues teaching with identical confidence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers setting, backstory, and thematic imagery toward a final classroom moment meant to crystallize purpose. Orientation anchors arrive quickly (benthic city, instructor role, post-alien world). However, no on-page reversal or tightening occurs; the anchor chain link is introduced in her quarters, brought to class, and used to illustrate a pre-formed thesis without altering her stance or options. The ending restates the opening premise with added symbolic weight but no felt cost or foreclosed path—closer to thematic echo than Resonant Reconfiguration. The "by semester's end" summary skips the dramatized closure moment entirely.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The benthic city setting is vivid and specific: bioluminescent towers, abyssal plains, pressure-sealed glass, deep-sea vents. The pressurized dome classroom and the anchor chain link function as micro-setting elements that recur across beats. The power fluctuation beat uses darkness and imagined stars to charge atmosphere. However, the environment does not constrain a choice at closure—Elira's balcony reflection and final classroom lecture proceed without spatial or resource pressure. The anchor chain link is handled but remains symbolic rather than a tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—teaching celestial navigation in an alien-altered cosmos—is signaled early and remains coherent. Kael's question about Vega drifting offers a brief teaching beat, and the power fluctuation creates atmospheric pressure, but neither narrows Elira's options or forces a trade-off. The semester-end summary tells us students succeed without dramatizing a pivotal teaching failure, breakthrough, or cost. No reversal or escalation: Elira begins confident in her method and ends the same way, mounting the chain link as a static symbol. The story accumulates detail but does not tighten.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Unfolded horizons," "edge geometry," and the anchor-as-adaptability metaphor recur across beats and achieve thematic coherence. The final classroom speech attempts to crystallize theme through the chain link image: rigidity versus flexibility, descent and rise. However, the speech explicitly states the theme rather than letting action or image carry it—"We are navigators of unfolded horizons" reads as prompt-echo. The benthic city as survival-after-discovery offers a compelling backdrop, but Elira's arc does not test or complicate the theme; she arrives with the answer and teaches it unchanged.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Voice is consistent and controlled: elevated diction ("somber marvel," "liminal spaces," "conceptually upward") matches Elira's instructor role and the speculative premise. Dialogue is minimal but functional; Kael's question and Elira's answer advance exposition without strong subtext. The anchor chain reflection and balcony beat show purposeful psychic distance modulation. However, diction occasionally drifts into abstract register ("thresholds," "alien-altered celestial grid") that risks declarative tone over embodied perception. Free indirect style is clean; no POV leakage. The prose maintains a singular, slightly formal texture throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and the prose is largely clear, but several beats rely on declarative exposition: "Her motivation wasn't nostalgia; it was necessity" and "That phrase—edge geometry—became her mantra" tell rather than show through scene pressure. The anchor chain passage uses strong concrete detail ("rusted and heavy," "cold iron weight"), but the subsequent classroom speech recycles the chain link metaphor with paraphrase loops: "We are not weights...We are not relics...We are navigators." Minor filter-verb stacks ("she felt not fear, but awe") and template cadence in the final lecture beats slightly dull momentum. No major artifacts touch closure, but density could tighten.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The premise—teaching starlight navigation in a post-alien-contact benthic city—offers a fresh synthesis of speculative elements. "Edge geometry" and "non-Euclidean folds" provide specific conceptual texture. However, the emotional and pedagogical arc follows a familiar template: competent instructor reaffirms purpose through symbolic object and inspirational speech. The anchor chain link as mnemonic device reads as purposeful but not indispensable; the teaching beats could proceed with a different object. The story commits fully to its premise but does not transform or subvert the instructor-teaches-resilience frame in a non-obvious way.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elira as navigation instructor is present throughout and her role shapes every beat. She teaches Kael, reflects on the anchor, and delivers the final classroom speech. However, her choices do not create turns—she arrives with her method and worldview intact and teaches them unchanged. The role is essential to premise but does not drive escalation or closure transformation. Present in all three gates (setup, middle teaching beat, ending speech) but her decisions do not narrow options or alter tactics. Mid-band: functional and thematic but not causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The anchor chain link appears in three beats: discovered in her drawer, placed on her desk, and brought to class for the final lecture. Each appearance advances thematic weight—from mnemonic to counterpoint to mounted symbol. The object is handled on the page and its meaning evolves from personal reminder to classroom teaching tool. However, it does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; Elira's teaching method and confidence remain unchanged whether the link is present or not. The object charges the final image but does not create causal pressure. Meets all three gates with thematic reprise, eligible above 6.0, but swappable with another symbolic object.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Unfolded horizons" is named explicitly in the opening line and recurs in the final classroom speech ("navigators of unfolded horizons"). The concept structures the world premise—aliens have rewritten spacetime—and motivates Elira's teaching mission. However, it operates primarily as theme and setting background rather than shaping on-page tactics or choices. Elira's method (edge geometry, starlight triangulation) responds to the concept, but no scene dramatizes a student or instructor struggling with unfolded space in a way that forces a turn. Present in setup and ending; minimal middle development. Conceptual frame, not causal driver.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Balancedly curious" is labeled once in backstory ("a trait that had saved her crew during First Contact") but never enacted in scene. Elira's on-page behavior—teaching, reflecting, and delivering the final speech—reads as confident and assured rather than curious or exploratory. No moment shows her balancing risk and caution or making a choice that tests this trait with visible cost. The attribute exists as exposition without dramatized proof. Present in setup only; absent from middle and closure. Label-only mention trends low.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Expand" recurs across beats: Elira teaches students to "expand perception through edge geometry," she expands her own perception during the balcony beat ("letting perception expand beyond the physical"), and the final speech urges "learning how to expand when the universe itself has stretched." The action is thematic and conceptual rather than physical, but it coheres as the story's central method. However, no turn traces directly to an act of expansion—Elira's understanding is already formed, and the students' success is summarized rather than dramatized. Present in setup, middle reflection, and ending; thematic frame without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Edge geometry" is introduced early ("became her mantra"), explained in the Vega teaching beat ("the liminal spaces between stars"), and referenced in the balcony reflection and final speech. The method is signaled and its mechanics matter to the world premise—reading warps in celestial fabric. However, no scene dramatizes edge geometry shaping an attempt, failure, or breakthrough that alters Elira's or a student's tactics. The method is described and taught but not tested under pressure. Present in setup and ending; minimal middle dramatization. Conceptual tool without on-page proof of use.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The benthic city is established in the opening line and recurs throughout: bioluminescent towers, abyssal plains, pressurized dome, pressure-sealed balcony, emergency power strips, deep-sea vents. The setting is vivid and specific, and the power fluctuation beat uses darkness to charge Elira's reflection. The dome overlooks the abyssal plains, anchoring classroom geography. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that affects outcome—Elira's teaching and reflection proceed unchanged by location. The city frames tone and premise but does not pressure tactics. Present across all beats; thematic anchor without causal role.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The timeframe "after discovering aliens" is established in the opening and recurs in backstory (First Contact, the Great Descent) and world premise (aliens rewrote spacetime). The post-alien reality motivates the teaching mission and the need for new navigation methods. However, time does not tighten decisions or alter tactics on the page—no countdown, no urgency, no semester deadline that forces a choice. The "by semester's end" summary skips forward without pressure. The timeframe is conceptual setup rather than a live clock. Present in setup; absent from escalation and closure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elira's motivation to teach navigation by starlight is stated early ("her motivation wasn't nostalgia; it was necessity") and drives every beat: classroom instruction, reflection on the anchor, balcony visualization, and final speech. The desire coheres across the story. However, it is declared rather than conflicted—no friction between cost and commitment, no moment where Elira doubts or pays a price for pursuing this goal. Students ask questions and succeed; Elira's confidence is unshaken. The motivation is functional and consistent but lacks dramatized internal friction. Present in setup and ending; told more than tested.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Somber marvel" is coherent and modulated across beats: the opening's "somber marvel of survival," the classroom's quiet teaching, the balcony reflection ("not fear, but awe—the somber marvel of a universe remade"), and the final image of the benthic city "alive with purpose." The tone supports the concept and charges the final image with bittersweet resilience. Diction choices—"dimly," "crushing," "ink-black," "quiet, somber curve"—sustain the register without flattening into static mood. The tone is consistent yet responsive to pressure, modulating from exposition to reflection to quiet affirmation. Present and purposeful throughout; elevates closure without overwhelming it.</comment>
