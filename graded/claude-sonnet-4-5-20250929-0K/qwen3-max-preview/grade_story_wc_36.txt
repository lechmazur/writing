<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation is concrete and specific—harvesting insights from failure rather than restoration—and her scholarly precision emerges through embodied micro-choices (calibrating driftwood angles, notebook documentation). Internal contradiction shows when precision trembles not from fear but exactitude, yet the piece leans heavily reflective with ~40% devoted to backstory/context of the collapse. The final renunciation (leaving the flute, becoming a keeper of thresholds) feels earned by her meticulous autopsy work, though the turn relies more on accumulative witnessing than a sharp on-page dilemma. Interiority remains particular to an archivist's mindset without therapy-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): she chooses witnessing over restoration, leaving the flute to become monument, with visible cost (the guardianship path foreclosed, the weave unrepaired). The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens—density builds through the three realm-collapse case studies, then pivots at "This was her harvest" into a cadence shift where she walks away and redefines her role. Orientation anchors quickly (kneeling keeper, Thunder-echo Range, seventeen years after), and causality holds through her methodical investigation. One minor slip: the between-place mechanics (how she steps through with a single breath) are lightly sketched, but the cost and thematic repricing are undeniable on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The Thunder-echo Range supplies vivid, selective details—ash-colored sand, bleached driftwood, scree-buried amphitheater—that ground the scholarly autopsy without catalog excess. Micro-setting (the driftwood compass, the floating marble slab in the between-place) charges key beats and the final image. Sensory hierarchy matches the protagonist's professional filter: she notices geomantic leylines and harmonic nodes, not tourist landmarks. The between-place's "gradient of forgotten hues" and suspended rivers offer lyric specificity that serves the conceptual stakes, though the piece does not demand that environment constrain a tactical choice in a high-pressure beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether to risk reopening the weave or let the collapse remain—is signaled early and tightens when she steps through, then crystallizes in her choice to leave the flute rather than repair it. The accumulative case studies (Verdantis, Silmara, Khyren) function as forensic escalation, each failure narrowing the viable approach until she concludes some doors stay open by staying closed. Her agency is renunciation with visible cost: she forecloses restoration, the Council's "never again" becomes her own internalized ethic, and she shifts roles from relic keeper to threshold keeper. No sharp antagonist, but the pressure coheres through her meticulous investigation under the chosen lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme—when to play, when to pause, when to let silence speak—emerges organically from the three realm autopsies (too loud, too timid, too perfect) and crystallizes in the final codex and the paradoxical koan "some doors stay open by staying closed." The piece resists moralizing; the flute's surrender to lichen and wind is image, not sermon. Subtext operates in the driftwood compass pointing "nowhere," the silent oracle, and the offerings left by pilgrims. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without stating thesis, and the protagonist's arc (from dust-shelves cataloger to threshold witness) is inextricable from the ethical question. No token motifs; the flute's physical decay charges the conceptual repricing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited holds steady, with psychic distance calibrated to an archivist's methodical consciousness—"This wasn't ritual. It was autopsy" captures both voice and stance. Diction remains within the POV's scholarly lexicon (geomantic leylines, harmonic decay, autopsy) without slipping into generic elevated prose. Perceptual signature is distinct: she notices stellar drift, canyon hush density, and the flute's residual resonance. No dialogue to evaluate. The prose modulates effectively from precision ("each stick had to angle just so") to lyric compression in the between-place without losing coherence. One brief filter-verb cluster ("She had studied...cross-referenced...mapped") in early reflection, but it serves clarity and does not dull a peak beat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high—most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "avalanchingly quiet despite the name" delivers setting, paradox, and voice). Opening and closing lines anchor well: the kneeling keeper and the final koan frame the arc. Minor scaffold appears in the three-realm exposition block where "One realm...Another...The third" cycles through identical stems, costing ~−0.4, and a few lines lean slightly purple ("silence fell like snow after a storm, avalanchingly quiet"). No paraphrase loops or pronoun drift. The piece sustains clarity and propulsion through its reflection-heavy middle without stalling momentum, and key beats (stepping through, walking away) remain concrete.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The premise—conducting an autopsy on a failed magical weave to harvest failure-insights rather than attempt restoration—offers a fresh, non-obvious angle on relic-keeper fantasy tropes. The synthesis of scholarly method with lyric world-logic (harmonic nodes, weave collapse, leylines) feels specific and internally consistent. The emotional arc (witnessing over heroism, monument over instrument) avoids the genre's repair-quest template. Mild derivative pressure: the "forbidden artifact, catastrophic misuse, Council verdict" setup echoes common fantasy scaffolding, and the three-realm taxonomy (too loud, too timid, too perfect) reads slightly schematic. The piece transforms through specificity (driftwood compass, canyon hush, codex of questions) and the non-triumphalist closure, but does not take bold structural risks.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The relic keeper drives setup (uncasing the flute), middle investigation (stepping through, documenting collapses), and closure (leaving the flute, redefining her role). Her choices—arranging markers, coaxing echo, walking away—create the story's key turns. She appears in all three gates and her final renunciation forecloses the restoration path with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The gilded reed flute appears in setup (uncased, brittle), middle (lifted to lips, single note opens the seam), and closure (left at the amphitheater to decay, becoming monument). It constrains her method (breath not song), enables the crossing, and its physical transformation (gold to lichen) charges the final image. Specificity (gilded lacquer, brittle reed, residual resonance) makes it irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Weaving between worlds shapes the dominant stake (whether to reopen the weave) and the middle investigation (the between-place, collapsed realms). The concept drives her forensic autopsy and the ethical codex she writes. It appears in setup (the flute once wove realms) and closure (she chooses not to restore the weave), though the mechanics of weaving remain lightly sketched and the concept functions more as thematic premise than tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Avalanchingly quiet" appears in the opening line and recurs as "canyon hush" throughout, modulating tone and charging the final silence ("The Thunder-echo Range held its breath"). It enables her forensic listening (the flute's faint hum, the echo she coaxes) and constrains the method (breath not song). The attribute is present in setup and closure, but does not force a visible tradeoff or alter tactics under pressure in the middle investigation.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Uncase" triggers the central sequence: it occurs early, motivates the journey to the amphitheater, and frames her seventeen-year wait. The action enables the middle investigation (she must uncase to use the flute) and participates in closure (she does not re-case it, leaving it exposed). It defines a before/after (cased/uncased, restoration vs. monument) and could not be swapped without altering the story's logic, though its causal pressure is moderate—it is setup more than turn.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Arranging driftwood as directional markers appears in setup (she scavenges and calibrates each piece) and middle (the markers converge at the amphitheater's harmonic node), shaping her method and constraining the flute's placement. The mechanics matter (angle calibrated to wind's memory, not whim) and the compass image recurs at closure (markers pointing nowhere, pilgrims find them). It enables her forensic approach but does not force a tactical choice under pressure; its role is methodological rather than pressure-driving.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Thunder-echo Range supplies the amphitheater (half-buried in scree, harmonic node), the ghost delta (source of driftwood), and the canyon hush that modulates tone and charges the final image. It constrains her method (geomantic leylines guide marker placement) and participates in closure (the land "held its breath"). The setting is present across all three gates and its specificity (ash-colored sand, bleached driftwood, avalanching quiet) is irreplaceable, though it does not supply a resource that alters tactics under immediate pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"After the guardianship ended" anchors the timeframe in setup (seventeen years of waiting) and motivates her decision (the Council's verdict, the passage of time as permission). It participates in the final image (pilgrims come "later," years pass before the apprentice asks). The timeframe does not tighten tactics in the middle investigation—no clock forces her hand—and functions primarily as backstory context rather than live pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The motivation—to harvest insights from failure—is signaled early ("not glory or restoration"), drives the middle autopsy (recording how realms unraveled, not what was lost), and crystallizes in closure (the codex of questions, honoring failures). It creates friction between the Council's "never again" and her need to dig anyway, and the final choice (leaving the flute, becoming threshold keeper) is its direct fulfillment. The desire is dramatized through concrete action (cross-referencing logs, transcribing breaths) with visible cost (the restoration path foreclosed).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"Canyon hush" modulates across the story: the opening "avalanchingly quiet," the middle "silence so dense it pressed against the eardrums," and the final "canyon hush, deeper now, as if the land itself understood." Tone charges the method (coaxing echo not song), the between-place stillness, and the closure image (no thunder, no choir, only hush). It is coherent through turns and elevates the conceptual repricing—the quiet avalanche that clears the path. The tone is irreplaceable and indispensable to the story's resonance.</comment>
