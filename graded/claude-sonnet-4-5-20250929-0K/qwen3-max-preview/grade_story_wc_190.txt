<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The operator's interiority is present and filtered through professional attention (storm glass monitoring, ear calibration), but his motivation remains abstract—"to teach silence how to comfort" is asserted rather than rooted in contradictory impulses acting in scene. The grandmother backstory and first passenger memory anchor his practice without dramatizing a hierarchy of values under current pressure. Agency appears as micro-adjustments (weight shift, tilt) that produce outcomes, yet the woman's transformation reads mechanical rather than earned through protagonist struggle with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece builds density through storm-glass swirls (gold ripples, syrup thickness, gray fog, silver eddies, clear mountain air, golden pulse) that track emotional barometric pressure across two passengers within one continuous terrace drift. Closure lands as Charged Poise—the operator re-clips the vial, turns the craft, lifts the glass for the next passenger with "not in warning, but in welcome," crystallizing his enduring role with felt cost (perpetual readiness, no destination for himself). Cost is conceptual but legible: he ferries others to clarity while remaining in transit.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The drifting prism terrace functions as micro-setting that constrains movement (thermal drafts, crystalline geometry, iridescent tiles humming in response) and shapes the operator's tactics (tilt toward chime-trees for subsonic lullaby, curve around upward waterfall). Sensory hierarchy filters through professional priorities (texture of sound: brittle snap, dull thud, shrill buzz). The setting charges the closure image—tiles hum "in approval" as he turns for the next passenger, and the storm glass "stills for a heartbeat, then began to churn" in the presence of new emotional weather.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: transform the passenger's silence from burden to vessel. One meaningful tightening occurs as the woman's fog-dense silence gradually unwound (shoulders drop, fingers loosen, tear escapes, letter no longer a weight). Yet escalation reads passive—the operator's adjustments (lean, weight shift, silence) trigger automatic responses without visible trade-offs or a moment where his choice forecloses another path. The second passenger's rage sets up perpetual recursion rather than a cost paid for the first success.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme—silence as presence, not void—emerges through storm-glass pulses and the operator's calibrated non-intervention rather than stated moral. The final exchange (woman opens mouth, closes it, smiles; he nods) offers a resonant answer without sermon. Backstory (grandmother's lullabies, first weeping passenger) roots the practice in particulars. Yet the closing image of the operator sighing "not with weariness, but readiness" edges toward overt thematic gloss, and the vial's welcoming churn for the next passenger risks tidy symmetry that flattens cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on the operator; distance modulates purposefully (close for storm-glass monitoring, wider for terrace drift). Perceptual signature is consistent—"years of solitude" calibrate his ears, tremors of strangers' breath guide his hands. Diction ("vaulting hush," "fluidly logical unwinding," "subsonic lullaby") stays elevated but voice-motivated by the operator's contemplative profession. The woman's interiority is inferred through body (white knuckles, clenched jaw, loosening fingers) without head-hopping, maintaining clean focalization throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Figurative density is high and mostly coherent (storm glass as emotional barometer, fractured sky shards, inverted waterfall mist), but several beats layer metaphor without advancing pressure: "sky was a vaulting hush" followed by "lingering resonance of a distant train whistle that had faded into the quiet that follows a train whistle's echo" loops the concept. Paraphrase appears: "He didn't speak" / "Still, he said nothing" / "No farewells were needed; the silence between them was already a conversation." Template cadence runs through the storm-glass progression without varying syntax. "Fluidly logical" recurs as descriptor without embodied cost on tactics.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The gondola-as-therapy frame and storm-glass emotional barometer offer a fresh synthesis, and the operator's professional silence practice avoids generic counselor tropes. Yet the core arc—troubled passenger boards, operator monitors and adjusts, passenger departs lighter—follows a familiar service-encounter template. The choice to frame silence as "not absence, but presence; not void, but vessel" and close with the operator turning to the next passenger risks the safety middle: perpetual recursion without definitive transformation or a bold structural risk that heightens stakes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Present early (paragraph 1) and focalized throughout. His choices—unclipping the vial, leaning on the railing, shifting weight to tilt the gondola toward chime-trees—create micro-turns that enable the woman's loosening and shape the final operator-readies-for-next-passenger image. Yet his decisions feel reactive and calibrated rather than high-cost; no moment where his tactic forecloses another passenger need or forces a personal sacrifice beyond perpetual duty.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Storm glass appears in beats spanning first third (introduction), middle (monitoring woman's silence: gold ripples, syrup, gray fog, silver eddies, clear air, faint glow), and closure (final pulse warm/golden/complete, then re-clipped and lifted for next passenger with churning fluid). Its swirling liquid provides immediate causal feedback and charges the ending with "not in warning, but in welcome." Specificity (liquid coiling/uncoiling, responding to emotional barometric pressure) makes it irreplaceable; a generic mood ring would not carry the same fluidly logical authority.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"In transit" frames the premise (gondola ferrying passengers "not to destinations, but through thresholds") and recurs in closure (operator turns craft around, perpetual journey). It constrains tactics—no fixed endpoint allows the operator to modulate drift speed and path—and shapes the woman's arc from clutching a letter to stepping onto the ramp "to wherever she needed to be." Yet transit remains more thematic envelope than a pressure that forces a difficult mid-scene choice; removing it would weaken coherence but not break a key causal link.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Fluidly logical" appears twice as descriptor for the storm glass's swirling patterns and once for the operator's breath-synchronized unwinding of tension. It labels the vial's behavior without constraining a choice or imposing visible cost—any synonym for smooth/systematic would fit. No on-page moment where fluid logic enables a tactic unavailable to a more erratic barometer or forces the operator to sacrifice emotional immediacy for calibrated patience.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Catalyzing stillness" is named as the operator's duty (paragraph 4) and demonstrated through his silence, weight shifts, and breath control that trigger the woman's unwinding. It shapes the middle progression (shoulders drop, fingers loosen, tear escapes) and primes the closure stance (readiness for the next passenger). Swappable phrasing—"facilitating calm" or "inducing quiet"—would require only minor edits, and no moment where catalysis fails or imposes cost beyond perpetual labor.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Monitoring noise levels is signaled early (paragraph 7: "texture of sound: brittle snap, dull thud, shrill buzz") and practiced throughout via storm-glass observation (woman's silence as dense fog, then silver eddies, then clear air). Mechanics shape tactics: the operator's silence and micro-adjustments respond to textural readings rather than decibel counts. It appears in closure as he lifts the glass for the trembling man and the fluid churns in welcome. Irreplaceability is moderate; generic empathy-sensing would serve, but "noise texture" adds professional specificity.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Drifting prism terrace is introduced in the opening line and recurs across beats: iridescent tiles hum when the woman boards, thermal drafts and crystalline geometry enable oar-less glide, tiles hum "in approval" at closure. It supplies the subsonic lullaby resource (chime-trees) and the inverted waterfall that prompts the woman's tear. The terrace's response (harmonic hum, approval hum) suggests agency, charging the operator's return to the boarding arch. Specificity (prism, iridescence, crystalline geometry) elevates it above generic floating platform.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"The quiet that follows a train whistle's echo" appears once in the opening sky description and never returns or tightens a decision window. No countdown, no reference to elapsed duration during the woman's journey, and no moment where fading echo-time pressures the operator's next move. It establishes a post-sound mood but remains ornamental; removing it would not alter the terrace drift's open-ended pacing.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Motivation to teach silence how to comfort is stated (paragraph 24) and demonstrated through the operator's practice: he monitors, adjusts, and withholds speech to let silence take root "not imposed, but invited." Backstory (grandmother's lullabies, first weeping passenger) roots the desire in lived cost. Final image—sighing with readiness, lifting the vial in welcome—dramatizes perpetual commitment. Friction appears as the tension between his grandmother's active lullabies and his own non-intervention, though this opposition stays implicit rather than forcing a peak choice with visible sacrifice.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Vaulting hush" is named in paragraph 2 and reprised in the final line ("The vaulting hush deepened"). Tone coheres—contemplative, hushed diction ("lingering resonance," "subsonic lullaby," "inverted mist"), minimal dialogue, slow-motion gestures—and modulates slightly as the woman's tension unwinds and the operator re-engages for the next passenger. The final deepening charges the image of perpetual work. Yet the tone remains static in register; no moment of sharp urgency or tonal rupture that tests the hush under pressure.</comment>
