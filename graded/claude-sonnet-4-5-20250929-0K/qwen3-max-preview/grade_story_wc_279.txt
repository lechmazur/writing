<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's "socially perceptive nature" is asserted but never dramatized through micro-choices that reveal value hierarchy under pressure. Her interiority leans heavily on aesthetic perception ("lilac unease," "emergent hush") without embodied contradiction or internal conflict acting simultaneously in scene. The final realization—"meaning emerges not when noise ceases, but when we learn to listen through the patterns we ourselves create"—arrives as a pronouncement rather than being earned through a dramatized struggle that forecloses a path with visible cost. The shift from city noise to grotto silence to acceptance of the musician's off-key tune registers as thematic assertion rather than a motivationally grounded alteration.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes who (chalk artist), where (grotto), and when (during the unlearning) by the opening lines, satisfying orientation. Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: sensory density builds toward a pattern-break when the mandala whispers synchronize, then dissolve into recognition. However, the closure unit—her standing, smiling, and later pausing at the street musician—lacks legible cost on the page; the tile flake cracks "softly" and she "didn't mourn its fracture," bypassing rather than foregrounding the price. The cost-proof test fails: no exact sentence shows what she forfeited or what path closed. The ending gestures toward Conceptual Repricing ("meaning isn't found in the fixing of broken things, but in witnessing how they break") but delivers it as meta-commentary rather than a final image that reweights prior stakes with undeniable pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The grotto's mist, limestone scent, and dripping stone anchor the setting vividly and filter through the protagonist's sensory hierarchy (she notices "wet limestone and moss rising like a question mark"). The whispering gallery tile flake functions as a micro-setting object that constrains the mandala's center and triggers the climactic hum, satisfying the 9+ gate criterion. Spatial choreography remains clear (kneeling, finger-tracing, standing, brushing sand from knees). Minor deduction: the rain-on-glass rivulet mandala at the end feels decorative rather than a constraint on her next choice, and the grotto's walls "absorbing sound, then returning it in fractured whispers" is described but never leveraged as a tactical resource during the peak beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—discovering meaning in the mess—is signaled early and sustained. A single meaningful tightening occurs when she places the tile flake at the mandala's center and the whispers synchronize, then dissolve. However, escalation under the Accumulative lens requires a deepening that reweights the stake with cost; here the protagonist's interjection ("by altering the next swirl of her finger, diverting a line, softening an angle") resolves the problem without visible trade-off. The "lilac unease bloomed into something warmer—not peace, not joy, but recognition" describes emotional shift without showing what she renounced or what path closed. No persistent constraint shapes her tactics; the mandala responds cooperatively, and she leaves it "untouched" with no on-page consequence for abandoning it.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The theme—meaning emerges through witnessing pattern rather than fixing broken things—arises from the grotto encounter and mandala work. The tile flake's crack and the street musician's off-key tune offer recurring images that attempt to reweight prior material. However, the final paragraph delivers explicit theme statements ("During the unlearning, she had discovered: meaning isn't found in the fixing of broken things, but in witnessing how they break—and how, sometimes, they sing louder for it") that replace scene pressure with articulated thesis. This thematic echo in the closing lines triggers the anti-pattern penalty for moralizing that supplants earned resonance. The emergent hush concept remains abstract; it never constrains a choice or creates friction between wants and costs on the page.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited throughout with a distinct perceptual signature: the protagonist notices "mist curled like breath," "sound tasted metallic," "lavender-tinted discomfort." Diction is controlled and consistent, matching an artistic sensibility. The narration avoids head-hopping and filter-verb stacks. Minor deduction: under peak stress (when the mandala whispers), the prose does not compress or shift rhythm to reflect urgency; instead it maintains the same lyric register ("Tiny voices, fractured and overlapping, rose from the patterns"). The final image—rain tracing paths down glass—sustains voice but leans toward aesthetic summary rather than charged perception that alters present options.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and paragraph structure modulates purposefully. Clarity is generally high, with no pronoun confusion or tense drift. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "not with words, not with chalk, but through the patterns" recurs in concept as "meaning emerges not when noise ceases, but when we learn to listen through the patterns"; "not fear, not dread, but the soft, lavender-tinted discomfort" and "not peace, not joy, but recognition" use identical "not X, not Y, but Z" scaffolding. The final third contains template cadence ("she passed," "she paused," "she drew," "she sat") and stock openers ("Today, she would," "Outside, the world," "That night, she"). Figurative density is high but several metaphors mix registers: "taste metallic" (synesthetic), "clanging without cadence" (auditory), "viscous with withheld confession" (tactile abstraction). Apply baseline artifact penalty of −0.6 and an additional −0.3 for paraphrase loops, totaling −0.9 in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The premise—chalk artist in a whispering grotto using a sand mandala to process city noise—offers a specific, non-generic synthesis. The emergent hush phenomenon and whispering gallery tile flake provide concrete world detail. However, the emotional arc (overwhelmed by noise → grotto retreat → acceptance of imperfection) follows a familiar contemplative-artist template without a non-obvious moral calculus or lived cost. The transformation test is borderline: swap "chalk artist" for "musician" or "poet" and the beats remain functionally identical. The piece commits to its lyric premise but retreats from risk at closure by delivering thematic summation rather than a final image that challenges or ambiguates the stake.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Setup: present from the opening ("whimsical chalk artist knelt"). Development: her finger-tracing and mandala construction occupy multiple beats. Payoff: she stands, leaves the mandala, and later pauses at the street musician. The character drives all on-page action. However, her choices do not create a key turn that narrows options; the mandala cooperates and she walks away unchanged in capability, only in acceptance. "Whimsical" as a descriptor is mentioned once and does not constrain or enable a visible trade-off. She reads as "contemplative artist" more than "whimsical," and the whimsy label does not shape tactics. Score in the mid-5s for functional presence across beats without causal pressure or irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Setup: the tile flake appears early in the satchel. Development: she places it at the mandala's center where "five spirals converged," triggering the thrum and whisper synchronization. Payoff: "The tile flake cracked softly in the center, its stored echoes spent, its purpose fulfilled." The object enables the climactic beat and its fracture marks the end of the grotto encounter. Two distinct beats (placement, fracture) plus closure linkage. Minor deduction: the tile's "hummed when pressed to her palm" property is mentioned early but never used tactically; she places it without testing or deliberation, and its crack carries no visible consequence for her next choice. Strong integration but not indispensable; a different resonant object could substitute with moderate rewrites.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Setup: "emergent hush" is named and described in the first paragraph. Development: the concept recurs when "The emergent hush deepened—not quieter, but denser" during the mandala beat. Payoff: the final insight claims "Emergent hush wasn't absence—it was potential, the quiet before meaning chooses its shape." However, the concept remains a thematic label rather than a constraint that alters tactics. She does not test it, choose between hush and noise, or pay a price for seeking it. The grotto's acoustic phenomenon is described but never leveraged as a resource or obstacle. Score in the functional-but-replaceable band; "silence" or "stillness" could swap in with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Setup: "Her socially perceptive nature had always let her read crowds like weather maps" is asserted in the opening. Development: no on-page demonstration during the grotto encounter; she is alone. Payoff: "socially perceptive enough now to hear not the flaw, but the yearning beneath" the musician's tune. The trait is invoked twice but never shown through a micro-choice with cost. The grotto scene does not require or test social perception; her perceptual work is sensory and introspective, not interpersonal. The attribute is ornamental to the central conflict. Score in the present-but-replaceable low band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Setup: "she would interject—not with words, not with chalk, but through the patterns in a sand mandala" signals the action early. Development: "She interjected—not aloud, but by altering the next swirl of her finger, diverting a line, softening an angle." Payoff: "The mandala responded. The whispers synchronized, then harmonized." The action drives the climactic beat and is causally linked to the outcome. However, "interject" as a verb is abstract; the physical act is finger-tracing, and the mandala's response is cooperative rather than contested. A more direct action verb (trace, alter, shape) could replace "interject" without loss. Score in the mid-6s for one strong causal beat without irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Setup: "through the patterns in a sand mandala she was now beginning to trace with slow, deliberate sweeps of her hand" introduced early. Development: "Each line was a question; each curve, a hesitation; each intersection, a place where meaning might pool or spill." The mandala's spirals converge at the center where she places the tile. Payoff: the mandala whispers, responds to her interjection, and is left behind to be reclaimed by mist. The method shapes two beats (construction, interjection-response) and its particulars (five spirals, grain rearrangement) matter. Minor deduction: the mandala's mechanics are partly metaphorical ("lines as questions") rather than fully grounded in sand-as-material that constrains her choices. Strong integration with two beats and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Setup: "whispering grotto" named and anchored in the opening. Development: the grotto's "emergent hush" deepens during the mandala beat; mist thickens and the walls absorb/return sound. Payoff: she leaves the grotto, and the mist clings "like a second skin." The setting provides atmosphere and the acoustic phenomenon that frames the whispers, but it does not constrain her choices or supply a resource she must manage. She could perform the mandala work elsewhere with minimal rewrites. The grotto is present across beats and thematically significant but not tactically essential. Score in the mid-6s for coherent atmospheric pressure without irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Setup: "during the unlearning" appears in the opening and recurs in the final paragraph. Development: no beats dramatize what the unlearning is, what rules or habits she is shedding, or how it tightens her decisions. Payoff: "During the unlearning, she had discovered" closes the piece as a time-label rather than a live constraint. The timeframe is asserted but never shown to pressure tactics or create urgency. It reads as world-flavoring rather than a story engine. Score in the functional-but-replaceable low band; "during her retreat" or "during the sabbatical" would serve identically.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Setup: "she sought meaning in the mess" introduced early and linked to her reason for visiting the grotto. Development: "Each line was a question; each curve, a hesitation" dramatizes her search through the mandala work. Payoff: "meaning emerges not when noise ceases, but when we learn to listen through the patterns we ourselves create" and the street-musician moment show acceptance. The motivation drives her actions across beats and evolves from seeking to acceptance. However, no on-page friction between this desire and a competing cost (e.g., time, safety, professional duty) emerges. The motivation is coherent but not conflicted. Score in the mid-6s for clear presence and evolution without felt trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Setup: "lilac unease settling into her bones—not fear, not dread, but the soft, lavender-tinted discomfort of standing at the edge of revelation." Development: "The lilac unease bloomed into something warmer—not peace, not joy, but recognition." Payoff: the tone shifts to calm observation in the final paragraphs (rain, musician). The tone is signaled, modulates with the mandala's resolution, and charges the mid-story turn. However, "lilac" as a descriptor is ornamental; the unease could be "gray" or "copper" without altering the emotional arc. The tone is present and coherent but not irreplaceable. Score in the mid-5s for purposeful modulation without specificity that shapes choice.</comment>
