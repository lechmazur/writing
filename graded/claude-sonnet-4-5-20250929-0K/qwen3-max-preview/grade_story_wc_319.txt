<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The guardian's interiority is concrete and distinctively embodied through physical anchors—swallowing landscapes, frost-shimmer fur, licking frozen cheeks. Interior contradiction appears ("not with patience, but with the hollow ache") and the final choice to offer its paw is motivated by the transmutation arc. However, the epiphany about uncertainty as compass/lens arrives more through poetic assertion than earned dramatic cost; the moment when it "simply waited—patient now, not hollow" tells the shift rather than shows a micro-choice that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with a Resonant Reconfiguration (transmutation of dimensional homesickness into compass/lens). Orientation anchors who and where within the opening lines; the "veil of sleep" timeframe remains soft but acceptable for lyric mode. The closure unit—offering the paw, the garden exhaling, homesickness transmuting—lands on the page with felt emotional cost (loneliness acknowledged, vulnerability accepted). One meaningful deepening occurs when the guardian places the pendant in the statue's hand and the ice "breathes" rather than melts, reweighting prior stakes. Causality is elliptical but legible under the accumulative lens; no breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The frozen garden supplies vivid, selective anchors—frost-laced boughs, mist coiling like serpents, statues caught between curiosity and terror—that are filtered through the guardian's feral POV. Spatial choreography remains coherent across the garden, pendant, statues, and mist. The pendant as micro-object constrains the guardian's vigil and charges the closure when placed in the statue's hand; the garden's "breathing" ice directly shapes the final turn. Sensory selection (licking frozen cheeks, tasting salt and sorrow) reflects urgency and priorities.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—making friends with uncertainty, escaping dimensional homesickness—is signaled early and coheres. The tightening arrives when the guardian presses the pendant to its forehead, boundaries shimmer as invitations rather than walls, and it places the pendant in the statue's hand; the statue's eyes opening and asking "Friend?" is a meaningful reversal that narrows options (companionship now possible, exile status shifted). The final act of offering its paw to a new traveler forecloses the old hollow waiting with visible emotional cost (vulnerability, trust required). One clean escalation under the accumulative lens with agency-driven closure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme—presence without witness, loneliness as shared shape, boundaries as membranes rather than walls—emerges organically from the guardian's actions and the pendant's function. The final image (uncertainty as lantern, the mist almost smiling, friendship in shared silence) offers a resonant, non-literal answer without stating a moral. The pendant's dual role (cultist's loneliness carved into silver, recognized by the guardian) deepens thematic layering. One slip: "dimensional homesickness...transmuted. No longer a wound, but a compass" edges into overt thematic statement, though the surrounding imagery rescues it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited through the guardian's feral consciousness; perceptual signature is distinctive (tasting static and snow, swallowing landscapes, licking frozen cheeks). Diction stays consistent with the voice—archaic, sensory, mythic—without unmotivated register drift. The single line of dialogue ("Friend?") serves purpose and emerges naturally from the statue's awakening. Free indirect style is clean. Psychic distance modulates intentionally, tightening during the pendant-pressing moment and expanding during reflective passages. No head-hopping; focalization is controlled.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings diversify; figurative language is dense but mostly coherent. However, several beats stack metaphors without clear vehicle logic: "boundaries of light" are edges "sharper than any blade—and softer than any sigh," then "membranes," then "gradients"—mixed vehicles that blur rather than clarify. Minor paraphrase loop: "It didn't know if they heard. It didn't need them to" restates the same stance without added pressure. The elevated diction ("foggy lucidity," "interiorizing exteriors") is voice-consistent but occasionally slows momentum in peak beats. Information density is high overall; no major scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The feral library guardian and the cultist's pendant offer a fresh synthesis; the premise (dimensionally exiled creature guarding thresholds in a frozen liminal space) is specific and non-obvious. The emotional arc—transmuting homesickness into companionship—feels earned in hindsight through the pendant-recognition beat. However, the "interiorizing exteriors" conceit and several thematic phrases ("foggy lucidity," "boundaries of light") read as prompt-adjacent abstractions rather than fully transformed particulars. The final turn (offering the paw, mist as smile) is genuinely moving and avoids the safety middle.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The guardian's choices—waiting beneath the boughs, pressing the pendant to its forehead, placing it in the statue's hand, offering its paw—create the story's key turns. Present throughout; drives at least three beats; decision to place the pendant enables the statue's awakening and the garden's transformation. The final paw-offering choice forecloses the exile stance with visible cost (vulnerability accepted). Removing this character would collapse the story.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The pendant appears in opening, middle (pressed to forehead, glyphs seeping into thoughts, boundaries shimmering), and closure (placed in statue's hand, pulsing gently). It enables the statue's awakening and the guardian's transformation. Its meaning evolves from stolen thresholds to recognized loneliness to shared companionship. Handled physically across multiple beats; its mechanics (sigils glowing with plea, not power) shape tactics. Strong causal role and closure linkage; irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Boundaries of light" frames the story early ("stitch the boundaries of light into a cloak") and returns at the midpoint turn ("boundaries of light began to shimmer—not as walls, but as membranes") where it enables the statue's awakening. The concept shapes the tactic of pressing the pendant and the resulting invitation-shift. However, it also functions as thematic echo without concrete action stakes in several mentions; the concept is more resonant than mechanically integrated. Two-gate plus lyric reprise; mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dimensional homesickness is signaled early ("longed for the scent of warm ink and the rustle of turning pages") and constrains the guardian's vigil throughout. The trait motivates the interiorizing-exteriors action (swallowing landscapes to keep them from vanishing) and drives the final transmutation when homesickness becomes compass rather than wound. The cost—loneliness, hollow ache—is visible on the page and shapes the decision to place the pendant. Essential to the arc; the story would lose coherence without it.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Waiting is the story's spine: "it waited—not with patience, but with the hollow ache"; "it simply waited...until the fear became curiosity"; the entire middle hinges on waiting with the pendant's plea. The final turn redefines waiting from hollow to patient, enabling the paw-offering closure. The action is irreplaceable—swapping it would require a complete structural rewrite. Drives three major beats and the thematic resolution; the cost (endurance, vulnerability) is felt throughout.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Interiorizing exteriors" is named explicitly mid-story and demonstrated through the swallowing-landscapes passage (deserts, cathedrals, oceans, the frozen garden). It constrains the guardian's response to loss and shapes the tactic of tucking geometry beneath ribs. However, its mechanics are more poetic assertion than dramatized method; the concept does not alter a specific middle choice with visible friction. Present across two beats (mid-story swallowing, final reflection on presence without witness); lyric reprise reweights the stake but without concrete cost tied to the method itself.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The frozen garden pressures every beat: frost on fur, mist coiling and muttering, statues of librarians as obstacles/companions, the pendant's warmth contrasting the cold. The setting supplies the statue (resource for the pendant-placement turn) and the mist (shifts from reluctant serpents to question marks to almost-smile, charging the closure). Spatial details (boughs, ankles, frozen cheeks) ground action. Removing the garden would collapse the story's logic and atmosphere; essential across setup, development, and payoff.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Through the veil of sleep" appears in the opening (pendant whispering through it) and recurs once mid-story ("Through the veil of sleep, it dreamed of shelves"). The timeframe signals liminality but does not tighten decisions or create urgency; the guardian's waiting is indefinite, and no clock pressures tactics. The phrase reweights the dream/waking contrast thematically but lacks causal force. Two touches; lyric coherence; replaceable with "in the liminal space" without structural loss. Mid-low band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The motivation to make friends with uncertainty is signaled early ("to make friends with uncertainty—to let the mist settle in its bones") and drives the guardian's refusal to demand clarity. It shapes the middle choice to wait with the pendant's plea and the final paw-offering to the traveler (accepting fear-to-curiosity rather than forcing certainty). The cost—endurance of hollow ache, vulnerability—is dramatized. Friction between the want (companionship) and the method (accepting uncertainty) is visible. Essential to closure; irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Foggy lucidity is established early through diction ("mist coiled," "half-languages that dissolved before meaning") and sustained across turns. The tone modulates coherently: hollow ache → pendant's plea → boundaries shimmer → mist curls into smile. The final image (uncertainty as lantern, shared silence) charges the tone with warmth without breaking the fog/clarity tension. Cohesive through pressure; the tone is voice-specific and integral to the ending's resonance. Strong execution; one step below indispensable due to slight late tonal drift toward sentimentality ("something almost like a smile").</comment>
