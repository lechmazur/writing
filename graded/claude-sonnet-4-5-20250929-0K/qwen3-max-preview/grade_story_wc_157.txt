<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The rogue scholar's interior is largely absent; we see her actions but rarely her contradictory impulses under pressure. Dr. Vex's hesitation over the lullaby phrase offers a brief moment of internal conflict, but the protagonist remains opaque throughout. The motivation to "stand guard over her own spark" is asserted rather than dramatized through on-page micro-choices that reveal competing values with visible cost. The ending distributes agency across a collective ("others stood with her") rather than focusing on the protagonist's earned transformation or renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The piece establishes a Situational lens (pressure from the surveillance state forces stance crystallization) but delivers closure as diffuse social change rather than a single crystallized moment with on-page cost. The gourd seed is planted, Dr. Vex becomes an ally, and the piece leaps to a future where "the Bureau finally noticed"—but that noticing happens off-page, summarized rather than dramatized. The Cost Proof Test fails: no exact sentence in the final beat shows the protagonist paying a visible price or foreclosing a path. Orientation anchors (greenhouse, tax regime, protagonist role) arrive clearly within the first 120 words, waiving that penalty.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The greenhouse provides vivid sensory detail (damp moss tiles, humid air, hanging wasp nests, surveillance moths on brass fittings) and the environment does constrain tactics—she must disguise her work as horticulture to evade drones. The gourd vine's visual sonnet "readable only at dawn when dew caught the angles" is a micro-setting detail that charges meaning. However, spatial choreography becomes vague in the final third when "neighbors" and "a child" appear without clear proximity or movement, and the leap to "the steps of power" loses concrete grounding.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake (linguistic rebellion against the thought-tax regime) is signaled early but never truly tightens on the page. Dr. Vex's decision not to stop her is a micro turn, but it costs him nothing visible and alters no later tactic. The piece summarizes escalation ("By week's end, the gourd vine spiraled") rather than dramatizing a moment where the protagonist's choice narrows options or raises cost. The ending distributes success across a collective without showing the protagonist's agency driving the final reversal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Theme (resistance through preservation of language and thought) emerges organically from the greenhouse setting and the gourd-as-transmitter conceit. The image of "planting defiance in rows, broadcasting silence in syntax" works without explicit moralizing. However, "the spark wasn't hers alone anymore—it was a garden" tips into thematic summary in the penultimate paragraph, and the final vision of children singing old lullabies resolves into a tidy, declarative future rather than a resonant present-tense image that leaves ambiguity intact.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is mostly stable but leaks into omniscient summary when the text declares what "the Bureau's compliance drones" saw or what will happen "when the Bureau finally noticed." The phrase "candidly cryptic" recurs as a label without perceptual grounding. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("converging chaos of a hundred small rebellions disguised as horticulture") that clashes with the concrete action of watering plants. Dr. Vex's interiority is briefly accessed mid-scene without a clear section break, creating a minor POV wobble.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Scaffold and loops are pervasive: "candidly cryptic" appears three times as a tonal label; "the gourd rattle seed" is restated in full across multiple paragraphs; "stand guard over her spark" recurs without variation. The phrase "converging chaos" appears in the opening and closing without functional escalation. Figurative density is high throughout ("cathedral of chitinous observation," "visual sonnet," "broadcasting silence in syntax") without pattern-teaching or payoff, triggering the overwriting penalty. Template cadence appears in the final third: "Through the children... Through the librarians... Through the rogue scholar." Applying −0.8 for loops, −0.4 for template cadence, and −0.3 for elevated register drift at peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The premise (thought-taxation, secret language club, botanical messaging) synthesizes familiar dystopian elements with a fresh horticultural angle. The gourd-as-sonic-transmitter is specific and non-obvious. However, the core conflict (covert resistance via mandated community service) follows a well-worn template, and the resolution (collective awakening, children singing in the streets) echoes stock endings from the genre without a distinctive twist. The piece commits fully to its premise but does not transform it through unexpected moral calculus or a non-obvious turn.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The rogue scholar plants the seed, hums a lullaby, and adjusts irrigation—but these actions do not create key turns. Dr. Vex's decision not to stop her is the only on-page reversal, and it is his choice, not hers. Her choices are present but do not narrow options or raise stakes in dramatized beats.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The gourd rattle seed is planted at Plot Gamma, grows into a vine by week's end, and is envisioned rattling at the Bureau archive—three beats. It shapes the protagonist's mission and recurs with reweighted meaning (from seed to transmitter). However, the final rattle is projected future action, not on-page dramatization, preventing higher scoring.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>The secret language club is mentioned in backstory ("She'd joined... at sixteen") and again in the signal gesture ("the club's signal"), but it does not shape on-page tactics or choices in dramatized beats. It functions as thematic backdrop rather than active stake.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Candidly cryptic" is repeated as a label three times but never constrains an on-page action with visible cost. It is descriptive flavor, not a trait that enables or forecloses a choice under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Warp" appears in "warping the sanctioned garden plots into message patterns" and again in "the quiet warp of meaning taking root." The vine's spiral is described as purposeful geometry, but the mechanics of warping are not dramatized—no on-page beat shows her adjusting, correcting, or risking detection to achieve the warp. It shapes one major beat (the planting) but is summarized rather than enacted.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Joining the community garden under the Mental Compliance Act is signaled early as cover; the method (planting message patterns) is enacted when she shapes the vine into a visual sonnet. It appears in setup, middle (shaping tendrils into glyphs), and ending (the collective planting defiance). However, the mechanics are described rather than dramatized in high-pressure moments.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The entomologist's greenhouse provides cover, surveillance moths as obstacles, and humidity dials that Dr. Vex adjusts to favor gourd growth—an on-page choice that alters tactics. The setting's dual function (observation cathedral and rebellion site) is essential across multiple beats and charges the ending image of "the greenhouse thrummed."</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The timeframe "after thoughts became taxable" is referenced in the opening and shapes the Bureau's surveillance apparatus, but it does not tighten decisions on the page. The "Hour of Silent Compliance" is mentioned once as a future target but does not constrain present tactics or create urgency.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The motivation "to stand guard over your own spark of defiance" is stated explicitly in one paragraph and echoed in the ending, but it is not dramatized through conflicted on-page choices. We are told she has smuggled verbs since sixteen, but we do not see competing wants or costs in the present action.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Converging chaos" appears in the opening ("converging chaos of winged things and whispering vines") and the ending ("converging chaos of a hundred small rebellions"), framing the piece. The tone modulates from covert tension to collective hope, but the phrase itself is used identically, limiting its reweighting effect. It charges the frame but does not escalate under pressure.</comment>
