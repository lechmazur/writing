<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation is clear and embodied through ritual action, but her arc lacks genuine internal contradiction—she moves through practiced gestures without facing a meaningful choice that forces trade-offs. The visitor's recognition moment ("exactly how I felt") lands cleanly, yet the scatterer herself never risks anything; her final seat in the motionless chair reads as thematic tableau rather than earned stance crystallization. Interiority is consistently filtered through porcelain-mask imagery and art-ritual language, but the lack of on-page pressure that tests her method or belief keeps this in strong-but-safe territory. The piece delivers a character portrait without compelling her to choose between competing goods.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story teaches an Accumulative/Textural lens through ritual cadence and returns to the rocking chair and mask motifs, but closure lacks visible cost—the final image (sitting motionless, eyes closed, "truth… gloriously, somberly real") asserts rather than demonstrates a felt price. The patron's cathartic departure and the scatterer's unchanged stance suggest Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis), yet no live option is foreclosed on the page; she performs the same ritual with the same conviction. Orientation is clean (who/where/when by paragraph one). The piece coheres under its chosen lens but the ending reweights meaning primarily through assertion ("mirage of safety fades") rather than a concrete image or action that makes cost undeniable.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The gallery, rocking chair, and porcelain mask function as micro-setting that charges the ritual and final image; the chair's stopping marks the beat transition into the scattering, and the mask's "seams where shards were glued" reinforces brokenness-as-revelation. Sensory detail is vivid and selective (bare feet whispering, powder settling like snowfall, candle flame trembling), filtered through art-ritual idiom. Spatial choreography is clear throughout. The setting shapes atmosphere and grounds the character's symbolic work but does not constrain a plot choice or alter tactics under external pressure, keeping this shy of the 8+ band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—to crystallize fleeting emotion through ritual—is signaled early and sustained, but the narrative presents no meaningful tightening or opposition; the scatterer performs her method without friction, the patron arrives and affirms it, and the ritual succeeds as designed. The chair's stopping functions as a timeframe cue rather than escalation. Agency is present (lighting the candle, choosing to sit) but these are confirmations, not choices that narrow options or incur visible trade-offs. Under the Accumulative lens, one deepening or cadence shift that reweights the stake is expected; here the ending repeats the opening's somber-marvel tone without a felt turn.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme (truth/brokenness versus the mirage of safety) emerges organically from the mask's construction, the ash-scattering ritual, and the gallery's "no windows" metaphor. The final image—sitting motionless, eyes closed, mirage fading—offers a resonant non-literal answer without overt moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture (touching the mask, not removing it) and the patron's wordless recognition. The piece resists tidy resolution and earns reflective weight through its ritual particulars. However, the thematic assertion in the closing lines ("What remains is truth—carefully woven, imperfectly held, gloriously, somberly real") borders on direct statement, slightly undercutting the earned-image standard for 8+.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with controlled psychic distance and a distinct art-ritual idiom ("voice curled around corners like smoke," "truth… sifted like pigment"). The perceptual signature is character-specific, filtering through porcelain and charcoal. Brief dialogue is purposeful and carries subtext. Sentence rhythm modulates well across reflective and action beats. The visitor's interiority ("not from sorrow, but recognition") momentarily slips psychic distance without clear free-indirect anchoring, and the final paragraph's elevated register ("gloriously, somberly real") drifts slightly above the established voice under peak emotional weight. These are minor slips that do not obscure clarity but prevent entry to 8+.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Prose is rhythmically controlled with varied syntax and vivid sensory anchors ("powder settles like snowfall on charcoal, clinging to the ridges of cheekbones"). Information density is high; most sentences advance image or character. However, the piece carries noticeable paraphrase loops: "She does not paint completion. She paints absence" immediately restates in the following dash-clause list; "The mirage of safety fades. What remains is truth" in the final paragraph loops the core assertion. Template cadence appears in the middle section ("She does not turn… She replies… She allows it"). The closing paragraph stacks abstract summaries ("carefully woven, imperfectly held, gloriously, somberly real") that reduce concrete propulsion at closure. Baseline deduction −0.8 in Q7 for loops and scaffold touching the ending.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The ash-scatterer premise and porcelain-shard mask offer a fresh synthesis of art-ritual and emotional archaeology, avoiding stock gallery-artist tropes. The method (incomplete information, powdered emotion) is specific and non-obvious. However, the piece plays safely within its established frame—no risk-taking structural choice or turn that challenges the protagonist's method or worldview. The visitor's affirmation and the scatterer's unchanged ritual leave the story feeling like a well-executed character vignette rather than a narrative that follows its premise into uncomfortable territory. The ending tableau is resonant but predictable given the opening's setup.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The scatterer is present throughout and her actions (drawing powder, scattering it, lighting a candle, sitting in the chair) drive the ritual sequence. However, these are procedural moves within an established practice; she makes no on-page choice that alters tactics or forecloses a path under pressure. Setup clear, closure participation present (she sits in the chair), but no causal turn created by a decision. Functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The mask appears in paragraph one (setup), is touched in reflection mid-story (development beat noting its construction and seams), and returns in the penultimate paragraph where she "touches her porcelain mask, feeling the seams… does not remove it" (closure participation). The mask's meaning—brokenness remade, truth sharp enough to cut—remains consistent rather than reweighted. Payoff is present but the element does not constrain a choice or visibly charge the final cost; it functions as thematic emblem. All three gates met, so eligible for 6+, but integration is symbolic rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The concept ("mirage of safety") is named explicitly in paragraph three and returned to in the final lines ("The mirage of safety fades"). It frames the thematic question (padded walls vs. honest brokenness) and informs the scatterer's stance, but does not shape an on-page tactic or choice under pressure—she already lives outside the mirage and the visitor's arrival does not test that stance. Setup and closure participation present; middle development absent. Lyric reprise reweights meaning but lacks mid-story causal work.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Weaves truth carefully" is stated in paragraph one and echoed in the closing line ("truth—carefully woven"), but the trait is label-only; no on-page moment shows her choosing between careful truth and a riskier disclosure, or paying a cost for that care. The visitor interaction proceeds smoothly without the attribute constraining or enabling a difficult beat. Ornamental mention without visible tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Powder" (the ash from unsent letters) is introduced early, drives the central ritual beat (scattering over the portrait), and the lit candle makes "the powdered emotion shimmer" in the closure image. The action is specific, irreplaceable (the story's ritual logic depends on it), and shapes two distinct beats (the scattering and the final shimmer). Causal pressure is moderate—it enacts her method but does not narrow options under opposition. Strong integration across setup, development, and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Through incomplete information" is named in paragraph three and demonstrated via the half-rendered portrait ("eyes still hollow, mouth caught between grief and relief"). The method is explained and shown in the scattering beat but does not evolve or face a test—the visitor's recognition affirms it without complication. Setup and development present; closure participation weak (the method is not visibly reweighted or challenged in the ending image). Functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The "vanishing point gallery" is anchored in the opening line, houses the ritual (the farthest alcove, the rocking chair), and the closing paragraph notes "the gallery breathes again" after the visitor leaves. The space frames the ritual and provides the rocking chair and portrait as props, but does not constrain a choice—there is no external pressure tied to the gallery's physical properties or social context. Setup, development (alcove as ritual site), and closure participation all present; causal pressure modest. Micro-setting (chair, candle, portrait alcove) does more work than the gallery itself.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The rocking chair's slowing to a stop is signaled in paragraph two ("as the chair finally slows to a stop") and marks the transition into the scattering ritual; the chair is described as "utterly still" later and the scatterer sits in it "motionless now, but not empty" in the closing beat. The timeframe cues the ritual's beginning and ending tableau but does not tighten decisions—no live clock alters tactics. Setup, development (the stop triggers the ritual), and closure participation (sitting in the still chair) all present. Thematic weight (stillness vs. motion, facing silence) charges the final image. Integration is strong for resonance, moderate for pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The motivation ("to crystallize a fleeting emotion before it evaporates") is stated in paragraph three and dramatized through the scattering ritual and the visitor's recognition. The scatterer's actions are goal-driven (drawing the vial, scattering powder, lighting the candle) and the visitor's tears show the motive succeeding. However, the motive is never conflicted on the page—no friction between the desire to crystallize and a competing want or cost. Setup, development, and closure participation present; causal pressure and internal friction modest. The motive unifies the arc but does not force a trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Somber marvel" is coherent from the opening's "silent gallery… walls lined with canvases that seemed to breathe" through the scattering ritual's "sacred" tactility to the closing candle flame "trembling but unbroken." Tone modulates subtly (the visitor's tears briefly warm the somber register; the final "gloriously, somberly real" reasserts it) and charges the ending image without becoming static. Diction ("whispering," "settling dust," "shimmers") sustains the tone across pressure beats. Strong integration; tone is purposeful and elevates closure resonance.</comment>
