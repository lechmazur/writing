<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The veiled dreamer remains abstract throughout; her choices (reaching for glyphs, documenting) feel choreographed rather than internally motivated. Interiority consists of atmospheric description rather than contradictory impulses under pressure. The confidence man's watch provides a mechanical guide, but no genuine stakes or fear constrains her movement through the library. The final transformation into "the archive" is asserted without embodied cost or renunciation earned through prior choices.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Orientation Test: who/where/when anchors arrive by the opening paragraph (pass). However, the drive lens remains ambiguous—oscillating between Accumulative/Textural (mist patterns, glyph collection) and Causal (the quest structure)—and never stabilizes. The ending claims a transformation ("She became the archive") but offers no on-page Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost, or Conceptual Repricing; the mirror-crack and mist-fold are gestural rather than definitive. The recursion reveal is told as explanation rather than dramatized through a choice that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The glowing library, mist, and cyclically reversed stacks are vividly rendered with strong sensory specificity (bergamot and rain, warm book covers, floating punctuation). However, these details function primarily as atmosphere; the environment does not meaningfully constrain her choices or force tactical adaptation. The mirror at the lectern charges the final image moderately, but spatial choreography grows vague in the inner sanctum sequence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding the library of unspoken words—is signaled early but never tested by opposition or cost. The watch guides her without friction, shelves rearrange obligingly, and every discovery succeeds. No reversal narrows options; the "propagation delays" mechanic is described but does not force a trade-off or alter her tactics. The ending's recursion twist is conceptual but carries no felt price—she "becomes the archive" without forfeiting a live option or enduring visible loss.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Theme of unspoken words and cyclical recursion emerges through images (glyphs, mirror, archive), but the ending states the thesis overtly: "the library of unspoken words was not a destination, but a recursion." The mirror sequence offers subtext, yet the final paragraph moralizes the recursion concept rather than allowing it to resonate through a non-literal image. Depth is present but undercut by explanation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The voice carries a distinct, elevated register ("cautious exuberance," "propagation delays," "unfolding cipher") that remains consistent and purposeful. However, the prose frequently tilts into abstraction ("negative space between them," "spectral phrase") that distances the reader from embodied experience. POV distance is stable third-limited, and no head-hopping occurs. Dialogue is absent (appropriately), so those bullets do not apply.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Rhythmic variety is present, but the piece suffers from paraphrase loops: "She'd stolen it…now, it pulsed warm" repeats watch information; "She understood then" signals an insight immediately explained in the next sentence. Template cadence appears in the glyph-documentation beats ("She reached…She documented…She lifted"). Figurative density is high throughout without pattern-teaching ("mist coiled into grammatical structures," "punctuation marks floated like fireflies"), which obscures rather than sharpens peak moments. The overwriting and scaffold penalties accumulate to approximately −1.2 in this category.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The premise—a recursive library of unspoken words accessed via a stolen confidence man's watch—combines intriguing elements, but the execution follows a familiar template: seeker enters mystical archive, collects symbolic tokens, discovers herself as part of the cycle. The "becoming the archive" twist is a known motif in metafictional library narratives. No fresh inflection or surprising synthesis arises; the recursion reveal is foreshadowed heavily and lands as anticipated.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The veiled dreamer is present throughout and performs key actions (stealing the watch, entering the library, documenting glyphs, pressing the stylus to the mirror). However, her choices do not create turns; she follows the watch's guidance and the library's offerings without meaningful friction or decision cost. Setup and development gates are met; closure participation is weak (she "becomes the archive" but this is asserted rather than chosen). Swappable with another seeker archetype. Band: functional but replaceable, no causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The confidence man's watch appears in beat one (stolen backstory), beat two (ticking against her wrist, spinning counterclockwise near truth), beat four (stuttering at "Regrets Never Voiced"), beat six (spinning wildly at the bergamot scent), and beat seven (silent, hands fused at midnight in the inner sanctum). Setup, development, and payoff gates all met. It constrains her navigation (truth/deception signals) and its final silence marks a threshold. However, it does not drive a key turn—she proceeds regardless of its state—and could be replaced with another mystical compass without breaking the plot. Strong beat involvement but moderate causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The "unfolding cipher" is named repeatedly (air shimmers "with the unfolding cipher of withheld confessions," archway runes "another unfolding cipher") but remains ornamental. It does not shape tactics or alter her method of documentation; glyphs simply bloom when she reaches. Setup gate met (early mention), but no middle development constraint and no closure participation beyond thematic echo. Swappable with "hidden code" or "secret language." Band: present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Cyclically reversed" is introduced early (stacks reappear ahead, rewritten) and paid off at closure (recursion loop, "each arrival rewriting the path for the next"). However, the attribute does not constrain an on-page action with cost; it is described as a property of the library rather than forcing her to retrace steps or abandon a path. Setup and payoff gates met; development gate weak. The recursion concept charges the ending moderately but could be achieved through other looping mechanics. Band: shapes the ending's meaning but does not narrow tactics.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Document" is the protagonist's core action: she carries a bone stylus, etches glyphs onto her forearm from her pulse, records sensations and phrases throughout, and presses the stylus to the mirror at closure. Setup, development, and payoff gates all strongly met. The act of documenting "ripples backward through the stacks, rearranging prior discoveries," which is a meaningful mechanic, and the final documentation ("a silence shaped like acceptance") triggers the mirror's crack and her transformation. However, the documentation does not face opposition or cost until the very end, and the ripple mechanic is told rather than shown constraining her choices. Band: essential across beats and drives the ending image, but causal pressure is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Propagation delays" is introduced early ("a place governed by propagation delays, where cause trailed effect") and mentioned again mid-story ("understanding unfolded…recursively"). However, the mechanic is described rather than dramatized; it does not visibly alter her tactics or force her to adapt her method. Setup gate met; development and payoff gates weak—it remains a thematic label rather than a functional constraint. Swappable with "temporal loops" or "recursive echoes." Band: functional but replaceable, no on-page causal work.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The "glowing library in mist" is vividly present from the opening line and anchors every beat: mist thickens into sentences, shelves curve like vertebrae, the library rearranges with a sigh, the inner sanctum holds the lectern and mirror. Setup, development, and payoff gates all met. The library actively responds to her actions (mist coils into grammatical structures when she reaches, the library folds around her at closure), and the setting's recursive nature is integral to the ending's transformation. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage; irreplaceable. Minor deduction for the setting's rules being told rather than discovered through friction.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Between two fateful letters" is introduced in paragraph seven (one dispatched to her mentor, one unsent to the confidence man) but never returns or constrains her actions. The letters do not create urgency, deadlines, or tactical choices; they exist as backstory flavor. Setup gate barely met (late first appearance, ~40% mark); development and payoff gates missing. Swappable with any other framing device. Band: present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The motivation "to find the library of unspoken words" is stated early ("She had come not for books, but for the library of unspoken words") and sustained throughout her quest. Setup and development gates met. However, the desire is never conflicted or tested—she encounters no barrier, temptation to turn back, or cost that forces her to weigh whether the library is worth the price. Payoff gate met (she finds and becomes the archive), but without on-page friction between want and cost. Band: shapes the journey but lacks dramatized conflict.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Cautious exuberance" is explicitly named ("the tone of her search was cautious exuberance") and appears again at closure ("with cautious exuberance" in the final paragraph). The tone is present in her approach—risk acknowledged, spirit soaring—but remains static; it does not modulate meaningfully under pressure or charge the final image with emotional complexity. Setup and payoff gates met via direct statement; development gate weak (the tone is told rather than shown shifting). The final reprise reweights the dominant stake moderately by framing the recursion as perpetual optimism. Band: coherent but static, lyric reprise lifts it slightly.</comment>
