<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The vine dresser's motivation is clear and consistent—she refuses metrics to prove reciprocity—and her actions align with this throughout. Interiority is concrete and character-particular ("gardens know their gardeners" drives every choice), with embodied emotion in polishing rituals and the laugh when her wrist-band twitches. The final stance is earned by prior causality and forecloses the path of compliance with visible cost (rejecting the intern's demand). Minor slip: the intern interaction feels slightly thin as a pressure test, more symbolic than urgent.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands on the page as Earned Stasis—she refuses compliance, the garden "consents," fireflies spiral in recognition—with felt cost (isolation, bureaucratic opposition). Orientation anchors who/where/when early (vine dresser, garden maze, post-luck-measurement era). The accumulative lens holds: density increases through polished marbles, each commemorating a victory, culminating in the altar moment and firefly response that reweights the premise. One meaningful deepening occurs when she refuses the intern and the garden answers, crystallizing reciprocity versus measurement.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The garden maze constrains choice throughout: wild spirals pressure her defiance, the altar of river stones anchors her ritual, and the canopy parting to light the marbles charges the closure. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful (damp earth, jasmine shiver, firefly spirals). Spatial choreography is clean; micro-setting (marbles, altar, vine) functions as setting by constraining her choices and charging the final image. Minor issue: the broader world (actuaries, botanists, drones) remains sketched rather than textured, though this fits the length.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—proving gardens know their gardeners—is signaled early and drives all choices. One meaningful tightening occurs when the intern demands replanting; her refusal forecloses compliance with visible cost (bureaucratic resistance, isolation). Agency is renunciation with on-page cost ("the garden doesn't comply. It consents") that narrows options. The garden's firefly response and her seated acceptance at the altar constitute a resonant reconfiguration. Under the accumulative lens, pressure coheres and tightens; coincidence does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme—reciprocity versus measurement—emerges organically from marbles, ritual, and the garden's response without stated morals. The final image (fireflies spiraling, marbles glowing, "a vine curling gently around her ankle like a question mark made flesh") offers a resonant, non-literal answer grounded in particulars. Subtext operates in gesture (polishing cracks, golden resin), silence (ignoring petitions), and the garden's shiver. The "mended deception" concept (frost/wisteria) integrates thematically. Minor slip: "commemorating small victories elaborately" occasionally edges toward prompt-echo phrasing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with tight focalization; perceptual signature is character-specific (she sees testimony where others see entropy). Diction matches her voice ("dry sound like seedpods cracking") and remains consistent under pressure. The intern's brief dialogue serves clarity without convergence. Purposeful compression in the firefly spirals and final breath fits the accumulative lens. Minor issue: a few elevated constructions ("counter-narrative to the empire of metrics") drift slightly above her earthy idiom, though they remain legible and purposeful.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings and paragraph lengths create visual rhythm. Information density is high (each marble touch advances character and theme). Clarity and momentum are strong through the altar scene. Overwriting friction: figurative language appears densely in some beats ("organic rebellion," "pages," "vein of gold," "question mark made flesh") without always earning the load; the final paragraph stacks metaphors (glowing, veins of gold, breathing, blooming/withering sigh) that blur rather than sharpen. Apply −0.5 for density and coherence drift in peak beats. No loops or scaffold detected.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The premise—proving garden reciprocity against metrics—offers a fresh angle on nature-versus-technology material through the marbles and ritual. Emotional specificity (polishing cracks, golden resin, whispered lullabies) grounds the theme. The firefly spirals mirroring her collection provide a non-obvious synthesis. Risk-taking in the accumulative structure and quiet ending heightens stakes. Friction: the setup (actuaries, drones, probability bands) leans on familiar cli-fi/solarpunk tropes without deep transformation; the intern serves as a stock foil. Proximity check passes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The vine dresser's choices create key turns: polishing marbles drives the first half, refusing the intern's demand drives the climax, and sitting at the altar shapes closure. Setup early, involved in three distinct beats, causally essential, and linked to closure (fireflies answer her). Irreplaceable; her specific pragmatic wisdom constrains tactics throughout. Cost is visible (isolation, defiance). Score: early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage +1.5, specificity +0.6, cost +0.5 = baseline 3.0 + 5.8 = 8.8, rounded to 7.8 per grading scale.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Marbles appear in setup (polishing begins paragraph two), middle (deep-blue sphere, moss-green orb split and glued), and closure (glittering in light, glowing faintly). Handled physically across three beats; each crack traces a triumph, evolving from commemoration to proof of reciprocity. Charged reprise: fireflies mirror the marble collection at the end, reweighting meaning. Irreplaceable; removing them breaks the ritual and closure logic. Cost tied directly (altar placement, defiance). Score: early +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal +1.3, closure +1.6, specificity +0.7, cost +0.5 = 9.2, rounded to 8.2.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Mended deception" appears mid-story in the wisteria anecdote (frost pretending death, she pretending indifference). It reframes the marbles' golden resin repair and thematically supports reciprocity through mutual masquerade. Present in ending reflection ("each crack a story mended, not hidden"). Shapes one beat and charges theme, but does not constrain tactics or alter options on the page. Score: setup late −0.3, one beat +0.4, thematic charge +0.8, closure linkage (oblique) +0.9, specificity +0.5 = 5.3, rounded to 5.8 after adjustments.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Wisely pragmatic" appears early ("moved with a wisely pragmatic rhythm—no flourish, no waste") and constrains her choices: she ignores petitions, refuses probability bands, polishes methodically. The trait enables her endurance against bureaucracy and shapes her refusal of the intern. Cost is visible (isolation). Label-only mention in opener −0.3, but the trait drives action throughout. Score: early +0.6, two beats +0.9, causal +1.1, closure link +0.8, cost +0.4, label friction −0.3 = 6.2, rounded to 6.4.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Polishing drives the opening, anchors the ritual across multiple marbles (deep-blue, moss-green), and frames her method. It enables the commemorative act that defines her stance against metrics. The final image (marbles glowing) depends on prior polishing. Major turns trace to this action (altar placement, intern refusal). Irreplaceable; swapping to another action breaks the marble logic. Score: early +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal +1.4, closure +1.4, specificity +0.7 = 8.6, rounded to 7.6 per grading scale.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Commemorating small victories elaborately" is signaled early (paragraph three) and shapes her method throughout: polishing each marble slowly, murmuring to jasmine, altar placement. It drives the ritual structure and final image (marbles as testimony). Mechanics matter: each groove traces a triumph, resin repairs the split orb. Present in closure (fireflies commemorating her). Score: early +0.7, two beats +0.9, causal +1.0, closure +1.2, specificity +0.6, cost +0.3 = 7.7, rounded to 6.7 per grading scale after adjustments.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The garden maze pressures choices throughout: wild spirals defy symmetry, vines knot paths, the altar anchors her ritual, and the canopy parts to light marbles. It supplies resources (jasmine, wisteria, fireflies) that answer her at closure. Micro-setting (altar, vine curling around ankle) constrains and charges the final image. Irreplaceable; the maze's organic rebellion mirrors her defiance. Score: early +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal +1.5, closure +1.7, specificity +0.8 = 9.1, rounded to 7.9 per grading scale.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"After luck becomes measurable" frames the world (actuaries, probability bands, drones) and motivates her defiance. It tightens stakes by establishing the bureaucratic opposition (botanist petitions, intern demand). Present in setup and ending reflection ("empire of metrics"). Does not track a live clock or alter tactics beat-by-beat; functions as premise rather than tactical pressure. Score: setup +0.6, one beat +0.4, causal (premise) +0.7, closure (oblique) +0.6 = 5.3, rounded to 5.2.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Her motivation—to prove gardens know their gardeners—is dramatized in every choice: polishing marbles, murmuring to jasmine, refusing the intern, sitting at the altar. Desire is conflicted (fear hidden under pragmatism, isolation versus proof). Friction between want (recognition from the garden) and cost (bureaucratic opposition) drives the arc. Present in closure (garden's firefly answer). Score: early +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal +1.3, closure +1.4, friction +0.6 = 8.4, rounded to 7.4 per grading scale.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Tone balances withering (gnarled knuckles, cracked marbles, dead wrist-band) and blooming (moonflower, hummingbird, wisteria, fireflies) throughout. It modulates with pressure: dry laughter at the wrist-band, steady refusal to the intern, quiet acceptance at the altar. The final image ("blooming and withering in the same sigh") crystallizes the duality and charges closure. Coherent through turns. Score: early +0.6, modulation +0.9, causal +0.8, closure charge +1.6, specificity +0.7 = 7.6, rounded to 6.8 per grading scale.</comment>
