<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The ghost bride lacks genuine agency—she drifts, places, and fades without interior contradiction or a decision under pressure. Elara arrives late (well past midpoint) and her single gasped realization feels unearned; we see no prior struggle or micro-choice that would justify sudden "searing clarity." The bride's motivation ("lovingly venomous") is declared but never embodied through conflicting impulses acting simultaneously in scene. Embodiment is abstract: "translucent palm," "threads unraveling"—label-only gestures rather than specific sensation or contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed: who/where/when coalesce only after ~180 words of atmospheric preamble, triggering the −0.3 penalty and the Q3 cap at 7.0. The closure unit—fruit bearing runes, Elara tasting nectar—lands on the page as a Resonant Reconfiguration (debt passed as gift), and cost is legible in the bride's dissolution. However, the causal chain from bead-touch to Elara's epiphany to orchard awakening relies on summary assertion ("the bead warmed instantly, its resonance syncing") rather than dramatized pressure, weakening the earned quality of the turn. Under a Hybrid lens (Accumulative atmosphere → thin Causal hinge at the bead exchange → Accumulative closure), the closure holds but the middle hinge is told, not shown.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Capped at 7.0 per the Orientation Test penalty applied in Q2. The greenhouse setting is vivid and atmospherically charged ("iron-boned ribs," "glass panes trembling"), and the final sequence leverages environment—trees, roots, fruit—to materialize the closure image. The mandrake, carved bead pressed to bark, and nectar dripping onto Elara's tongue all demonstrate setting elements constraining or enabling the ending. Absent the orientation debt, this would score higher; the descriptive work is strong and purposeful.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—repaying a debt across lifetimes—is signaled early but pressure remains atmospheric rather than escalating through protagonist agency. The ghost bride never faces a live choice; Elara's arrival and the bead transfer happen to her rather than through her struggle. The final transformation (fruit bearing, nectar tasting) provides visible cost (bride's dissolution) but the escalation lacks a meaningful tightening or trade-off driven by character decision. One deepening occurs (bead unlocks memories, reframes debt as balance) but it is told via summary epiphany rather than a choice that forecloses options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme—vengeance twisted into devotion, debt as balance—emerges from particulars (arsenic kiss, mercury contract, nectar "sweet, bitter, and alive") and avoids overt moralizing until the near-final line "The debt was repaid—not through vengeance, not through sacrifice, but through transmission" which edges toward summary. The bead and fruit motif charges the closure image effectively, reweighting prior material. However, the epiphany is declared ("the debt was never punishment; it was balance") rather than discovered through dramatic irony or resistance, slightly flattening thematic complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Single third-person POV holds cleanly with no head-hopping. The perceptual signature leans heavily on elevated gothic register ("lovingly venomous echo," "translucent palm," "rusted hinges remembering") which remains consistent but risks ornamental density. Elara's brief focalization ("gasped, not from fear, but from the sudden, searing clarity") tells her reaction rather than showing perception degrade or choice crystallize. The prose texture is distinct but the lexicon ("resonant awakenings," "alchemical lullaby lost to time") occasionally drifts into abstract poeticism that dilutes immediacy under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>High figurative density pervades nearly every sentence without pattern-teaching or clear payoff ("ashen-veil ghost bride drifted, not as a specter of sorrow, but as a lovingly venomous echo—her touch gentle, her intent sharp as shattered crystal"). Mixed/strained metaphors: "iron-boned ribs" (greenhouses don't have ribs), "greenhouse exhaled—a sound like rusted hinges remembering how to turn" (hinges don't exhale). Template cadence in the middle third: "She had been... He thought... Her vengeance was..." Paraphrase loop: "Her purpose: to repay a debt" / "Each cameo appearance... was a stitch in the unraveling tapestry of her curse" restates mission without added pressure. Applying −0.6 for density without payoff, −0.4 for mixed metaphor, and −0.3 for paraphrase loop = baseline ~5.9. Artifacts touch the closure beat (final fruit description), disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Gothic ghost-debt-repayment premise is widely templated; the specific synthesis (alchemist betrothed, bead as keystone, greenhouse cathedral) adds texture but does not transform the emotional or moral core. The "lovingly venomous" paradox is declared rather than dramatized through contradictory action. The ending—cursed figure dissolves into gift—follows a familiar redemption arc. Proximity check: "threads of her veil unraveling into motes of silver dust" and "nectar the hue of forgotten vows" echo stock gothic imagery without fresh inflection. No bold structural risk; the piece plays safely within genre conventions.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Ghost bride present in setup and closure but makes no on-page choice; she drifts, places bead, and fades. Observation without decision. Swappable with any passive delivery mechanism.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Bead appears in setup (cradled, described), middle (pressed to bark, glows), and closure (unlocks memories, "pulsing brighter," weaves through roots, rinds etched with same runes). Drives two distinct beats (bark-press awakening, memory unlock) and charges the final image. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage push toward high-7s; slight swappability (any magical token could carry runes) and the fact that its mechanics are asserted rather than constrained prevent 8+.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Resonant awakenings" named in setup (bead hums with frequencies), returns in closure paragraph ("her resonant awakenings lingered"). Shapes the thematic frame but does not constrain a live choice or alter tactics on the page—trees "recognize" and "shudder," but protagonist agency is absent. Functional label, replaceable with "transformation" or "renewal" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Lovingly venomous" declared in the second paragraph but never enacted through contradictory impulse or visible cost. The bride's actions (gentle touch, placing bead, dissolving) are consistently gentle; no on-page venomous act. Label-only trait, ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Ghost" permeates setup, middle (ephemeral appearances, bead placement), and closure (dissolution into essence). The ghostly state enables the debt mechanism and the final infusion. However, the action itself—being a ghost—does not drive a protagonist decision or create a turn; it is the condition through which events unfold. Present in all three gates and integral to tone, but passive vehicle. Scores mid-6s for pervasive presence and closure linkage, capped by lack of agentic turn.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Ephemeral cameo appearances" signaled early ("ghosted through ephemeral cameo appearances") and enacted when bride appears before Elara. The method enables the single key encounter but does not shape multiple attempts or tactics—only one cameo is dramatized on the page. Lyric reprise in closure paragraph ("her final cameo dissolving") reweights the concept as exit-as-infusion. Two gates (setup, closure participation) plus one middle touch; functional but light causal pressure. Scores low-6s.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Greenhouse setting anchors the entire piece: glass panes, iron ribs, frost, trees groaning, mandrake, vines. Environment supplies the resources (trees, roots, soil) that materialize the closure effect—fruit swells, nectar drips. Spatial choreography is clean (Elara hunched over mandrake, bead pressed to bark, fruit plucked and split). The "alchemical orchard greenhouse shrouded in endless night" is irreplaceable: remove it and the story's logic collapses. Strong setup, middle constraint (frostbitten mandrake), and closure participation (fruit bearing). Scores high-7s; lacks one additional tactical constraint mid-scene to reach 8+.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"Over the hush of winter-cracked fields" sets seasonal frame in opening, and "when the frost outside cracked the soil like porcelain" reappears at Elara's entrance. Time remains static (eternal twilight, endless night); no clock tightens decisions. The winter frame contributes atmosphere but does not alter tactics or escalate pressure. Functional mood-setting, replaceable with any cold-season cue.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"To repay a debt across lifetimes" stated early as purpose, dramatized through bead placement and memory unlock, and resolved in closure ("The debt was repaid"). Drives the narrative spine but remains told rather than conflicted: the bride never wrestles with the debt or chooses between competing pulls. Elara's realization ("the debt was never punishment; it was balance") is epiphany-by-summary. Present in all three gates with clear causal role, but lacks on-page friction between want and cost. Scores low-6s.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Mournful elation" implied through imagery (weeping as nectar drips, "sweet, bitter, and alive") and the bride's dissolution described as both loss and gift. Tone modulates slightly from somber setup to bittersweet closure. However, the emotional register remains consistently elevated and poetic without sharp tonal shift under pressure. Coherent but static mood; no moment where tone itself constrains a choice or charges the final image beyond general atmosphere. Mid-5s for coherence and closure presence, capped by lack of dynamic modulation.</comment>
