<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elira's motivation to "read" scars is established and her final shift from "closure seeker" to someone who accepts continuation shows internal movement. The accidentally telepathic trait functions mostly as atmospheric color rather than a genuine constraint that forces difficult choices—the ivy "whispers" coordinates but doesn't impose cost or create friction. Interiority leans heavily on poetic abstraction ("meteor hush," "silence stitched with awe") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The scar-merging climax arrives without visible tradeoff or renunciation that forecloses a live path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers motifs (scars, ivy, hourglass, coffee rings) toward a final reconfiguration. Orientation anchors who and where adequately, though "after anesthesia" remains vague on clock and consequence. The closure unit is a Conceptual Repricing—the seed dissolves into her scar, rewriting "tragedy to threshold"—but the cost is asserted rather than dramatized (no visible sacrifice, loss, or foreclosed option on the page). The narrative moves by accretion and lyric juxtaposition rather than because/therefore linkage, which fits the lens, yet the final image lacks the undeniable pressure or felt price required for high-band Resonant Reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The tower, cellar, and cathedral catacombs are vividly anchored with sensory specificity (moss-slick flagstones, dew, fossilized roots). Spatial choreography is clear across moves. The coffee-ring table and the hourglass on the windowsill/cellar floor function as micro-setting objects that constrain choice and charge the final image (sand resumes, rings rearrange). These elements elevate the score into the 7-band under the micro-setting allowance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Elira's search for the displaced miracle to "translate" rather than resurrect—is signaled early and tightens once (the tunnel opens, she retrieves the seed). No meaningful reversal or cost-laden choice appears: the roots part "by invitation," the seed dissolves willingly, and no live option is foreclosed. The piece delivers one beat of intensification (descent and retrieval) but lacks a second pressure point or visible tradeoff that would raise escalation into the strong band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the scar/story motif and culminates in the realization that "endings could be sealed, that scars could be silenced" is a lie. The final image—hourglass sand spiraling outward "like roots, like scars, like stories that refuse to end"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Minor deduction: the shift from "closure seeker" to acceptance of continuation is asserted in summary rather than fully enacted through a conflicted micro-choice at the peak beat.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-close on Elira with a lyric, elevated register ("meteor hush," "silence pooled like spilled ink") that remains internally consistent. Perceptual signature is character-specific (she reads coffee rings, listens to plants). The diction occasionally drifts into decorative abstraction ("divine echoes," "green memory") that dilutes immediacy under pressure, and the final paragraph's summary tone ("She was no longer a closure seeker") softens the ending's embodied charge.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose is rhythmically controlled with vivid images (ivy "curled around her ankles like worried children," seed "nestled in a cradle of fossilized roots"). Two artifact clusters lower the score: (1) paraphrase loops in the opening ("not pain, but silence—the kind that follows a meteor's passage, a hush stitched with awe and dread" rehearses the same idea twice), and (2) filter-verb stacks in the middle passage ("showed her every wound… every life… every death") flatten immediacy during a pivotal beat. The final paragraph summarizes rather than enacting the transformation on the page.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of scar-reading, plant telepathy, coffee-ring divination, and a miracle-seed buried beneath a cathedral offers a dense, specific premise. However, the emotional arc—grief-stricken seeker learns to accept continuation over closure—follows a familiar template, and the resolution (seed merges painlessly, hourglass resumes) lacks the bold risk or non-obvious moral calculus that would signal high originality. The motifs feel purposefully chosen but arrive without surprising friction or cost.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elira is identified as a "closure seeker who opened wounds" in the opening and her final line confirms transformation ("She was no longer a closure seeker"). The trait appears in setup and payoff but does not drive a middle turn or force a conflicted choice. The "reading" is mostly passive observation until the seed merges at the end. Two gates met (setup, payoff); causal pressure minimal. Score neighborhood: mid-5s for functional presence without middle development or visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The frosted hourglass appears on the windowsill (setup), is left on the cellar floor before descent (middle), and resumes flowing at closure (payoff). All three gates met. It charges the final image ("sand now flowed freely… spiraling outward") with symbolic reweighting. However, Elira never handles or interacts with it in a way that constrains a choice; it remains observational. Score: 6.1 for presence across all gates with lyric reprise but minimal causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The "displaced miracle" is whispered by the ivy early, drives the descent and retrieval (middle), and is revealed as the seed that merges with Elira's scar (closure). All three gates met. It shapes the dominant stake and the final reconfiguration. Slight deduction: the miracle's mechanics (why buried, what it cost the monks) remain abstract, and its resolution involves no visible tradeoff. Score: mid-6s for strong presence across structure with moderate causal work.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Plant telepathy is introduced early ("accidentally telepathic with plants"), enables the ivy to whisper coordinates (middle beat), and the plants "screamed… in recognition" when she touches the seed (closure). Two-and-a-half gates met. However, the trait imposes no visible cost or constraint—no moment where she must choose between plant insight and another path. The "accidental" label and the ease of use lower irreplaceability. Score: low-5s for functional presence without demonstrated tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The tunnel action is setup via the coffee-ring memory, executed at midpoint when "the roots parted like curtains," and delivers Elira to the seed (closure participation). All three gates met. The descent is the story's central spatial move and is irreplaceable—without it, she cannot reach the miracle. Deduction: the tunnel opens "by invitation" without friction or cost, reducing causal pressure. Score: low-7s for strong structural necessity with minimal resistance.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Coffee-ring examination appears in setup (the oak table scene) and supplies the memory of tunnels that motivates descent. Not present in closure. Two gates met (setup, middle). The method is specific and memorable but does not recur or constrain a later choice. Swappable with another divination method (e.g., reading the ivy directly). Score: high-4s for functional use in one key beat without closure linkage or irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The "quiet tower at dawn" anchors the opening, houses the coffee-ring table and cellar entrance (middle), and the ivy bows as Elira emerges at "dawn's full blush" (closure). All three gates met. The tower's vertical structure (windowsill, hearth, cellar) constrains spatial moves and the dawn frame bookends the narrative. Minor deduction: the "quiet" attribute is asserted more than dramatically tested. Score: mid-6s for solid structural integration with moderate pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the anesthesia wears off" is signaled in the opening line and the story closes "at dawn's full blush," bracketing a single night. Setup and closure present; no middle use. The anesthesia detail colors the opening but does not tighten decisions or create urgency—Elira moves at her own pace. The dawn frame is lyric rather than causal. Score: low-4s for presence at boundaries without pressure or clock constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Elira's desire "to learn to read the stories in scars" is declared early, demonstrated through coffee-ring and scar examination (middle), and evolves at closure when the seed "rewriting its tale from tragedy to threshold" answers her search. All three gates met. The motivation drives the quest but is not visibly conflicted—no moment where she must choose between reading and another want, or pay a price for understanding. Score: mid-6s for coherent arc with minimal friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The "meteor hush" phrase appears in the opening and closing paragraphs, bookending the narrative. The tone—awed stillness, reverent silence—is sustained through elevated diction and lyric pacing. It modulates slightly at the climax (plants "screamed") but quickly returns to contemplative register. Two gates met (setup, closure); no middle development. The tone charges the final image but remains largely static. Score: high-5s for coherent lyric frame without dynamic modulation under pressure.</comment>
