<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The sentimentalist remains abstract throughout—neither embodied nor contradictory. Interiority consists of poetic declarations rather than concrete thought under pressure ("This is what we carried"). The gear-holding and singing motions are gestures without lived tension or micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. No meaningful change occurs; the protagonist simply completes a pre-set task with no visible cost or foreclosed path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed past 120 words (who/what/when remain vague until mid-piece), triggering the penalty. The closure offers Resonant Reconfiguration via the gear's transformation and the sentimentalist's transit, but cost is asserted rather than dramatically legible—rust flakes, teeth turn, no visible price paid or option foreclosed. The lens reads Accumulative/Textural (pattern and cadence shift), and one tightening occurs (gear begins to turn), meeting minimum threshold but lacking concrete stakes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The nebula garden supplies vivid sensory texture (violet, ember, petals, hydrogen clouds) filtered through an otherworldly POV. The setting does not constrain a choice but charges the final image through petals and pulses, meeting the micro-setting allowance. Spatial choreography is dreamlike but coherent within its own logic. The recurring petals reweight the closure moment, lifting the score toward the 9+ gate threshold without quite crossing it.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—teaching the gear to feel without calculating—is signaled early but never tested by opposition or scarcity. No meaningful tightening occurs; the sentimentalist proceeds unopposed through sonar pings to a frictionless resolution. The gear's transformation is granted rather than earned through agency or trade-off. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure should deepen or narrow options; here it simply accumulates description.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme (generational healing, light without fire) emerges organically from the gear and ancestor motifs. The final image ("You do not need to burn to be bright") borders on direct statement but is rescued by prior particulars (rust, teeth, pulses). Subtext operates in the sonar-ping method and petal descent. The piece resists overt moralizing until the penultimate beat, where thematic echo nearly surfaces but stops short of full sermon.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Voice is consistent: elevated, lyric, metaphor-dense throughout. POV remains stable (single focalizer, no head-hopping). However, psychic distance is uniformly distant—no modulation under pressure, no perceptual signature that shifts with stress. Diction stays in high register without variance ("troubling serenity," "soul-frequency"). The narrative withholds immediate anchors (who/where/when) past the opening third, creating initial opacity that Q2 already penalized.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Figurative language saturates most sentences without pattern-teaching or payoff (−0.5 density penalty). Mixed metaphors appear: "cathedral of gas" / "nebular orchids" / "lighthouse without flame" stack vehicles without coherent tenor. Paraphrase loops: "This is what we carried / This is what broke us / This is what we mend" and "sonar pinging" repeated across beats without added detail (−0.4 template cadence). Information density is low; many lines restate mood rather than advance situation. Artifacts touch closure ("You do not need to burn"), disallowing 9+ globally per the cap.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The premise—cosmic ancestor attempting non-violent communication through resonance—offers a fresh angle on generational trauma. Execution leans on stock SF imagery (nebula, stars, plasma) and therapy-speak framing (healing cycles, breaking patterns). The sonar-ping method is specific but underutilized in scene. Emotional specificity is absent; the sentimentalist's struggle is told rather than dramatically contradicted. No bold structural risk; the piece follows a linear accumulation without surprise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The sentimentalist wanders, pauses, sings, and transits—observation and gesture without on-page decision that alters tactics. No choice narrows options or incurs visible cost. Present throughout but functionally passive.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The gear appears in opening, middle (cradled, laid on petals), and closure (spinning, pulsing). It shifts from rusted relic to radiant beacon, reweighting meaning. However, the transformation is granted by the sentimentalist's song rather than constrained or enabled by the gear's own properties. Two beats plus closure linkage, but causal pressure is weak.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Generational patterns frame the backstory and motivate the protagonist's method ("not repeat that"). The concept shapes the dominant stake (teaching without fire) but remains thematic rather than tactical—no on-page choice hinges on breaking versus continuing a pattern. One beat (ancestor summary) plus closure echo.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Approximates infinity...in patience" appears once as descriptive label. No action is constrained or enabled by this trait; it colors characterization without altering on-page choices. Ornamental use.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Transit bookends the piece (wandering, final deeper transit) and defines the protagonist's role. The action itself is vague—"through resonance, through memory"—and could be replaced by "healing" or "journeying" with minor edits. It structures the arc but does not create a key turn with cost.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Sonar pinging is signaled early, used in two beats (sending pulses, receiving echoes), and participates in closure (duet with gear's rhythm). The method is specific and tied to the protagonist's approach. However, mechanics remain abstract; no choice depends on ping success or failure. Two beats plus closure presence.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The nebula garden supplies atmosphere and recurring petals that frame and close the piece. It does not pressure a choice but charges the final image through petals falling slower, pulsing light. Micro-setting via petals meets the allowance. Setup, lyric development, closure reprise—two gates plus resonance.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Across the quiet sigh of falling petals" is poetic framing; elapsed time is vague (millennia referenced, but scene duration unclear). No tightening deadline or clock that alters tactics. Petals fall throughout, signaling duration atmospherically but not mechanically.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The motivation ("share light without using fire") is stated early and governs the protagonist's method. It is told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants or costs—no moment where the sentimentalist is tempted to use fire or pays a visible price for gentleness. One beat (setup) plus closure assertion.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Troubling serenity is named late ("troubling...because peace felt fragile") and maintained through lyric, distant register. Tone does not modulate with pressure (no pressure exists). The final image sustains the mood and charges it with the gear's glow. Static throughout but coherent and purposeful at closure.</comment>
