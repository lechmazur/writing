<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The navigator's moon-phase fluctuation is stated but never constrains an on-page choice with visible cost—it remains decorative physiology. Interiority leans heavily on poetic assertion ("lattices of meaning," "tapestry—one that maps absences") rather than embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. The final singing of coordinates feels like a repeated ritual rather than a decision that forecloses a path. No meaningful change or renunciation with felt cost is dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Orientation is severely delayed: who she is, her goal, and the operational logic of the cryptic calls remain abstract well past 120 words, triggering the −0.5 penalty and Q3 cap at 7.0. The piece reads as accumulative/textural but never tightens—beats recycle the same actions (rubbing the censer, whispering coordinates, waiting for flickers) without a turn or deepening that changes options or knowledge. No legible closure: the final singing and flicker-answer repeat prior material without a decisive change, resonant reconfiguration with cost, or conceptual repricing. The "reverse migration" premise is theme-stated but never forces a tactical choice or alters her stance on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The starlit signal station supplies vivid atmospheric anchors (rusted gantry, broken dish array, Junction 7 silt) and the censer foot's bronze hum offers tactile specificity. However, spatial choreography across locations (gantries, alleys, thresholds) remains vague, and the environment never constrains a choice or alters tactics—it serves as backdrop. The censer's ghost-heat and hum charge the final image modestly, lifting the score within the capped range (Q2 orientation penalty caps Q3 at 7.0).</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>A dominant stake—navigating loss through cryptic signals—is signaled early, but pressure never escalates. The Tuesday call, the censer hum, and the final singing are parallel rituals without a tightening that narrows options or forces a trade-off. No on-page reversal or deepening; coincidence (the voice replying, the flicker answering) complicates without protagonist agency driving the turn. Closure lacks a visible or felt cost that forecloses a live path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The theme of reverse migration and navigation through absence emerges clearly from image and action, avoiding overt thesis. The final paragraph's "Raw solace isn't comfort" meta-statement and the line "She doesn't heal. She doesn't fix. She navigates" veer toward direct thematic summary, lowering resonance (−0.5 in Q5). The ending offers a lyric answer—seepage rather than parade—but it reiterates the premise rather than reweighting prior material with a non-literal turn.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and sustained: lyric, compressed, with purposeful fragment rhythms ("Not resurrection. Resonance.") and a consistent perceptual signature (scent and shadow coordinates, bronze hum settling "behind her sternum"). The single cryptic phone-call exchange carries subtext and goal pursuit. However, psychic distance drifts: "People think migration only flows outward" breaks into essayistic omniscience, and the final explanatory paragraphs shift from immersive to thematic narration. Elision is pattern-taught and largely legible, but the voice flattens slightly under the weight of thematic summary at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout with some vivid constructions ("moon… hanging like a wound," "ears ringing for days") but also mixed vehicles ("weaves not a net, but a tapestry" when both are woven textiles) and synonym loops ("dial tone becomes a dirge; a busy signal, a lullaby" mirrors "Shrines of dial tones" and "Cathedrals of missed connections"). Template cadence appears in stacked "She [verb]" and "Not [X]. [Y]." structures across multiple beats without full pattern payoff (−0.6 in Q7). Several scaffold lines paraphrase without adding pressure: "She doesn't heal. She doesn't fix. She navigates" and "Not resurrection. Resonance." are conceptually redundant. Line-level clarity is mostly maintained, preventing deeper penalties.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of lunar physiology, abandoned signal station, and navigating loss through cryptic calls is non-obvious and specific. The "reverse migration" frame offers a fresh angle on grief. However, the piece cycles through variations of the same ritual—rubbing, whispering, singing, receiving flickers—without a turn that redefines the premise or follows an unexpected implication. The closure image (singing coordinates, flicker answering) fulfills the setup but does not surprise or transform. Risk-taking is moderate: the lyric compression and non-linear presentation elevate somewhat, but the avoidance of a decisive change or renunciation keeps the piece from bold payoff.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The patchwork navigator is named and present throughout, but her actions are observational and ritualistic rather than decision-driven. She waits, rubs the censer, whispers coordinates, and sings—none of these choices narrow options or force a trade-off with visible cost. The moon-phase fluctuation is stated but never constrains a beat. She is setup and present across beats but does not drive a turn; functional but replaceable with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The patina bronze censer foot appears early (first paragraph), is handled across multiple beats (rubbing when moon wanes, humming back, held during final singing), and charges the final image. Its ghost-heat and bronze note anchor her tactile connection to the past. However, it does not constrain a choice or enable a tactic—its role is atmospheric and symbolic rather than causal. Two gates (setup, closure participation) plus beat recurrence place it solidly mid-band; lack of causal pressure or cost linkage prevents higher scoring.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Reverse migration is foregrounded conceptually ("the great, silent return of what was lost") and frames the premise. However, it remains thematic rather than operational: it does not shape on-page tactics, constrain choices, or change options. The story could function with "navigation of loss" or "recovery of echoes" substituted with minor edits. Present and consistent but swappable, placing it low-mid functional band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>Moon-phase fluctuation is stated early ("joints stiffen at new moon, her thoughts sharpen at full") and mentioned twice (ignoring it once caused static-wall ringing; she rubs the censer when moon wanes). However, it never constrains an on-page action or enables a tactic with cost. The Tuesday gibbous call and final full-moon singing are not tied to a trade-off or limitation. Label-only trait without visible pressure penalty, capping below functional threshold.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Build" is signaled early ("her task now… to navigate") and recurs thematically ("the build—the slow, stubborn reassembly," "She builds altars of static"). However, the action is abstract: mental loom-weaving and altar-building are metaphors, not concrete moves. No major turn traces to a specific act of building. The action shapes tone and frames the accumulative design but is swappable with "navigate" or "assemble" with minor edits. One gate (setup) plus thematic recurrence place it mid-low band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Cryptic phone calls at midnight are introduced early ("cryptic phone calls at midnight, dialed not to numbers but to frequencies"), dramatized in the Tuesday beat with the genderless voice reply, and implied in the background ("former operators… the station itself, dreaming aloud"). The method matters—coordinates are whispered, a voice confirms—but it does not constrain or enable a turn. The mechanics are ornamental: the call could be replaced by radio broadcast or direct invocation with minor edits. Two gates (setup, middle development) without closure linkage or causal pressure place it low-mid band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The starlit signal station is named in the title and opening, anchors multiple beats (rusted gantry, broken dish array, highest gantry climb), and frames the final singing. The failed hydraulics create the inciting context. However, the station does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome—it functions as evocative backdrop. Three gates (setup, development via "highest gantry" climb, closure participation) without causal pressure place it mid-band; atmospheric charge and recurring presence prevent lower scoring.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"After the hydraulics fail" is signaled early and establishes the premise (loss of machine coordinates, shift to memory-based navigation). However, the timeframe is static: there is no live clock, no tightening deadline, and no urgency tied to "after." The story could open "after the station closed" or "after the signals stopped" with identical structure. One gate (setup) with no middle or closure tightening caps it below mid-band; causal framing prevents ornamental scoring.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>"To navigate the geography of loss" is stated early and recurs ("her task now," "the inward journey"). The desire is dramatized through her actions (cryptic calls, rubbing the censer, singing coordinates) and friction appears briefly ("tried to ignore it once, charted a course through grief… walked straight into static"). However, the motivation does not produce on-page conflict between wants and costs at closure—she continues the same rituals without a trade-off or renunciation. Two gates (setup, middle friction) without closure friction place it low-mid band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Raw solace is modeled throughout: quiet rituals, muted flickers, scent and shadow rather than triumph. The tone modulates subtly (bronze hum settling, wind carrying coordinates) and the final definition ("Raw solace isn't comfort. It's the creak of a hinge…") reweights the concept. However, the explicit meta-statement in the last paragraph flattens the effect slightly, and the tone remains static rather than shifting under pressure. Lyric reprise (setup to final definition) without mid-scene turn places it upper-mid band; coherence and closure linkage prevent lower scoring.</comment>
