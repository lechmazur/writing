<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation—preserving trust through vigilance—is concrete and constrains her choices consistently. Her muscle-memory signal system (buckle as communication code) embodies her method without diagnostic label-speak, and the final choice to re-clip the buckle and walk toward the next arbor demonstrates earned endurance with visible cost. Internal contradiction appears in her balancing of truth-telling versus reassurance, shown through the remembered village failure. Minor slips: the mentor backstory occupies ~15% without altering present tactics significantly, and some interiority leans toward summary ("she had learned that the hard way") rather than embodied perception under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure is a clear Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): the Watcher chooses to continue bearing the burden, re-clips the buckle as private vow, and walks toward the next arbor—foreclosing flight with visible cost (the weight of ongoing vigilance). The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece builds through repeated images (buckle, silence, signal) and a cadence shift at the chime moment that reweights the stake. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph. One meaningful tightening occurs when the arbor trembles and she reads the silence as signal, then acts to stabilize the villages—narrowing options from panic to trust. Cost is legible in the final paragraph: "she would carry it… That was the burden." Minor gap: the causality linking the chime's ripple to village acknowledgment is slightly elliptical but remains plausible within the piece's taught world-logic.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The nocturnal arbor—trees growing sideways from floating moss islands, roots clutching sky—is vividly particular and constrains the protagonist's movement (sky-bridge of woven vines). The parachute buckle functions as micro-setting: its physical presence (cold metal, grooves, release catch) anchors the Watcher's signal code and charges the final image when she re-clips it. The setting details are filtered through the POV's professional priorities (bioluminescent vines, wind-chimes, trained moths as signal tools) and the spatial choreography remains coherent across moves. The piece meets the 9+ gate: the buckle (object-as-setting) charges the closure when she re-clips it as vow, and the arbor's trembling triggers the central action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: preserve communal trust when silence screams. One meaningful tightening occurs when the arbor trembles and she must act without instructions, choosing the buckle-chime to prevent panic—a decision that forecloses the option of silence or flight. The escalation is driven by protagonist agency (she adapts old signals, reads the hush, strikes the buckle) and the cost is legible on the page: lanterns blink acknowledgment, trust holds, and she must now walk toward the next arbor to repeat the burden. Under the Accumulative lens, the pressure coheres through the silence/signal pattern and reweights at the chime moment. Minor issue: the middle passage's reflection on the past village failure adds context but does not materially narrow present options in the arbor scene.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme—the burden of shaping silence into reassurance so others can sleep—emerges through the buckle signal system, the village lantern response, and the final image of walking toward "the next quiet place that needed her." The Watcher's internal arc (learning to revise timing rather than words) is inextricable from the thematic question of trust versus truth. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: "That was the burden. That was the gift." The parachute buckle and muscle-memory motif recur with shifting weight (remembering mentor, signaling patience, striking chime, re-clipping as vow) and charge the closure without overt statement. No thematic echo penalty. Minor slip: the phrase "not to fix it, but to frame it, revise it, make it bearable" in the penultimate paragraph trends toward explicit thesis, though it remains tied to action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable and apt; no head-hopping. The perceptual signature is consistent: the Watcher notices silence, vibration, the "hush between breezes," bioluminescent vines—filtered through her professional lens. Diction is controlled and voice-motivated (e.g., "the arbor trembled—not from storm, but from a frequency too low for most to feel"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully at emotional peaks (the chime moment tightens to sensory immediacy). Deductions: the phrase "the static had cleared an hour ago" is a filter-verb tell where dramatized sequence would sharpen immediacy. Repetitive syntactic stems appear in the closing paragraphs ("not toward noise, but toward…" / "not to fix it, but to frame it"), creating mild template cadence. Overall voice is distinct and pressure-responsive, but the pattern slips slightly reduce line-level control.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear and propulsive, with strong sensory anchors ("cold metal of the parachute buckle," "ironwood railing," "sky-bridge of woven vines"). Information density is high in the opening and chime sequence. Deductions accumulate: paraphrase loop in mid-section (paragraphs 6–7 restate "the body remembers" without added pressure). Template cadence in the final third: "not because it was loud, but because…" / "not as noise, but as vibration" / "not with stoicism, but with invention" / "not toward noise, but toward" (four parallel constructions in ~150 words). Minor filter-verb stack in paragraph describing the chime's spread. The loops and stems dull momentum in the closure approach. Combined penalties: −0.8 for paraphrase/template cadence, −0.3 for filter reliance. Artifacts touch the final third, disallowing 9+ globally per the rule.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The core premise—Watcher who signals through muscle-memory gestures and a parachute buckle to preserve trust in a post-static world—offers a fresh synthesis of familiar post-apocalyptic vigilance with the specific inflection of embodied communication codes. The arbor setting (sky-rooted trees, floating moss) and signal tools (bioluminescent vines, trained moths) are particular and memorable. Transformation test: the emotional arc (learning to revise timing, not words) and the closure (re-clipping the buckle as vow, walking toward the next quiet) feel organic to this world and voice. Minor weaknesses: the mentor-apprentice frame and "burden" language are well-worn tropes executed competently but not radically transformed. The piece commits fully to its premise and follows implications without retreat, earning solid mid-range originality.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The midnight pattern seeker is established in the opening line, drives the middle choice (reading the arbor's tremor, striking the buckle-chime), and appears in the closure (re-clips buckle, walks toward next arbor). Her observational skill enables the key decision: she interprets the low-frequency tremor and chooses the signal that prevents panic. Removing her role would collapse the story's logic. Early signal +0.6, two distinct beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage +1.4, cost connection +0.5 = ~4.6 baseline + positive signals. Minor friction: her title functions as descriptor; the identity could be labeled "Watcher" with near-equivalent effect (−0.3 swappability).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The parachute buckle appears in paragraph 2 (grounding cue), paragraph 10 (muscle-memory signal code: thumb-brush = patience, three taps = prepare), paragraph 19 (she strikes it against railing to produce the chime), and paragraph 23 (re-clips as private vow in closure). It drives two beats (muscle-memory code, chime signal) and charges the final image. Setup by ~10%, development (signal system), payoff (chime + re-clip). Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.4, closure linkage +1.6, irreplaceability +0.7, cost connection +0.5 = high-band entry. No frictions apply.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The watcher's burden is named in paragraph 7 ("not in seeing, but in choosing what to show"), dramatized in the village failure memory (paragraph 8), restated in paragraph 26 ("heavy, but she bore it not with stoicism, but with invention"), and appears in the final lines ("That was the burden. That was the gift"). It shapes her stakes (preserve trust) and tactics (revise timing, not words; use the chime rather than speech). Setup early, development in the middle reflection, payoff in closure image. Early signal +0.7, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.1, closure linkage +1.3, cost connection +0.5. Friction: the concept is stated multiple times rather than fully embodied in each instance (−0.4 ornamental repetition in paragraphs 7 & 26).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Attentively inventive" is demonstrated in paragraph 12 (adapts old signals: bioluminescent vines, wind-chimes, trained moths) and paragraph 27 (sketches new signal possibilities: shadow-play, scent-moths). It enables her tactics but does not constrain a choice with visible cost on the page. The trait is shown through action rather than label, satisfying functional integration. Setup by paragraph 12, development in signal adaptation, payoff in forward planning. Beat involvement +0.4, causal enabling +0.8, closure proximity +0.3. Frictions: appears primarily in two descriptive clusters without a single on-page moment where inventiveness costs her something or forecloses an option (−0.5 no visible tradeoff). Cap at mid-6s per cost-connection absence.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Revise" is seeded in paragraph 9 ("she revised not with words, but with timing, with gesture, with silence"), drives the key turn when she strikes the buckle (paragraph 19: not a declaration but a shaped vibration), and appears in the closure walk toward "the next quiet place…to frame it, revise it, make it bearable" (paragraph 28). The action redefines her method (contrast with the failed storm warning) and produces the village acknowledgment. Setup early, development in chime choice, payoff in closing intent. Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.3, closure linkage +1.5, cost connection +0.4. Minor friction: swapping "revise" with "adapt" or "shape" would preserve most logic (−0.3 swappability).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Remembering through muscle memory is introduced in paragraph 10 ("the body remembers truth even when the mind drowns in doubt"), mechanics detailed in the signal code (thumb-brush, three taps), enacted when she strikes the buckle (paragraph 19: "her fingers absently tracing the buckle's grooves"), and affirmed in closure ("as long as her muscles remembered, she would carry it"). The method enables the chime action and charges the final vow. Setup by paragraph 10, development in signal execution, payoff in closure. Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +1.2, specificity +0.5. Friction: the phrase "muscle memory" is stated rather than shown in paragraphs 10–11, creating mild label-only use (−0.3).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The nocturnal arbor is established in the opening line, supplies the setting for the chime action (ironwood railing, sky-bridge, canopy), and the piece ends with her stepping onto the vine bridge toward the next arbor. The arbor's trembling (paragraph 16) triggers her response. It provides resources (railing to strike, vines to pulse warnings) and spatial context. Setup immediately, development in tremor trigger, payoff in closure walk. Early signal +0.8, two beats +0.9, causal trigger +0.9, closure linkage +0.9. Frictions: the arbor functions as backdrop for most beats; removing it and substituting another elevated structure would preserve the chime logic with minor edits (−0.6 swappability). The setting pressures the opening image and closure but does not alter tactics mid-scene.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"After the radio static clears" is named in paragraph 4 and restated in paragraph 17 ("the static had cleared an hour ago"). The timeframe establishes the world state (silence as signal) and the urgency (villagers whisper of omens, she must act). It does not create a live ticking clock that alters moves beat-by-beat. Setup early, thematic development, mild closure relevance (the world after static is the ongoing condition). Early signal +0.6, one beat involvement +0.4, causal framing +0.6. Frictions: time remains vague after the hour marker; no moment-by-moment countdown (−0.4 untracked). The element sets stage but does not tighten decisions within the scene (−0.3 static rather than dynamic).</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Motivation to preserve trust is stated in paragraph 6, dramatized in the village failure memory (paragraph 8: broken trust from poor timing), drives the chime decision (paragraph 19: she acts to prevent panic), and is validated in the lantern response (paragraph 22: "just trust, held firm"). The friction between truth-telling and reassurance is enacted when she chooses silence shaped into signal rather than direct warning. Setup by paragraph 6, development in memory and chime choice, payoff in village acknowledgment and closure vow. Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.5, closure linkage +1.4, cost connection +0.6 (she must walk toward the next burden). No significant frictions.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Soundless echo is named in paragraph 14 ("each soundless echo carried meaning") and enacted in paragraph 20 ("the soundless echo spread, not as noise, but as vibration"). The tone is coherent: silence, hush, vibration, and quiet recur throughout and modulate at the chime moment (shift from stillness to felt ripple). The final image ("the wind rose, cool and clean, carrying no message but the memory of what silence could mean") charges the tone with cost. Setup by paragraph 14, development in chime effect, payoff in closure wind. Beat involvement +0.9, causal tone-shift +1.1, closure linkage +1.5, specificity +0.6. Friction: the phrase "soundless echo" is slightly oxymoronic and explained rather than fully embodied in some mentions (−0.4 label reliance in paragraph 14).</comment>
