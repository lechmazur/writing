<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The poet's motivation to "become the translator between generations" is established through reflection but lacks on-page micro-choices that test competing impulses. His interaction with the child near the end finally dramatizes a key value (giving back wonder), but the internal contradiction between survival and redemption is told more than enacted. The progression from "survival wasn't enough" to leaving anonymous jars reads as summary rather than pressure-tested choices. Embodied emotion is thin; much of the interior reads as philosophical narration rather than contradiction acting simultaneously in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Lens: Accumulative/Textural—the piece gathers sonic reliquaries and exchanges until the final jar with the child reweights the dominant stake. Orientation is delayed (vagrant poet, loft, dunes) but adequately anchored by the end of the first block. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the child clutches her grandmother's echo; the poet vanishes but his jars hum on), and the cost—his disappearance, his anonymity—is legible. However, the causal chain from repairing the music box to leaving jars on doorsteps is thin; the turn feels asserted rather than earned by prior pressure. The "he was gone" ending provides closure but the escalation leading to it is weak.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The feral loft and dunes are vivid and specific; "salt-wind slipping through cracks," "dunes groaned under ice" anchor sensory detail in POV and season. The loft's evolution from smuggler's cache to sonic reliquary is purposeful. The frozen puddle in the climactic scene and the labeled jars throughout charge the setting with function. Spatial choreography is clean. The micro-setting (loft, jars, dunes) constrains the poet's isolation and enables the final gift to the child, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—gleaning redemption through captured sounds—is signaled early but never tightened by live opposition or cost. The poet's actions (wandering, bottling, gifting) accumulate but do not escalate; no option is foreclosed until the poet vanishes, and that disappearance is not prepared by prior pressure. The child's arrival is coincidental, not a reversal driven by the poet's agency. The ending reconfigures meaning (wonder survives loss) but lacks a visible price paid in a beat where the poet must choose between competing goods.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme—continuity across loss, redemption gleaned from wreckage—emerges organically from the jar-bottling conceit and the music-box repair. The final exchange with the child ("her wonder isn't [gone]") answers the thematic question without stating a moral. The image of jars humming after the poet's departure reweights prior material with lonesome splendor. No overt thesis statements mar the ending. The piece resists tidy closure while offering resonance through specifics (grandmother's voice in the jar, the ballerina's twitch).</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and carries a lyric, archaic texture ("dawn's earliest whistle," "sonic reliquaries"). The diction is consistent but occasionally elevated beyond the vagrant's plausible lexicon ("distillations," "articulate"). No head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present in the focus on sound over sight. The poet's interior is summarized more than rendered through immediate perception under pressure. The dialogue with the child is natural and advances plot, but brief. Compression and elision serve the lyric mode; the piece teaches its pattern early and maintains it.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies; sentence openings are diverse; no paraphrase loops. However, several passages lean into overwriting: "fragile, trembling things sealed beneath cork and wax," "lonesome splendor—positively wistful, endlessly bright" stacks modifiers without added pressure. "He rose not to beg or barter, but to sweeten the silence—with glass jars" is a forced construction. The final poem recites the prompt elements ("gleaned redemption," "lonesome splendor," "positively wistful") in a way that feels like thematic echo rather than earned image. Figurative density is high but coherent; no mixed metaphors. Information density is strong in the middle third but thins in the reflective blocks.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The conceit of bottling sounds in jars is specific and memorable; the music-box repair via captured sighs is inventive. The vagrant-poet-as-memory-keeper avoids stock redemption arcs. However, the core emotional progression (orphan seeking beauty, then redemption, then anonymity) follows a familiar template. The transformative element is the sonic reliquary system, which feels fresh in its mechanics but underexploited in its stakes. The ending's quiet disappearance is a lyric choice but not a bold one; the piece retreats into poeticism rather than following the jar conceit to a harder edge.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The vagrant penny poet is present throughout and his choices (repairing the music box, leaving jars, speaking to the child) frame key moments. However, many of his actions are summarized ("he began to leave jars") rather than dramatized in discrete beats. The decision to vanish is not shown as a choice with competing options. He observes and acts but rarely under pressure that tests him. Present in setup, middle, and ending, but swappable with "hermit artisan" or similar archetype without breaking logic.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The forgotten music box appears in the second quarter, is repaired with captured sounds in a vivid beat (gears sigh, ballerina twitches), and reappears in the final scene playing to empty chairs. It constrains one major choice (the repair as epiphany: "to become the translator") and charges the ending image. However, it does not drive the climactic exchange with the child; the jar does that work. Two-beat involvement (repair, final image) and closure linkage place it in the 6-band, but it is not indispensable—the jar-gifting plot could proceed without it.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Gleaned redemption" is named explicitly in the poet's reflection ("redemption, he realized, wasn't granted—it was gleaned") and restated in the final poem. It frames the thematic question and the arc from survival to giving. However, it is articulated as theme rather than enacted as a stake that narrows options in scene. The concept does not create friction or visible cost on the page; the poet's acts of gleaning (bottling, gifting) accumulate but do not force a trade-off. Present in setup (implied), middle (stated), and ending (echoed), so eligible above 6.0, but the lack of causal pressure and the reliance on label keep it mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Positively wistful" appears only in the final poem's last line and is not dramatized as a trait that constrains or enables action. It reads as a tonal descriptor rather than a character attribute with mechanical consequence. The poet's wistfulness (longing for connection, acceptance of loss) could be inferred from prior beats, but the specific phrase is ornamental. Late arrival (final third), label-only use, and no cost connection cap it below 5.0.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Sweeten" is signaled early ("to sweeten the silence—with glass jars") and recurs in the second-to-last stanza ("Still, he sweetened the world, one jar at a time"). It frames the poet's method and motive. However, "sweeten" is metaphorical shorthand rather than a discrete action beat; the actual actions are capturing, sealing, and gifting. The verb does not shape a major turn—removing "sweeten" and keeping "capture/gift" would preserve all plot logic. Early signal and thematic reprise earn mid-5s, but swappability ("beautify," "preserve") and lack of causal necessity prevent higher scores.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Capturing sounds in glass jars is the method throughout: the poet wanders with jars, fills them ("sigh of tide," "cry of gull"), seals them with cork and wax, labels them, and gifts them. The mechanics shape multiple beats (the opening, the townsfolk exchanges, the child's jar). The jar is the vehicle for the climactic revelation (grandmother's voice) and the ending image (jars that hum). Early signal, multi-beat involvement, closure linkage, and high irreplaceability (no other method would preserve the sonic conceit) place it solidly in the 7-band. Specificity (cork, wax, labels, uncorking ritual) adds texture.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The feral loft beneath the dunes is established early, anchors the poet's isolation, and houses the music box and jars. It recurs in the cold-morning climax (outside the loft, frozen puddle) and the ending (loft remains, filled with jars). The setting constrains (isolation, salt-stung decay) and enables (cache for reliquaries). However, the loft does not alter a key tactic or decision—the poet could work from any marginal space. Setup, middle presence, and ending participation meet the three-gate test, and the closure image (jars humming in the empty loft) gives it lyric charge, but the lack of tactical constraint limits it to mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"At dawn's earliest whistle" frames the opening and the cold morning near the end ("On the coldest morning" echoes the dawn rhythm). The timeframe does not tighten decisions or create urgency; the poet's routine is habitual, not time-bound. The phrase recurs as a lyric motif ("At dawn's earliest whistle, he was gone") but does not function as a clock. Setup and ending presence without middle development cap it at 4.6 per the missing-middle gate. The dawn motif reweights slightly at closure (disappearance at the ritual hour), nudging it toward the cap's ceiling.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"To become the translator between generations" is articulated explicitly in the music-box repair sequence ("That was when he understood his true motivation") and guides the subsequent gifting acts. The desire is present in the middle and shapes the ending (giving the child her grandmother's echo). However, it is told rather than dramatized; the poet's motivation does not face friction or competing wants on the page. The cost (anonymity, disappearance) is implied but not shown as a choice. Setup (implied), middle (stated), ending (enacted in the jar gift) satisfy the three gates, and the motivation drives two beats (repair epiphany, child exchange), placing it in mid-5s. Lack of on-page conflict between wants and costs prevents higher scores.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Lonesome splendor" is named in the final poem and evoked throughout via imagery (salt-stung loft, dunes, solitary wandering, anonymous gifts, the poet's disappearance). The tone is coherent and modulates appropriately: wistful curiosity in the opening, quiet reverence in the exchanges, elegiac solemnity at the end. The final image (jars humming, poet translating "between silence and song") charges the tone without stating it. The phrase itself arrives late (final poem), but the tonal texture is consistent from the first line. Coherence, modulation under pressure, and closure linkage place it in the upper 6-band; the late explicit naming and reliance on the label in the poem prevent entry to 7+.</comment>
