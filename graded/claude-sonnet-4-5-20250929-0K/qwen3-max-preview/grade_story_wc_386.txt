<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's interior life is established through selective attention (snow globe warmth, dream-mapping), but her motivation to "salvage something pure" remains largely asserted rather than tested through contradictory impulses under pressure. The child ghost's desire is rendered through cameos, not dramatized conflict. The final act—placing the globe in the ice frame—feels like ritual completion rather than a choice that forecloses a live option with visible cost; the whisperer walks away unchanged, her methods validated without friction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece builds through image density (candle shrine, dream constellation, ice window) and a final cadence shift when the globe is placed and "the ice remembers." Closure reads as Conceptual Repricing: the globe's message is delivered, dream cameos fade, strangers' lives ripple. Cost is implied (the child's appearances end, the whisperer moves on) but not felt on the page as a foreclosed path or stake transformation. Orientation is clear by the opening lines; no penalty applied. One meaningful deepening (analyzing dreams → placing the globe) is present, but the final act lacks causal pressure—it completes a ritual rather than resolving contested options.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The glacier shrine is vivid and specific: candle flames against blue-veined ice, the carved window recess, ice that "ripples, not melting, but remembering." The melted snow globe functions as micro-setting, constraining the final image when placed in the ice frame. Sensory hierarchy (warmth against glacial chill, borrowed starlight) charges the closure moment. Spatial choreography is clean throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—salvaging the child's uncorrupted echo—is signaled early but never contested. The protagonist maps dream cameos and places the globe without resistance, reversal, or visible trade-off. The child's appearances "will fade now" is told consequence, not on-page cost. No tightening narrows options; the whisperer's methods succeed on schedule. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure should deepen or cadence should shift to reweight stakes; here, the ritual completes as expected.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme—connection through fragile thresholds, "windows not doors"—emerges cleanly from image work (frosted panes, ice frames, borrowed starlight) and the dream-cameo method. The fisherman/librarian/widow ripples in the final third offer a resonant coda without overt moralizing. However, the piece risks thematic echo: "weaving truth carefully" and "windows of connection" feel prompt-adjacent rather than discovered through conflict. The ending reweights prior material (globe becomes window within window) but the conceptual cost is oblique—strangers' dreams shift, yet no one on the page sacrifices or chooses differently.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice is controlled and distinct: "breath curling like incense," "blue-veined ice," "not to haunt, but to be seen." Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping. Diction remains consistent ("borrowed starlight," "miniature streets reform in crystalline relief") with one micro-slip: "unnervingly warm" leans expository when the prior line already contrasts warmth and glacial chill. Free indirect style is clean throughout. No dialogue present; other tests do not apply.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes. Information density is high in the dream-cameo constellation paragraph. However, paraphrase loops appear: "not terror, but wonder" / "not to haunt, but to be seen" recurs as template negation across multiple beats (−0.4). "The ghost whisperer" is repeated as subject in adjacent sentences mid-piece where pronouns would serve (−0.2). Figurative density is high but controlled; no mixed metaphors. Proofreading is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The wreck-diver ghost whisperer and dream-cameo method offer fresh synthesis. The melted snow globe's transformation (slumped smear → crystalline streets in ice) is a specific, memorable image. However, the arc—specialist performs ritual, ghost finds peace, strangers' lives gently improve—follows a template for "quiet exorcism" stories without friction or moral ambiguity. Transformation test: the plot and arc would survive intact with a medium swap (psychic reads objects, detective follows clues). No proximity echo detected, but the premise leans toward a prompt checklist rather than earned inevitability.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The wreck-diver ghost whisperer is present throughout and makes one key choice—placing the globe in the ice frame—that completes the closure. However, her decision is ritual execution rather than a turn under pressure; no live alternative is weighed. She maps dreams (middle beat) and performs the shrine act (ending), so two beats are touched. Causal pressure is low; the whisperer's methods succeed without friction. Early signal (+0.5), two beats (+0.9), closure linkage (+0.9), but low causal pressure and no visible cost (−1.0).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The melted snow globe appears early (altar, first paragraph), is handled mid-scene ("cradling…against her chest"), and returns transformed at closure (placed in ice frame, streets reform). Three beats: altar description, tactile handling, ice-window placement. The globe's warmth and final crystalline state charge the closure image with specificity. Early signal (+0.6), three beats (+1.4), closure linkage (+1.5), specificity (+0.6), but the object does not constrain a choice—it completes a ritual (−0.8). Swappability is low; the melted-then-reformed property is irreplaceable (+0.5).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Windows of connection" is named explicitly mid-piece ("Not doors, not gates, but windows") and illustrated through dream cameos and the ice-frame window. However, the concept does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; it is thematic decoration. The whisperer does not weigh "window vs. door" logic under pressure. Present in setup (cameos) and ending (ice window), but missing middle constraint. Setup (+0.5), closure participation (+0.8), but label-only in peak beat (−0.4), no causal pressure (−0.6), swappable metaphor (−0.5).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Weaves truth carefully" is stated early ("she weaves truth carefully…because truth…shatters") but never constrains an on-page action with cost. The whisperer maps dreams and places the globe without a moment where careful weaving versus blunt revelation shapes her tactics. The trait is invoked thematically in the final third ("truth…need not wound—it can mend") but remains label-only. Setup (+0.4), closure echo (+0.4), but label-only (−0.5), no visible trade-off (−0.8), summary use (−0.4).</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Expose" (via "exposes hidden narratives…by analyzing cameo appearances") drives the middle beat: mapping dream fragments into the child's story. The action enables the closure (understanding allows placement), but "expose" is swappable with "reveal," "uncover," or "trace" without loss. Present in setup (method statement), middle (dream-mapping), and ending (narrative emerges), so all three gates are met. Setup (+0.5), two beats (+0.9), closure linkage (+1.0), but swappability (−0.7), and the final turn is placement, not exposure itself (−0.6).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The method—analyzing dream cameos—is signaled early, demonstrated in the constellation paragraph (fisherman, librarian, widow dreams), and pays off when "cameo appearances will fade" at closure. Two beats: dream-mapping (middle) and consequence statement (ending). The mechanics matter: cross-referencing dreams is the tool that reveals the ghost's intent. Setup (+0.6), two beats (+0.9), closure linkage (+1.0), specificity (+0.5), but the method succeeds without friction—no failed attempt or cost tied to the analysis itself (−0.8), and "fade now" is summary consequence, not dramatized (−0.4).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The glacier shrine is established in the opening line and returns throughout: candle flames, blue-veined ice, the carved window recess. The ice "remembers" at closure, reforming the snow globe's streets. Three beats: opening anchor, ice altar (protagonist lays hands), window frame (placement). The setting enables the final transformation (ice as medium) and charges the closure image. Setup (+0.7), three beats (+1.4), closure linkage (+1.3), but the shrine does not constrain a choice—it is backdrop for ritual (−0.9). Micro-setting allowance applies; the ice frame functions as tool.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>N/A</grade><comment>Required element is "None."</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"To salvage something pure" is stated early and colors the whisperer's selective focus (echo of love/regret/hope, not gold/jewels). However, the desire is never dramatized through conflicting wants or visible cost. The whisperer maps dreams and places the globe without friction; purity is achieved on schedule. The motivation frames the setup and is invoked at closure ("knowing truth…can mend"), but it does not drive a turn or force a trade-off. Setup (+0.6), closure echo (+0.6), but told-only (−0.6), no friction (−0.8), summary use (−0.4).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Borrowed starlight" appears early ("ice glows like captured moonlight—or borrowed starlight") and returns in the final third ("melted snow globe now a window…refracting borrowed starlight"). Tone is lyric, contemplative, and consistent through turns. The phrase charges the final image (starlight refracted into dreams). Lyric reprise allowance applies: early seed → final return reweights the stake. Setup (+0.6), closure linkage (+1.2), tone modulates with pressure (candle flicker → dawn violet → refracted starlight, +0.8), but the tone is static mood rather than dynamic modulation under stress (−0.6). Specificity is high (+0.5), but "borrowed" as metaphor for indirect connection is elegant yet not irreplaceable (−0.4).</comment>
