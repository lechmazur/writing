<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The guardian's motivation is declared poetically but never tested through contradictory impulses. Her action—weaving light—remains consistent without internal friction or visible cost to her personally. The drowned woman's smile feels asserted rather than earned through dramatized struggle. The guardian's capability is never bounded by genuine limits that force trade-offs.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes a clear Accumulative/Textural lens: the guardian's repeated light-weaving accumulates into the drowned woman's response, then the unbroken starlight. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the drowned woman's gentler descent, the star piercing through) with felt cost visible in "smiled—first time since her wedding day—and sank again." Orientation anchors quickly (cobalt dock, hooded guardian, canal). One meaningful deepening: the drowned woman's touch transforms rejection into acceptance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The cobalt dock, iron shutters, and dental mirror supply tactile particulars. The shutter mechanism directly enables the guardian's method, constraining her toolkit to light-bending rather than speech. The canal's "stillwater tension" and "ancient and hungry" darkness frame the stakes spatially. The final unbroken starlight charges the closure image with environmental proof of the guardian's success.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: whether the drowned woman will remain trapped in despair or be eased into acceptance. The guardian's shutter-weaving accelerates ("wove faster now") when the woman pauses, tightening pressure. The drowned woman's touch and smile constitute the reversal, earned by the guardian's persistent glyph-work. Cost is present but dispersed—the woman still sinks—which keeps resolution from full weight.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme—darkness as audience rather than enemy—emerges through the guardian's method (weaving light into darkness rather than banishing it) and lands cleanly in "to teach darkness the value of stars—not by banishing it, but by showing it what it swallows can still shine." The drowned woman's smile reweights prior sorrow with wonder. The final unbroken starlight offers a resonant, non-literal answer: persistence transforms witness into grace. No moralizing; the glyphs remain "half-spoken, half-seen, wholly necessary."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is consistent: the guardian reads wood grain as braille, sees gasps as wonder, frames darkness relationally. Distance is stable third-close with no head-hopping. However, diction drifts high ("spiralingly calm," "meniscus," "glyphs") in ways that strain the guardian's implied register. Elevated phrasing pervades peak beats ("weaving reflections into brief, shimmering constellations") where simpler syntax might sharpen pressure. Purposeful compression is legible but occasionally self-conscious.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout ("drowned sapphire," "spiralingly calm," "hope's geometry," "liquid silver and refracted moonlight," "moth wings") without pattern-teaching or payoff proportional to frequency; this triggers overwriting penalties (−0.5). "Spiralingly calm" recurs as a phrase without evolving stakes. Some lines paraphrase: "She did not speak…silence was her dialect" restates the same content. Template stems appear: "She would crouch…weaving reflections"; "By tilting them…she could sculpt." Propulsion is intermittent; the bridge-memory paragraph stalls momentum mid-scene. Information density is high in closure beats, preventing catastrophic failure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis—silent empathy enacted through light refraction rather than speech or touch—feels specific and non-obvious. The dental mirror's unconventional sacredness and the shutter-glyphs as language transform stock "guardian of the threshold" material. The drowned woman touching reflection rather than surface is a fresh inflection that grows from prior particulars. Premise commits fully without retreat into easier explanations.</comment>
