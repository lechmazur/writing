<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The carpenter's motivation is established—silence as native tongue, interpretation as goal—but remains largely abstract. His decision to restore the carousel follows naturally from his craft identity, yet the internal contradiction needed for high marks is absent; he encounters no meaningful resistance to his choice. The "song" of hands and tools offers embodied emotion, but the stakes feel predetermined rather than tested. The change at closure (completing the carousel) reads as fulfillment rather than transformation with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: mist, halo fragment, wind bells, and carousel details layer toward a final image of restoration. Orientation anchors (carpenter, morning mist, circus train) appear early enough. The closure—carousel turning, halo spinning—delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the work crystallizes into sanctuary. Cost is conceptual (beauty left incomplete as "wound") but not viscerally dramatized; the carpenter pays no visible price on the page, only completes what was always his intent. One meaningful deepening occurs when he sets the halo and begins his silent song, but the inevitability undercuts tension.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The abandoned circus train is vividly rendered—sagging cars, moss-swallowed wheels, faded murals, caramel ghosts—and the carousel in the final car becomes the spatial anchor for the climax. The halo fragment, placed on the central pole, charges the ending image. Sensory detail is selective and atmospheric (sawdust, metal sigh, wood creak), filtered through the carpenter's reverent attention. The rusted signpost and hidden oasis guide the discovery without becoming ornamental. The train's decay and the carousel's incompleteness constrain the work he must perform, meeting the 9+ gate of environment shaping choice and final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—restoring the carousel as sanctuary—is clear, but escalation is minimal. The carpenter encounters no obstacles; the wrong turn leads directly to the hidden train, the halo glows cooperatively, the horses stir without resistance. His "quietly persistent" work proceeds unopposed from discovery to completion. One tightening occurs when he begins to "sing" and the carousel responds, but this reads as confirmation rather than a turn that narrows options. The lack of friction or trade-off keeps the score below 7.0; pressure accumulates texturally but never forces a choice with on-page cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: silence as language, absence as fertile ground, beauty incomplete as wound. The halo fragment and carousel function as particulars rather than allegory. The final image—carousel turning, halo spinning, wind bells chiming—offers a resonant answer without moralizing: reverence and persistence redeem what was abandoned. The "quietly persistent" work and the "wrong turn" that becomes compass true north avoid platitude through embodied action. Subtext operates in the wordless song and the world leaning closer to listen. The ending reweights the opening silence from emptiness to presence, meeting the 9+ quick test cleanly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable throughout. The perceptual signature—silence as native tongue, reverence for craft—is consistent and specific. However, diction drifts into elevated register ("reliquary of whimsy," "cloisters," "sovereign") that sits uneasily with a working carpenter's interior voice. Psychic distance is controlled, and the carpenter's selective attention (tools, wood, silence) reads as character-specific. The "song" metaphor (hands, breath, chisel rhythm) is purposeful but borders on authorial poeticizing. No dialogue present. The voice is distinct but occasionally prioritizes lyricism over interiority, preventing entry into the 9-band.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout—"syrup" time, "curious cats" mist, "tired beasts" train cars, "caramel ghosts"—and while individually effective, the accumulation in every beat creates a lyric gloss that slows momentum. Several metaphors verge on mixed: "silence became song, became sanctuary, became salvation" chains abstractions without concrete anchoring. Template cadence appears in parallel constructions: "not with voice, but with hands, with breath, with the tilt…" and "One horse lowered…Another turned…" Propulsion suffers in the middle third as description dominates action. No paraphrase loops, but the ornamental density and unvaried lyricism prevent higher scores.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The silent artisan restoring a forgotten wonder is a familiar archetype, and the halo fragment + carousel combination leans toward fantasy-quest template. The "wrong turn to hidden place" and "beauty incomplete as wound" are well-worn. Transformation occurs through specific detail—wind bells, rusted signpost shaped like clown's grin, painted constellations—and the wordless song innovation adds freshness. The piece commits fully to its lyric register and the carpenter's reverence, avoiding hedged ambiguity. However, the emotional arc (discovery → restoration → completion) follows a predictable path without structural risk or moral complexity that would elevate originality into the high 7s or 8s.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The silent carousel carpenter is present throughout and his choices—following the sound, climbing aboard, setting the halo, beginning to work—drive the action. Setup is immediate, middle development shows him moving through the train and beginning restoration, and payoff has him completing the carousel. However, his choices face no friction; he encounters no dilemma or trade-off. The silence trait shapes perception but does not constrain a choice with cost. Two beats (discovery, restoration) involve him causally, and closure links to his work, but the lack of difficult decision-making and swappability (any reverent craftsman could fill the role with minor edits) cap the score near mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The halo fragment appears early (coat pocket, dream origin), is placed on the carousel's central pole at the climax, and spins "like a crown returned" in the final image—three beats. It glows, pulses, casts silver light, signaling its importance. However, its function is atmospheric rather than causal; removing it would not break the carousel's restoration logic, only the mystical charge. The carpenter does not choose to use it in a way that forecloses another option; it simply enhances. Early signal, closure participation, and recurring presence earn mid-range, but lack of causal pressure and mechanical specificity (why this fragment? what does it do beyond glow?) prevent entry into the 7+ band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Misting hush is established early (morning mist, world wrapped in hush) and returns in the climax ("misting hush thickened, as if the world leaned closer"). It frames atmosphere and the carpenter's interpretive silence. However, it does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; it is descriptive rather than active. The concept shapes tone and resonates thematically (silence as possibility, absence as presence) but remains a backdrop. Two moments (opening, climax) involve it, and closure echoes it, meeting the lyric-resonance allowance threshold for low-6s, but the lack of causal pressure or cost linkage caps it there.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Quietly persistent is stated early and demonstrated through the carpenter's methodical work—"worked through the chime of wind bells, carving flanks, polishing hooves." It enables the restoration to completion. However, it is not tested by opposition or shown to foreclose an easier path; the trait aligns with his goal without friction. Label appears once; the action of persistent work spans the middle and ending. The trait fits the character and closure but does not create a visible trade-off (e.g., exhaustion, missed opportunity). Functional integration without cost caps the score in the mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Sing appears at the climax and is the pivot that animates the carousel—"he began to sing—not with voice, but with hands, with breath…" The act is irreplaceable; the wordless song through craft tools is specific and transforms the moment. It drives two beats (initial singing, carousel stirring) and directly shapes the ending (horses move, halo spins). Setup is implicit (his silence as native tongue primes the wordless song), development is the climactic act, and payoff is immediate. The song is causally essential and specific, meeting high integration. However, it arrives late (final third), and no cost is tied to singing itself—no strain, no sacrifice—capping entry into the 8+ band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>A wrong turn at the rusted signpost leads him to the hidden oasis and circus train—setup occurs early. The turn is narrated, not dramatized, and functions as a convenience mechanism rather than a method he employs with intent or cost. It does not constrain his choices or shape his approach; it simply delivers him to the location. One beat (the discovery) involves it causally, but it is swappable (any chance encounter would serve). No middle development beyond the mention, and no closure participation. The "compass needle finding true north" thematic gloss does not add mechanical integration. Functional but replaceable, mid-band at best.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The abandoned circus train is the story's sole location and richly detailed—sagging cars, faded murals, rusted ticket booths, carousel in the final car. It supplies the carousel that becomes the object of restoration, constraining the carpenter's work (half-built, horses frozen). Spatial choreography is clear (climbing aboard, moving through cars, reaching the engine's heart). Setup is early, middle development shows him navigating and discovering, and payoff is the carousel turning within the train. The train is essential to the plot and irreplaceable. However, it does not pressure a choice or alter tactics; it is a static container. Strong presence and closure linkage earn mid-to-high 6s, but lack of active constraint caps it below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Inside the chime of wind bells brackets the work—wind bells hang from the train's awning, chime in harmony during the restoration, and chime "a single, perfect note" at the end. They mark the timeframe poetically but do not tighten decisions; no clock pressures the carpenter. The phrase appears in the opening (dream origin) and ending, meeting lyric-resonance allowance, but the middle is unmarked by temporal urgency. Two beats (beginning, ending) involve the bells, but they are ornamental rather than a live constraint. Swappable with any atmospheric time marker. Functional for tone, replaceable for stakes.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>To interpret silence as possibility is stated explicitly early ("his motivation was not treasure or redemption, but interpretation") and demonstrated through his approach: he follows the sound, treats the carousel as sanctuary, and sings wordlessly. The motivation shapes his goal (restoration) and aligns with the ending (silence becomes song, presence). However, it is never conflicted or tested; no friction between this desire and a competing want appears. The motivation is consistent and closure-linked, meeting two gates (setup, payoff), but the lack of dramatized friction or cost tied to interpretation caps the score in the low 6s. Told more than shown in choices under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Whispering gleam is realized in the final image—"whispering gleam of wood against wood, halo fragment spinning"—and echoes the tone throughout: reverent, hushed, lyric. The piece sustains a consistent atmospheric register (silence, mist, chime, glow) that modulates gently with the carpenter's progress from discovery to restoration. The tone charges the ending by framing the carousel's animation as sacred rather than mechanical. However, the tone is static rather than dynamic; it does not shift under pressure or tension. It is coherent and purposeful, meeting closure participation, but lacks the modulation needed for 7+. Solid lyric execution without tonal risk.</comment>
