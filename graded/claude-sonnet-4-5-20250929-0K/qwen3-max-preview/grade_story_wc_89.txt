<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The beast whisperer's motivation is consistently rendered—grief transformed into active conjuring—but her interior life relies heavily on abstract metaphor ("tectonic plates shifting beneath her soul") rather than embodied contradiction. The phoenix relationship is told through summary ("its laugh like wind through canyon flutes") instead of dramatized micro-choices that reveal competing impulses. The final "no longer just whisperer, no longer just beast" reads as a label for transformation rather than a lived shift with visible cost in her stance or capability.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive promptly; the orchard setting and phoenix-summoning goal are clear. However, the closure lacks decisive cost: the phoenix simply returns, the bond "reforges," and they walk together without any on-page forfeiture or narrowed option. The spice-conjuring mechanism operates as decoration—no failed attempt, no tactical adjustment—so the ending reads as wish-fulfillment rather than earned reconfiguration. Under a Causal lens, the "because" chain dissolves into poetic assertion at the moment of return.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The orchard's "permanent moonlight" and "silver bark" anchor atmosphere effectively, and the spices (saffron, cardamom, cinnamon) are named with sensory detail. Yet the environment remains postcard-static: no branch blocks her movement, no moon-phase shift alters the conjuring, no tactile constraint shapes her final choice. The setting charges the tone but does not narrow options or participate in the closure action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—reforging the bond—is signaled early but never faces genuine opposition or cost. The spice ritual succeeds on first attempt; no reversal tests her commitment. The "paradoxically steady tremor" is asserted but not dramatized through a visible trade-off (does steadiness prevent her from fleeing doubt? No such moment appears). Pressure remains declarative ("threshold trembling") rather than escalating through narrowed options or forced sacrifice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The theme of love outlasting entropy emerges through image and ritual, avoiding overt sermon until the penultimate paragraph's "she had conjured a covenant" edges toward thesis. The fortune cookie and spice motifs recur but function more as atmospheric tokens than as constraints that force thematic friction. The final "universe leaned closer, intimate as a lover's sigh" invites reflection but lacks the non-literal answer or reweighted cost that would elevate to resonant closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited; the narrator's diction is lush and controlled ("aromas that bent gravity," "translation: bone learning feather"). However, the register is consistently elevated without modulation under pressure—crisis and calm share identical syntactic density. Dialogue, when present, feels arch ("Where to now, anchor?" / "Everywhere") and lacks subtext or goal-driven indirection. Filter verbs ("she whispered," "she breathed") appear frequently but fit the lyric voice without obscuring immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Figurative language saturates nearly every sentence ("wind through canyon flutes," "smoke serpents," "ember-feathers and starlight eyes"), creating density without corresponding causal propulsion. Paraphrase loops abound: "not grief, nor vengeance, but something quieter, hungrier" / "not fear, not excitement, but the quiet certainty"; "not to command, but to remember" / "not to choke, but to lift"; "not by force, but by faith; not by breaking, but by bending." Template negation stems recur across six distinct beats, flattening rhythm (−0.6). The closure beat ("not out of the orchard, but into its deeper truth") continues the pattern, dulling the final image (−0.3 additional). Stock metaphor strings ("pulsed brighter," "cradles seeds") and therapy-speak inflections ("surrendered—not to loss, but to reciprocity") further reduce precision. Apply −1.2 total in Q7 for patterned artifacts touching closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The fairy-tale orchard under permanent moonlight and phoenix resurrection are familiar high-fantasy tropes executed without transformation; swap names and the arc remains generic summoning-ritual-succeeds. The spice-conjuring via scent is a fresh detail but functions as window dressing rather than a constraint that reshapes the core problem. The fortune cookie invitation and "beast whisperer" role are mentioned but not integrated into a non-obvious synthesis—the whisperer does not negotiate or fail, she simply enacts ritual and receives reward.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The beast whisperer is present throughout and performs the central conjuring, but her role is largely observational and procedural. She crushes spices, whispers memories, and receives the phoenix without a key choice that alters tactics or stakes. The "decision" to surrender is asserted ("she did not resist") but not dramatized through competing impulses or visible cost on the page.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The fortune appears in paragraph four, recurs as "invitation" in paragraph five, and is referenced obliquely near the end ("she knew now why the fortune had found her"). It frames expectation but does not constrain a middle choice or reweight meaning at closure—it remains thematic gloss rather than a causal hinge. Two touches across beats, but no tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>Reluctance is mentioned once ("reluctant metamorphosis had begun") as a label but never dramatized. The protagonist does not resist or negotiate the transformation; she "surrendered—not to loss, but to reciprocity" without friction. The metamorphosis shapes the thematic claim but does not narrow options or create visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Paradoxically steady" appears twice as a descriptor ("paradoxically steady tremor," "steps paradoxically steady") but never constrains or enables an action. No scene shows steadiness preventing retreat or enabling precision under stress. Label-only use without causal work.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Conjuring is the central action: signaled early (paragraph six), executed in the middle (paragraphs six through thirteen), and completed at closure (phoenix appears, bond reforged). However, the conjuring succeeds on first attempt without reversal, so it does not redefine options or force tactical adjustment. Present across beats and essential to plot, but lacks the cost-linked pressure that would elevate above 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The spices (saffron, cardamom, cinnamon) are introduced in paragraph six, their scents released in paragraph seven, and their effect continues through paragraph twelve. The method is signaled and visually present, but the mechanics remain opaque—no failed mixture, no dosage choice, no tradeoff between speed and control. Functional across beats but swappable with other ritual catalysts.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The fairy-tale orchard with permanent moonlight is anchored early and provides atmospheric continuity. The orchard "responds" (branches lean, blossoms pulse) but does not constrain movement or supply a resource that alters the conjuring outcome. Postcard setting without tactical pressure; present across beats but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"After the phoenix rises" appears in the timeframe specification but is contradicted on the page: the opening states "long after its ashes had cooled," framing the story as occurring after the phoenix's death, not after a rise. The timeline does not tighten decisions; no clock or deadline shapes urgency. Minimal integration, possible prompt misalignment.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The motivation to reforge the bond is stated early (paragraph three), drives the conjuring action, and is fulfilled at closure when the phoenix returns. However, the desire is never conflicted—no moment where she doubts the wisdom of resurrection or weighs the cost of disturbing death. Told and pursued but not friction-tested; present in setup, middle, and payoff, eligible for mid-6s, but lacks the visible cost for higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Cosmic intimacy is sustained through diction ("universe leaned closer, intimate as a lover's sigh," "velvet dark beyond") and the orchard's responsive atmosphere. The tone remains consistent but static—no modulation between urgency and reflection to match pressure shifts. The final image ("intimate as a lover's sigh") charges the ending with the specified tone, lifting the score into the 5s, but the lack of tonal escalation prevents higher placement.</comment>
