<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The cartomancer's motivation is clear—retrieving lost time with her daughter—and embodied through concrete ritual actions (unfastening, pressing palm, crawling through the saucer). However, interiority leans heavily on elevated metaphor ("grief's quiet magnetism," "archive of evaporated seconds") rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The final choice to descend feels asserted rather than earned through on-page struggle; we see renunciation of grip but no visible cost that forecloses a live option. The daughter remains off-page until the porch-swing voice, limiting relational crucible pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through layered images (shard, moss, phantom tablecloths) and the saucer's fracture opening functions as threshold. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration—the shard becomes whole, the mother descends transformed—but cost remains oblique; "surrender" and "lighter heart" are told, not shown through a specific forfeited option. Orientation anchors late: "onyx-ink cartomancer" and "midnight glade above clouds" are vivid but "after the birth—not of a child, but of silence" delays who/what/when clarity past ~120 words without teaching disorientation as pattern. The piece coheres under its lens but the Cost Proof Test is weak: no exact sentence makes the price legible at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The midnight glade above clouds is vividly rendered with sensory specificity (thin air, moss, clouds thickening into spectral hands) and the environment constrains choice: roots rise to cradle her hand, the saucer becomes a threshold she must crawl through. The micro-setting—her body pressed to moss, forehead to saucer rim—drives the climactic crossing. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout. However, the glade's mechanics (why this place pools time) are asserted rather than discovered through action, and the porch swing at the end arrives without spatial setup, creating a brief geography gap.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: recover lost time/connection with her daughter. The piece tightens through one meaningful sequence—placing the shard, spectral hands responding, crossing the threshold—but escalation under the Accumulative lens relies on density of metaphor rather than choices that narrow options. The protagonist's agency is primarily observational and receptive (kneeling, whispering, pressing) until the threshold crossing, which reweights her stance. Cost is told ("final unfastening of her grip") rather than shown as a forfeited alternative. The saucer healing and the daughter's voice calling feel convenient rather than earned by prior sacrifice, softening the pressure at closure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme of time, memory, and maternal regret emerges through concrete particulars: the cracked saucer, inked hand tracings, the ritual of presence. The piece resists overt moralizing and the final image (saucer unbroken, descending to the waiting tea) reweights prior material. However, "cloudbound repentance" and "willingly perplexed" function as prompt labels rather than earned concepts; "repentance—not for sin, but for surrender" is a thematic echo that tells the reader what to feel. The archive of "unspent kiss, every postponed lullaby" lists missed moments without dramatic friction. The ending avoids stating a moral but the transformation feels asserted rather than inevitable.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with a distinct lyric register: "onyx-ink cartomancer," "choking beauty," "archive of evaporated seconds." Voice is consistent and purposeful, though diction sometimes drifts into elevated abstraction ("grief's quiet magnetism," "transmute regret into grace") that feels decorative rather than character-particular. Psychic distance fluctuates—close bodily detail (trembling fingers, breath ragged) alternates with distant metaphysical summary—without clear modulation tied to pressure. No dialogue to evaluate. Perceptual signature is poetic but not distinctly the cartomancer's; the narration could describe any lyric quest. Filter verbs ("she understood then," "she realized") are sparse and acceptable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Prose is lyric and imagistic but suffers from density overload and paraphrase loops. "Lost time did not vanish—it ascended" and "not to bury, but to remember" and "not to reclaim, but to bless" create a repetitive "not X, but Y" template cadence across multiple beats. Figurative language appears in nearly every sentence without pattern-teaching or payoff, muddling high-pressure moments: "spectral hands," "vapor," "amber air," "shimmering," "silver mist" stack without clear referents. Adjacent lines restate: "lost time did not vanish—it ascended" is immediately followed by explanation of the same concept. Register drifts into abstract elevation ("transmute regret into grace") that clashes with concrete ritual action. Artifacts touch closure ("sealed not by glue, but by surrender"), triggering the disallow-9+ rule and −1.2 deduction for template runs and opacity at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The premise—cartomancy ritual to recover lost maternal time—offers a fresh synthesis of grief memoir and magical realism. The hand-tracing birthday custom is a specific, memorable detail. However, the emotional arc (regretful mother seeks redemption, finds grace) follows a familiar template without transformation through non-obvious moral calculus. The glade, spectral hands, and threshold crossing feel like genre furniture rather than inevitable expressions of this character's particular wound. The saucer's crack-as-map and healing-through-surrender are symbolic conveniences that arrive to resolve rather than complicate. Proximity check: "where lost time accumulates" and "archive of evaporated seconds" echo common metaphors for memory without fresh inflection.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The onyx-ink cartomancer is present throughout and her ritual actions (placing shard, whispering, pressing palm, crawling through threshold) drive key beats. However, her choices are primarily receptive and observational rather than decisive; the glade responds, she follows. Her agency at closure (descending as mother) is a stance shift rather than a choice that narrows options. Early signal is strong, beat involvement spans the piece, but causal pressure is low—she enacts ritual steps without visible tradeoffs or costs that alter tactics. The transformation from cartomancer to mother is told rather than earned through on-page struggle.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dolls' tea set saucer crack appears early, is handled in multiple beats (withdrawn, placed on moss, glows, becomes threshold, emerges whole), and its fracture functions as both map and portal. It returns at closure "unbroken" and reweighted as "compass, covenant." The crack's transformation from wound to threshold to healed object drives the accumulative design. Strong setup, clear development (threshold crossing), and closure linkage. However, the healing mechanism (surrender) is abstract rather than tied to specific actions, and the saucer could be replaced by another fractured keepsake without breaking logic, limiting irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Cloudbound repentance is named twice ("summoning cloudbound repentance," "where cloudbound repentance waited") but functions as thematic label rather than on-page constraint. The concept does not shape tactics or alter options; the glade's response (clouds thickening, spectral hands) would proceed identically if this phrase were omitted. The qualification "not for sin, but for surrender" is exposition rather than dramatized pressure. Present but ornamental—score reflects label-only use without causal work.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Willingly perplexed appears once early ("Her willingly perplexed gaze traced the horizon's silvered edge, not in confusion but in reverence") and once near the end ("willingly perplexed heart lighter"). The attribute is described as intentional openness to mystery but does not constrain or enable any on-page action. No visible tradeoff: her perplexity could be removed and all choices would proceed unchanged. Label-only mention without causal pressure or cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Unfastening appears three times with escalating significance: unfastens satchel clasp (opening), unfastens coat to bare tattooed wrist (vulnerability), "final unfastening of her grip" (closure metaphor). The action shapes the arc from practical opening to symbolic release and ties directly to the transformation at closure. However, the unfastening is thematic rather than mechanically decisive—the ritual could proceed through other actions (opening, revealing, releasing) without structural collapse. Strong setup and closure linkage, but swappability limits the score.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The family custom of tracing hands on birthday tablecloths is introduced early as backstory, drives the emotional core (her daughter's inked fingers, the ritual as ward against oblivion), and returns in the vision sequence ("tracings on the phantom tablecloths stirred") and at closure ("The tracing would be done"). The method frames stakes and the final vow. However, its mechanics are told rather than shown in action on the page, and the tracing itself does not constrain present choices—it is invoked and remembered rather than enacted. Two-gate presence (setup, closure) with lyric resonance lifts it into mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The midnight glade above clouds is established immediately, provides vivid sensory anchors (thin air, moss, clouds, silvered horizon), and supplies resources that affect outcome: the moss cradles her hand, roots rise, the threshold opens. The environment pressures the crossing choice and the descent. Strong setup and development. However, the glade's mechanics (why time pools here) are asserted, and the final setting shift to the porch swing below is unanchored spatially, creating a seam. The glade matters but does not uniquely constrain tactics—another liminal space could serve.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>After the birth functions as backstory anchor ("after the birth—not of a child, but of silence") but does not create urgency or tighten present decisions. The timeframe establishes emotional context (loss has already occurred) but remains vague—no clock pressures the ritual, no deadline alters tactics. Time is thematic rather than tactical. The phrase "where time had waited, patient, after all" in the ending gestures toward temporal repricing but does not land as felt cost. Functional setup without development or closure pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>To find where lost time accumulates is stated early ("she sought where lost time accumulates, convinced it pooled") and drives the quest structure. The motivation shapes her journey to the glade and ritual actions. However, the desire is told rather than dramatized through on-page friction: she seeks, finds, and is granted transformation without visible obstacles or conflicting wants. The motivation unfolds as scripted quest rather than contested choice. Setup and closure participation are clear, but lack of dramatized conflict or cost limits the score.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Choking beauty is named in the opening ("air thin and shimmering with choking beauty") and returns in the vision sequence ("shimmering, heavy with the choking beauty of what might have been"). The tone—beauty laced with sorrow and urgency—is sustained through lyric elevation and grief-laden imagery. Tone modulates subtly from quest urgency to reflective sorrow to quiet resolution. However, the phrase itself is used twice as label rather than embodied consistently through diction and rhythm across beats. Coherent tonal arc with purposeful callback, but the specific phrase is not indispensable to achieve the effect.</comment>
