<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The spinner's motivation is clear and her final choice—weaving herself into the tapestry—is earned by the amber bead's warmth and the puzzle's revelation. However, interiority relies heavily on poetic abstraction ("raveling silence," "gravity of latent sacrifice") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The sacrifice itself is told through lyric summary ("With each shuttle throw, a piece of her dissolved—memories of his laugh") rather than dramatized micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. The man's brief recognition scene at the end provides emotional closure but his interior remains thin.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates pressure through discovery (puzzle), transformation (loom reconfiguration), and sacrifice (weaving herself). Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (the message arrives; the spinner's essence persists in stars) with felt cost—her physical dissolution. The lens holds: each beat deepens the textural stakes rather than narrowing causal options. One persistent constraint (the amber bead's guidance) shapes the final weave, though the mechanics of "weaving thresholds" remain abstract.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The orchard, bamboo grove, and loom are vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (moss-slick boulder, plum pits for dye, dew-laced petals). The loom itself constrains the final choice: she must rebuild it around the puzzle frame to send the message. Spatial choreography is mostly clear, though the transition from orchard to "city of glass towers" lacks grounding anchors. The micro-setting (loom as tool and workspace) charges the closure image when it becomes "just a frame" holding her afterimage.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: carrying a message to a love unseen for seven winters. Pressure accumulates through the puzzle discovery, loom reconfiguration, and the solstice deadline. The climactic weaving sequence narrows options (she must dissolve herself thread by thread) with visible cost: memories transmuted into glyphs, her chair left empty. The sacrifice is described rather than dramatized in micro-choices, which softens its impact. The man's recognition provides a resolution beat but his agency is minimal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: love as labor, message as self-erasure, connection across impossible distance requiring sacrifice. The amber bead and puzzle shift meaning from gifts/objects to conduits for transformation. The final image—spinner's essence woven into stars, man receiving the glowing bead—offers a resonant answer without stating a moral. The piece resists tidy resolution (she is gone but the message arrived) and the cost is undeniable. Minor weakness: phrases like "raveling silence" and "time's unraveling tapestry" border on thematic echo.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. The prose carries a lyric, mythic texture consistent with the fairy-tale frame. Psychic distance is controlled, staying close to the spinner's perceptions until the final switch to the man. However, pervasive figurative density ("raveling silence," "hush of time's unraveling tapestry," "stoically sparkling") creates a uniform poetic register that can dull immediacy in high-pressure beats. The spinner's perceptual signature is consistent but not sharply particular; her way of noticing reads as generic mythic rather than character-specific.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Overwriting pervades: nearly every sentence carries figurative weight ("raveling silence," "time's unraveling tapestry," "stoically sparkling," "hush of time's unraveling tapestry"). Template cadence appears in the weaving sequence: "The first pass pulled a sigh... the second, a shiver... With each shuttle throw, a piece of her dissolved." Paraphrase loops: "raveling silence" recurs four times; "time's unraveling tapestry" appears twice in identical phrasing. The phrase "jigsaw puzzle edges found in a rummage sale box" is repeated verbatim as a nested descriptor. These artifacts cluster in peak beats (the solstice weaving), dulling propulsion. Applying patterned-artifact penalty pack: −1.0 for loops and template cadence touching closure. Information density is high but clarity suffers under the figurative load.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The premise—weaving a message by dissolving oneself into the tapestry—offers a fresh angle on separation and sacrifice. The puzzle-as-map and loom-as-threshold transformation are specific inventions. However, the fairy-tale frame (forgotten orchard, ancient love, mystical objects) follows familiar templates without sharp deviation. Emotional specificity is present but the lyric distance keeps the particulars from feeling deeply lived-in. The solstice timing and bamboo/plum setting provide texture but read as carefully chosen details rather than inevitable necessities. The final image (amber bead appearing in the city) is evocative but the urban contrast arrives too late to integrate fully.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The wistful loom spinner appears throughout and her choices drive the narrative: she gathers plum pits, finds the puzzle, rebuilds the loom, and weaves herself into the tapestry. Setup is immediate; development includes the loom reconfiguration and puzzle assembly; closure is her dissolution into the final weave. Causal pressure: her decision to sacrifice herself narrows options and enables the message's arrival. Cost is clear (her physical existence). One friction: the sacrifice is described in lyric summary rather than dramatized through micro-choices.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The tree sap amber bead is introduced early (around her neck), returns with functional pressure (its pulsing warmth guides puzzle assembly), is tied to the loom's central crossbeam where it glows and casts reflections, acts as a beacon during the weave, and reappears in the city scene to deliver the message. Setup, development (two beats: puzzle guidance and loom beacon), and payoff (final delivery) are all present. Causal pressure: it enables navigation through "folds of fractured time." Cost linkage: its use is inseparable from her sacrifice. Specificity: its trapped firefly and origin story make it irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The "raveling silence" is named repeatedly (opening, mid-story, and near the end) and described as expectant, deepening, and eventually sighing in completion. It shapes atmosphere and tone but does not directly constrain choices or alter tactics on the page. Setup is present; it recurs with reweighted meaning at closure ("the raveling silence sighed—not in loss, but in completion"). However, it remains largely abstract and lyric rather than a mechanical force that changes options. Functional reprise without middle development or causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Stoically sparkling" is applied to the loom ("stoically sparkling with dew and stubborn glimmers of mica") and later to its metal ("stoically sparkling metal"). It is descriptive but does not constrain or enable any on-page action with cost. The loom's physical state matters (moss-slick, crooked, later reconfigured), but the "stoically sparkling" trait is ornamental. No setup-development-payoff arc; label-only mention. Late compound appearance (second mention in final third) without causal work.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Recommence" appears mid-story when the spinner understands she must "recommence—not weaving cloth, but weaving thresholds." This realization drives the loom's dismantling and reconfiguration, which in turn enables the climactic sacrifice. Setup occurs at the recognition beat; development includes the physical rebuild; payoff is the successful weave and message delivery. The action redefines her goal and tactics. Causal pressure is strong. One friction: the word "recommence" itself is not deeply embedded in dialogue or repeated; the concept (beginning again with new purpose) does the work.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The jigsaw puzzle found in a rummage sale box is introduced in the first third, assembled over three dawns on the loom's warp beam, and reveals the doorway-map that teaches her how to weave thresholds. The puzzle's runes and image directly enable the loom reconfiguration. Setup, development (assembly beats), and payoff (its frame becomes the loom's core structure) are all present. Causal pressure: without the puzzle, she cannot build the new loom. Specificity: "jigsaw puzzle edges" and "rummage sale box" are exact descriptors. One friction: the mechanics of how puzzle edges translate to loom function remain abstract.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The forgotten orchard deep in a bamboo forest is established in the opening line and remains the primary location throughout. It provides resources (plum pits for dye, the rummage sale box, the gnarled trees and moss-slick boulder for the loom's placement). The setting's isolation underscores the "impossible distance" and the bamboo grove's stillness participates in the climactic weave ("bamboo leaves curled inward as if in reverence"). Setup is immediate; development includes resource use; payoff is the setting's response to the weave and the orchard holding her afterimage. Causal role is moderate; the setting enables but does not tightly constrain.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The timeframe "through the hush of time's unraveling tapestry" appears as a recurring phrase (three times) and shapes tone, but time is not tracked as a tightening constraint. The solstice provides a deadline for the weaving, and the opening references "seven winters" since the love was last seen. However, time mostly "unravels" and "pools like spilled ink" rather than forcing choices. The phrase is setup and reprise; the solstice is a single development beat. No persistent clock pressure that alters tactics. Lyric resonance without causal force.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The motivation to carry a message across impossible distance is stated early (she wove "a message—woven in indigo and silver—for a love she hadn't seen in seven winters") and drives every major choice: assembling the puzzle, reconfiguring the loom, and sacrificing herself to send the message. The desire is dramatized through action (three dawns of puzzle work, dismantling the loom, the weaving sequence). Friction is present: the cost is her existence. Setup, development (multiple beats of preparation and execution), and payoff (message arrives, man weeps in recognition) are all clear. Internal conflict is implied but not deeply embodied.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The tone of latent sacrifice is established early (the loom's "stubborn glimmers" refusing despair, the amber bead as unspoken vow) and builds through the realization that she must weave herself into the pattern. The tone modulates: expectant during the puzzle assembly, grave during the solstice preparation, and quietly exalted during the weave ("She didn't weep. Tears would unravel the weave"). The final sigh of the raveling silence ("not in loss, but in completion") charges the closure. Coherent through turns; the tone reweights the ending by framing dissolution as fulfillment rather than tragedy.</comment>
