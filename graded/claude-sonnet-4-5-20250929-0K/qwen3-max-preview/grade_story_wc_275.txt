<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara's character is established through concrete actions (kneeling in soil, finger-brushing stems, sheathing the knife) and her perceptual signature is distinct. The internal contradiction between her violent inheritance and chosen gentleness operates across multiple beats. However, the piece leans heavily on demonstration-through-vignette rather than a single high-pressure choice that tests competing impulses in real time. The visitor interactions provide external validation but minimal on-page friction that forces Elara to weigh costs.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) as closure: Elara's ritual of sheathing the knife and offering cuttings to strangers forecloses violence with visible cost (her father's legacy, isolation in a charred world). Orientation anchors are present early (glass dome, desert rose farm, post-tower setting). The final beat with the child reweights prior material but adds no new pressure or tightening; the story's stakes remain static from opening to close. Cost is conceptually legible but emotionally diffuse—no single moment makes the price undeniable on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The glass dome, red soil, ballast sandbag scrap, and knife are all concretely present and handled across multiple beats. The dome's "liquid gold" light and the scrap's "coarse weave" constrain Elara's choices (salvage, planting, gifting) and charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clean throughout. The micro-setting (sandbag-lined planter, knife sheath ritual) functions as setting and directly shapes her present actions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—cultivating peace in a post-collapse world—is signaled early and held throughout. However, the piece offers no meaningful tightening or escalation under the Accumulative lens: each visitor encounter (man, child) demonstrates the same gesture (gift, silence, teaching) without raising cost or narrowing options. The knife-sheathing ritual is repeated but not tested; no on-page moment forces Elara to choose between competing goods or pay a visible price. The deepening is conceptual but not felt in scene pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme (continuity through chaos, choosing gentleness as defiance) emerges from concrete particulars: the sandbag scrap, the knife ritual, plants learning from broken pottery. The final exchange with the child offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. However, "engraved quiet," "weave the threads," and "ballast for the soul" veer toward overt symbolic labeling. The piece avoids didacticism in dialogue but occasionally indulges thematic echo in narration.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: Elara notices "tremor in a petal before wind arrived" and "grief in a root's curl." Diction remains character-bound and voice modulates appropriately across beats. Dialogue is sparse but functional, carrying subtext in Elara's economy ("Continuity," "Not monuments"). No head-hopping. Some filter verbs ("she'd trace," "she'd sheathe") are voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy. Psychic distance is controlled throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but several lines loop or restate: "She didn't preach. She demonstrated" is a meta-summary of what has already been shown; "violence folded away, not forgotten, but chosen against" is elegant but paraphrases the prior sentence about the knife. Figurative language is purposeful but occasionally stacks: "tranquil blaze," "engraved quiet," "liquid gold," "stubborn memory" cluster without breathing room. Opening and closing lines are strong. No major grammar or sequencing errors, but synonym churn appears in the sandbag-scrap descriptions ("memory, gravity, the hush of descent" vs. "the grit still clinging like stubborn memory").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of bounty-hunter legacy, post-apocalyptic horticulture, and pacifist ritual feels specific and non-obvious. The ballast-sandbag scrap as both physical and symbolic anchor is fresh. However, the premise (warrior's child chooses peace, teaches through example in ruined world) is a familiar template, and the story does not fully transform it through unexpected moral calculus or a risky structural choice. Emotional truth is present but the visitor vignettes follow a predictable pattern. The piece commits to its vision but plays safely within the contours of the prompt.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her choices (salvaging the scrap, sheathing the knife, offering tea and seeds) drive multiple beats and shape the ending. However, her role as "bounty hunter's daughter" remains largely backstory context; the pacifist stance is already established at the opening, so no key turn tests the inheritance conflict on the page. She observes, demonstrates, and teaches, but does not face a live decision where her father's legacy pressures her toward violence. Setup, development (middle demonstrations), and payoff (gift to child) are all present. Causal pressure is moderate; the element enables the premise but is not indispensable to the specific closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The sandbag scrap appears in three distinct beats: salvage mention, lining the planter base, wrapping seeds for the man and child. It carries memory and continuity (thematic freight) and is handled on the page. Early signal is clear; it shapes Elara's gifting tactics and charges the final exchange. However, the scrap's unique properties (coarse weave, manufacturer's stamp, grit) are described but do not constrain or enable a choice beyond generic "wrapping material." Swappable with any salvaged cloth without breaking story logic. Present across beats and tied to closure, but not causally irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Engraved quiet" is introduced early as a descriptor and returns at night when Elara traces the sandbag scrap. It functions primarily as atmospheric theme—"presence of peace, engraved into every leaf, every stem"—rather than shaping on-page stakes or tactics. The concept is talked about but not tested; no moment where Elara must choose between quiet and noise, silence and speech, with visible cost. Setup and lyric reprise are present, but middle development is absent. Ornamental use that supports tone without altering options.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Senselessly perceptive" is signaled early and demonstrated through specific observations (tremor in petal, grief in root's curl). It enables Elara's horticultural success and teaching moments but does not constrain a choice or impose a visible tradeoff. The trait operates as characterization rather than plot lever; removing it would soften her voice but not break the story's logic. Present in setup and middle beats; no closure participation. Functional but replaceable with "attentive gardener" or similar.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Sheathe" appears in two distinct beats: the nightly ritual ("She'd sheathe her father's old hunting knife each dusk") and the repetition at night ("She'd sheathe the knife again, even when no one watched"). The action is described as a vow and ritual that forecloses violence, charging thematic resonance. However, the knife is never drawn or tested on the page; sheathing is demonstration, not turn. Early signal, thematic payoff, but the action does not redefine options—Elara's pacifism is static throughout. Could be replaced with another ritual (e.g., laying down a weapon, locking a door) with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Inculcating plants with values" is introduced explicitly in the opening third ("She inculcated plants with...patience...resilience...forgiveness") and demonstrated through her teaching the man and child to whisper to seeds. The method shapes Elara's daily work and enables the middle beats (offering cuttings as lessons). However, the mechanics are summary ("spoke to them in lullabies") rather than shown in scene with visible cost or constraint. Present in setup and development; the child's final question touches it obliquely. Functional but the method itself could be replaced with "nurturing plants" without breaking closure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The glass-domed desert rose farm is anchored early and returns across multiple beats: opening description, the dome refracting sun into "liquid gold," the gate where visitors stand wary. The enclosure supplies physical resources (shelter, soil, plants) and creates spatial pressure (inside/outside boundary, scavengers at the gate). The dome's light charges the "tranquil blaze" tone and the final scene occurs within this setting. Environment shapes Elara's tactics (salvage, cultivation, gifting at the threshold) and the closure unit. Essential to story logic and tone; removal would collapse the premise.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"After the tower falls" is established early (opening line, wanted posters in ruins) and frames the post-collapse context. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions or tactics on the page; the story operates in a vague "weeks later" present with no urgency or countdown. The tower's fall supplies backstory motivation but does not pressure Elara's current choices. Setup is clear, but development and closure participation are absent. The element provides setting context but is not causally active; the story would function identically if set "after the war" or "during the drought."</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elara's desire to "weave continuity through chaos" is dramatized in her actions (salvaging the scrap, gifting seeds, sheathing the knife) and articulated in dialogue ("Someone has to weave the threads between then and after"). The motivation drives multiple beats and shapes the ending (teaching the child to plant memory). However, the desire is never conflicted on the page; Elara faces no moment where continuity and self-preservation, or continuity and another value, pull in opposite directions. Setup, development, and payoff are present, but friction between want and cost is told rather than shown.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>"Tranquil blaze" is established early ("the glass dome refracted the sun into liquid gold, bathing the farm in a tranquil blaze") and held across beats: serene actions (kneeling, tracing the scrap) set against the "charred world outside." The paradox modulates with pressure in the visitor encounters (wary scavengers, hollow-eyed refugees meet Elara's calm offering). The tone charges the final image (child leaving "with dirt under her nails and something like peace"). Coherent throughout and essential to the story's emotional texture; removal would flatten the contrast that defines Elara's stance.</comment>
