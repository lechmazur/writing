<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Eleanor's motivation is embodied through concrete action—thumb on grain, chisel moving—and her grief is "crystallized into something...hauntingly practical," shown via smoke detectors and jar-labeling. Internal contradiction appears when she won't rise for the kettle ("Let the water boil dry") yet moves deliberately with the carving, revealing competing values. The final choice to place the lion in light rather than keep it close feels earned by the prior rhythm work, though Viktor remains more archetype than individuated presence. Minor: "not yet shaped, not yet named" edges toward poetic scaffolding rather than strict character thought.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph (widow, loft, rain, present moment). Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density increases through the carving's evolution, the kettle's insistent song, and the mantra "here and gone" recurring with shifted weight. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): placing the half-formed lion in light reconfigures her stance from containing memory to letting it exist in the open, with the cost felt in "Let the pot scorch. Some things mattered more than tea." One tightening—ignoring the kettle to finish the work—narrows her options and crystallizes her new relationship to loss. The lens holds without contradiction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The loft is established early (rain-beaded skylight, woolen rug, cedar chest, single window) and micro-setting constrains choice: the carving blank pulled from "Before," the skylight's watery gold striping her hands at the turn, the windowsill as final resting place. The kettle downstairs creates spatial pressure through sound, and Eleanor's refusal to descend becomes a choice shaped by environment. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through her state: "rust-hued peace," "wet cedar and old tea leaves," rain tapping glass. The body and tool (chisel worn by Viktor's grip) charge the final image when the lion is placed where light touches it.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—learning to move with grief rather than against it—is signaled in the opening reflection and tested when the kettle demands response. One meaningful tightening: Eleanor ignores the urgent whistle twice, crystallizing her priority (the carving over domestic routine) and foreclosing retreat into habit. Agency is attention and endurance: "Still, she didn't stir" becomes a renunciation that costs her the tea and charges her commitment to the work. The escalation deepens rather than reverses: first curl of wood → suggestion of mane → half-formed lion → placement in light, each beat reweighting her relationship to memory with visible cost in real time.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: the ash blank becoming a resting lion (not roaring), the kettle's insistence versus Eleanor's stillness, Viktor's "learn their rhythm, then move with it" applied to grief itself. The final image—lion on the sill where light touches it, "Here...And gone. But never lost"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing: containment transforms into coexistence. Subtext operates in her refusal to rise, the choice of a sleeping lion over a snarling one, the mantra's shift from carried weight to crystallized acceptance. One slip: "That was the lesson: not to fear the fall, but to honor the arc" edges toward articulation of the thesis, though it remains tied to Viktor's voice and her present realization.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with clean focalization; psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during carving, slightly elevated during reflection on Viktor). Perceptual signature is consistent: Eleanor notices grain, weight, texture, the kettle's "shrill punctuation," sensory details filtered through a craftsperson's attention. Diction fits her state—"hauntingly practical," "crystallized," "residue"—without register drift. Minor penalty: some elevated phrasing ("To harvest lessons from loss," "emotional flatlining" would apply if she reset, but she doesn't) risks a slight distance wobble, and the line "time wasn't something to outrun or mourn—it was something to crystallize" feels slightly more authorial than character-specific in this beat, though it's anchored to her action.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings and lengths create visual breathing room. Information density is high: most lines advance character, atmosphere, or thematic weight. Two deductions: (1) Paraphrase loop at "She wasn't sculpting memory; she was trying to contain it" followed immediately by similar phrasing about spillage (~−0.3). (2) Stock metaphor "fine as a lion's whisker" and "watery gold" are competent but not fresh (~−0.2). The kettle's escalation (slow song → whistle → scream → click) is purposeful and propulsive. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent; "rust-hued peace settling like dust" works, though the piece nears the threshold where metaphor frequency in contemplative beats could dull immediacy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The widow-as-sculptor synthesis is handled with specificity (ash blank, chisel worn by Viktor's grip, mane suggestion) rather than generic grief-craft. The choice to carve a sleeping lion rather than a roaring memorial feels earned and non-obvious. Transformation test passes: the particular details (circus tent collapse, lion taming, "Here and gone" applied to wood curls and time) anchor universals in this situation. Minor limitation: the grief-through-craft frame is familiar territory in literary fiction; the story elevates it through execution (the kettle as pressure device, the choice to let it scorch) but doesn't fully escape the template's gravitational pull. The rust-hued peace tone and the specific lesson ("learn their rhythm") add freshness within the bounds.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Eleanor (lion tamer's widow) drives the two key turns: (1) pressing chisel to blank after reflection, (2) refusing to rise for the kettle twice, which crystallizes her priority and charges the final placement. Her choices—pulling the blank from the chest, carving a resting rather than roaring lion, placing it in light—alter tactics and foreclose retreat into domestic routine. Present in setup (cross-legged with blank), middle (chisel work), and closure (windowsill placement). Cost is visible: scorched pot, physical stillness traded for creative motion, old identity ("Before") opened.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ash wood carving blank is handled in setup (pulled from chest marked "Before"), developed through multiple beats (thumb tracing grain, chisel's first curl, suggestion of mane, half-formed lion), and charges closure (placed on sill where light touches it). Its transformation from "not yet shaped, not yet named" to sleeping lion with "eyes closed...in trust" mirrors Eleanor's arc. The blank's evolving state constrains her choices (she ignores the kettle to continue) and its final placement reweights "Here and gone" from mantra to acceptance. Indispensable to structure and theme.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Here and gone" is established as Eleanor's mantra in paragraph four, recurs as she peels the first wood curl ("fine as a lion's whisker"), and is repriced at closure ("Here...And gone. But never lost"). The concept shapes stakes: she's trying to contain transience, and the carving becomes the vessel for that effort. It alters her tactics—choosing the resting lion's pose (present/gone tension held in sleep) rather than a roaring memorial. The final triplet reconfigures the concept from threat (spillage, drowning) to coexistence, with cost in letting the pot scorch to stay in that crystallized moment.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Hauntingly practical" appears in paragraph five as Eleanor's grief state, demonstrated through checking smoke detectors and labeling jars. It enables the central choice: she doesn't weep or flee but instead works the blank methodically. The trait constrains one key action—ignoring the kettle's urgent call (practical tasks deferred for creative containment)—and the visible tradeoff is the scorched pot and refusal to perform domestic duty. Present in setup (shown via label examples), tested in middle (kettle ignored), and implicit in closure (placement rather than storage). Could score higher if the trait drove a second distinct beat with cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Contain" is signaled early ("trying to contain it—before it spilled again"), drives the middle action (carving as vessel-making: "Something to contain the love, the terror...so it wouldn't leak out"), and is redefined at closure when she places the lion in open light rather than storing it. The action shapes two beats: first chisel stroke ("to listen") and the decision to make "a vessel" rather than a memorial. Major turn traces to this: refusal to rise for the kettle is motivated by the need to finish containment work. Swappable test: changing "contain" to "preserve" or "honor" would require rewriting the spillage/leak imagery and vessel logic. Cost is visible in the scorched pot and renounced routine.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Crystallized time" is introduced in paragraph five ("grief had crystallized into something quieter"), developed in paragraph eighteen ("time...wasn't something to outrun or mourn—it was something to crystallize"), and demonstrated through the carving's transformation across beats (blank → curls → mane → sleeping lion) that arrests motion into form. The method shapes her attempt: she doesn't rush or summarize but lets each stroke accumulate meaning, and the mechanics matter—wood curls as trapped moments, the final lion as "echo" not "replica." Present in setup (as crystallized grief), middle (peeling curls, each a frozen whisker), and closure (lion placed where light "touches it," fixing the image). Could reach higher with one more beat where crystallization constrains a tactical choice.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Rain-beaded skylight loft is anchored in the opening line and provides resources: the cedar chest marked "Before" (supplies the blank), the windowsill (final resting place for the lion), the skylight's "watery gold" that "stripe[s] her hands" at the turn. The setting pressures one choice—spatial separation from the kettle downstairs makes ignoring it easier, and the loft's contained peace enables focused work. Present in setup (sensory anchor), middle (light stripes mark the turn), and closure (sill placement). Could score higher if the loft's specific features (e.g., single window, woolen rug) constrained a second choice or if rain-clearing tied more causally to her decision rather than paralleling it atmospherically.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kettle timeframe is signaled early ("kettle below began its slow, metallic song"), tested twice in middle (whistle, scream), and resolved at closure ("clicked off, its heat spent"). The clock tightens decisions: Eleanor must choose between attending to the kettle or finishing the carving, and the escalating urgency (song → whistle → scream) pressures her stance. Time is tracked through the kettle's stages and moves are plausible within that window. Cap rationale: while the kettle provides a live clock, the piece doesn't make elapsed time constrain her carving speed or force a tactical trade-off beyond the single choice to ignore it. A second beat where time running out alters her approach (e.g., simplifying the carving under deadline) would lift the score.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"To harvest lessons from loss" is stated in paragraph fifteen and demonstrated through Eleanor's choices: ignoring the kettle to carve, choosing a resting lion (Viktor's lesson: "learn their rhythm, then move with it"), and placing the vessel in light rather than hiding it. Motivation is conflicted—she wants to contain the spill but must let it exist openly—and the friction between wants (control) and costs (scorched pot, vulnerability of display) is visible on the page. Present in setup (pulling blank from "Before"), middle (carving despite urgency), and closure (windowsill as exposure). Drives two beats: first chisel stroke and the refusal to rise. The lesson Viktor taught ("understand, don't conquer") shapes her final tactic.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>"Rust-hued peace" is established in the opening line, modulates under pressure (kettle's "shrill punctuation," "insistent" scream) without breaking, and charges the final image when "the clouds had thinned" and light touches the lion. Tone coheres through turns: Eleanor's stillness and the loft's quiet absorb the kettle's urgency without shattering the contemplative register. The rust hue (aged, oxidized calm) permeates diction choices ("old tea leaves," "worn smooth," "ash dust") and supports the widow's stance—grief as patina rather than wound. Present in setup, tested by escalation (urgent kettle vs. sustained calm), and reinforced at closure (peace wins, pot scorched). Could reach higher if tone modulation were more dynamic—slight compression at peak beats might heighten relief when calm returns.</comment>
