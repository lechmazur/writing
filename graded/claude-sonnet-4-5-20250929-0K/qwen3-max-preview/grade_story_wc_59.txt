<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The prince's embodied exhaustion ("trembling with exhaustion and hope," "hollow-eyed") and sustained commitment to a seemingly impossible task provide clear motivation. His interior life shows consistency—whispering theories to the egg, working by hypothesis—but the solitary design limits on-page contradiction or choice under interpersonal pressure. The final laugh-through-tears moment is embodied, though the journey from despair to hope lacks intermediate micro-choices that visibly foreclose paths. No secondary character applies immediate pressure, so relationship crucible and status dynamics are inapplicable.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story teaches a pattern of density increase and charged imagery early; the final image reweights the prince's project with undeniable emotional cost (tears, laughter, decades of isolation) and conceptual repricing (beauty as oxygen, genesis enough). Orientation anchors—bedraggled prince on suspended palace—arrive promptly. The egg's pulsing transformation and birdsong eruption constitute a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant): options crystallize (hatch or not, beauty stirred) and pressure is felt even if the hatch is deferred. Cost is legible: years of despair, exile, and the prince's physical reduction. No causality breaks; the accumulative design holds through closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The suspended palace anchored to stalactites is established early and constrains choice—chains groaning, chandeliers swaying—charging the final image when "the palace trembled harder, not from decay, but awakening." The mechanical wasteland below, stained-glass myths, and the atrium's cracked marble are filtered through the prince's despair and hope. The egg's cradle of brass petals and velvet moss, plus the mirrors shattering into floating shards of sky, uses micro-setting objects to pressure the climax. Spatial choreography is clear; sensory detail (acid rain, wild thyme scent) is selective and purposeful.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reawaken beauty in a mechanical world—is signaled early and sustained. The story offers one meaningful tightening: the prince's activation ritual (palm to egg, hypothesizing aloud) narrows options to success or failure. The egg's responsive glow and the palace's resonant awakening provide a turn that reweights the stake, though the prince's agency is more ritual invocation than strategic decision under opposition. Coincidence does not resolve; the transformation arises from his sustained effort and emotional investment. Cost is felt (decades of isolation, physical reduction) and the final image charges the outcome with undeniable pressure, meeting Accumulative escalation standards.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—beauty as necessity, not luxury—emerges through concrete imagery: the child weeping at a dandelion, the prince's hollow-eyed humming, the extinct egg as covenant. The final image offers a resonant answer without moralizing: "beauty had stirred. And that was genesis enough." The flawed-genesis concept integrates through particulars (copper veins, pendulums mimicking heartbeats) rather than abstraction. Subtext operates in the mirrors reflecting "not his image but fragments of sky, leaf, and wing." Minor slip: "Beauty was not luxury. It was oxygen" edges toward thematic statement but is brief and contextualized by prior scene work.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, anchored in the prince's perception. Perceptual signature is present—"dented like a crushed beetle shell," "chromatic pulses, like dawn breaking through stormclouds"—but the voice occasionally drifts into elevated, ornamented register ("marrow of his marrow," "quaking reverie") that reads more as authorial lyricism than the prince's interior idiom under peak stress. No dialogue to judge. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close at activation, wider at world-building). Filter verbs are sparse. The prose reflects emotional intensity without head-hopping, though the consistent high-baroque diction compresses character-specific texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout—"velvet tunic frayed and stained," "crown dented like a crushed beetle shell," "mineral tears," "marrow of his marrow," "unsung hymn," "honey laced with salt"—creating cumulative overwriting in a high-pressure climax where clarity would serve better. Several metaphors border on mixed: "quaking reverie" applied to chandeliers, "bitterly sweet, like honey laced with salt, like reunion shadowed by loss" stacks vehicles. Template cadence appears: "He worked by hypothesizing… He installed… He calibrated… He closed his eyes and hypothesized aloud" runs a repeated stem across key beats. Paraphrase loop: "Not from the egg. Not yet. But from the air itself" restates the prior line's implication. No major clarity breaks, but density and loops reduce propulsion at closure. Applying −0.6 for density in peak beats, −0.4 for template cadence, −0.2 for paraphrase loop; cumulative artifact cap at −1.2 within Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The core synthesis—extinct organic relic meets mechanical resurrection via emotional catalysis in a skyborne ruin—is specific and committed. The suspended palace on stalactites and the copper-vein cradle are memorable particulars. The ending's ambiguity (egg may never hatch) and the prince's acceptance ("genesis enough") offer a non-obvious emotional stance. However, the "beauty vs. mechanized dystopia" premise is familiar, and the "lone visionary scorned by bureaucrats" frame is stock. Transformation occurs through specificity (hypothesizing as method, mirrors shattering into sky fragments) but the core arc—faith rewarded by miracle—does not surprise. The "bitterly sweet" tonal instruction and quaking-reverie phrasing read as prompt fulfillment rather than organic voice.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The bedraggled prince is present throughout and his choices—whispering to the egg, calibrating devices, pressing palm to egg—frame all beats. His decision to activate the egg at the climax drives the closure. However, his role is largely observant and ritualistic rather than forcing tactical reversals; the egg's transformation is catalyzed by his touch but not by a series of escalating decisions. Setup early, development in middle beats, and payoff at closure are all present. Cost is tied to his decades of isolation and physical reduction. Swappability: the role could be another outcast inventor without major structural change. Band: functional across beats, causal role at closure, but not indispensable in its exact royal form.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The extinct bird's egg is introduced early, handled in the cradle-building beat, activated at climax, and its pulse shapes the final image. It appears in at least three distinct beats: initial cradling, installation of copper veins, activation ritual, and closure silhouette. The egg's spirals "shimmered only under moonlight or sorrow" and its pulsing warmth with translucent shell are specific, irreplaceable properties. Its transformation (glow, fissures, heartbeat silhouette) narrows the prince's options and charges the ending. Cost is tied to its status as last relic and the prince's sustained faith. Removing this exact object would break the story's logic. Minor slip: the egg is more catalyst than tool wielded with visible tradeoffs.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Flawed genesis is introduced early ("not divine, not perfect, but flawed, human, trembling with the risk of failure") and shapes the prince's tactics: he calibrates imperfect clockwork for elegance, threads filaments from music boxes, tunes for forgotten frequencies. The concept recurs at closure when the egg's chirp is "also a chime, a sigh, a sonata" and the mirrors shatter from "overflow." The ending's ambiguity—egg may never hatch—embodies the flawed-genesis premise. However, the concept functions more as thematic frame than on-page constraint that forces tactical reversals. It reweights the closure image but does not materially narrow options mid-story. Band: shapes one key beat (activation) and charges the ending, but not indispensable in driving multiple turns.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Bitterly sweet" appears once, applied to the egg's sound: "bitterly sweet, like honey laced with salt, like reunion shadowed by loss." The phrasing charges the sensory description at climax but does not constrain an on-page action or enable a tactical choice with visible tradeoff. It functions as tonal coloring rather than a trait that alters the prince's moves. No setup in the first third; introduced at climax only. Swappability: "poignant," "melancholy-tinged," or similar adjectives could replace it with minor edits. Band: functional in one beat (climax), purposeful, but not causally active or irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Assemble" is signaled early ("He would assemble a new genesis") and frames multiple beats: spreading blueprints, installing copper veins, calibrating pendulums, welding gears, placing the egg in its cradle. The action is repeated across the atrium-work sequence and culminates in the activation ritual. The assembled apparatus (mirrors, brass petals, copper threads) is causally necessary for the egg's transformation—removing "assemble" would collapse the middle and ending. Cost is visible in the prince's exhaustion and years of labor. Minor slip: "assemble" as method overlaps somewhat with "hypothesizing" (9 F); the mechanics of assembly are less distinct than the prince's theorizing habit. Band: drives two beats, essential to closure, high specificity, but slightly blurred by method overlap.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Hypothesizing about everything" is introduced early ("He worked by hypothesizing about everything") and returns at climax ("He closed his eyes and hypothesized aloud: 'If grief can be a catalyst… if memory can power motion… if longing can be transmuted into lift…'"). The method shapes his nightly whispers to the egg and justifies the eclectic, experimental assembly choices. It provides a perceptual signature and frames his ritual at activation. However, the mechanics of hypothesis-testing are not dramatized—no on-page trial-and-error sequence where one hypothesis fails and another succeeds. The method charges the voice and closure but does not narrow tactics mid-story. Band: present early, reprised at climax with purpose, but does not constrain middle beats with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The suspended palace anchored to giant stalactites is introduced in paragraph three and recurs throughout: chains groaning, chandeliers swaying, palace quaking with factory thunder, stalactites resonating at climax. The setting's precarious suspension mirrors the prince's emotional state and charges the ending when "the palace trembled harder, not from decay, but awakening." The stalactites' mineral tears and the atrium's cracked floors provide tactile, lived-in detail. The setting does not materially constrain the prince's choices—he could conduct his work elsewhere—but it supplies atmospheric pressure and symbolic resonance. Band: setup early, present across beats, charges the final image, but does not alter tactics or provide a resource that affects outcome.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Through the discovery" timeframe is implied by the story's arc from sustained labor ("years ago," "decades," "each night") to the eve of activation and the climactic moment. However, the exact duration of the discovery beat—from activation to egg-pulse to mirrors shattering—is compressed and untracked; no live clock shapes the prince's moves during the climax. The story's long temporal span (decades of work) provides weight but does not tighten decisions at closure. Time is more backdrop than constraint. Band: functional, contributes to stakes, but does not pressure tactics or create urgency that alters outcome.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The motivation "to reawaken beauty in a mechanical world" is signaled early ("his cracked, stubborn vow") and dramatized through the prince's sustained labor, nightly whispers, and final activation ritual. The opposition (bureaucrats, fled courtiers, "output and yield" culture) frames the stake. The prince's memory of the child weeping at a dandelion provides concrete grounding. The motivation drives all beats and culminates in the egg's transformation and birdsong's return. Friction is present—decades of isolation, physical reduction, uncertain outcome—but the story does not force the prince to choose between beauty and survival, or beauty and another competing want. Band: dramatized, drives closure, but lacks a second on-page friction that would elevate cost visibility.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Quaking reverie" tone is established early via "quaking reverie that matched the prince's own unsteady heartbeat" and sustained through trembling palace chains, swaying chandeliers, and the prince's trembling fingers. The tone modulates from despair-tinged persistence to climactic intensity (mirrors shattering, birdsong erupting) to tearful laughter. The phrasing is coherent and charges the final image when the palace trembles "not from decay, but awakening." However, "quaking reverie" as a label is somewhat abstract and the tone leans heavily on elevated, baroque diction throughout, reducing modulation range. Band: coherent, present across beats, charges closure, but lacks sharp tonal contrast that would elevate pressure differentiation.</comment>
