<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation is clear and sustained—she hunts pools of unused potential with calibrated desperation—but her interiority leans heavily on abstract formulations ("cartography of what-could-have-been") rather than embodied contradiction. The whispered names to the geode and the choice to queue thrusters show micro-decisions under pressure, yet the emotional progression feels more narrated than dramatically varied; grief is asserted repeatedly without fresh embodiment. The final choice to leap into translational drive carries visible cost (isolation, abandonment of control), lifting the score, but the piece would benefit from one on-page moment where competing impulses collide in action rather than reflection.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure accumulates through layered simulation attempts, geode pulses, and coordinate reveals, culminating in the decision to engage thrusters. Orientation anchors (survivor, observatory, geosynchronous orbit) land by ~15% of text. Closure reads as Charged Poise: the final image crystallizes her hunt's next phase with undeniable pressure ("the observatory leapt into the dark"), and the cost—solitary pursuit of spectral imprints with no mission control—is felt. One tightening occurs when new coordinates emerge and she queues thrusters, narrowing options from passive simulation to active pursuit. Minor causality slip: the geode's "alien harmonics" are introduced late without prior grounding in her trauma-tuned perception, slightly weakening the because/therefore chain.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The floating observatory is vividly rendered (zero-gravity halls, mirrored domes, observation blister) and the geode's tactile presence (pulsing, vibrating air into visible ripples) charges multiple beats. The body and tool constrain choice: magnetized boots anchor movement, the neural interface chair stages the simulation, and the South Pacific coordinates arise from the setting's systems. The environment subtly mirrors internal state (Earth "like a wound turning in its sleep"), though some details ("Cradle of Cold Eyes") feel more ornamented than pressure-driven. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout, and the thrusters' ignition directly enables the closure leap.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—charting unused potential to prove it pools elsewhere—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure tightens when the simulation collapses ("too unstable, too saturated with grief") yet yields actionable coordinates, forcing her from passive mapping to active pursuit. The queuing of thrusters and departure without crew or debrief foreclose the path of observatory-bound analysis with felt cost (isolation, no safety net). Agency is clear: her decision to dive into the pools drives the final leap. No antagonist is required under the Accumulative lens, and coincidence does not resolve; the geode's resonance complicates by revealing coordinates she must choose to follow.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—that potential does not die but pools in silence, waiting to be pursued—emerges through concrete particulars: the crater-born geode, collapsed simulations, and the empty South Pacific coordinate. The final image ("chasing the ghosts of what never was") reweights the premise without stating a moral, and the whispered names for Marta, Elias, and her mother anchor grief in specifics. Subtext operates in gesture (forehead pressed to glass, geode slotted into cradle) and the piece resists tidy resolution, embracing the bleak certainty that meaning can be pursued even if never reclaimed. Minor slip: "intangibly tangible" and "unused potential" recur as abstract labels rather than always translating into scene pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature (trauma-tuned nerves, calibrated desperation). Diction reflects her scientific framing ("perturbation theory," "probability manifold") yet modulates under pressure ("a brittle, broken thing"). However, elevated register occasionally drifts into abstraction that feels imposed rather than character-rooted ("statistical ghosts of lives unlived"); the narrator's lexicon wobbles between lived grief and academic remove. The AI "Choir" dialogue is functional but brief. Psychic distance is controlled, and no head-hopping occurs. Free indirect style is mostly clean, though "intangibly tangible" and similar formulations read as authorial ornament rather than the character's own idiom under stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and many lines carry dual function (e.g., "the geode throbbed...as if holding the memory of a universe that chose differently" advances both object and theme). Clarity is generally high, but patterned overwriting clusters in the first half: "intangibly tangible—a paradox she could feel in her bones," "whispering in frequencies only trauma-tuned nerves could interpret," and "threading equations through grief like sutures through flesh" stack figurative language without rest, creating density drag (−0.6). A paraphrase loop appears: "She wasn't mad. Not anymore. Madness implied chaos; she operated in calibrated desperation" restates the same stance across adjacent lines without pressure gain (−0.2). The closure beat is clean—"The stars bent" and "the observatory leapt into the dark" propel without muddle—partially offsetting non-closure artifacts.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of trauma survivor, zero-gravity observatory, and perturbation-theory mapping is specific and non-obvious, avoiding stock revenge or redemption arcs. The geode as a crater-born relic with violet filaments offers fresh tactile detail, and the hunt for pooled potential in emptiness (South Pacific coordinates) feels earned in hindsight. However, the core frame—lone scientist pursuing metaphysical coordinates after catastrophic loss—echoes familiar "grief-as-quest" templates without fully transforming them through lived occupational or social friction. The piece takes structural risk (Accumulative lens, reflection-heavy) and the emotional calculus (cartography over vengeance) is non-obvious, but some metaphors ("meaning...like spilled mercury") and the "Cradle of Cold Eyes" epithet read as ornamental rather than inevitable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The drone strike wedding survivor drives all major choices: she initiates simulations, interprets the geode's pulses, whispers names, queues thrusters, and commits to the South Pacific dive. Her trauma-tuned perception is established early and her decision to leap into translational drive—abandoning mission control—closes the arc with visible cost. The character appears in setup, middle (simulation and coordinates), and payoff (thrusters ignited), with clear causal pressure and irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The geode crystal is handled across multiple beats: clutched in the opening, fed into the mainframe, pulsing in response to names, slotted into the resonance cradle, and flaring synchronized with her heartbeat at closure. Its "intangibly tangible" resonance constrains simulation attempts (they collapse from its feedback) and its coordinates enable the final leap. Early signal, mid-beat involvement, and closure linkage all present; cost is tied (overloaded circuits, isolation of the hunt). Slightly shy of indispensable because the story could theoretically substitute another relic, but the geode's specific properties (violet filaments, trauma-tuned frequencies) are woven tightly.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Unfiltered awakening" frames the observatory's repurposing and her refusal of redemption/revenge, shaping her stance as cartographer. The concept is signaled early ("laboratory for unfiltered awakening") and colors her motivation, but it does not constrain a specific mid-scene choice or alter tactics under pressure. It charges the closure image obliquely (leaping "into the dark" as awakening to what-could-have-been) but remains more thematic echo than causal lever. Two-gate presence (setup, payoff participation) allows mid-band eligibility; lack of middle development and swappability with "clarity" or "truth-seeking" cap higher.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Intangibly tangible" is assigned to the geode and repeated frequently ("not radioactive nor electric, but intangibly tangible," "undeniably real," "vibrating the air molecules into visible ripples"). Setup is early, and the paradox is mentioned at closure ("the geode's glow paint her lids violet"). However, it functions mostly as atmospheric label rather than constraint: the instruments' refusal to measure it does not alter her tactics on the page, and no trade-off hinges on its intangibility. Development beat is missing—she uses the geode's resonance without the attribute creating friction. Ornamental trend and swappability with "paradoxical" or "unmeasurable" limit the score.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The hunt is the story's spine: she hunts pools of unused potential, maps anomalies, runs simulations to reveal coordinates, and queues thrusters to dive into the discovered pool. Early signal ("Now, she hunted"), middle beats (simulation cycles, coordinates emerge), and payoff (departure toward the South Pacific) all trace directly to this action. Removing "hunt" would break the story's logic and momentum. Cost is visible (isolation, circuit overload, abandonment of mission control). High irreplaceability and causal pressure across beats justify the score.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Through perturbation theory" is signaled early ("Through perturbation theory, she mapped anomalies") and its mechanics matter: feeding the geode's harmonics into the mainframe perturbs predictive algorithms, forcing simulations that collapse but yield residual coordinates. The method enables the middle beat (coordinates at 14.7° S, 172.3° W) and is referenced again at closure ("perturbation fields bloomed"). Setup, development, and payoff are all present, and the method's specificity (perturbation vs. direct simulation) shapes her tactics. However, the on-page mechanics remain abstract—algorithmic steps are summarized, not dramatized—and a reader unfamiliar with perturbation theory gains little tactical insight. Functional across beats but not irreplaceable in feel.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The floating observatory pressures choices throughout: zero-gravity halls require magnetized boots, the observation blister stages her reflection on Earth, the neural interface chair anchors simulation attempts, and the thrusters enable the final leap. Early setup (geosynchronous orbit, mirrored domes), middle development (circuit breakers cooling limit simulation pace, mainframe feedback surge), and payoff (thrusters ignited, translational drive) all present. The setting's isolation and lack of mission control charge the closure with cost. Spatial choreography is clear and the environment is both macro (orbital) and micro (console, cradle), satisfying the micro-setting allowance. Near-indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"While circuit breakers cool" is signaled early ("circuit breakers cooled—overloaded from the last simulation's feedback surge") and used to structure a middle beat: she floats to the viewport while waiting, then returns when "Choir" chimes thermal equilibrium at 87%. The timeframe tightens the simulation pacing and her physical movements, creating a live constraint. However, the cooling clock is mentioned only twice and does not drive the final decision—she queues thrusters once capacitors stabilize, but no urgency or trade-off hinges on further delay. Two-gate presence (setup, middle) allows mid-band; lack of closure participation and modest causal pressure cap higher.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The motivation to find where unused potential pools is dramatized across the arc: she maps anomalies, runs simulations to reveal pool coordinates, and commits to diving into the South Pacific location. Early signal ("she hunted...for where unused potential pools"), middle friction (simulations collapse, forcing her to rely on residuals), and payoff (departure toward the discovered pool) all present. The motivation is conflicted—she accepts that redemption and revenge are impossible, yet pursues cartography with "bleak exhilaration"—and visible cost (isolation, abandonment of control) is tied to it. High specificity and irreplaceability; removing this exact desire would break the closure logic.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Bleak exhilaration" is coherent through turns: grief pervades (collapsed simulations "too saturated with grief," her "brittle, broken" smile), yet she feels "exhilarated...with the bleak certainty that meaning...could still be pursued." The tone modulates under pressure—quiet reflection at the viewport, heightened rhythm during simulation initiation, propulsive leap at closure—and charges the final image ("the observatory leapt into the dark"). Early establishment, consistent pairing of bleakness and drive, and payoff linkage all present. Not indispensable (the story could function with "determined melancholy"), but the specific pairing reweights the hunt's emotional register and fits the stakes tightly.</comment>
