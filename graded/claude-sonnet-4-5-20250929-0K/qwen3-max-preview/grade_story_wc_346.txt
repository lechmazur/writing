<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The adjuster remains a cipher executing a predetermined ritual without internal contradiction or meaningful choice under pressure. His "scarred fingers" and "crystallized tears" are label-only traits never dramatized as constraints. The puppet's smile and resonance are asserted repeatedly but never tied to a micro-choice that alters his tactics. The piece offers no embodied emotion—only elevated declarations ("bruised awe") that float above concrete sensation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation remains vague past 120 words: "hidden lighthouse" anchors place loosely, but "dusk" and "seven ages" lack grounding in a coherent present-tense frame. The dominant lens is Accumulative/Textural, but no on-page closure unit (DC/RR/CR) is legible—the adjuster completes his task exactly as planned with no reversal, reconfiguration, or visible cost that forecloses a path. The "final tick" and dissolving lighthouse are asserted outcomes, not earned through protagonist agency or a dramatized price. No meaningful tightening or deepening occurs; the ritual proceeds in a static arc from step one to completion.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The lighthouse interior (spiral stairs, brass chronometer, curved glass) is vivid and the puppet's cracked porcelain recurs across beats. However, no environmental constraint alters a choice or tactic—the adjuster moves freely through the space executing his plan. The "pane of hush" thickens and the sea stills, but these effects are passive backdrops rather than pressures that shape action. Spatial choreography is clear, and sensory detail is abundant, but the setting never forces a tradeoff or charges the final image with cost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"to make [the end] gentle"—is signaled early but never tested or deepened. The adjuster encounters no obstacle, risk, or tightening choice; he ascends, places the puppet, turns the spindle, whispers the lullaby, and succeeds exactly as intended. No reversal, no foreclosed path, no visible price paid. The text substitutes atmospheric intensification (stars blinking out, civilizations pausing) for narrative pressure, but these are declared outcomes, not contested turns. Agency is absent; the protagonist performs a ritual, not a decision under fire.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through recurring images (the puppet's smile, nested patterns, lullabies) but resolves into an overt moral: "He had honored it" and "to let the beautifully flawed remain beautiful even in their breaking" state the theme rather than enacting it through particulars. The final paragraph ("He was not afraid. / He had done his duty...") functions as a summary rather than a resonant reconfiguration. The puppet's gratitude is asserted, not earned by prior friction. No counter-reading or ambiguity lingers—the text instructs the reader how to feel rather than inviting reflection through a charged image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited, but perceptual signature is generic: the adjuster's way of noticing ("salt-worn stone," "viscous, golden") could belong to any elevated narrator. Register drifts into elevated diction ("vouchsafe," "entropy's curtain," "causality's last knot") incongruent with embodied crisis perception. Figurative language dominates most sentences without variation: "pane of hush," "velvet hush," "afterglow," "membrane between what was and what will never be" stack metaphors that blur rather than sharpen. Under peak stress (the final turning of the spindle), syntax remains ornate and distant rather than compressing to match urgency.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade: "hush" appears in eight distinct phrasings (pane of hush, hush of time's final ripple, final quiet, velvet hush, gathering dark); "nested patterns" and "fractal lullabies" restate the same concept without added pressure. Template cadence runs: "not with X, but with Y" appears four times ("not to warn, but to cradle"; "not with voice, but with resonance"; "not with lungs, but with soul"; "not in violence, but in drowsy surrender"). Stock metaphors cluster: "cracked like a dried riverbed," "folding inward like petals at twilight," "dew on spider silk." Figurative density obscures cause/effect in peak beats—the final dissolution ("glass dissolved into mist, stone into memory") replaces concrete closure with elevated abstraction. Information density is low; many sentences restate atmosphere without advancing situation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>The premise (cosmic ritual performed by a solitary keeper) and imagery (lighthouse, puppet, lullaby, doomsday clock) follow familiar lyric-apocalypse templates without transformation. The "beautifully flawed" motif and "to honor the end" thesis are stated rather than discovered through specific choice. Emotional calculus is tidy: the adjuster succeeds without cost or friction, and the universe "chose to sleep rather than scream"—a safe, balanced metaphor that avoids genuine moral ambiguity. The turn from "he had not saved the world" to "he had honored it" is conceptually thin, restating the premise rather than reweighting it. No risk-taking heightens stakes; the ornate voice cushions rather than sharpens.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>The adjuster ascends, places the puppet, turns the spindle, and whispers the lullaby—actions that execute a plan rather than make contested choices. No key turn arises from his decision under pressure. His role is curator, not agent.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The puppet head appears in beat one (found in the flooded toyshop), beat two (placed on the chronometer), and beat three (its eye falls, striking the gear). The eye's fall triggers the final chime, giving the object causal weight at closure. However, the puppet could be replaced by any resonant relic with minor edits—the specificity of "puppet" versus "music box" or "doll" does not constrain tactics. Presence across three beats and closure linkage lifts the score into mid-band, but swappability and lack of unique constraint cap it below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Pane of hush" is named early and thickens into "viscous, golden" membrane, but it does not constrain or enable a choice. It functions as atmospheric metaphor rather than a stake-shaping force. The adjuster never navigates around it or leverages it tactically. Functional presence but no causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Beautifully flawed" is applied to the puppet ("its porcelain cheek cracked... beautifully flawed, like all things worth saving") and echoed in the final lines ("to let the beautifully flawed remain beautiful even in their breaking"). Label-only; no on-page action turns on the trait, and no tradeoff dramatizes its cost. Theme claim without visible constraint.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>"Vouchsafe" appears in the setup ("to vouchsafe the last quiet before entropy's curtain") and conclusion ("He had done his duty: to vouchsafe the end with grace"). The action frames the entire ritual and defines the adjuster's goal. However, it is an umbrella concept—"protect," "consecrate," or "honor" could replace it with minimal loss. Present at setup and payoff but not irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Nested patterns" are signaled early ("fractal lullabies woven into clockwork spirals") and activated at the climax ("The nested patterns activated: first, the rhythm of a mother's heartbeat... then, the cadence of wind... finally, the silent hum between stars"). The method shapes the ritual's mechanics and ties to the final effect. However, the nested structure is described rather than demonstrated—the reader is told the patterns matter but does not see how their nesting constrains or enables a choice under pressure. Functional in one key beat but not causal.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The lighthouse is present from the opening ("spiral stairs," "lantern room's apex," "beacon's lens") through closure ("The lighthouse's glass dissolved into mist"). Its height and isolation frame the ritual spatially, and the beacon's inward pulse is mechanically tied to the clock. The setting does not constrain a choice—no locked door, no unstable platform, no intruder—but it charges the final image (dissolution into mist) and recurs across all three beats. Solid development and payoff, mild causal role.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Across the hush of time's final ripple" appears in the setup and conclusion but does not function as a live clock. No countdown tightens decisions; the adjuster works at "glacier drift" pace without urgency. Timeframe is thematic label rather than tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>The lullaby motivation is seeded early ("the lullaby he'd composed across a thousand lifetimes") and enacted at climax ("he whispered... the lullaby"). However, the desire is told rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses—no moment shows him tempted to abandon the task or weighing the cost of singing versus silence. Present but frictionless.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Bruised awe" is named once midway ("bruised awe swelling in his chest") and coheres with the elevated, reverent diction throughout. Tone is stable across beats and modulates slightly at the ending (from ritual focus to reflection on "gratitude" and "afterglow"). However, the single static mood (solemn reverence) does not shift under pressure or charge the final image with new emotional weight. Coherent but not dynamic.</comment>
