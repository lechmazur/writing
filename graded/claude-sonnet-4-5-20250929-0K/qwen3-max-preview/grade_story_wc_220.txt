<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Bracken's interior world is richly textured through embodied perception (sniffing the wind, reading grooves), but the transformation from body-finder to voice-keeper occurs largely off-page in summary. The motivation "to translate distance into closeness" drives his decoding work, yet the closure cost—his emotional shift from hunting the dead to resurrecting them—is told rather than dramatized through a specific renunciation or contradiction. The wax leaf functions as a recurring image but does not force a meaningful choice that forecloses a path with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. The piece accumulates density through cylinder discoveries and voice resurrections, then offers a Resonant Reconfiguration in the final paragraphs: Bracken's role shifts from hunter to keeper, the settlement from salvage to resonance. However, the closure beat ("the lost were no longer gone—only waiting to be heard") is stated rather than shown through a final dramatized act with visible cost, weakening the RR's felt price. The escalation is a steady deepening rather than a narrow tightening, which fits the lens but leaves the ending more declarative than charged.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The scrapyard is vividly particular: rusted transmission towers, tank hulls, stoves fueled by circuit boards. Spatial choreography is clear across beats, and the bunker discovery supplies a crucial resource. The wax leaf constrains Bracken's interpretive work (tinted shadows spelling truths), charging the final image with its glow "soft as breath." While the setting shapes tactics and the micro-object (leaf) recurs with purpose, the environment's pressure remains constant rather than evolving causally with events.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake: resurrecting lost voices to translate distance into closeness. The cylinder discovery and bunker expedition constitute one meaningful deepening that broadens the archive from one voice to hundreds. However, Bracken faces no on-page reversal or forced trade-off; Veyra's arrival and the bunker's discovery unfold without complication or visible cost. The resolution—Bracken as living archive—is earned by accumulation rather than protagonist agency under pressure, leaving escalation more additive than tightening.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: grief and memory as living practices, closeness as resonance rather than proximity. The wax leaf's tinted revelations avoid overt symbolism, and the final image (leaf glowing, forests whispering through grooves) reweights prior material without stating a moral. The piece resists tidy resolution, ending with the settlement thriving on presence rather than salvage. However, the thematic answer is delivered through assertion ("closeness isn't measured in steps, but in shivers") rather than a non-literal image that lets the reader feel the stakes.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with a distinct perceptual signature: Bracken's sensory world (scent, tremor, glow) and metaphor-rich narration. Psychic distance remains consistent, and filter verbs ("he knew," "he read") are voice-motivated. However, the prose occasionally drifts into elevated diction ("intuitively descriptive," "archives of feeling") that feels imposed rather than filtered through a hound's consciousness. Veyra's brief dialogue is functional but does not carry distinct idiom or subtext.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high in descriptive passages. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "He no longer hunted the dead. He resurrected them" immediately follows paragraphs establishing the same idea. Template cadence in the middle third ("He gathered… shared… led") and stacked metaphoric constructions ("tinted revelations," "wild hush," "resonant echo") occasionally slow momentum. The opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes, but mid-story beats carry redundant restatements of Bracken's transformation without advancing pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The phonograph-cylinder archive and tinted-wax decoding offer a fresh synthesis of post-apocalyptic salvage and auditory archaeology. Bracken's shift from finding bodies to resurrecting voices transforms the retired-search-dog trope. However, the core premise—voice recordings as emotional closure—is familiar, and the story does not complicate the emotional calculus with a non-obvious moral cost (e.g., voices that should remain silent, or a choice between presence and peace). The final image is resonant but predictable in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Bracken is present throughout and his choices (placing cylinder on turntable, gathering scavengers, leading expedition, decoding nightly) shape all major beats. However, his decisions are cooperative rather than pressured; no choice narrows options or forecloses a path with visible cost. He enables rather than wrestles with the core conflict.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The wax leaf appears in paragraph three, recurs in decoding beats (casting tinted shadows), and glows in the final image. It enables Bracken's interpretive work (amber/violet/emerald meanings) and charges closure with its soft glow. However, it does not constrain a choice or force a trade-off; it remains a tool rather than a crucible.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Tinted revelations shape Bracken's method: the wax leaf projects color-coded meanings (amber truth, violet warning, emerald hope) across multiple beats. The concept structures his interpretive work and recurs in the closure image. However, it does not alter tactics under pressure or force a difficult choice; it functions as atmospheric texture rather than a stake that narrows options.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Intuitively descriptive" is introduced as a label ("the hound who sees sideways") and mentioned in the final paragraph, but it does not constrain or enable a specific on-page action with cost. The trait describes Bracken's perceptual style without creating friction or forcing a trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Riddles appear as a framing device (elders bring "desperate knots of meaning") and Bracken riddles back to Veyra late in the story. However, no major turn traces to solving or posing a riddle; the cylinder decoding is presented as translation rather than puzzle-solving. The element is present but swappable with "interpret" or "decode."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The phonograph cylinder appears early (Veyra brings it), its mechanics are detailed (hand-cranked dynamo, needle, grooves), and decoding drives two major beats: the handler's message and the bunker archive. The method shapes Bracken's nightly work and the settlement's transformation. Removing it would break the story's logic and closure image.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The scrapyard is established early with vivid particulars (tank hulls, transmission towers, circuit-board stoves) and recurs across beats. It supplies the turntable and frames the communal gatherings. The bunker expedition extends the setting with causal consequence. However, the setting does not tighten choices or create obstacles; it provides atmosphere and resources without pressuring tactics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The post-war timeframe is signaled early ("last resource war," "smoke-choked ravine") and motivates the scarcity context (salvage economy, lost voices). However, time does not tighten decisions or impose a live clock. The element provides backdrop without altering tactics or escalating pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"To translate distance into closeness" is dramatized in Bracken's decoding work and the handler's message ("Bring him close, even if the world is wide"). It drives his nightly labor and the settlement's transformation. However, the motivation is articulated in prompt-like language and not tested by friction between competing wants or a visible cost that forces a trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Wild hush" appears twice (families gather "in wild hush," scrapyard under "wild hush") and the tone coheres through quiet, reverent beats. However, the tone remains static rather than modulating with pressure, and "wild hush" functions as a descriptive phrase rather than a tonal charge that shapes the final image's emotional aftereffect.</comment>
