<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Molt's personality-molting trait is announced but never constrains an on-page choice; the "sardonic shell fully shed" moment reads as declared rather than earned through contradictory impulses in action. Interiority leans heavily on metaphor ("burrs in her coat lining," "old skin of cynicism peel away") rather than embodied sensation under pressure. The friendship with Elias supplies backstory weight, but his influence on her present actions remains abstract—no moment where competing impulses (cynicism vs. hope) force a visible tradeoff. The final gestures (planting seeds, singing) feel performative rather than desperate, missing the desperation that would sell the transformation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors arrive promptly (vagrant poet, rusted library, nighttime), but the closure effect is a Resonant Reconfiguration that relies on cumulative symbolic gestures (candle, seeds, song) rather than a decision that forecloses a path with visible cost. The piece teaches an Accumulative/Textural lens by midpoint, and the final image (planting seeds, singing into ruin) does reweight the dominant stake (forging beauty from anarchy), but the cost remains conceptual and diffuse—no single on-page moment where we see what Molt sacrifices or risks. The "by dawn, someone would find" projection gestures toward consequence but externalizes impact rather than landing it in her body or immediate circumstance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The rusted library is vividly rendered (corroded gutters, shattered skylight, open ribs of the ruined roof) and the environment charges the final image by supplying the floorboard cracks for seed-planting. Sensory detail is selective and atmospheric (moonlight "stitching the fractures," wax pooling "like liquid starlight"), filtered through Molt's poetic lens. The setting functions as more than backdrop—it becomes the canvas for her act of rebellion—pushing this into the solid 7-range despite minimal spatial choreography of movement within the space.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake (forging beauty from anarchy) is signaled early and the piece accumulates pressure through symbolic acts, but there's no on-page reversal or tightening choice that narrows Molt's options. The gestures (pinning poem, lighting candle, planting seeds) are additive rather than escalatory; no moment where failure looms or a decision forecloses an alternative path. Under an Accumulative lens, the density does increase and the cadence shift at "bloom where they think nothing can" reweights the stake, but the cost remains felt rather than visible—no dramatized consequence of her night in the ruin.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from image and action: rebuilding as planting rather than restoration, beauty sprouting in cracks, resistance as quiet persistence. The final image (seeds in floorboards, candle burning, poem glowing) offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. Elias's "They call us broken. We call us seeds" risks thematic echo but is delivered in-world via found poem rather than narrator commentary, and the subsequent actions dramatize the metaphor with physical specificity. The piece resists tidy resolution—Molt will molt again, the outcome uncertain—preserving complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and lyric throughout, with strong perceptual signature (broken glass and brittle leaves, "sharp as a snapped pencil," "liquid starlight"). POV remains stable in close third with no head-hopping, and psychic distance modulates purposefully—tighter during memory of Elias, broader during the catalogue of symbolic acts. Figurative density is high but mostly voice-consistent, though some lines veer toward purple ("silence held court," "gardener of the impossible"). The final future-tense projection ("she'd be gone—molting again") briefly shifts stance but reads intentional, framing her as legend rather than person.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but metaphor saturation in the opening third risks overwriting ("burrs in her coat lining," "beauty could sprout in the cracks of anarchy"). Template cadence appears in the mid-section: "He'd shown her... He'd taught her..." runs across multiple sentences without variation. Paraphrase loops cluster around "rebuild" and "molt" language—"another molt begun, not by calendar but by grief" closely echoes the opening premise without advancing pressure. The candle/seeds/song sequence is propulsive, but the "by dawn, someone would find" paragraph abstracts momentum into summary rather than staying in present action. No causality breaks, but the scaffold and density issues prevent high-band entry.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The vagrant-poet-as-revolutionary synthesis is executed with specificity (coffee tin false bottom, prison library friendship, wildflower seeds in floorboards) that lifts it above template, and the molting-personalities hook offers a fresh angle on transformation narratives. However, the core arc—cynical outsider rediscovers hope through symbolic ritual—follows a familiar template, and the transformation feels more asserted than earned through irreversible choice. The prison-library friendship and seed-planting image are memorable, and the piece commits fully to its lyric register, but the emotional territory and symbolic vocabulary (candles, ruins, wildflowers) draw from well-worn counterculture idiom without sharp transformation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Molt is the POV throughout and her actions (pinning poem, lighting candle, planting seeds, singing) drive the sequence of beats, but none of these choices involves a visible tradeoff or forecloses an alternative path—she performs each gesture without cost or resistance. Early signal is strong and she appears in all major beats, but agency reads as expressive rather than constrained; removing her specific choices would not fundamentally break the story's logic, only its texture.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The coffee tin appears in two distinct beats (opening description with "heavier tonight" and the seed-planting at the end when she "reached into the coffee tin again"), and its false-bottom mechanic enables both the smuggled poem and the hidden seeds, creating a charged reprise that reweights its function from concealment to creation. The specificity (bent nail, chipped teacup, false bottom opened with thumbnail) makes it irreplaceable, and its final use directly shapes the closure image.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Blooming resistance" is the conceptual spine—signaled in Elias's seed metaphor, literalized in the wildflower planting, and echoed in "bloom where they think nothing can"—and it shapes the dominant stake (forging beauty from anarchy). The concept moves from metaphor to physical act, altering Molt's tactics (she shifts from writing for coin to planting seeds), but the stakes remain thematic rather than urgent; no on-page moment where resistance faces concrete opposition or cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The monthly molting trait is announced in the opening and revisited at "another molt begun, not by calendar but by grief," but it never constrains or enables a specific choice. The label supplies voice texture and frames her self-concept, but removing it would require only minor edits; the story's logic hinges on her transformation via Elias's influence, not on any mechanical consequence of the molting attribute.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Rebuild" is signaled early ("she'd come here to rebuild"), developed in the prison-library flashback ("Elias had taught her that rebuilding wasn't about restoring what was lost, but planting what was possible"), and enacted across all closure beats (pinning poem, planting seeds, singing to "turn decay into a kind of cathedral"). The action is irreplaceable—the story's logic requires construction rather than destruction—and the final image (seeds in floorboards, lit candle, glowing poem) is the rebuild made visible.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The friendship with Elias is seeded early ("a friendship sparked sorting books") and his final poem is the object that initiates the night's action, but the mechanics of sorting books never pressure a choice or shape tactics on the page. The friendship supplies emotional weight and thematic content (his "burn a mind" line, his seed metaphor), but it functions as backstory causa rather than present method; swapping "sorting books" for "tutoring sessions" would not break the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The rusted library is established immediately, returns in every major beat (door for pinning poem, floor cracks for seeds, open roof for moonlight), and its ruin directly enables the closure action—without floorboard cracks, seed-planting loses its symbolic charge. The setting is irreplaceable: a functional library or different ruin would not carry the same weight. The space constrains her gestures (she works within the decay) and charges the final image (moonlight "stitching the fractures").</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The timeframe is anchored in the opening ("as the moon cleared the skyline") and revisited at mid-passage ("Above, the moon slipped past the last jagged tooth"), but it does not tighten decisions—Molt completes each gesture without clock pressure. The moon's movement supplies atmospheric progression and marks elapsed time, but removing the specific lunar cue would not alter her choices or the story's logic; any single-night window would function identically.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The desire to "forge beauty from anarchy" is stated explicitly ("she'd come here to rebuild... the belief that beauty could sprout in the cracks of anarchy") and dramatized through her actions (planting seeds, lighting candle, singing into ruin), but there's no on-page friction between this want and a competing cost—no moment where pursuing beauty risks something tangible. The motivation shapes the sequence of gestures and the closure image, but it remains largely uncontested; she acts without resistance or visible sacrifice.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Luminous fracture" is embodied throughout (moonlight silvering corroded gutters, wax pooling like liquid starlight, moonlight "stitching the fractures") and modulates with pressure—sharper in the Elias memory, softer during seed-planting, elevated in the singing. The tone is coherent and charges the final image (ruin transformed into cathedral), making it indispensable; a different tonal palette (grim realism, sarcastic detachment) would break the lyric register that enables the closure effect.</comment>
