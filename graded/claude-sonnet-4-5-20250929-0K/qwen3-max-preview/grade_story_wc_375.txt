<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The artist's mnemonic gift and charcoal-stained fingers are established early, but interiority relies heavily on summary ("mnemonically gifted, yes, but cursed to hoard memories like tombstones") rather than embodied contradiction in scene. The final choice to release the portraits feels thematically necessary but lacks visible cost—she gains sovereignty without forfeiting a live option or relationship on the page. The father's lock and her childhood self function more as symbolic vehicles than pressure points that force difficult trade-offs.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the cave descent, lock breaking, and portrait release accumulate toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise shifting to sovereignty). Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. The lock snapping open and the final ascent offer closure, but the cost remains felt rather than visible—no on-page forfeiture of a relationship, tool, or future path is dramatized. One meaningful deepening (lock opens, portraits released) is present, sufficient for this length under the accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The subterranean crystal cave is vivid and purposeful: auroral glow, cobalt quartz, geodes underfoot. The cave's "remembering imprisonment" and resonance with the lock charge the final image. The charcoal nub hidden in the lock functions as micro-setting that enables the climactic drawing. Spatial choreography is clean throughout; the cave constrains and reflects her internal state without postcard drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—uncorking suppressed creativity versus remaining "polite, productive"—is clear early. The descent and lock-breaking provide one meaningful tightening under the accumulative lens. However, the resolution lacks a visible price: she retrieves the charcoal, draws wings, and ascends "sovereign" without forfeiting a tangible option (e.g., losing the father's memory, sacrificing a commission, or accepting permanent isolation). The portraits' release feels thematically complete but cost remains oblique.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme (creativity as tide, not faucet; the cost of suppression) emerges through concrete images: the lock, the portraits, the charcoal nub. The cave's own history of water refusing containment mirrors her arc without overt statement. The final image—adding wings to portraits, releasing the father with a tear—offers a resonant, non-literal answer. Minor slip: "creativity isn't a faucet to be shut off, but a tide" edges toward direct articulation, though it remains interior reflection rather than authorial moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with a distinct perceptual signature: "charcoal-fingered," "mnemonically gifted," auroral light filtering through her artist's eye. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("cathedral hush," "mnemonically sovereign") that feels authorial rather than character-owned during high-pressure beats. No head-hopping; focalization is clean. Psychic distance modulates purposefully, tightening during the drawing sequence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is generally high. However, several lines loop or paraphrase: "not from cold, but from the inescapable callings" / "the callings never ceased. They whispered…"; "corked, polite, productive" restates the faucet/tide metaphor without added pressure. Template cadence appears in the "They rise…They whispered…Then the second…Then the sketching begins" sequence. Elevated diction ("mnemonically sovereign," "auroral sorrow") in the final paragraph reads ornamental rather than propulsive. Apply −0.6 for paraphrase loops and template stems, plus −0.3 for register drift in closure beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The premise—artist descends into a resonant cave to release suppressed work—is not novel but receives specific treatment through the broken lock, hidden charcoal nub, and the cave's own "imprisonment" backstory. The portraits-on-walls and auroral-light mechanics feel familiar from lyric/fantasy templates. Risk-taking is modest; the ending's emotional satisfaction is earned but predictable. No close echo of famous lines, yet the transformation test flags that plot and arc could transpose to other "creative suppression" frames with minimal edits.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character is present throughout and drives the descent, lock confrontation, and drawing sequence. She makes the choice to draw wings and release portraits, altering tactics from passive remembering to active release. However, the decision lacks visible cost or friction—no on-page trade-off complicates the turn. Two gates met (setup, closure participation); middle development is more thematic than tactical.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Broken combination lock appears in paragraph 6 (setup), is described as "jammed at 3-7-1" and "rust-eaten," then snaps open at the climax, revealing the charcoal nub (development and closure participation). All three gates met. The lock's mechanics (refusing to turn, resonating with the cave, opening untouched) constrain and enable beats. Swappability is low; the combination lock's "witness" function and hidden payload are specific. However, it does not narrow options in the middle—its main work occurs at closure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Inescapable callings are declared in paragraph 3 and echoed as theme ("they whispered…hummed…screamed"), but do not constrain an on-page choice with cost. The artist arrives already committed to "rectify"; the callings do not force a difficult mid-scene trade-off. Present and thematic, but functionally replaceable with "compulsion" or "need to create" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Mnemonically gifted is labeled ("mnemonically gifted, yes, but cursed to hoard memories") and enables the visualization of "every suppressed line" in paragraph 13. However, no on-page cost or tactical constraint is tied to the trait—she does not struggle with overwhelming recall or sacrifice a memory. Label-only mention trends low; the trait could be generic "perfect memory" without loss.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Rectify is announced as tonight's purpose (paragraph 5) and executed through the lock-breaking and portrait-releasing sequence. The action drives the arc from suppression to release. Two gates met (setup, closure). However, the specific word "rectify" is not irreplaceable—"heal," "release," or "free" would serve identically. Causal role is strong, but swappability caps the score.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Painting with the lock taped behind it is introduced in paragraph 6, propped against a stalagmite, and functions as the vessel for the hidden charcoal nub revealed at closure. Three gates met (setup, middle staging, closure payload). The mechanics matter: the lock's opening releases the tool. However, the painting itself (as image) does not constrain choice—the lock could have been hidden in a box or pouch. The combination is specific but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Subterranean crystal cave is established in the opening line, provides auroral light that eliminates the need for a lantern, offers resonant walls for the portraits, and "remembers imprisonment" to break the lock. Three gates met. The cave's properties (glow, quartz, thrum, memory) enable and charge multiple beats. Removing the cave would require extensive rewrite; the setting is integral to mechanics and theme.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>Timeframe "after the last echo of laughter fades" appears in the opening line and establishes tone, but does not tighten decisions or tactics. No live clock pressures her choices; the cave sequence unfolds without time constraint. Setup gate met, but no middle or closure participation. Swappable with "at dusk" or "in silence" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Motivation to uncork suppressed creativity is declared in paragraph 11 ("she kneels…to uncork suppressed creativity") and dramatized through the descent, lock confrontation, and drawing. Three gates met. The desire drives the arc and is conflicted via the father's prior suppression. However, the friction between want and cost is told more than shown—no on-page moment where she hesitates or pays a visible price to proceed. Causal role is strong, but cost connection is oblique.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Auroral sorrow is introduced in paragraph 2 ("ribbons of indigo and violet pulsing…the cave's ancient grief"), sustained through "patient sorrow" of the portraits, and gentled at closure ("its sorrow gentled, its glow now warm as dawn"). Tone is coherent, modulates with pressure, and charges the final image. Three gates met. The tone is distinct and irreplaceable; removing "auroral sorrow" would flatten the emotional texture and thematic resonance.</comment>
