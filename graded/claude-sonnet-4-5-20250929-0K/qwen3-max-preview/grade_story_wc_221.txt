<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's interiority is consistent and particular—sketching as a habitual response to confusion, the gilded compass as a tactile anchor. Her choice to remain and to witness is clearly motivated. However, the piece relies heavily on reflective summaries ("she understood: true north wasn't celestial") rather than embodied contradiction in scene. The emotional progression is smooth and contemplative but lacks friction; no impulse competes with her decision to stay and sketch, reducing the visible cost of her stance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates through recurring images (compass, sketching, stars) and achieves Resonant Reconfiguration at closure when the violet filament vanishes after being witnessed—a Charged Poise moment where her act of attention reweights meaning. Orientation is clean (who, where, when established early). The cost is conceptual and felt: her isolation and the peaceful absorption of the anomaly register as stakes resolved. One weakness: the turn from sketching Orion to the violet filament is a deepening rather than a tightening of options, and the final vanishing feels more like affirmation than foreclosure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The observation deck is vividly rendered with sensory specificity: breath misting, echoed silence, chronal hum as "memory of motion." The temporally stretched stars are concretely visualized (Orion "like taffy," Vega "smeared into a teardrop"). The sketchpad and compass applique function as micro-setting elements that constrain her action and charge the final image. The setting modulates from oppressive to companionable by the end, mirroring her stance shift. Strong integration of environment into character perception.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—turning confusion into exploration through witnessing—is signaled early and sustained. The violet filament's appearance at ~75% provides a meaningful deepening that raises the conceptual cost (she recognizes "why she stayed"). However, the piece lacks a true tightening: no choice forecloses a live alternative, and the filament's peaceful vanishing feels like validation rather than sacrifice. Under the Accumulative lens the pattern break (filament) does reweight the stake, but the cost remains oblique and largely retrospective.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: true north as inner bearing, the family custom of sketching as presence rather than accuracy, witnessing as an act that grants peace. The compass rose and stretched stars accumulate meaning without overt statement. The final image—the filament absorbed by her witnessing—resonates as a non-literal answer to "what blooms in time's wake." One slip: "true north wasn't celestial. It was the choice to remain curious" edges into direct thesis statement, though it's earned by prior material. No moralizing in the final beat.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Voice is consistent, lyric, and reflective with a distinct perceptual signature (stars as "held note," silence as "companionable"). Diction remains controlled and voice-motivated throughout. Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping. Weakness: the prose occasionally drifts toward elevated abstraction ("entropy's victory," "revelation") that feels authorial rather than character-particular under pressure. The narrative stance is single-POV, reflective mode; free indirect style is clean, though filter verbs ("she remembered," "she understood") cluster without necessity in the middle third.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and the prose carries momentum through most beats. Information density is high in sensory passages. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "temporally stretched" recurs across five sentences without added nuance; "echoed silence" appears three times in similar constructions. The metaphor stack in the opening third (stars as "frozen fire," "held note," "taffy," "teardrop") creates decorative density that slows rather than sharpens the initial pressure. Template cadence is visible in paired "She [verb]" openings across paragraphs 8–10. These artifacts do not obscure closure but dull momentum in the middle third. Deduction: −0.8 for paraphrase loops and template cadence, per the Non-closure Accumulation Cap.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of time dilation, family ritual, and solitary witness offers a fresh angle on post-apocalyptic stillness. The "blessed pariah" frame and the tactile compass applique feel specific rather than stock. The emotional truth—presence as an end in itself—resists easy resolution. However, the core setup (lone observer after shutdown, sketching as ritual) follows a recognizable contemplative-SF template. The violet filament's peaceful vanishing avoids bold risk; a less affirming closure would have elevated originality. Transformation is present but incomplete.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The blessed pariah is present throughout and her choice to remain (signaled early) and to sketch the anomaly (final third) constitute key decisions. However, her actions are more observational than turn-generating; the violet filament appears independently, and her sketching does not narrow options so much as affirm a stance already taken. She is on the page in every beat but does not create reversals. Mid-band: functional, causally involved, but her agency does not drive the story's one turn.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The gilded compass rose appears in three beats: early description, mid-story pulse synced to heartbeat, and final affirmation. It recurs with reweighted meaning (warmth = chronal charge = affirmation of direction). However, it is handled passively—she traces it once, then it pulses on its own—rather than used as a tool that constrains choice. The object charges the closure image but does not enable or limit a tactic. Lyric reprise with modest causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>True north is seeded early (compass applique, grandmother's voice), developed through reflection ("true north isn't a place—it's a decision"), and returns at closure when the compass pulses affirmation. It shapes her stake (finding direction in confusion) and her tactic (sketching as navigation). However, it remains more thematic anchor than on-page constraint; she never faces a choice between competing norths or a cost for holding her bearing. The concept is present across beats and participates in closure but does not narrow options with visible friction.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Temporally stretched" is introduced early (stars "stretched thin like taffy") and constrains her sketching action (Orion and Vega both require her to capture elongated forms). The violet filament is also temporally stretched. The attribute enables her witness—she can sketch what others cannot see—but imposes no visible cost or tradeoff. It is functionally integral to two beats (Orion, Vega) and the closure image, but swappable for another time-distortion effect. Mid-band: shapes action without imposing friction.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Glimpse" structures the piece: she glimpses trailing Orion, glimpses Vega, glimpses the violet filament twice before sketching it. The action is repeated across beats and drives the final turn (recognizing the anomaly). Removing "glimpse" would require rewriting the perceptual frame entirely. The filament glimpse at ~75% is the story's pivot—it redefines her purpose from mourning to witnessing. Strong causal role and closure participation, though the action itself is passive observation rather than decision-driven.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The family custom is seeded early (grandmother's voice, anniversary ritual, charcoal sketches on kitchen walls), used as her tactic in the present (unclipping sketchpad, sketching Orion, Vega, filament), and reweighted at closure ("the family custom wasn't about accuracy; it was about presence"). The method shapes her response to the anomaly and provides the mechanics of her witness. It appears in at least four beats and the closure moment. Strong integration: the method is indispensable to both her action and the thematic payoff.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The time dilation observation deck is named early, provides the vantage for all action, and supplies the "echoed silence" that becomes companionable by the end. It enables her witness (she can see the stretched sky) and charges the final image (she turns from the glass). However, it does not constrain her choices—she could sketch anywhere—and the deck's properties (faint hum, chilled glass) are descriptive rather than tactical. Present across all beats and integral to closure, but more stage than pressure source.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"After the shutdown" anchors the story's premise and is referenced in three beats (chronometric engines fell still, others fled, she stayed). However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions; no clock presses her, and the shutdown is backdrop rather than active constraint. The phrase "every anniversary" ties the family custom to time, but that ritual is past, not present pressure. The shutdown enables the temporally stretched stars but does not shape her tactics in the present scene. Functional setup, minimal middle or closure involvement.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The motivation is stated explicitly ("to turn confusion into exploration") and demonstrated through her sketching action. It is seeded early ("confusion had become her compass"), enacted in the middle (sketching as "quiet rebellion"), and affirmed at closure ("to map the unmappable"). However, it is told more than dramatized—no competing desire creates friction, and the cost of exploration (isolation, being called pariah) is summarized rather than felt in a present choice. The motivation is coherent and closure-linked but lacks visible tradeoff on the page.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Echoed silence" is introduced early (observation deck hums "not with machinery, but with the memory of motion"), modulates through the piece (oppressive, then companionable), and charges the final image ("the echoed silence now companionable, no longer oppressive"). The tone is coherent, lyric, and sustained through every beat. It mirrors her internal shift from isolation to presence. Strong reprise and closure participation. The tone does not vary dramatically with pressure (remains contemplative throughout), which fits the Accumulative lens but limits dynamic range.</comment>
