<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elira's "prism-minded" trait remains largely label-only; her fractured cognition is asserted but never constrains a choice or creates visible tradeoff. Internal conflict is absent—she progresses smoothly through escalating magical challenges without doubt, fear, or competing impulses. The ending grants her the Seed with no visible cost or renunciation, reducing her arc to competent puzzle-solving. Embodied emotion is sparse; moments like "heart hammering" are generic physiology rather than character-specific sensation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece follows a causal adventure structure: gravity inverts → thresholds open → fragment found → wall opens → Seed retrieved. Each gate unlocks the next, but escalation is mechanical rather than driven by protagonist choice or sacrifice. Closure delivers the object but no decisive change in Elira's situation or stance—she emerges planning "her next reentry" in the same role. The "Seed of Vigilance" is acquired without visible cost, reading as quest completion rather than transformation. Orientation is clear early; the causal chain holds, preventing collapse, but the ending lacks felt consequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The grotto's phosphorescent moss, inverted gravity, and liquid-glass waterfall create vivid sensory anchors that guide Elira's path and enable the threshold effects. Spatial choreography is coherent—upside-down bridge, floating sigil carving through mist—and the environment directly constrains her route. The final chamber's glass tablets and suspended Seed charge the closure image. Gravity inversion functions as both atmospheric pressure and mechanical enabler, meeting the 9+ gate requirement that setting constrain choice or charge the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding the seventh eye's location—is clear and pursued throughout. However, Elira faces no meaningful opposition or tradeoff; each threshold yields to her knowledge without cost. The fragment ignites with "latent blaze" and sears memory, but this doesn't narrow her options or force a choice—it simply grants her the answer. The Seed is "nestled in her satchel, warm and whispering" with no struggle or sacrifice to obtain it. Escalation is spatial (deeper into the grotto) rather than pressure-based; coincidence (gravity inverting at the exact hour she reenters) enables rather than complicates.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The theme of vigilance seeded in margins emerges clearly through the manuscript doodle, the archivists' preparation, and the final image of the Seed. The closing reflection "vigilance cannot be enforced—it must be seeded, watered with curiosity, and lit by those prism-minded enough to see" borders on thematic summary but is partially earned by the prior imagery of marginalia and hidden knowledge. The piece resists moralizing until the penultimate paragraph, where it edges toward thesis statement. The Seed's purpose—"to protect the power from the world's neglect"—offers conceptual weight, though the lack of tradeoff or moral complexity keeps resonance in the mid-band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, anchored in Elira's perceptions throughout. Diction is elevated and consistent—"clandestinely luminous," "synaptic thread," "latent blaze"—creating a distinct archival-mystical register. No dialogue appears, so those bullets are not applicable. The prose maintains psychic distance and narratorial confidence appropriate to the focalizer's expertise. However, the register occasionally drifts into expository summary ("They had known gravity would invert. They had prepared.") that tells rather than dramatizes key backstory, and some figurative phrases ("powdered stars," "blade through silk") lean generic within the ornate texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The prose is dense with figurative language—nearly every sentence in high-pressure beats carries metaphor or ornate diction ("spectral halos that whispered secrets," "pulsing orb of layered crystal"). This density without pattern-teaching or purposeful variation flattens momentum rather than escalating it, triggering the overwriting check (−0.5). Paraphrase loops appear: "The doodle was no key" restates the prior sentence's implication; "she seized it; the moment her fingers brushed" doubles the touch. Template stems recur ("She stepped," "She pressed," "She traced," "She followed," "She reached"). Stock metaphors—"tearing silk" appears twice, "blade through silk" and "peeling apart like pages of a book"—and elevated diction ("clandestinely," "vigilance," "latent") cluster without variation. Cumulative artifact penalty: −1.0 in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The core premise—archivist decoding a manuscript during a gravity-inversion event to find a hidden chamber—combines several fantasy tropes (chosen-one decoder, magical timer, treasure vault) without meaningful transformation. The "prism-minded" trait and "clandestinely luminous" descriptor feel like ornamental labels rather than lived constraints. The emotional arc is a straight retrieval with no sacrifice, and the thematic ending ("vigilance must be seeded") is asserted rather than earned through human complexity or moral calculus. Details like "Codex 7-M" and "Fragment Delta" provide surface texture but lack organic integration. The piece reads competent but derivative, leaning on genre furniture without a non-obvious synthesis.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Elira appears in setup, pursues the goal through multiple beats (water curtain, bridge, wall, chamber), and is present at closure when she retrieves the Seed. However, her choices are largely procedural—applying dialect knowledge, tracing sigils—rather than decisions that alter tactics or foreclose options. The "prism-minded" observation enables decoding but doesn't create dramatic friction or cost. She makes no renunciation or sacrifice; the arc is competent problem-solving. Two gates (setup, payoff) are met, but middle development lacks causal pressure from her agency, capping the score near mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The margin doodle appears in setup (Codex 7-M with spiral and seven eyes), drives middle beats (Elira decodes six eyes, seeks the seventh), and is causally active at closure (fused with Fragment Delta, the seventh eye blinks open and carves the path). It shapes tactics—she traces its shape on the wall—and its mechanics matter. Three gates met; causal pressure and closure linkage are strong. However, the doodle could be replaced with another cipher or map without fundamentally altering story logic, preventing top-band irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Seeds of vigilance" appears in setup as thematic frame, recurs in the middle explanation ("vigilance must be seeded in plain sight"), and anchors the final object (Seed of Vigilance). However, it functions primarily as thematic echo rather than shaping stakes or altering tactics on the page. The concept is told—"some truths must be guarded...in margins, in doodles"—but doesn't constrain Elira's choices or create friction. The Seed is retrieved without cost, reducing the concept to a symbolic trophy. Late thematic articulation in the penultimate paragraph lowers integration; the concept is present but ornamental to the causal chain.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Clandestinely luminous" describes the texts (setup), the grotto's moss, Elira's synaptic threads, and the final chamber. It establishes atmospheric consistency but remains descriptive rather than constraining action. The attribute doesn't force a tradeoff or enable a specific tactic that couldn't occur under ordinary light. Swappable with "hidden glow" or "secret radiance" with minor edits. Present across beats but label-only, fitting functional-but-replaceable band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Reenter" is the inciting action—Elira's return to the grotto during gravity inversion begins the quest. It frames the setup and is referenced at closure ("already planning her next reentry"). However, the action itself could be "enter" or "descend" with no structural change; the gravity event and her expertise drive the plot more than the fact of re-entry. The action signals intentionality but doesn't redefine options or carry unique mechanical weight. Two gates (setup, closure reference) met; middle development present but not causally distinct from simple entry.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Threshold effects" appear in setup (gravity inversion thins thresholds), drive two middle beats (water curtain, petrified-root bridge), and enable access to the chamber. The method's mechanics—what was buried rises, what was hidden shimmers—are signaled early and shape Elira's path. However, the thresholds function as sequential gates that unlock with knowledge rather than imposing cost or forcing tactical adaptation. Swappable with "portals" or "passages" without altering the quest structure. Two distinct beats plus setup; causal role present but not irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The serpentine grotto in mist appears in setup, structures all middle beats (walls, waterfall, bridge, chasm, stone wall), and hosts the final chamber. Its coiled architecture and phosphorescent elements guide Elira's choices and create spatial pressure. The grotto's layout—reachable only during inversion—constrains access and charges the closure image (chamber sealing behind her, mist curling at exit). Three gates met; the setting is causally active and its removal would collapse the quest. However, another hidden location (labyrinth, cave system) could serve similar function with edits, preventing top irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The one-hour gravity inversion appears in setup ("the sky's sigh") and enables threshold access. However, the time limit is never tracked or tested—Elira completes her quest with no urgency, and the text doesn't show time pressure narrowing her options. The hour ends coincidentally when she exits ("the gravity snapped back"), functioning as a clean frame rather than a ticking clock that shapes tactics. Two gates (setup, closure punctuation) met, but the timeframe remains ornamental to escalation. Missing middle development where the clock would force a choice.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"To find where forgotten combinations hide" is Elira's stated goal in setup, pursued through decoding and threshold navigation, and fulfilled at closure when she reaches the chamber of glass tablets. The motivation is clear and drives action. However, it's never conflicted—no competing desire, no moment where she weighs the cost of continuing versus retreating. The quest proceeds smoothly without friction between want and fear. Three gates met; causal role solid, but lack of internal conflict or visible sacrifice keeps the motivation functional rather than dramatically charged.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Latent blaze" appears when the glyph ignites Fragment Delta ("searing not her skin but her memory—flashing visions") and in the final chamber's "clandestinely luminous light." The tone conveys hidden power made visible under pressure. It modulates somewhat—quiet expertise in early beats, intensifying at the fragment discovery, warming at the Seed retrieval. However, the tone remains fairly static (mystical competence) without sharp shifts that mirror escalation or cost. Present in setup and closure image; charges the fragment beat but doesn't evolve meaningfully across the arc. Two gates met; coherent but not transformative.</comment>
