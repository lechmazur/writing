<question>1</question>
<grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Elara's motivation is articulated clearly (discovering why paths choose walkers), anchored in childhood trauma, and manifested through deliberate physical actions (palm on seal, descent into dream). However, interiority leans heavily toward abstract philosophizing ("paths choose their walkers when the walker's essence resonates") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The final choice to take the wafer seal and walk into the storm feels more like acceptance of a delivered truth than a decision forged from competing impulses with visible cost. The character endures and receives revelation, but agency at closure reads passive.</comment>

<comment>Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive clearly in the opening. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: storm approach, dream descent, symbolic vision, and final emergence accumulate toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara "becomes the road." However, the closure unit lacks legible cost—she walks out unsoaked, saluted by trees, with the bunker collapsing conveniently behind her. The final image asserts transcendence but does not dramatize a forfeiture, refusal, or price paid on the page. The orientation penalty is waived (anchors present early), but cost proof at closure is absent, triggering the −0.6 deduction specified in the Cost proof test.</comment>

<grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>The vine-draped bunker, rusted steel, ivy-choked vents, and corroded floor grates are vivid and consistent. The wafer seal's cracked surface and the storm's rhythm serve as micro-setting elements that anchor Elara's ritual. The forest as "guardians, softening steel with chlorophyll patience" and the bunker's collapse under roots constrain the final image and charge it with symbolic weight. Sensory selection (damp moss, dust shaken by thunder, rain sliding off shoulders) is filtered through the POV and reflects the character's priorities, meeting the 9+ gate requirement that environment charge the final image.</comment>

<comment>The dominant stake (discovering why paths choose walkers) is signaled early and pursued throughout. The dream-state descent functions as a tightening that narrows Elara's search to a single revelation. However, escalation is conceptual rather than decision-driven: the answer "blooms" in her chest, and the wafer seal's glow marks the directive's surrender, not Elara's trade-off. No live option is foreclosed by her agency; the storm, bunker collapse, and forest's "salute" all cooperate to deliver the answer without extracting visible cost. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening is present, but the lack of a felt price at closure (per Q2) limits the band.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>6.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically from images: the seven-path vision, the wafer seal's honey-to-obsidian transformation, and the forest reclaiming the bunker. The central question (why paths choose walkers) is explored through symbolic particulars rather than statement. However, the final paragraph edges toward Thematic Echo: "You were always the path" and "walkers, at last, become the road" articulate the thesis too directly, replacing earned resonance with summary. The piece invites reflection, but the closure moralizes rather than letting the image speak, triggering a −0.5 deduction per the Thematic Echo penalty guidance.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>POV remains stable third-limited throughout with a distinct perceptual signature: Elara's way of noticing privileges symbolic over practical detail (crow pecking clock, river uphill, paths reaching for wrists). Diction is elevated and internally consistent ("chlorophyll patience," "dream-state not as escape, but as excavation"), voice-motivated for a character who lives in foresight/hindsight. However, register drifts toward essayistic abstraction at peak beats ("walker's essence resonates with the path's hidden architecture"), slightly diluting immediacy. Free indirect style is clean, psychic distance controlled, and no head-hopping occurs.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>6.3</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and imagery is dense ("voices whispering from rusted pipes, children laughing in languages no longer spoken"). However, several paraphrase loops appear: "not with power, but with release" / "not with triumph, but with kinship"; "the bunker hadn't reclaimed the forest; the bunker had surrendered" / "The storm wasn't a threat—it was punctuation." Template-cadence runs emerge in the vision sequence and final paragraphs (repeated "not X, but Y" constructions across three or more lines), triggering a −0.6 deduction per the Patterned-artifact penalty pack. Clarity remains high, but momentum drags slightly under the weight of repeated syntactic frames. Filter-verb density ("placing her palm," "let the storm's rhythm sync") does not reach the ≥3-line stack threshold.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>5.7</grade>
<comment>The vine-draped bunker, decaying AI directive, and dream-method synthesis offer a fresh angle on the quest-for-meaning template. Elara's foresight/hindsight constraint and the "paths choose walkers" premise are specific and non-generic. However, the emotional arc follows a familiar wisdom-journey structure: descent, revelation via symbolic vision, emergence transformed. The final image (rain parting, trees bending in salute) leans toward wish-fulfillment rather than earned cost, and the thematic answer arrives as delivered insight rather than a choice forged under pressure. The piece commits to its premise but does not transform the template through consequence or moral calculus, placing it in the mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question>
<grade>4.8</grade>
<comment>Elara ("foresight hindsight only") is present throughout and her constraint shapes the opening reflection and the decision to use dream-descent rather than linear investigation. However, the character attribute does not drive a key turn or choice with visible cost. The revelation arrives via the directive's surrender and symbolic vision; Elara's foresight/hindsight limitation does not narrow options or impose a trade-off at closure. Setup clear (+0.5), one beat (dream-method selection, +0.4), no closure linkage (−0.2 late-arrival friction for thematic echo only in final paragraph), swappability moderate (−0.4): the story could function with a character who "sees patterns" or "reads symbols" with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 B</question>
<grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>The wafer seal appears in three distinct beats: initial tracing/examination, palm-contact during dream-state, and detachment/cradling before exit. Its cracked surface, residual authority, and glow-with-release provide texture. The seal enables the dream-ritual (middle beat) and is taken as "memory" at closure, reweighting its function from command to relic. However, its properties do not constrain a choice or impose cost; Elara's decision to take it is uncontested, and no trade-off is dramatized. Setup (+0.6), three beats (+1.4), closure presence (+0.5), ornamental use (−0.6 for no action pressure), swappability moderate (−0.4): a talisman or core fragment could serve similar function.</comment>

<question>9 C</question>
<grade>5.2</grade>
<comment>The "decaying directive" is introduced early (bunker's core programming, "preserve continuity at all costs"), recurs in the vision sequence ("trying to communicate before its final collapse"), and delivers the final whisper ("You were always the path"). It shapes the dominant stake (Elara seeks to understand why paths choose walkers, and the directive's paradoxes are the puzzle). However, the directive's decay does not narrow Elara's options or impose cost; it cooperates by surrendering and whispering the answer. Setup (+0.6), two beats (+0.9), closure linkage (+0.5), no causal pressure (−0.8), swappability low (−0.3): the story depends on an AI remnant offering wisdom, but "ancient oracle" or "encoded message" could substitute with moderate edits.</comment>

<question>9 D</question>
<grade>4.1</grade>
<comment>"Precisely playful" is named once ("moved with a precisely playful step, half-dance, half-defiance") and again at the wafer-seal detachment ("precisely playful twist of her wrist"). The trait is shown in choreography (boot-clicks calibrated to avoid alarms, wrist-twist) but does not constrain or enable a choice with visible cost—alarms are dormant, and the seal detaches without resistance. Setup (+0.4), two beats (+0.9), no cost (−0.5), label-heavy (−0.3), swappability high (−0.5): "deliberate grace" or "careful defiance" would serve equally.</comment>

<question>9 E</question>
<grade>5.9</grade>
<comment>"Transcend" appears explicitly in the dream-method descriptor ("the only method she'd ever trusted to transcend linear time's tyranny") and thematically in the closure claim ("memory… was the first step toward transcendence"). The action is enacted via dream-descent, which yields the revelation and enables the final walk "no longer bound by foresight or hindsight, but by the living now." However, transcendence is asserted rather than dramatized through a choice that forecloses a path. Setup (+0.5), closure linkage (+0.7), one beat (dream-descent, +0.4), summary-only at closure (−0.6), swappability moderate (−0.4): "understand" or "integrate" could replace with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question>
<grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>"Through interpreted dreams" is signaled early ("the only method she'd ever trusted"), demonstrated in the central beat (lying on floor, syncing pulse with storm, visions surging), and pays off with the revelation that blooms from dream-symbols. The method's mechanics (symbols bleed meaning: crow/clock, river uphill, wafer-seal transformation) are shown and matter. However, the method does not impose cost or constrain later action—Elara emerges from the dream gasping but unharmed, and the revelation arrives without trade-off. Setup (+0.7), one major beat (+0.4), closure linkage (+0.5), no cost (−0.5), irreplaceability moderate (+0.4): the dream-state is specific, but "meditation" or "trance" could substitute with moderate edits.</comment>

<question>9 G</question>
<grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>The "vine-draped bunker hidden in a rewilded forest" is anchored early (opening sentence) and revisited in the storm sequence (canopy illuminated by lightning, vines as guardians) and final collapse (swallowed by roots in under a minute). The bunker's decay and the forest's encroachment supply the thematic frame (surrender, reclamation) and charge the final image. The setting does not pressure a tactical choice, but it provides the ritual space (cold floor, seal housing, corroded grates) and its collapse forecloses return, functioning as a one-way threshold. Setup (+0.8), two beats (+0.9), closure linkage (+1.2), no tactical constraint (−0.6), irreplaceability high (+0.6): the bunker/forest duality is load-bearing for theme and image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question>
<grade>5.6</grade>
<comment>"When the storm approaches" is signaled in the opening line ("as the storm approached"), manifests in the middle beat (first thunder cracks, shaking dust; Elara syncs pulse with storm rhythm), and punctuates the exit (storm-lashed forest, rain sliding off). The timeframe creates atmospheric pressure but does not tighten decisions—Elara's ritual unfolds at her own pace, and the storm's arrival does not force a choice or impose cost. Setup (+0.6), two beats (+0.9), closure presence (+0.3), no tactical pressure (−0.7), swappability moderate (−0.4): "at dusk" or "during the eclipse" could serve similar atmospheric function.</comment>

<question>9 I</question>
<grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>The motivation "to discover why some paths choose their walkers" is named in the opening paragraph ("a question that had haunted her since childhood") and dramatized through the dream-descent and vision sequence (seven paths, one reaching for her wrist). The answer blooms in her chest and is articulated in the directive's final whisper. However, the motivation is pursued without friction—no competing want or cost complicates the quest, and the answer is delivered rather than earned through a choice. Setup (+0.8), one major beat (+0.4), closure linkage (+1.0), told-only origin (−0.3), no friction (−0.7), irreplaceability moderate (+0.5): the specific question is thematic, but "understand her destiny" could substitute.</comment>

<question>9 J</question>
<grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>"Ethereal grit" is coherent throughout: damp moss and rusted steel, vine-draped bunker and corroded grates, dream-state and calibrated boot-clicks. Tone modulates from atmospheric opening to lyric vision to declarative closure without jarring breaks. The final image (rain parting, trees saluting) leans more ethereal than gritty, but the bunker's collapse under roots provides grounded weight. However, tone does not charge the closure with tension—salute and easy passage feel wish-fulfillment rather than hard-won. Coherence across turns (+0.8), closure modulation (+0.6), no tension at end (−0.5), pattern-taught (+0.5): the duality is established early and sustained.</comment>
