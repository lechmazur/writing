<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The worker's interior texture is distinct—arboreal motivation, patience over force—and the choice to follow the sextant rather than fix it carries cost. However, the astronomer's vanishing and the worker's transformation into "cartographer of witnessed sorrow" arrive through exposition rather than embodied struggle; the final choice feels declared rather than earned through contradictory impulses acting in scene. Micro-choices (setting the sextant down, whispering "Show me") advance pressure, but the protagonist's arc relies on received understanding rather than friction between competing wants.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors quickly (maintenance worker, tower, storm, sextant). The accumulative/textural lens is taught early through poetic density and holds through the forest sequence; closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (the worker shifts from technician to witness-cartographer) with conceptual cost legible in the line "She wasn't fixing anything anymore. She was remembering for them." The sextant's healing and dream-projection constitute a meaningful tightening that reweights the dominant stake. One persistent seam: the astronomer's backstory and the worker's arboreal motivation are told rather than dramatized, creating minor causality drift in the middle third that weakens (but does not break) the because/therefore chain leading to the forest walk.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The tower (leaded windows, spiral stairs, rain-slicked parchment) and forest (mossy root, wet grass, leaf veins) are rendered through purposeful sensory detail filtered by the worker's attention. Moonlight functions as micro-setting: it triggers the sextant's healing and charges the closure image ("Moonlight pooled around her like a blessing"). The constraint is implicit—moonlight enables revelation—and the forest environment (oak crevice yielding artifacts) directly shapes the final mapping action. Spatial choreography remains clear across the descent and forest entry.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding arboreal witness to sorrow—is signaled early and drives the worker's choices. Pressure tightens when the sextant projects dreams, then deepens when she follows it into the forest; the oak's offered crevice constitutes a meaningful turn that narrows options (from fixing to remembering). However, no credible opposition tests commitment; the trees "lean toward her... in recognition" rather than resist, and the astronomer's precedent removes discovery-cost. The final choice (sketching dreams into her notebook) lands with conceptual cost but minimal friction, reading more as fulfillment than trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—grief as measurable, trees as silent witnesses—emerges through concrete images (the sextant's fractures, artifacts in bark) rather than statement. The sextant's overload and the worker's shift to cartographer offer a resonant answer: sorrow can be mapped, not solved. Subtext operates in gestures (pressing cheek to bark, whispering to roots) and the final image reweights the opening question without moralizing. Minor penalty: "mundane miracles" and "quantified sorrow" risk thematic echo, skating close to prompt-label territory in "the first cartographer of witnessed sorrow—mundane, miraculous, and finally, mercifully, mapped."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>POV distance is stable and the narrative voice carries a distinct poetic texture ("wind through hollow bone," "exhaling mist like breath held too long"). Perceptual signature—patience, attention to resonance—remains consistent. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register that strains the maintenance-worker lens ("pilgrim of mundane miracles," "quantified sorrow onto rings no axe would ever split") and the final paragraph's summary cadence ("She wasn't fixing anything anymore. She was remembering for them.") tells rather than embodies the shift. No dialogue on the page beyond the single whispered line, so naturalism tests do not apply.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and many lines do multiple jobs ("Its brass limbs lay twisted, its arc fractured, yet the worker felt it hummed with a quiet grief"). Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent. Penalties accumulate: paraphrase loops in the opening (sweat-wiping, trudging, haste-vanishing astronomer all frontloaded without pressure), template cadence in the middle ("How the old maple... How the gnarled yew... How the slender birch"), and elevated diction that clashes with the worker's practical role ("arboreal," "quantified sorrow," "cartographer of witnessed sorrow"). The closure beat itself remains clear, but artifacts in the final third ("mundane, miraculous, and finally, mercifully, mapped") disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band entries at 8.8 per the artifact rule.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of broken instrument, arboreal witness, and dream-mapping offers a fresh angle on grief and memory. The sextant's inversion (measuring sorrow instead of stars) and the trees-as-archive premise feel specific rather than stock. However, the emotional arc (wonder → recognition → peaceful acceptance) follows a familiar template, and the worker's frictionless success—no missteps, no resistance from the world—reduces risk. The astronomer's prior journey as precedent deflates discovery stakes. The piece commits fully to its lyric premise but does not transform the "mystic technician" or "sacred cartography" tropes beyond surface recombination.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The maintenance worker is present in all three sections (tower, descent, forest) and makes choices: deconstructing the sextant with patience, descending after the storm eases, setting the device on the root and requesting revelation, then sketching dreams. The final choice to map rather than fix creates the closure turn. However, observation dominates over friction; she does not struggle against doubt, fatigue, or competing priorities. The choice to "follow it" is prepared but not tested—she walks into acceptance rather than wrestling with cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The sextant appears in all three beats: broken on the workbench (setup), healing and projecting dreams under moonlight (middle turn), and set on the mossy root to guide the worker (closure participation). Its transformation from measuring stars to measuring sorrow is causally active, and its projection of scattered dreams enables the worker's final mapping action. The fractured-then-healed arc provides clear reweighting. Strong integration, though the astronomer's prior use of the device slightly dilutes irreplaceability—another could have followed the same path.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Quantified sorrow" is named early and governs the sextant's function (hairline fractures as measurements, dream-projection as data). It shapes the worker's motivation and the final mapping action. However, it operates more as thematic frame than on-page constraint; the story does not dramatize how quantification changes tactics or forecloses options—sorrow is witnessed and recorded, but the mechanics of quantification remain abstract. The concept charges the closure image but does not generate visible trade-offs during the action.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Heals in moonlight" is introduced at the midpoint and enables the key turn: moonlight causes the sextant to realign and emit dreams, which redirects the worker from repair to revelation. This trait constrains timing (the worker must wait for moonlight) and enables the dream-mapping that drives closure. The cost is implicit—moonlight dictates the moment of discovery—but the effect is decisive. Slight deduction for mid-story introduction and for the trait feeling convenient (why moonlight?) rather than prepared earlier.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Deconstruct" appears on-page ("began to deconstruct it, not with tools, but with patience") and the act of patient disassembly directly precedes the sextant's moonlight healing. The action sets up the worker's receptive stance and differentiates her from a forceful repair approach. However, the narrative could achieve similar results through careful observation or handling; the specific choice to deconstruct does not generate unique consequences or trade-offs. It shapes the beat but does not redefine options at closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Mapping scattered dreams" is signaled in the sextant's dream-projection and actualized in the closure: the worker sketches dreams onto her notebook, mapping "laughter onto leaf veins, silence onto root systems." The method is present in the final third and drives the closing action. However, it is told and summarized rather than shown in granular steps; we see her open the notebook and begin to sketch but do not witness the mapping process itself. The method is essential to closure but arrives late and is not developed across multiple beats.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The "stormlit tower by moonlight" is anchored early (spiral stairs, leaded windows, rain drumming, moonlight pooling through the slit-window) and provides the conditions for the sextant's healing. Moonlight is causally active—it triggers the device's transformation—and the storm's easing permits the descent. The forest setting in the second half (oaks, mossy root, wet grass) supplies the final stage and the oak's crevice offers the artifacts. Both settings constrain the worker's actions, though the tower functions more as atmospheric frame than tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"At the moment a pin is heard in a silent corridor" appears once, mid-story, as a metaphor for the small chime the sextant emits amid thunder. It does not structure the narrative clock or tighten decisions; the story unfolds across an untracked evening (storm, moonrise, descent, forest walk) without urgency. The phrase is ornamental rather than functional—a lyric grace note that does not constrain timing or alter tactics. Present but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The desire "to discover what trees witness" is stated early ("Her motivation wasn't academic or mystical; it was arboreal") and drives the worker's choice to repair the sextant, then to follow its guidance into the forest. The motivation is coherent and pays off when the oak reveals artifacts and the worker begins mapping dreams. However, the motivation is declared rather than dramatized through conflicting wants or visible cost; the worker never doubts, hesitates, or sacrifices another goal. The desire shapes the arc but lacks friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Mundane miracles" governs tone throughout: the worker's patient deconstruction, the sextant's quiet healing, the trees' recognition, and the artifacts glowing "like captured moonlight." The tone modulates appropriately—calm patience in the tower, reverent wonder in the forest—and charges the final image ("Moonlight pooled around her like a blessing"). The phrase itself is named in the closing paragraph, risking on-the-nose labeling, but the tone is enacted consistently across beats and supports the accumulative/textural lens. Coherent and purposeful.</comment>
