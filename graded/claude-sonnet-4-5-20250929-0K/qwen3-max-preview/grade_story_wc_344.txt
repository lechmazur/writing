<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The locksmith's motivation is stated clearly ("to understand why some breaks cannot be mended") but her interior remains abstract—labeled emotions ("anticipation," "full-hearted") without embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. The mirrors show past moments, yet these function as exposition rather than forcing present decisions that foreclose paths. The final departure reads as summary rather than a choice with visible cost; we're told she's "no longer a locksmith chasing prophecy" without dramatizing what she renounces or gains on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed: who/where/when remain vague past 120 words (−0.3). The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density increase toward a conceptual repricing—but the closure unit is weak: the locksmith leaves "empty-handed but full-hearted" without a legible on-page cost or decisive reconfiguration of her stance. The gears "embedded in the hall's ceiling" and her departure feel asserted rather than earned through prior causality or a visible forfeiture that narrows options.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The frozen library, ice-glazed marble, and glacial glass create vivid atmosphere. The Hall of Mirrors and the gear pedestal supply spatial coherence. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or charge the final image—she walks in, kneels, traces gears, and leaves without the setting altering her tactics or imposing cost. The body and tools (keys, apron) appear but do not shape the closure moment.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—learning "the rhythm of repair"—is signaled early but never tested by a meaningful on-page reversal or tightening. She reaches the hall unopposed, the gears align without resistance, and she departs without forfeiting a live option. The mirrors show past moments, yet no present choice narrows her path or forces a trade-off. Escalation under the Accumulative lens requires density increase or cadence shift; here the final beat summarizes rather than intensifies.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme—"repair is not restoration, but reharmonization"—is stated explicitly in the climax rather than emerging through image and action. The final line offers thematic closure ("keeper of quiet mendings"), but the silver threads dissolving and gears embedding themselves read as symbolic convenience rather than particulars that constrain choice. The mirrors' reflections of past moments function as metaphor without creating friction in the present stake.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with a distinct lyric register ("driftwood nostalgia," "breath fogging the air"). However, at peak pressure the voice remains uniformly elevated—"reharmonization," "salvaged seconds," "hauntingly bright"—without modulation. The locksmith's perceptual signature is filtered through poetic diction rather than her occupational or personal idiom. No dialogue appears. Psychic distance stays consistent but does not sharpen under stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully and figurative language is vivid ("moonlight itself had been woven," "memory—the driftwood nostalgia"). However, density suffers from paraphrase loops: "not to fix the world… but to understand why some breaks cannot be mended… and which ones must be" restates the same concept across three clauses. Template cadence in the mirror sequence ("They showed her… They showed her… They showed her") and elevated diction ("reharmonization," "latent purpose") in peak beats reduce propulsion (−0.6). The final third includes scaffold ("not from loss, but surrender") that abstracts rather than advances.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The lunar-eclipse locksmith and frozen skyborne library offer fresh specificity. However, the Hall of Mirrors reveal—past moments shown, wisdom received, protagonist leaves transformed—follows a familiar template without a non-obvious turn. The gears aligning into "a constellation of interlocking teeth" and the apron dissolving into light read as symbolic flourish rather than earned stakes. The emotional arc (solitude over love, choosing the library) is told in retrospect rather than tested on the page.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The lunar-eclipse locksmith is present throughout and her goal drives the sequence, but her choices do not create key turns—she reaches the hall unopposed, kneels, traces gears, and departs. The mirrors show her past decisions (refusing a commission, choosing solitude) as exposition rather than forcing a present choice. Her final departure is stated ("no longer a locksmith chasing prophecy") without an on-page decision that alters tactics or forecloses a path with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The clockmaker's gear assortment appears at the chamber's center, levitates, and forms a constellation. It is handled in two beats (kneeling, tracing the pattern), but its function is described rather than used to alter tactics. The gears "vibrating with latent purpose" and then "embedded in the hall's ceiling" serve as symbolic payoff without constraining a choice or creating friction. Swappable with another mystical object without structural impact.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The Hall of Mirrors shapes the scene's geography and supplies the mechanism for the revelation—mirrors show past moments, not her face. It appears in the opening prophecy, anchors the chamber description, and houses the closure image (gears in the ceiling, door sealing). However, the concept does not constrain her choices or impose cost; she moves through it unopposed. Present in setup, development, and ending, but causal pressure is low.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"Hauntingly bright" is applied to the apron's silver thread in the opening and recurs when the threads dissolve into motes of light. However, the attribute is purely descriptive—it does not enable or constrain an action. The dissolving threads are framed as "surrender" rather than a visible tradeoff. Label-only mentions without on-page cost; no gate met for middle development or causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Uncap" appears when she uncaps the velvet pouch, letting the three silver keys fall. This action triggers the gears to levitate and the mirrors to ripple—a clear causal link. However, the action is functional rather than transformative; dropping keys from a pouch could be replaced with another gesture (placing, offering) without redefining options. Present in one key beat with moderate causal pressure but high swappability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Through scraps of prophecy hidden in a library's corner" is mentioned in the opening ("she'd learned of the Hall of Mirrors… through scraps of prophecy") and summarized in one line ("seven winters tracing faded glyphs in frostbitten tomes"). The method is signaled early but does not shape present attempts—she reaches the hall without needing to decode further or apply the method under pressure. Setup present; middle development and closure participation absent.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The frozen library above clouds anchors the opening, supplies spatial coherence (ice-glazed marble, arched windows, oaken door, spiral stair), and frames the departure. The setting provides atmosphere and houses the Hall of Mirrors. However, it does not pressure choices or supply resources that alter outcome—she walks unopposed through each space. Micro-setting (the pedestal, the mirrors) organizes action but does not constrain tactics. Present in setup and ending with moderate scenic function.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Under the soft hush of a distant morning" appears in the opening line and closing paragraph. The timeframe establishes atmosphere ("dawn's blush barely staining the horizon") but does not tighten decisions or create urgency—she has already spent seven winters preparing, and the morning provides no live clock that alters tactics. Lyric reprise without causal pressure or felt constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"To learn the rhythm of repair" is stated clearly ("why she sought the rhythm") and dramatized when the rhythm pours into her ("not a beat, but a breath"). The motivation drives her seven-winter search and frames the closure revelation. However, it is not conflicted in present choices—no friction between this want and a competing cost or fear on the page. The mirrors show past renunciations (love, commission) in summary rather than forcing a present trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Driftwood nostalgia" is named explicitly ("the air hummed… with memory—the driftwood nostalgia of lives half-lived") and sustained through lyric diction, reflective pacing, and the mirrors' retrospective images. The tone is coherent but static—no modulation under pressure or cadence shift that charges the final image. The ending ("steps lighter than snowfall") maintains the same wistful register without intensification or purposeful tension.</comment>
