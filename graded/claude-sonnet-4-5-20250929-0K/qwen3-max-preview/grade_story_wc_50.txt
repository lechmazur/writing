<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The locksmith's motivation ("to store wonder in the cellar of reason") is told rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. His "peripherally focused gaze" is asserted as a trait but never constrains an on-page decision with visible cost. Interiority leans heavily on abstract metaphor ("mercury," "poetry's coat") rather than embodied sensation, and no meaningful choice or renunciation forecloses a path—he simply completes his archive and leaves. The final walk away reads as completion without struggle or trade-off.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The piece establishes who/where/when within the first paragraph and maintains spatial coherence throughout the cavern work. However, closure relies on Resonant Reconfiguration through summary declaration ("he'd remembered how to listen") rather than an on-page image that reweights prior material with felt cost. The "years later" coda attempts thematic payoff but occurs off-page and tells rather than shows consequence. Escalation is accumulative (reflections at 11:03, 3:17, dusk) but the final sealing and departure lack a visible price that alters the locksmith's stance or forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The marble cavern is vividly rendered with quartz veins, condensation, and the single shaft of midday sun that the locksmith uses tactically (aligning mirrors, triggering glyphs). The shattered stalactite at dusk demonstrates environment responding to action, and the resin slabs function as micro-setting that organizes the harvest. Sensory detail is abundant and selective, filtered through the locksmith's archive-building purpose, meeting the requirement that setting constrains choice and charges the final display.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving wonder for the thirsty and lost—is stated early but remains abstract throughout. No on-page reversal narrows options; the locksmith encounters no opposition, and each discovery (glyph, tone, shard) accumulates without friction or cost. The timer "shuddering" and emitting a tone are atmospheric beats, not pressure points that force trade-offs. Closure is a smooth completion rather than a choice that forecloses a path, and the "years later" travelers provide thematic echo but no dramatized consequence tied to protagonist agency.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Theme (wonder as nutrient, periphery as truth-source) emerges from repeated images—mirrors, angles, echoes—and the locksmith's methodical archiving embodies preservation over restoration. However, the final paragraph explicitly moralizes ("He'd built a larder for the soul") and the closing lines summarize theme rather than offering a resonant non-literal answer. The "echo, harvested, waiting" is poetic but tells rather than dramatizes cost. Subtext operates in the locksmith's gesture (not flinching, smiling) but the ending leans toward thesis statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Voice is consistent and lyric-textured throughout, with a distinct perceptual signature (glimmers, periphery, angles as syntax). Diction is elevated and purposeful—"foxed leather," "geological patience," "toxic if grasped too directly"—and matches the contemplative focalization. No dialogue appears. However, filter verbs cluster in reflective passages ("he believed," "he didn't believe"), and the final paragraphs shift into summary omniscience ("travelers would find," "someone, somewhere, would feel it") that dilutes tight third-person distance established earlier.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The prose is densely figurative with strong rhythm and vivid imagery ("frost clung like regret," "light as his scribe, angles as his syntax"). However, overwriting pervades: nearly every sentence carries metaphor or elevated diction, creating a uniform lyric register that flattens urgency—crisis and calm read identically ornate. Paraphrase loops appear ("not a failure but a fulcrum" echoes earlier reframings), and synonym churn surfaces in the closing paragraph ("glimmers"/"resonance," "bread"/"wine"). The final third's summary mode introduces template cadence ("They'd leave... whisper... unaware") that dulls the closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of locksmith-as-archivist, reflection geometry, and emotional resonance stored in physical angles offers a fresh premise. The "peripherally focused" trait and the harvest-of-echoes conceit are non-obvious and specific to this voice. However, the execution leans on familiar lyric-essay tropes (the solitary artisan, the abandoned village, the misunderstood visionary whose work is validated by later pilgrims) without transformation through dramatic conflict or cost. The timer mechanism as "fulcrum" and the travelers' offerings read as template beats from genre-adjacent work.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The locksmith is present throughout and his actions (aligning mirrors, collecting shards, sealing slabs) structure the narrative. However, these are procedural rather than decisional beats—no choice narrows options or incurs visible cost. His observation dominates; he never faces a dilemma that tests commitment or forces a trade-off. Present and functional but replaceable with another contemplative artisan.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The timer mechanism appears in the opening (salvaged from bell tower), is handled mid-story (shudders, emits tone), and sits "at the center of his display" in closure. It reweights from "broken" to "fulcrum." Early signal, two beats, closure linkage. However, the timer does not constrain a choice or narrow tactics—it is acted upon rather than enabling/limiting action. Charged reprise qualifies it for mid-6s but lacks the causal pressure for ≥7.0.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Harvest of echoes" is signaled early ("coax from fractured gears the harvest of echoes") and recurs in the closing image ("the echo, harvested, waiting"). It shapes the locksmith's archive-building goal and organizes his method (collecting shards, labeling by frequency). However, it operates primarily as thematic frame rather than on-page constraint—no beat shows him choosing one tactic over another because of the harvest concept. Lyric seed-to-reprise qualifies it for low 6s.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Peripherally focused" is explicitly stated ("His peripherally focused gaze never settled... he watched the edges") and described ("to see truth, he had to glance sideways"). However, it never constrains an on-page action with visible cost—no moment shows him failing or succeeding specifically because of peripheral vision, nor does he sacrifice direct sight to gain oblique insight. Label-only trait without dramatized trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Reverse-engineer" appears early in the locksmith's goal ("to reverse-engineer wonder") and his method involves working backward from fractured gears and reflection angles to recover resonances. However, the action itself is passive observation and recording rather than a choice-driven turn. Each discovery accumulates without the reverse-engineering process itself creating friction or narrowing options. Functional but swappable with "reconstruct" or "recover" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Studying reflection angles at different times" is signaled early ("He'd spent years studying reflection angles") and demonstrated in concrete beats (11:03 glyph, 3:17 pulses, dusk tone). The method supplies the mechanic for his archive work and organizes the middle section. However, the angles do not constrain a failed attempt or force a tactical shift—each angle simply yields a discovery. Present across beats and shaping attempts, but lacks cost-driven causal pressure for ≥7.0.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The marble cavern provides the quartz veins that pulse at 3:17, the single shaft of sun the locksmith angles at 11:03, the stalactite shattered by tone, and the geological patience that embodies the archive's permanence. It is signaled early, supplies resources that enable his method, and appears in the closure image ("in the marble throat of the earth"). The setting constrains his tools (mirrors, prisms) and the cavern's specific properties (condensation, veins) alter his tactics. Essential across beats and ending.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Across the lull of a wounded season" frames the opening and closing ("when the season finally stirred from its wound"), but the timeframe imposes no urgency or tightening. The locksmith's work unfolds in untracked "years" with no live clock pressuring decisions. The seasonal metaphor is lyric coloring rather than a constraint that alters moves. Present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The motivation "to store wonder in the cellar of reason, for later" is explicitly stated mid-story and shapes his archive-building goal. However, it is told rather than dramatized—no on-page moment shows him sacrificing certainty for wonder or facing friction between reason and preservation. The desire organizes his actions but does not create conflicted choices with visible cost. Functional but without friction between wants and costs.</comment>
