<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The poet's interior life is rendered through heavily elevated diction ("rarefied her grief into ritual") that reads as imposed rather than lived. Internal contradiction is present ("furiously tranquil") but remains a label rather than dramatized through simultaneous impulses in action. The final choice—not opening the envelope—lands as stance crystallization, but motivation remains abstract; we see her conclude "the scars were not endpoints but waypoints" without concrete micro-choices that earn the shift. Embodied emotion is sparse; most feeling is declared through metaphor rather than physical sensation or contradictory micro-behavior under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates storm imagery, timer ticks, and the sealed envelope toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis: she chooses not to open the envelope, a renunciation that forecloses immediate catharsis). Orientation anchors who and where early; when remains abstract ("stormlit" night, no clock time). The cost is conceptual—she accepts perpetual vigil—but the final image ("became her own archive, her own atlas") asserts the reweighting rather than showing a visible tradeoff or forfeited path. One meaningful deepening occurs (timer reaches zero, she does not reset it), but causality is thin; no because/therefore linkage forces the choice. The closure reads as thematic declaration more than felt consequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The observatory setting is vivid and purposeful: "domed ceiling streaked by lightning," "glass eye trained on galaxies." Spatial choreography is clear (chair, locker, eastern window). The darkroom timer and sealed envelope function as micro-setting objects that constrain the ritual. The storm accumulates pressure and charges the final image ("storm-kissed and wonder-struck"). However, the observatory itself does not alter a tactical choice on the page; it serves as atmospheric container rather than active constraint. Sensory detail is selective and consistent with the accumulative design, filtered through the poet's elevated register.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: the poet's negotiation with her censored past and the sealed poem. The vigil "in pause" establishes a stance; the timer reaching zero is the sole tightening. One on-page choice: not opening the envelope. Agency is present as renunciation (Earned Stasis), but no live opposition or cost is dramatized—no consequence for opening or not opening is made legible. The storm and censors remain off-stage; no escalation forces a trade-off. Pressure is asserted through metaphor ("cartography of scars") but does not cohere into a narrowing of options. The resolution feels more like a thematic summation than a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Theme—survival through self-archiving, transforming censorship into cartography—emerges from the storm, timer, and envelope. The final image ("her own unredacted sky") attempts resonance, but the piece states its thesis openly: "the scars were not endpoints but waypoints." The metaphor of "cartography of scars" recurs without evolving; each mention restates rather than reweights. Subtext in gesture or silence is minimal; most meaning is declared. The envelope's non-opening invites reflection, but the narrator's certainty ("She knew now") forecloses ambiguity. The thematic answer is non-literal and image-driven, yet the clarity of articulation ("territory no state could erase") borders on moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Single POV, third-person limited, stable throughout. Distance is consistent; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present—elevated, poetic register—but diction often exceeds the moment's needs ("rarefied," "cartography," "oracle of ink and bone"). Register remains high even under emotional pressure, lacking modulation. No dialogue. Purposeful compression ("furiously tranquil," "storm-kissed wonder") teaches a lyric pattern that holds at closure. Filter verbs are sparse. Psychic distance stays close. The prose voice is distinct but not character-particular; it reads as authorial overlay rather than the poet's own idiom under stress. Syntax and rhythm are controlled but uniform, without pressure-driven variation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout: "rarefied her grief," "oracle of ink and bone," "chorus of exiled muses," "quartz fractured to reveal its inner fire." In peak beats (timer reaches zero, final window scene) the metaphor stacking continues unabated, dulling propulsion. Mixed register: "darkroom timer" and "bus timetable" sit beside "cartography of wounds" and "suspended between heaven and oblivion." Template cadence appears in the final paragraph: "not endpoints but waypoints, not wounds but coordinates." Paraphrase loop: "The vigil was in pause" restated as "The vigil in pause was not waiting." Clarity remains intact, but density and loops reduce momentum. Information density is moderate; many sentences elaborate a single image without advancing situation or choice. Applying density penalty (−0.5), loop/scaffold (−0.4), and register drift (−0.3) within Q7 only, total deduction ~−1.2.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The premise—censored poet in stormlit observatory conducting a timed vigil over a sealed poem—is specific but derivative of solitary-artist-in-exile templates. The storm-as-muse and envelope-as-secret motifs are familiar. Transformation through concrete detail is limited; the poet's biography, the censorship mechanism, and the city "that no longer remembered her name" remain generic. The "tear shaped like a question mark" glyph and "bus timetable" offer small particularity. Emotional complexity is present in the renunciation, but the arc (isolation → self-acceptance) follows a well-worn path. The final image's resonance is intentional but not surprising. No bold structural risk; the accumulative design is conventional for lyric pieces. Proximity check: no direct echoes, but the tone and metaphor vocabulary recall published solitary-vigil narratives without fresh inflection.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Censored poet is present throughout as focalizer. She makes one on-page choice: not opening the envelope. Setup clear; middle beats show her handling timer and envelope; closure links to her renunciation. However, her decision does not create a key turn—it confirms a stance already established. Most beats are observational (looking at storm, remembering censorship) rather than decisional. Causal pressure is low; the choice feels thematic rather than consequence-driven. Swappable with "exiled artist" or "silenced writer" with minor edits. Integration solid but not indispensable. Late first-third positioning of vigil concept. Cost is conceptual, not visceral.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Darkroom timer appears in three beats: opening ("fingertips brushing"), midpoint ("her pulse matched the...cadence"), and ending ("clicked to zero...she did not reset it"). It measures the vigil and triggers the non-decision. Setup early; middle use as metronome; closure participation via reaching zero. Causal pressure moderate—its completion prompts her to lift the envelope. However, its specific properties (darkroom timer vs. any timer) do not matter; a kitchen timer would function identically. The object is present and functional but replaceable. Closure linkage is real but mechanical. Cost connection weak; no visible tradeoff tied to the timer itself. Irreplaceability low.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"A vigil in pause" is named early ("The vigil was in pause") and restated at closure ("The vigil in pause was not waiting"). It frames her stance: enduring without acting. The concept shapes her choice not to open the envelope, aligning with the "pause" logic. Setup clear; middle beats embody it (sitting, not resetting timer); closure pays off ("suspended breath"). However, causality is thin—"pause" justifies inaction but does not narrow options or impose cost. The vigil could be "solitary reflection" with similar effect. Integration is thematic rather than structural. Specificity moderate; the "pause" nuance distinguishes from simple "vigil," but the distinction does not alter tactics. Closure linkage present but not decisive.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Furiously tranquil" appears twice: opening ("sat furiously tranquil") and near-end ("smiled...fiercely, furiously tranquil"). It labels her contradictory state but does not constrain or enable a specific action. No on-page tradeoff where fury and tranquility pull her in opposite directions within a beat. The attribute is asserted, not dramatized through simultaneous impulses. Setup present; no middle development; closure reprise is decorative. Swappable with "calmly intense" or "serenely fierce" without structural loss. Label-only use. Cost connection absent. Integration ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Rarefy" appears once: "She had rarefied her grief into ritual." The term describes her coping method but does not drive a turn. It is told, not shown—we do not witness her refining grief on the page. No middle beat where rarefication constrains a choice. Closure does not hinge on it; the envelope decision follows from "vigil in pause," not from grief distillation. Setup weak (mid-first-third); no development; no closure participation. Summary-only use. Easily swappable with "distilled" or "crystallized." Late first appearance (~25% mark). Ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The method—envelope wedged in bus timetable—appears in one extended beat (mid-story). She retrieves it from the locker; the concealment is explained ("mundane enough to escape scrutiny"). The mechanics matter slightly: the bus timetable's obsolescence mirrors her exile. Setup late (~40% mark); no earlier signal. Middle beat shows retrieval; closure shows her holding it but not opening it. The method's specificity (timetable vs. any hiding place) adds poignancy but does not alter tactics. She could have hidden it elsewhere with similar effect. Causal pressure low; the hiding method does not shape the choice to open or not. Closure participation weak—she holds the envelope, but the timetable is discarded narratively. Late arrival, modest specificity, minimal causal work. Lyric reprise absent.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Observatory is named early and supplies vivid detail: "domed ceiling," "telescope," "glass eye," storm outside. It provides the sealed environment for her vigil. She moves within it (chair, locker, eastern window)—spatial choreography clear. The storm pressures mood and charges the final image. However, the observatory does not constrain a choice; it is container, not agent. She could conduct this vigil elsewhere (tower, lighthouse) without altering the arc. Setup strong; middle beats use space functionally; closure charged by storm imagery. Micro-setting (timer, envelope) more decisive than macro-setting. Environment shapes tone more than tactics. Integration solid but not indispensable. Specificity moderate; the "above clouds" and telescope nod to exile and vision but do not narrow options.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"When masks slip" appears in one interior reflection: "When masks slip...it is not in daylight courts...but here, in solitude." The timeframe is metaphorical, not diegetic—there is no tracked moment of mask-slipping on the page. No live clock; the storm provides urgency but not deadline. The phrase frames theme but does not tighten decisions or alter tactics. Setup absent (phrase arrives ~75%); no middle development; closure does not pivot on it. The poet's mask "had slipped long ago," so the timeframe is past, not present. Ornamental thematic echo. Swappable with "in moments of truth" or "when pretense fails." No cost tied to timing. Label-only.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"To understand the cartography of scars" is named early as "her only compass." The motivation recurs: "the cartography of wounds," "scars were not endpoints but waypoints." It justifies her vigil and frames the ending insight. However, the desire is told, not tested. No on-page friction where understanding competes with another want (e.g., forgetting, escaping). The motivation aligns with every choice without conflict. Setup clear; middle beats reference it; closure declares it achieved ("Each one mapped a place she'd survived"). But the achievement is asserted, not dramatized through a trade-off. The metaphor "cartography" could be "reckoning" or "inventory" with minor loss. Desire shapes framing but not a contested choice. Cost connection weak—no visible sacrifice to gain understanding. Integration thematic, not causal.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Storm-kissed wonder" appears in closing paragraph and titles the tone throughout: lightning, thunder, tempest imagery, "wonder-struck" at the end. Tone is consistent—elevated, lyric, awed—and modulates minimally (from "furiously tranquil" to fierce smile). The storm charges the final image strongly. Setup via storm imagery from line one; middle beats sustain it; closure pays off with "storm-kissed and wonder-struck." However, the tone is static rather than dynamic; pressure does not alter its register. The "wonder" is asserted, not earned through a discovery that shifts perception. Coherence high; specificity moderate (storm-kissed vs. tempest-awed); closure linkage strong. Tone supports but does not transform. Integration solid.</comment>
