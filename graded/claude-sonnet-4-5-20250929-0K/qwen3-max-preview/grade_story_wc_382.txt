<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to learn building language is established early, but her interior life remains largely ornamental—tracing moss, folding origami—without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The weekly tea ritual with the archivist shows relationship pressure, yet their dynamic never forces a choice that alters their state until the final exchange, which arrives as reveal rather than earned turn. The final acceptance of the key reads as information transfer, not a decision that forecloses a path with visible cost. Embodied emotion is present but muted; no diagnostic label-speak, but also no visceral stakes that compel higher-risk choices under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: details accrue (meteor shower, seal, key, building's sentience) toward a final image that reweights the premise. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph. However, closure cost is conceptual rather than felt—she receives the key and descends with new knowledge, but no on-page price is paid; the building "knew she was coming" states resonance without dramatizing what she surrenders or risks. The escalation from sugar-borrowing to key-exchange operates through exposition ("he confessed") rather than scene pressure, weakening the Resonant Reconfiguration. One meaningful deepening occurs (the seal's purpose revealed), but the cost remains asserted, not shown in a concrete sentence or image at the ending beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The rooftop garden, meteor shower, and recurring objects (seal, key, tea) are vividly rendered and purposefully selected. The seal's patina "catching starlight like a promise" charges the exchange scene. Spatial choreography is clear (bench, fire escape, basement vault behind furnace), and the building's sentience is woven through creaks, sighs, and settling groans. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or alter tactics—it provides atmosphere and symbolic resonance but remains backdrop rather than pressure. Sensory detail is strong (tea-stained receipts, velvet-lined cigar box, rusted key) and filtered through the protagonist's attentive lens, elevating the work into the 7+ range despite the lack of micro-setting constraint on closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—learning to communicate with the building—is signaled early and remains coherent. One meaningful deepening occurs when the archivist reveals the seal as cipher and offers the key, narrowing her options from passive listening to active dialogue. Yet this turn is delivered through confession and object-exchange rather than protagonist agency under pressure; she does not wrestle with competing costs or make a choice that forecloses a path. The "agreed upon lies" provide texture but do not escalate into conflict; the couple's unspoken compact dissolves without friction. No reversal tests commitment; the resolution is handed to her. Coincidence does not resolve, but neither does her decision carry visible price on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme—reciprocal communication, the sentience of neglected structures, the scaffolding of agreed-upon lies that hold up deeper truths—emerges through image and motif rather than statement. The seal-as-cipher and the transition from sugar-borrowing to truth-exchange offer non-literal answers to the central question of how to speak to what is forgotten. The final image of the building sighing in recognition reweights prior material with quiet resonance. However, the archivist's exposition ("it was sentient, stitched together by masons…") risks stating theme rather than trusting scene work. The piece resists tidy morals and invites reflection, but the climactic confession flattens some earned ambiguity. Solid thematic integration with one expository lapse near closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and controlled: lyric register, patterned syntax ("not dead in the way you'd fear—no pallor, no rigor—but dead as in retired"), purposeful compression. POV remains stable third-limited with no head-hopping. Psychic distance modulates intentionally (close during introspection, wider during exposition). Dialogue is minimal but carries subtext ("You knew." / "I suspected.") and advances plot. However, elevated diction occasionally drifts from the focalizer's likely lexicon during peak beats ("sentient, stitched together by masons who spoke a tongue lost to time"), and the archivist's exposition block reads as helpful-narrator intrusion rather than character-driven revelation. Perceptual signature is strong (her attention to creaks, moss, doorknobs), but the prose does not heighten under pressure; rhythm remains consistent rather than accelerating at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and figurative language is generally controlled ("meteors…painting the sky with fleeting silver scars," "lies a scaffold holding up something truer"). Information density is high; most lines advance character, atmosphere, or concept. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "She wasn't dead…but dead as in retired, forgotten" restates the same idea; "her motivation, now, was quieter, stranger" summarizes what the next sentence shows. The archivist's confession block stacks exposition without scene action, dulling momentum. Minor filter-verb clusters ("she believed," "he confessed") reduce immediacy in key beats. No mixed metaphors or template cadence, but the prose does not tighten at closure—the final paragraph maintains the opening's lyric register without propulsion shift. Solid craft with scattered scaffolding that prevents entry to the 7.5+ range.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The premise—a retired language tutor learning to communicate with sentient architecture via an antique cipher—offers a fresh synthesis of familiar materials (urban fantasy, forgotten knowledge, object-as-key). Specificity in detail (coiled serpent, cigar box, clay tablets baked in sun) and the transformation of "borrowing sugar" into a ritual of half-truths provide earned freshness. However, the core emotional arc (lonely expert finds hidden world and mentor) follows a recognizable template, and the resolution (key granted, descent to deeper knowledge) does not surprise in hindsight. The building's sentience is asserted late rather than demonstrated through constraint. Risk-taking is modest; the lyric frame and accumulative structure are competent but not bold. No close echoes of famous work, but the piece does not fully transform its genre conventions.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The dead language tutor is present throughout and makes one key choice at closure (accepting the key and descending). However, most beats involve observation or passive receipt of information rather than decisions that alter tactics. Her motivation is stated early and her final action aligns with it, but she does not wrestle with competing costs or drive reversals. She appears in all three gates (setup, middle ritual, ending descent) and her choice at closure is specific to her character, elevating the score to mid-band, but the lack of on-page struggle or visible tradeoff limits higher range.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The antique desk seal appears in three distinct beats: introduced in the opening third (setup), used to encode messages in clay tablets (middle development), and placed on the bench as catalyst for the archivist's revelation (closure participation). Its specific property—coiled serpent matching the key's symbols—matters causally. However, its middle use (pressing messages into clay) is told rather than dramatized, and the closure beat uses it as prompt for exposition rather than active tool. The seal constrains one choice (she brings it instead of sugar) and charges the exchange scene, but its irreplaceability is moderate; another cipher object could serve with minor edits. Strong integration across gates with moderate causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The concept "agreed upon lies" is named explicitly ("The agreed upon lies began with sugar") and illustrated through the weekly tea ritual where both characters sustain polite fictions. It shapes one tactic (the sugar-borrowing pretense) and provides thematic texture. However, it does not generate on-page conflict or narrow options at closure; the lies dissolve without friction when truth is offered. The concept is present in setup and middle but does not participate in the ending's pressure—by the final beat, "no lies exchanged" signals its absence rather than transformation. Functional but replaceable; the story's logic does not depend on the lies being "agreed upon" versus any other form of pretense.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The attribute "patiently nimble" is illustrated through specific actions: folding origami, plucking dew from spiderwebs, turning doorknobs without sound, and the closing line "her fingers brushing his—patiently nimble, even now." It appears in setup and is reprised at closure, reweighting her patience as both method and endurance. However, it does not constrain a choice or impose visible cost; the trait enables action but never forces a tradeoff (e.g., patience causing delay that matters). The reprise charges the final image with thematic resonance but lacks causal pressure. Present across gates with lyric payoff but minimal functional necessity.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The action "interrogate" appears explicitly in the middle section: "she'd interrogate him—not with suspicion, but with curiosity—asking about the building's original blueprints, its hidden crawlspaces, the odd hum in the west wall." This questioning drives the middle beats and sets up the archivist's eventual confession. However, the interrogation itself is summarized ("for months") rather than dramatized in scene, and the major turn (his revelation and key-gift) is triggered by her bringing the seal, not by a specific question. The action is present in two gates (middle, indirectly in closure) and shapes tactics, but its mechanics are told and it could be replaced with "researching" or "observing" without major structural change. Solid integration with moderate causal weight.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The method "borrowing sugar that turns into weekly tea sessions" is signaled early, developed through the middle section's ritual description, and implicitly present at closure when the pattern breaks ("No sugar borrowed"). It shapes one key turn—the shift from pretense to truth—and provides the social scaffold for their months-long exchange. However, the method is more backdrop than active mechanism; the tea sessions enable dialogue but do not constrain choices or impose trade-offs. The payoff is lyric (the pattern's dissolution charges the final "only truth" line) rather than causal. Present across all three gates with thematic reprise but minimal mechanical necessity; the story could achieve similar ends through other repeated encounters.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The rooftop garden during a meteor shower provides vivid atmosphere and frames the opening and key-exchange scenes. The meteors appear three times: opening, mid-scene ("another meteor shattered the dark"), and implicitly at closure when she descends. However, the setting does not constrain choices or supply resources that affect outcome; the garden and meteor shower are backdrop. The garden's "sigh" in the final paragraph ("not from wind, but recognition") offers thematic resonance but no causal pressure. The setting is present in setup and closure with strong sensory detail, but its role is ornamental rather than functional—removing the meteor shower would not alter the plot. Mid-band for atmospheric presence and lyric reprise without tactical impact.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>N/A</grade>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The motivation "to learn the language of old buildings" is stated early ("her motivation, now, was quieter, stranger") and dramatized through concrete actions: listening to creaks, pressing clay tablets, interrogating the archivist about blueprints and crawlspaces. It drives her weekly visits and shapes the middle beats. At closure, the motivation reaches fulfillment when she receives the key to the basement vault where "walls still speak in full sentences." However, the motivation is not conflicted on the page—no competing desire or cost tests her commitment. It appears in all three gates and drives choices, but the lack of friction or visible tradeoff limits the score. Strong setup and payoff with moderate causal pressure but minimal dramatized struggle.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The tone "mysterious familiarity" is established early through the blend of domestic ritual (tea, sugar-borrowing) and uncanny detail (building's sentience, cipher seal, language of structures). It modulates across beats: the opening's lyric distance, the middle's comfortable pretense, the exchange scene's quiet revelation. The tone charges the final image when the building "knew she was coming"—mystery validated by recognition. However, the tone remains relatively static; pressure does not sharpen it into urgency or dissonance. Coherent across gates with purposeful consistency, but the lack of tonal escalation or breakdown under stress prevents higher range. Solid atmospheric control without dynamic modulation.</comment>
