<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's interior world is vivid and consistent—his obsession with the missed gamble, the self-aware "grim optimist" stance, and the shift from carving to speaking proofs show contradictory impulses acting in scene. However, motivation remains largely reflective rather than dramatized through micro-choices under immediate pressure; the climactic moment (touching the reflection, losing the die) feels less like a decision with visible cost and more like a passive receipt of transformation. Embodied emotion is strong ("marrow-deep certainty," the metronome pulse of the die), but the final renunciation lacks the felt forfeiture that would anchor change to prior causality.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation is clear early (protagonist, infinite staircase, the chipped die as compass). The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density increases through recurring proofs, the die's clicks, the 37-step landings, building to the moment the staircase ripples and the reflection appears. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the die vanishes, he climbs on carrying "the captured texture")—the cost is conceptual (loss of the relic, acceptance of the missed opportunity as material rather than burden). One friction: the ripple and reflection feel like an external gift rather than a consequence of his agency, softening the earned quality of the shift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The infinite staircase is vivid, particular, and pressures every choice: "spiraled without curvature," stone that digests his equations, landings every 37 steps. The body (thumbnail carving, breath syncing with gears, back scraping stone) and the chipped die function as micro-setting, constraining action and charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (cold tread, hum of gears, neon-lit arcade memory). The environment is integral to the protagonist's tactics and the closure moment when stone becomes liquid glass.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—capturing the texture of the missed opportunity—is signaled early and remains coherent. Pressure accumulates through the repeating climb, the equations that vanish, the die rolled on landings, building to the moment he speaks the elegant proof and the staircase ripples. That moment is the one meaningful tightening: his utterance causes the transformation, and touching the reflection delivers the texture he sought. The cost is legible (the die vanishes, a relic traded for insight), though the reversal leans on external response (the staircase's ripple) rather than pure protagonist agency.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: regret as propulsion, perpetual motion as metaphor for recursive indecision, the mathematics of rupture. The chipped die, the arcade memory, and the equations all accrue meaning without stating a moral. The final image—climbing on with the captured texture woven into "the next proof"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer: acceptance and integration rather than escape. One small slip: "boundless confinement" and "recursive ascension" occasionally veer toward overt thematic language, but the story earns its conceptual weight through concrete action (carving, rolling, touching).</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV is stable, third-limited with tight focalization; perceptual signature is distinct (mathematical idiom, the physicist's lens on "theorem tested against gravity's silent dissent"). Diction is elevated and consistent, voice-motivated by the protagonist's intellectualism. No dialogue appears. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during the reflection touch, wider during the climb overview). Compression is purposeful and taught early; the reader learns the rhythm of ascent and proof. One friction: a few phrases ("texture of what might have been," "machinery of forever") approach abstract summary, but the concrete anchors (thumbnail, die clicks) keep the voice grounded.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies, sentence openings diversify, and information density is high (each paragraph advances image, stake, or insight). However, several lines loop conceptually: "the texture of that missed opportunity" recurs in near-synonyms ("grain of what might have been," "captured texture," "humid press of a future unlived"), and template cadence appears in the middle ("He didn't mind. The act mattered more than the artifact. Each proof was a rupture..."). Stock metaphor strings ("wound of his indecision," "shell of what he'd accepted") in peak beats and filter-verb reliance ("he'd believed," "he'd tried," "he remembered") dull immediacy. The overwriting is controlled but pervasive enough to prevent high-band entry; apply −0.8 for paraphrase loops and template stems, −0.3 for filter stacks.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of infinite staircase, mathematical proofs, and a protagonist haunted by a dice gamble is specific and memorable. "Balancedly daring" and "grim optimist" feel fresh as character stance. The transformation of regret into propulsion (climbing *with* the texture rather than toward escape) avoids template resolution. However, the "magical staircase as metaphor for psychological state" and "object vanishes at epiphany" are familiar moves; the piece executes them well but does not fully escape proximity to writing-exercise tropes. The mathematical idiom and the 37-step landings add verifiable texture.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The grim optimist frames the entire narrative; his stance (accepting impossibility while climbing anyway) drives the choice to speak proofs aloud, touch the reflection, and continue after the die vanishes. Present from the opening line and active in the closure beat. The trait constrains tactics (he doesn't try to escape, only to rupture) and the final image shows him climbing on, embodying the paradox. Two beats: the decision to stand after sitting, and the utterance of the elegant proof. Causal pressure is moderate—his choices shape the arc, but the staircase's response feels externally granted. Score reflects strong setup, multi-beat involvement, closure linkage, but limited irreplaceability (a "determined pessimist" could serve a similar arc with edits).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The chipped die appears in beat one (pocket, missing corner described), beat two (rolled on landings, never totaling seven), and the closure (vanishes after he touches the reflection). It is the only compass, a metronome of regret, and its absence at the end signals the shift from relic to integration. The object's chipped state matters (the missing corner = the missed throw), and its loss carries felt cost. Setup early, development through rolling and the clicks against his thigh, payoff in vanishing. Causal pressure: moderate—it does not enable the ripple, but its removal marks the threshold. High specificity and closure charge; cap below 8.5 because the die does not directly narrow options in the middle beats, only symbolize them.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Perpetual motion is signaled early ("He'd once believed perpetual motion was impossible—until..."), tested when he tries resting and the staircase carries him upward, and present in the closure ("symbiotic engine of boundless confinement"). It shapes stakes (he cannot halt the machine, only endure and rupture it) and tactics (speaking proofs to "rupture its logic from within"). The concept is active in at least two beats: the sitting attempt and the elegant proof that makes the staircase shudder. Causal pressure is strong—his inability to stop defines his only available move. Closure linkage is conceptual but undeniable (the staircase remains, he climbs on). High integration; cap below 8.5 because the concept is more constraint than tool—he does not manipulate perpetual motion, he inhabits it.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Balancedly daring" is named early ("moved balancedly daring—not reckless, not cautious") and reprised late ("He climbed on, balancedly daring"). It describes his stance but does not visibly constrain or enable a specific on-page action with immediate cost. The trait colors his approach (sitting once, carving proofs, speaking the elegant proof), but those choices are motivated more by curiosity and obsession than by calibrated risk-taking. Setup present, closure reprise clear, but middle development is label-only. Lyric resonance (first-third seed → final reprise) allows entry to mid-5s; lack of causal pressure or visible tradeoff caps score here.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Rupture" appears as intention early ("to rupture its logic from within"), method (each proof "a rupture—not of the staircase, but of his own resignation"), and climax ("a proof so elegant... it folded space"). The elegant proof causes the staircase to ripple, the one major on-page reversal. The action is signaled, attempted across beats (carving, then speaking), and pays off at closure. Causal pressure is strong—his rupture-attempt produces the transformation. However, "rupture" could be swapped for "break," "pierce," or "crack" with minor edits to diction; the concept matters more than the exact word. Score reflects multi-beat involvement, closure linkage, and causal role, capped by modest swappability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Mathematical proofs are signaled early ("whispered mathematical proofs to himself"), shown in action (carving partial derivatives, tensor notations, eigenvalues), and deliver the climax (the elegant proof that folds space). The method shapes his tactics (he cannot escape, so he probes with intellect) and the staircase's response (it digests the symbols, then ripples at the right proof). Present in three beats: carving, speaking, and the elegant utterance. Causal pressure: the method enables the reversal. Closure linkage is strong ("the next proof" in the final line). Specificity is high—only mathematical proofs fit this protagonist's idiom. Cap below 7.0 because the mechanics remain abstract (we don't see *which* proof or *how* it works), limiting felt constraint.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The infinite staircase is setup (opening line), pressures every beat (climbing, sitting, the staircase carries him, landings every 37 steps), and delivers the closure transformation (becomes liquid glass, then solidifies). It is the crucible: without it, no stakes, no tactics, no rupture. The setting is not backdrop—it *acts* (digests equations, moves him while sitting, shudders at the proof). Spatial specificity is high (risers, banisters, the void, landings at precise intervals). Causal pressure is maximal; the staircase's rules define all options. Closure linkage is total (the ripple and reflection occur *in* the staircase). Irreplaceable. Cap below 8.5 only because the staircase's agency occasionally feels external (it grants the ripple) rather than purely responsive to protagonist tactics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>N/A</grade>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The motivation—"to capture... the texture of that missed opportunity"—is stated early, dramatized in the arcade memory, tested through the climb and the proofs, and fulfilled at closure when he touches the reflection and feels "rough velvet of indecision, metallic tang of adrenaline." The desire drives his refusal to escape ("His motivation wasn't escape") and his choice to speak proofs (to rupture, not solve). Friction between want (to reclaim the texture) and cost (enduring the climb, losing the die) is visible. Setup, development (the rolled dice, the carving), and payoff (touching the reflection, carrying the texture forward) all present. Causal pressure is strong. Cap below 8.0 because the texture's capture feels granted by the staircase's ripple rather than purely earned by his prior choices.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Boundless confinement" is signaled early ("boundless confinement" in the text, "void that refused to acknowledge up or down," "perpetual motion"), sustained through the middle (he cannot stop, the staircase is infinite yet inescapable), and charges the final image (he climbs on, "carrying now not a relic of regret" but still within the machine). Tone modulates with pressure: wonder at the gears, grim laughter at the paradox, quiet acceptance after the die vanishes. Coherence is high; no tonal breaks. The tone is conceptual and atmospheric rather than a driver of choices, but it saturates every beat and the ending's resonance depends on it. Setup, development, payoff all clear; causal role is indirect (tone does not narrow options, but it reweights meaning). High specificity and closure charge justify upper-7 band.</comment>
