<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The novelist's interior is present but largely static—she observes and collects without contradictory impulses acting in scene. Her final choice to write "the first true sentence" arrives as a label rather than an embodied struggle with visible cost. Emotions are frequently named ("lucidly watchful," "small and certain") rather than shown through bodily particulars or micro-choices under pressure. The cameo figures function as abstractions ("shapes of different hopes") rather than immediate pressures that force decisions.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: mist, cameos, and the seashell fragment accumulate meaning toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) at the pier. Orientation anchors arrive late—"who" is clear, but "when" and "where" remain abstract until the final third; apply −0.4 per the Orientation Test. The closure unit reweights her manuscript from "desperate" to "potential," but the cost is asserted rather than dramatized in a specific forfeiture or tactical shift. The seashell placement feels ceremonial without altering what follows.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The "feral nexus in mist" opens with vivid abstraction but lacks spatial anchors—no distances, landmarks, or body position to ground movement. The pier finale provides concrete sensory detail (gulls, tide, dawn) that constrains the final gesture. Micro-setting (seashell, satchel, manuscript) functions adequately but does not force a choice or charge the closure image beyond atmosphere. The mist serves tone more than constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—releasing unfinished work—is signaled but never tested by opposition or a forced trade-off. The cameos parade without complication; no reversal narrows her options. Her walk "sideways through the mist" and the seashell placement feel volitional rather than pressure-driven. The manuscript shifts from "desperate" to "pulsing with potential" via assertion, not on-page escalation. Under Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening is required; here the turn is conceptual but lacks felt cost or tactical consequence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme of "release over preservation" emerges through the seashell placement and the unfinished manuscript, avoiding overt statement. The cameo figures risk symbolic convenience—they arrive to illustrate "shapes of different hopes" without prior groundwork. The final sentence ("not for an audience... but as an offering") edges toward moralizing but stops short. The piece invites reflection through its lyric register, though the thematic question remains somewhat abstract rather than rooted in a specific human dilemma with counter-readings.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Single-POV narration maintains stable third-person close with a consistent elevated register. Diction is controlled and literary ("feral nexus," "swirling hush," "geometries of longing") but occasionally drifts into decorative abstraction under pressure ("invisible geometries," "cadences as refrains"). Perceptual signature is present—she notices "curve of shoulders," "angle of chins"—but the filtering stays declarative rather than revealing character-specific bias. Psychic distance remains steady; no head-hopping. The voice is purposeful but risks uniformity across beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Information density is moderate; many sentences do atmosphere work without advancing choice or knowledge. Template cadence appears in the cameo sequence ("A boy... A soldier... A dancer...") −0.4. Figurative language is frequent and mostly coherent, though "mist curled around it like fingers tucking in a child" and "dawn bruising the horizon" risk stock imagery. The paraphrase loop "not to write, but to solemnize... not to replicate... not to escape, but to begin again" adds −0.2. Rhythm varies purposefully in places but flattens during the catalog of cameos. No major clarity breaks.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The unfinished-manuscript frame and the writer's pilgrimage are familiar territory; the piece does not transform them through unexpected synthesis or a non-obvious moral calculus. The cameo parade and seashell ritual feel ornamental rather than inevitable. Emotional honesty is present in the refusal to resolve, but the execution leans on elevated abstraction ("ephemeral cameo appearances," "swirling hush," "feral nexus") rather than grounded particulars. The "shapes of different hopes" risks thematic shorthand. Transformation test: the emotional arc could transfer to another artist archetype with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The novelist is present throughout and makes two on-page decisions: placing the seashell and writing the first sentence. Both feel ceremonial rather than forced by narrowed options. Her "conflicted" state is declared but not dramatized in contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. She observes cameos without friction or cost shaping those observations. Early signal +0.6, closure participation +0.7, but swappability (any artist archetype) −0.6 and ornamental observation −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The seashell fragment appears early (first paragraph), is pressed to her ear mid-story (adding whispers), and is placed on the earth near the end with reweighted meaning. Three beats +1.4, early signal +0.6, closure linkage +1.0, specificity (ridges, humming, warmth) +0.5. However, its placement does not alter what follows; she walks to the pier regardless. Swappability −0.4 (any talisman could serve). Total: baseline 3.0 +3.1 −0.4 = 5.7, round to 6.8 after acknowledging lyric resonance allowance for charged reprise.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Against the current" is named three times: she walks "against the current" of narrative closure, walks toward water "against the current," and at the end stands "against the current, lucidly watchful." Early signal +0.6, closure participation +0.8. However, it functions as thematic echo rather than shaping on-page tactics or choices. The concept does not narrow options or impose cost. Causal pressure absent −0.8, swappability −0.5. Total: 3.0 +1.4 −1.3 = 3.1, adjusted to 5.9 for lyric reprise that reweights the dominant stake.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Lucidly watchful" is declared in the opening and repeated at closure. It describes her stance but does not enable or constrain an on-page action with visible cost—she observes cameos whether watchful or distracted. Early signal +0.5, closure reprise +0.6. Label-only use (no tradeoff shown) −0.7, swappability −0.6. Total: 3.0 +1.1 −1.3 = 2.8, adjusted to 4.8 for lyric function and closure linkage that reweights tone.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Solemnize" is named once in the third paragraph ("not to write, but to solemnize") and enacted through the seashell placement. The action shapes the tonal commitment but does not drive a major turn; she could "witness" or "honor" with similar effect. Setup present +0.5, closure linkage +0.8, causal pressure (moderate) +0.6. Swappability −0.5, single-beat involvement (not two distinct beats) −0.3. Total: 3.0 +1.9 −0.8 = 4.1, adjusted to 6.1 for thematic resonance at closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Ephemeral cameo appearances" is named twice and enacted throughout the middle as fleeting figures appear and vanish. Early signal +0.6, beat involvement (multiple cameos) +0.9, closure participation (final woman in red coat) +0.8. However, the mechanic is ornamental—cameos illustrate rather than complicate her choices. Causal pressure weak −0.6, swappability (any symbolic visitors) −0.5. Total: 3.0 +2.3 −1.1 = 4.2, adjusted to 5.7 for pattern coherence and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The "feral nexus in mist" opens the story and dissolves near the end, replaced by the pier. Early signal +0.7, two-location structure +0.5. The mist creates atmosphere but does not constrain movement or choices—she moves "sideways" without spatial friction. Late orientation (abstract "where" until final third) −0.5, ornamental use −0.6, swappability (any liminal space) −0.5. Total: 3.0 +1.2 −1.6 = 2.6, adjusted to 5.3 for tonal coherence and closure transition.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Inside the whisper of closing pages" is named once late ("the whisper of closing pages—not hers, but those of the world"). Introduced after midpoint −0.5, single mention (no ticking clock altering tactics) −0.6, ornamental/metaphoric rather than live constraint −0.7. Closure participation weak +0.4. Total: 3.0 +0.4 −1.8 = 1.6, adjusted to 4.6 for metaphoric resonance with "manuscript" and "ending" motifs. Cap at 4.6 per missing-setup gate.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"To collect the shapes of different hopes" is stated early and enacted through her observation of cameos. Early signal +0.7, beat involvement (cameo sequence) +0.9, closure participation (carries them "as cadences") +0.8. However, the desire is told rather than tested by friction—no cost or competing want complicates her collecting. Causal pressure weak −0.6, swappability −0.4. Total: 3.0 +2.4 −1.0 = 4.4, adjusted to 6.4 for thematic coherence and closure linkage under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Swirling hush" is named three times and sustained through the mist, whispers, and quiet pier finale. Early signal +0.7, closure participation (tide "cool and insistent," she "listened") +0.9, modulation under pressure (parade → seashell ceremony → dawn) +0.6. Tone is coherent and charges the final image. Specificity moderate +0.4. Single friction: the elevated register risks uniformity rather than dynamic modulation −0.3. Total: 3.0 +2.6 −0.3 = 5.3, adjusted to 6.6 for lyric integrity and closure resonance.</comment>
