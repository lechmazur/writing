<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The forager's internal contradiction between involuntary truthfulness and the need to occlude is dramatized through both internal tension and the glass-eye totem. Her micro-choices—kneeling to harvest, choosing metaphorical language with the survivors, finally releasing the relic—show hierarchy of values with visible cost. The empathy-virus backstory is substantial but anchors in present stimuli (the trembling survivors, the truffle's scent) and tilts her stance toward release. Embodied emotion is strong ("trembling at touch, weeping at minor slights") but occasionally slips toward label-only affect in reflective passages.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraph. The piece reads as Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through layered images (orchard, mycelium, glass eye, survivors) and a cadence shift at the ending where she releases the relic and walks on, achieving Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis—she chooses trust over control, foreclosing the path of carrying safety as possession). Cost is legible: "her silence no longer armor but invitation" and the act of leaving the eye behind. The motivational through-line from self-protection to communal trust is causally earned by the survivors' acceptance and the child's laugh, though the reflective density in the middle third slightly softens urgency.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The ravine orchard is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail—moss-slick roots, swaying bridges, half-rotted fruit, mist—and constrains movement and choices (kneeling in damp earth, navigating swaying bridges). The glass eye as micro-setting object charges the final image when she places it in the lightning-split tree. Spatial choreography remains clear across all moves, and the mycelium/soil refrain grounds the ending's thematic weight without becoming ornamental.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—cultivating psychological safety—is signaled early and tightens when the three survivors arrive, forcing her to choose between blunt truth and occluded kindness. The tightening is meaningful: she first offers raw honesty, they flinch, she pivots to metaphor, they accept, and she later releases the relic entirely, foreclosing the path of personal control. One visible price (releasing the totem) alters her final stance. The arrival of the survivors is coincidental but complicates rather than resolves, and her agency drives the closure choice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme—safety as presence of regulation, not absence of threat—emerges organically from the forager's actions and the textbook fragment rather than thesis statement. The glass eye and truffle recur with shifted meaning: first tools of personal calm, then gifts, finally released wild. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: safety grows not from control but surrender, paid off in the image of the eye left in the tree and her smile at the child's laughter. The piece resists moralizing; the forager's insight is earned through specifics (soil, scent, trembling survivors) rather than abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, with a distinct perceptual signature—scientific attention to mycelium, embodied metaphor ("orchard sighing…like a lung"), and a restrained, particular lexicon. The narrator's certainty matches the forager's knowledge; purposeful compression in reflective beats ("You remember balance") reads as voice-motivated. Dialogue, when present, carries subtext and goal pursuit ("Please, wrap it in shadow. Say it slant."). Psychic distance shifts intentionally between close observation and reflective withdrawal, supporting emotional beats without head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings and paragraph lengths create visual and sonic cadence. Information density is high—most lines advance character, atmosphere, or theme. However, mid-story reflective passages show mild paraphrase loops ("not for adornment, but because…" / "not profit, nor thrill, but…") and a few filter-verb stacks in the mycelium passage that dull immediacy slightly. The closure beat is clean, with strong propulsion and no figurative muddle. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent, though "bruised clouds" and "fractured grace" trend toward stock phrasing.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of empathy-virus worldbuilding, involuntary truthfulness, and the forager's role is fresh and specific; the glass-eye relic and truffle-as-medicine anchor the premise in concrete particulars rather than allegory. The ending's move from control to trust feels inevitable in hindsight, earned by prior choices. The transformation test passes: plot and arc depend on these exact details (ravine, virus, truffles, glass eye). However, the "empathy as contagion" premise echoes recent speculative templates, and while the execution is strong, the core concept does not fully transcend its archetype.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Present by paragraph one (setup). Her choices create two key turns: kneeling to harvest truffles (middle development) and releasing the glass eye in the tree (closure payoff). Both choices narrow options and carry visible cost—harvesting under storm pressure, releasing her psychological anchor. Causal pressure is clear, and the closure turn is indispensable. Roles as observer (the survivors arrive) are brief; her decisions dominate.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Present in paragraph three (setup). Handled in three distinct beats: carried as totem (mid-story), offered to survivors (development), and placed in the tree (closure payoff). Each use reweights its meaning—from personal anchor to shared gift to wild invitation. The closure image depends on this exact object; removal would collapse thematic resonance and the forager's arc from possession to release. High irreplaceability and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Present by paragraph three (setup). The glass eye functions as smuggled relic with rumored properties that soften neural edges. It constrains her tactics (she holds it to bend her truths) and shapes the survivors' acceptance (development). At closure, she releases it, reweighting its function from personal tool to communal offering. Causal pressure is moderate; the relic enables one tactical shift and participates in closure, but its smuggled status is stated rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Present by paragraph two (setup). The trait constrains her speech: "people recoiled from unvarnished honesty, so she…learned to occlude her words." In the survivor encounter (development), she first speaks bluntly, they flinch, and she pivots to metaphor—an on-page cost and tactical shift. At closure, "her truth now a companion, not a curse" signals resolution. Visible tradeoff appears once; the trait shapes two beats and participates in thematic payoff.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Present by paragraph two (setup). Occlusion shapes her core tactic: using silence, metaphor, and the glass eye to soften involuntary truth. The survivor encounter (development) dramatizes the action—she pivots from blunt honesty to "Say it slant" metaphor. At closure, "without occlusion" marks the transformation. The action drives two beats and is indispensable to her arc; removal would collapse the tension between truthfulness and kindness. High causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Present by paragraph seven (late setup; ~40% mark). The textbooks are recalled in flashback: truffles secrete compounds that quiet the amygdala. The method enables her tactic (harvesting and offering truffles to survivors) in development. However, the mechanism is told rather than dramatized, and the textbooks themselves do not reappear at closure. One beat involvement; functional but replaceable with generic herbal-lore framing. Late arrival and summary-only use limit integration.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Present in opening sentence (setup). The ravine orchard constrains movement (moss-slick roots, swaying bridges, storm gusts) and supplies resources (truffles in damp earth, lightning-split tree). The setting pressures choices in three beats: navigating the storm, kneeling to harvest, and placing the eye in the tree (closure payoff). Spatial choreography is coherent; the orchard's skeletal, storm-battered state mirrors the post-virus world and charges the final image of endurance. Essential across beats and ending.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Present by paragraph two (setup). The empathy-virus aftermath shapes stakes (people raw, trembling, flinching) and motivates her foraging and occlusion tactics (development). The timeframe enables the world logic and the survivors' trauma. At closure, the child's laughter signals a shift in the post-virus landscape. However, no live clock tightens decisions; the timeframe is contextual rather than urgent. Two-beat involvement and thematic linkage, but time does not narrow tactical windows.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Present by paragraph five (setup). The motivation is dramatized through conflicted choices: she forages "for herself, first, then for the scattered survivors" and faces friction when offering safety plainly versus obliquely (development). At closure, releasing the relic enacts the motivation's final form—safety "unowned" and grown wild. Visible cost appears in the pivot to metaphor and the release. The motivation drives two beats and participates in closure, though the phrasing "psychological safety" trends toward prompt echo.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Present throughout. Tone coheres via diction ("fractured grace," "tender of small, subterranean mercies," "luminous") and modulates with pressure—restrained in reflective passages, compressed during the storm and survivor encounter. The final image ("her silence no longer armor but invitation") charges the ending with the tone's core tension: brokenness held with quiet resilience. Rhythm and cadence support emotional turns without static mood. The tone is indispensable to thematic resonance and closure effect.</comment>
