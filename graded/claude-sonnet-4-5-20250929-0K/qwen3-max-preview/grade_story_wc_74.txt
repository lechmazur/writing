<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The painter's motivation is externalized through ritual and belief rather than tested by on-page contradiction. Her "methodically hopeful" stance is declared but never constrained by doubt or cost that would alter a later choice. The arrival of the teenage girl provides a micro-turn, but the painter's interior remains static—no hierarchy of values emerges under pressure. The barista's compulsion and the girl's dream are off-page effects, not dramatized friction that would force the protagonist to recalibrate.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive clearly within the first paragraph. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: the painter's nightly ritual accumulates pressure through repetition, charged objects (brush, glyphs), and the resonant final beat when the girl joins her. Closure reads as Charged Poise—the shared painting reweights the dominant stake (proving strangers remember kindness) and crystallizes a before/after (solitary offering → collaborative continuation). Cost is felt but conceptual: the painter's solitary vigil ends, foreclosing her private certainty. The lens holds; the cost is legible in the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The rooftop greenhouse is signaled early, its glass panes and soot anchoring the smog-choked city. The moon's path dictates canvas alignment, and the skylight's opening becomes ritual choreography. The brush's lunar-charged bristles and the greenhouse's salt-and-jasmine air during the Vaelish glyph demonstrate that environment shapes the protagonist's method and charges the final shared painting. Spatial choreography remains coherent; the fire escape, studio door, and billboard across the street track cleanly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—proving strangers remember kindness—is signaled in paragraph four and tested through the painter's nightly glyphs. Pressure accumulates via the brush's transmissions, the barista's compulsion, the note on the door, and the offerings at the fire escape. The girl's arrival constitutes a meaningful deepening: the painter's solitary proof becomes collaborative continuation. Under the Accumulative lens, one tightening is sufficient at this length. Cost is conceptual—the painter's private certainty shifts to shared practice—but the trade-off (solitude for communion) is legible in the final beat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars: the brush as conduit, glyphs as lantern, the city's dormant empathy roused by encoded kindness. The Vaelish glyph ("the hand that gives water") and the Sky-Weaver glyph ("You are not alone") anchor the thematic question without stating a moral. The girl's arrival and the shared painting offer a resonant answer: kindness propagates not through fame but through transmission across strangers. The final image reweights prior material—no one knows the painter's name, yet the practice continues—without explicit philosophizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited with stable distance and a distinct perceptual signature: "silence that pooled like spilled ink," "daydreams sparked by moonlight to bloom behind her eyelids." The prose carries a lyric, unhurried cadence that modulates slightly when the girl arrives. Brief dialogue ("I drew this in my sleep…") serves subtext and advances plot without over-articulation. Filter verbs ("she believed," "she'd discovered") are voice-motivated and fit the reflective register. Psychic distance remains controlled; no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Overwriting strain in the opening: "smog-choked city offered none," "pooled like spilled ink," "glass panes streaked with soot and stubborn dew" stack figurative density without pattern-teaching. Multiple sentences open with "She + verb" ("She believed," "She worked," "She painted," "She smiled," "She kept painting"), creating template cadence. Paraphrase loops: "not for air…but for silence" and "less a sanctuary and more a confession booth" restate texture without advancing pressure. Information density is high in the brush and glyph mechanics, but the figurative load and repetitive stems dull propulsion in the first third. No causality break, so penalties remain in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The core synthesis—lost languages as encoded kindness transmitted via moonlit brush—offers a fresh angle on the "art as empathy catalyst" template. The Vaelish and Sky-Weaver glyphs provide specific cultural texture, and the brush's lunar-charged bristles avoid generic magic. However, the premise leans on familiar beats: solitary artist, mystical heirloom, gradual transformation of a weary city, climactic arrival of a kindred soul. The girl's crumpled sketch matching the glyph feels too symmetrical, reducing surprise. Transformation is present but modest; the emotional arc (isolation → collaboration) is legible but not startling.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The insomniac painter is present throughout and her ritual frames all beats. Her choice to align the canvas, dip the brush, and paint each glyph drives the middle action. The decision to step aside and allow the girl to enter creates the closure beat. Two clear beats (Vaelish glyph → barista compulsion; Sky-Weaver glyph → girl's arrival) and closure participation earn mid-band. However, her choices are methodical repetitions rather than high-cost pivots; the arrival of the girl is coincidental, not forced by the painter's prior tactical shift. Early signal, beat involvement, closure linkage present; causal pressure and cost connection are modest.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The calligrapher's moon-tipped brush appears in paragraph six with origin (mute librarian, brittle scrolls) and function (silvered bristles, lunar exposure, resonance). It is used in the Vaelish glyph beat (paragraph fourteen: "As the brush glided…"), the Sky-Weaver glyph beat (paragraph twenty-five: "She barely finished the final stroke…"), and implicitly in the shared painting at closure. The brush's mechanics—requiring moonlight, transmitting daydreams, whispering rather than shouting—shape the painter's method and charge the final image. Early signal, three beats, causal pressure (the brush carries meaning extinct languages cannot), closure linkage (the spare brush in the final beat), and irreplaceability (unique lunar properties) all present. Cost connection is indirect (the brush's gift imposes ritual constraint), preventing full 8.5+ range.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Lost languages are introduced in paragraph three (glyphs from crumbling archives, vanished syllables) and actively shape the painter's nightly work. The Vaelish glyph (paragraph fourteen) and Sky-Weaver glyph (paragraph twenty-five) provide specific extinct tongues with defined meanings that alter the city's empathy. The concept constrains tactics: the painter cannot use living languages; she must trust the brush to carry extinct meanings. The girl's matching sketch suggests the concept propagates beyond the painter's direct touch, deepening the stakes. Early signal, two major beats, causal pressure (lost languages encode kindness strangers can feel), closure linkage (the next glyph is painted in a lost tongue). Cost is conceptual—extinct languages resist conscious comprehension—but legible.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Methodically hopeful" is declared in paragraph nine but never tested by doubt or renunciation that would foreclose a path. The painter's ritual is steady and patient ("never frantic, never despairing"), and the girl's arrival affirms rather than challenges this stance. The attribute does not constrain an on-page action with visible cost; it remains a label that colors her approach without altering tactics under pressure. Setup present, no middle friction, no closure tradeoff. Swappable with "patient" or "determined" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Rouse" appears in the prompt motivation (prove strangers remember kindness) and is threaded through the narrative: the barista's compulsion, the note on the door, the offerings at the fire escape, and the girl's arrival all signal roused empathy. Paragraph twenty-three explicitly names "rouse—not of rebellion, but of remembrance." The painter's glyphs function as rouse-actions, and the final shared painting extends the action. Early signal (implicit in motivation), beat involvement (barista, note, offerings, girl), closure linkage (shared painting continues the rousing). However, the action is diffuse across multiple off-page effects rather than concentrated in one on-page turn. Causal pressure present but diluted; cost indirect.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The method—daydreams sparked by moonlight—is introduced in paragraph ten: "wait…for the daydreams sparked by moonlight to bloom behind her eyelids." Paragraph eleven clarifies that daydreams are transmissions (child sharing bread, nurse humming, old man leaving coins). The Vaelish glyph beat (paragraph fourteen) demonstrates the method in action: moonlight touches the brush, the painter sees the transmission, she paints. The Sky-Weaver glyph beat (paragraph twenty-five) repeats the method under a fuller moon. Early signal, two beats, causal mechanics clear. However, the method is not tested by failure or constraint that would force tactical adaptation; it works reliably each time. Closure linkage is indirect (the girl enters after the method succeeds). Cost connection absent.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The rooftop greenhouse in a smog-choked city is anchored in paragraphs one and two (fire escape, glass panes, soot, dew, urban noise) and recurs throughout. The skylight's opening (paragraph ten) and the moon's path alignment constrain the painter's ritual. The city's smog and weariness (paragraph twenty-one) provide the pressure the painter resists. The greenhouse's liminal position—above the city, beneath the moon—enables the transmission. The billboard across the street (paragraph twenty-six) extends the setting's reach. Early signal, beat involvement (ritual setup, Vaelish glyph, girl's arrival), causal pressure (the setting isolates and elevates the painter's work), closure participation (the greenhouse door opens to admit the girl). Specificity and irreplaceability high; cost connection modest (the rooftop is refuge but also exile).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The waxing moon is mentioned in the opening line and recurs in paragraphs fourteen ("under the swollen curve of the waxing moon") and twenty-five ("as the moon swelled fuller"). The final beat names "the saffron quiet of the waxing moon." The timeframe is cyclic and accretive rather than a live clock; the waxing moon signals increasing resonance but does not tighten a deadline. The moon's phase constrains the painter's ritual (she must wait for moonlight) and charges the brush's bristles, but no on-page decision is forced by lunar urgency. Early signal, beat involvement, closure linkage present. Causal pressure modest; cost connection absent. Lyric reprise (first line → final beat) reweights the moon's role from silence-provider to collaboration-witness, lifting the score slightly.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The motivation—to prove that strangers remember kindness—is stated in paragraph four and tested across the narrative: the barista's compulsion, the note, the offerings, and the girl's arrival all serve as proof. The painter's nightly ritual enacts the motivation, and her smile (paragraph eighteen) signals satisfaction rather than doubt. The girl's entrance (paragraph twenty-six) shifts the motivation from solitary proof to shared practice, altering the painter's stance. Early signal, beat involvement (barista, note, offerings, girl), closure linkage (shared painting extends the proof). However, the motivation is never conflicted by failure or cost that would force recalibration; it is affirmed rather than tested. Told-only in paragraph four, dramatized in later beats, but friction between wants and costs is minimal.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Saffron quiet" appears only in the final paragraph, naming the tone under which the shared painting occurs. The tone throughout is lyric, contemplative, and unhurried, modulating slightly when the girl arrives (her red-rimmed eyes and whispered speech introduce vulnerability). The opening's "silence that pooled like spilled ink" and the greenhouse's "salt and jasmine" air establish a sensory, meditative register that holds across beats. The tone supports the accumulative lens and charges the final image by naming the moon's color and emotional texture. However, the element is introduced late (final paragraph) and its earlier presence is implicit rather than named. Coherence across turns present; modulation with pressure modest; closure charge strong despite late arrival. Late penalty applies but lyric reprise partially offsets.</comment>
