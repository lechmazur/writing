<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's interiority is specific and embodied—somatic markers, phantom twinges, the pearl of stillness—but the final turn toward sketching and leaving drawings in tree hollows feels asserted rather than causally earned by prior micro-choices. The sister's memory is handled with restraint, avoiding sentimentality. Therapy-adjacent language ("somatic markers," "grounding," "pressure equals presence") borders on diagnostic label-speak but remains mostly anchored in bodily sensation. The shift from survival to "talent serves something beyond survival" is clean, though the agency behind it could be sharper.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation is clear by ~80 words (arboretum, seaside cliff, survivor context). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density increases through repeated visits, sketches, and the pearl-of-stillness motif, culminating in "I carry the pearl now, not in my pocket, but in my pulse." Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis meets Charged Poise)—the protagonist reweights grief as compass and continues witnessing with visible cost (the tears, the daily return, the secret gap in the fence). One meaningful deepening occurs when the freeze becomes "a frequency I'm finally tuned to receive." Cost is legible: the crumpled photograph's weight shifts, tears are counted no more, and the arboretum becomes collaborator rather than escape.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The arboretum's overgrown paths, ivy-swallowed benches, broken greenhouse panes, and storm-bent cypress are selective and filtered through the protagonist's attention to texture and survival. The cliff, gap in the fence, and daily dawn return create spatial constraint that charges the closure—"I climb through the gap in the fence like a secret kept between me and the cliff." The dewdrop-as-pearl and the way vines frame abandoned sketches show setting as active collaborator. Sensory hierarchy (barefoot on damp soil, moss spirals, gull cries timed to waves) reflects the protagonist's grounding practice without becoming a checklist.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—anchoring optimism in realism after trauma—is signaled early and tightens when the freeze at the cypress becomes a moment of reception rather than terror. One meaningful deepening: the photograph shifts from anchor/burden to compass, foreclosing the path of pure survival and opening witness-as-practice. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens through repeated dawn visits and the decision to leave unsigned sketches, each a micro-renunciation of control. The cost is visible: tears without timing, the gap climbed daily, the arboretum as necessary collaborator. No antagonist required; the protagonist's internal calculus between grief and green things pushing through drives escalation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: the pearl of stillness (dewdrop, held breath, pulse), the photograph's weight shifting from anchor to compass, and the arboretum's coexistence of ruin and regrowth. The final image—"I carry the pearl now, not in my pocket, but in my pulse"—reweights the opening's calibration goal without stating a moral. The contrast between the drone strike's fracture-without-warning and the arboretum's "eye within chaos" operates through action (barefoot grounding, sketching, leaving gifts) rather than assertion. One minor slip: "the quiet insistence of green things pushing through" borders on abstraction, though it's earned by prior moss-and-vine specifics. No thematic echo in prompt language at closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Single first-person POV is stable; perceptual signature is distinct (noticing moss spirals, gull-cry timing, silence as wearable). Psychic distance modulates purposefully from close embodiment ("phantom twinges," "pearl of stillness forming in the hollow behind my sternum") to reflective calm in the final paragraphs. Minor issue: "somatic markers" appears three times, twice as explicit instruction ("the way my body therapist taught me," "a somatic marker of its own"), which risks filter-verb stacking and slight didacticism. The voice remains consistent under pressure, and the final "I carry the pearl now, not in my pocket, but in my pulse" lands with earned compression. Diction stays within the POV's lexicon—lyric but grounded.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Rhythm varies well; sentence openings shift naturally. Information density is high in the cypress-freeze beat and the dewdrop-as-pearl morning. Two frictions: (1) "somatic markers" recurs three times with near-identical framing (label + instructional aside), creating a mild template effect; (2) the middle third includes paraphrase loops—"I don't come to escape. I come to witness" directly restates the prior paragraph's shift without adding pressure, and "The drone strike taught me... The arboretum teaches me..." is symmetric summary rather than dramatized contrast. No loops touch the closure beat. Figurative language (pearl, frequency, compass, shell cradling sea's memory) is consistent and purposeful, though "frequency I'm finally tuned to receive" borders on mixed metaphor with the earlier tactile pearl. Proofreading is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The combination of drone-strike survivor, abandoned arboretum, somatic grounding practice, and the pearl-of-stillness motif feels specific and non-obvious. The photograph's reweighting from relic to compass and the protagonist's unsigned sketches as gifts avoid stock recovery arcs. One friction: the broader frame—trauma survivor finding solace in nature through embodied practice—is well-trodden in contemporary literary fiction; transformation here relies on the dewdrop-as-pearl image and the "eye within chaos" insight, which are fresh but not fully surprising. The arboretum-as-collaborator conceit (vines framing drawings, rain blurring ink) adds ingenuity. Risk-taking in the freeze beat and the refusal to count tears elevate without obscuring clarity, warranting a modest within-band lift.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Survivor status is signaled early (first paragraph), drives the need for calibration and grounding, and shapes the freeze-at-cypress choice and the decision to sketch again. The trait appears in three beats: initial grounding walk, the freeze moment, and the sustained return with sketches. Closure participation is strong—"I carry the pearl now, not in my pocket, but in my pulse" directly answers the calibration goal. Cost is visible: daily return, tears without timing, the gap climbed like a secret. Swappability is low; remove the drone-strike context and the photograph's jasmine-and-gunpowder weight collapses. Causal pressure: the trauma constrains healing and enables the protagonist's attention to texture and stillness.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The photograph is handled in two beats: initial pocket description (jasmine and gunpowder, sister mid-laugh) and the freeze moment where it unfolds in the protagonist's mind "not as a relic of loss, but as a frame of pure, unguarded joy." Its weight shifts to compass by the closure paragraph. Appears in setup, middle reweighting, and closure. Cost tied to it: the tremors memorized by paper fibers, the decision not to unfold it often. One friction: the photograph remains mostly in the pocket after the freeze; the shift to compass is told rather than shown through a new handling beat. Specificity is high (veil askew, champagne flute, jasmine scent). Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.9, cost +0.4, told-shift −0.6, swappability low +0.4.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The concept is seeded early ("a pearl of stillness forming in the hollow behind my sternum"), returns as the named dewdrop on the bench, and is carried "not in my pocket, but in my pulse" at closure. It shapes the freeze choice—"I let the moment swell"—and the protagonist's shift from timing tears to witnessing. Three beats: freeze, dewdrop morning, final pulse. Closure linkage is strong. One friction: the concept operates mostly as metaphor and internal state rather than constraining tactics on the page; the freeze is a single moment, and the pearl's "shape lingers" in breath and pause but doesn't alter a second live choice. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure +1.2, causal pressure (moderate) +0.8, metaphor-heavy (not swappable but also not tool-like) −0.5, cost visible +0.5, ornamental (partial) −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Quietly talented" is claimed early ("I am quietly talented—not at anything grand, but at noticing") and enables the sketching resumption. It appears in two beats: the noticing catalog (moss, gulls, silence) and the drawing of roots, light, and lighthouse beam. At closure, "the talent serves something beyond survival." One friction: the trait is largely label-only in the first mention; the noticing is shown, but "quietly talented" itself is asserted. The sketching is a visible action, and leaving unsigned drawings as gifts ties to the quiet attribute. Swappability is moderate—"observant" or "attentive" could substitute with minor edits. Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.8, cost (modest: unsigned gifts, no need for recognition) +0.3, label-only mention −0.6, swappability −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The freeze is the story's hinge: "this freeze is different. It comes like a held breath beneath the ribs." It occurs mid-story at the cypress, enables the photograph's mental unfolding and the sister's laugh as frequency, and leads directly to the tears-without-counting beat and the sketching resumption. Three beats touched: cypress moment, crying on bench, shift to witness mode. Closure participation: the freeze's lesson (stillness as eye within chaos) is the conceptual answer carried in the pulse. Causal pressure is strong—remove the freeze and the shift from survival to witness collapses. Cost: the vulnerability of letting the moment swell, the tears, the daily return. Early-mid signal +0.5, three beats +1.4, causal +1.2, closure +1.3, specificity +0.6, cost +0.5.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Somatic markers" are named three times: phantom twinges in the opening, barefoot grounding ("pressure equals presence"), and "each line is a somatic marker of its own." The method is signaled early and shapes the grounding walk, but it operates more as explanatory frame than live tactic—the protagonist uses it once (barefoot on soil) and then describes it retrospectively for the sketching. Two beats: grounding walk, sketching. Closure linkage is indirect (the pulse at the end is somatic, but the phrase "somatic markers" doesn't appear there). Swappability is moderate—"body memory" or "embodied practice" could substitute. Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, causal (modest) +0.6, label-heavy −0.6, swappability −0.5, summary-only in third use −0.4.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The arboretum is present in all beats: overgrown paths, ivy-swallowed benches, storm-bent cypress, gap in the fence, and the daily dawn return. It constrains the protagonist's choice to return ("no one else comes; the path is overgrown") and supplies the dewdrop-as-pearl. Closure participation: "The arboretum, in its quiet decay, becomes my collaborator"; the gap climbed "like a secret" and the final witness mode depend on the setting's wildness and privacy. Cost: daily climb, isolation, the arboretum's demand-free presence as necessary counterweight to therapy's calibration goal. Specificity is high (cliff, lighthouse keeper absence, greenhouse panes, tree hollows). Early signal +0.7, four beats +1.4, causal +1.4, closure +1.5, specificity +0.7, cost +0.5, irreplaceable +0.6.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the last lighthouse keeper vanished" anchors the arboretum's abandonment but does not tighten the protagonist's decisions or tactics. It provides atmospheric context (wind-rattled glass, salt-crusted benches) but no live clock or pressure. The protagonist's visits span an untracked duration ("one afternoon," "one morning," "I return every dawn"), and the ending's pulse-carried pearl is eternal rather than urgent. Setup only; no middle or closure pressure. Present +0.3, atmospheric +0.2, no causal constraint −0.8, no closure linkage −0.7, vague tracking −0.6, decorative −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"To anchor optimism in realism, as my therapist gently insisted" is stated early and drives the protagonist's return to the arboretum, the barefoot grounding, and the final witness practice. It appears in three beats: opening goal, freeze-as-calibration (the pearl of stillness as the anchor found), and closure (the arboretum teaches "stillness is not the absence of chaos, but the eye within it"). Friction between wanting healing and fearing re-traumatization is implicit in "I don't come to escape." Cost: tears, daily exposure, the gap climbed. One friction: the motivation is told at the start and resolved at the end without a mid-story choice where optimism and realism visibly clash. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure +1.0, cost +0.4, told-bracketing −0.5, conflict (implicit) +0.3, summary treatment −0.4.</comment>
