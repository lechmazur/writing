<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The protagonist operates as pure observer-manipulator without internal contradiction or cost to her own stance. Her motivation is told ("neither greed nor fame, but something purer") rather than tested; she enacts perfect interventions without friction, doubt, or visible trade-off. The reunited couples experience gasps and hesitant hope, but these are asserted rather than embodied through contradictory impulses. No micro-choice under pressure reveals a hierarchy of values with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (emerald station, moonlight, thief's role) arrive within the first paragraph. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: the thief deposits moonbeams and flowers at two stations, creating parallel reunions that demonstrate her method without a causal linkage forcing escalation. Closure reads as Conceptual Repricing—"she wasn't altering fate—she was translating it"—but the cost remains abstract; no on-page action forecloses a path or imposes a felt price. The final image (jar nearly empty, soul brimming) asserts balance without dramatizing what she renounced or risked.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The emerald station's moss-cracked tiles, ivy-wrapped pillars, and Platform 3 bench ground the setting with selective, atmospheric detail. The jar of moonbeams functions as a micro-setting object that enables the spectral vision and charges two beats. Spatial choreography (archway, escalator, western alcove) remains clear across moves. The station pressures the reunions by supplying proximity and the departure-board rhythm of crossings, lifting the score into the 7-band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—demonstrating the thief's translation of fate—is signaled early but never tightens or deepens under pressure. She executes two identical interventions (moonbeam vision + flower code) without obstacle, adaptation, or cost. No reversal narrows her options; coincidence (the woman holding sunflowers arrives exactly when cued) resolves both reunions without protagonist agency forcing a trade-off. The declared motivation ("press your ear against destiny's door") remains decorative; no on-page choice tests it.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme (fate as translation, not theft; revelation as release) emerges through the flower codes and the repeated structure of vision + reunion. The final paragraph's "translating it" and "destiny's door… waited for someone quiet enough" make the concept explicit rather than letting the particulars speak. The two reunions offer specific images (sunflowers, the name "Arthur") that avoid pure abstraction, and the jar's emptying provides a concrete correlate to emotional expenditure. However, the ending asserts thematic resolution ("soul brimming") without a non-literal image that reweights prior material with cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV remains stable throughout, filtering station details through the thief's savvy attention ("reading not faces but the illuminated moments"). Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("luminous disbelief," "essential," "brimming") that clashes with the concrete action of planting flowers and pouring moonbeams. Dialogue is absent; the two reunited pairs are rendered through gesture and whisper, which fits the thief's silent method. Perceptual signature (codes in pigeon scatter, breath patterns) is character-specific and sustained under the lyric mode, though the final paragraph's expository summary ("she wasn't altering fate—she was translating it") breaks the show-don't-tell contract at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Overwriting pervades high-pressure beats: "bleeding the last hues of a fleeting golden sunset," "shadows pooled like spilled ink," "swirled like liquid mercury," "cathedral of crossings." Figurative language appears in most sentences without pattern-teaching or payoff (−0.6). Paraphrase loops: "She believed fate spoke in patterns" followed immediately by examples rephrasing the same claim; "not theft, but revelation. Not capture, but release" recycles structure without new information (−0.4). Template cadence: "She moved… her fingers… her eyes…" and "She didn't speak. She never did. Instead, she placed…" (−0.4). The final third's exposition ("This was her art—not theft, but revelation") stacks summary over image. Cumulative artifact penalty −1.4; disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band entries at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The premise—interventionist using symbolic codes to nudge strangers toward fated reunions—echoes guardian-angel templates without transformation through cost or moral calculus. Both reunions follow identical beats (moonbeam vision + flower code + coincidental arrival), reducing ingenuity to repetition. The jar of captured moonbeams offers surface novelty, but its mechanics (pour, form spectral image) serve convenience rather than constraint. No fresh inflection or non-obvious synthesis emerges; the ending's "translating fate" thesis could slot into any mystical-matchmaker frame with name changes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Present throughout; drives the two flower-placement beats. However, her choices enact a fixed method without adaptation or cost—observation trends into decision, but the decisions do not alter her tactics or stakes. No friction tests her "quietly savvy" stance. Functional but replaceable with any mystical helper archetype.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The jar appears in paragraph 5, is used at Platform 3 (paragraph 10–11), and returns at closure ("jar nearly empty," paragraph 18). Two distinct beats; its emptying signals expenditure. However, the cost is told ("cooled against her ribs," "soul brimming") rather than constraining a later choice. Causal pressure is moderate; closure linkage is decorative rather than decisive.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Illuminated moments are described (paragraph 3: "half-smiles before farewells") and echoed thematically ("revelation," "essential"). The concept frames the thief's gaze but does not change her options or tactics on the page. Swappable with "meaningful connections" or "pivotal instants" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Quietly savvy" appears in paragraph 2 as a label. No on-page action dramatizes the trait constraining a choice or imposing cost. She moves unseen and reads moments, but the attribute does not enable a visible trade-off or tactical shift.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Reinterpret governs the jar's use (moonbeam forms a spectral image of the past) and the flower codes. The action is functional across two beats but easily swappable with "reveal" or "translate" in the mechanics. Does not redefine options at closure; the thief's stance remains unchanged.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Flower codes are signaled in paragraph 9 ("codes in flower arrangements"), detailed (daisy = linger; three violets = turn left; sunflower = someone waits), and used twice (paragraph 13: white roses + lavender; paragraph 16: bluebells + red poppy). The mechanics matter: each code prompts a reunited pair's action. Present across setup, middle, and closure vicinity. Causal pressure is moderate; the method shapes two key turns.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Emerald station anchors the piece from the opening line, supplies Platform 3 and the western alcove, and provides the departure-board rhythm ("cathedral of crossings") that frames the thief's work. Spatial choreography guides the two reunions. The setting enables proximity but does not impose obstacle or alter the thief's tactics. Present in all three gates; causal pressure is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"Fleeting golden sunset" appears in the opening and closing paragraphs but is not tracked as a live clock. The thief's interventions unfold without time pressure narrowing her options. Decorative rather than tactical; swappable with "nightfall" or "dusk."</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The motivation is told in paragraph 8 ("to press your ear against destiny's door") and echoed at closure ("destiny's door… sighed, it creaked, it waited"). It frames the thief's stance but is never tested by friction or conflicting desire. No on-page choice dramatizes want versus cost. Lyric reprise reweights the stake with poetic charge but not dramatized pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Luminous disbelief appears at paragraph 11 ("luminous disbelief") when the man sees the moonbeam vision. The tone—wonder tinged with the uncanny—modulates gently through the two reunions and the closing image. Coherent but static; no tonal shift under escalating pressure. Charges one beat and echoes at closure without reweighting prior material through contrast.</comment>
