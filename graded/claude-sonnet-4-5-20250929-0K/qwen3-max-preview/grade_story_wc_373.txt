<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation is concrete and embodied through the watch fob, her surveillance tactics, and her micro-choices under pressure. Her "curiously steadfast grace" manifests in calculated retreats and misdirections, though the trait itself reads more as authorial observation than character-particular contradiction. The two failed prior attempts (apprentice, fortune-teller) provide useful stakes and demonstrate adaptive thinking. Interior life is somewhat thin—the girl remains more cipher than contradictory consciousness—but her final choice to walk away is earned by the pattern of listening rather than fighting.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration: the trust-breaking sound she hunts materializes not as violence but as recognition, and she achieves her mission by triggering memory rather than confrontation. The causality is tight—fob touches wrist, Marla freezes, The Chain flees—and the cost is visible in the shattered deal and her solitary departure. Orientation anchors (pier, market, pre-sunrise) arrive early. One meaningful tightening occurs when the drunkard's bump creates a false start that Marla dismisses, narrowing the window for the girl's final move.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The pirate market is rendered with vivid, purposeful detail: lanterns as "drunken fireflies," singing eels masking approach, shark-tooth coat, drowned men's nets. Spatial choreography remains coherent across the girl's movements from shadow to stall to crate. The watch fob itself functions as micro-setting, constraining her grip and charging the final beat when it swings over the deal. The sunrise timeframe creates atmospheric pressure but does not tighten tactics on the page as much as it could.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—thwart the deal before sunrise—is signaled immediately and pursued with escalating tactics: two prior failures, the drunkard false-start, and the final pendulum move. The false starts themselves constitute the method of escalation, each retreat a "calculated reset" that buys seconds. Pressure coheres under a Causal lens: the girl's agency (dangling the fob at the exact moment hands clasp) triggers the memory that shatters trust. The cost is legible in the broken truce, The Chain's flight, and her solitary walk into darkness without pursuit or celebration.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the collision of silence, memory, and inherited guilt. The "truce of hush" operates as both historical constraint and present tactic, deepening when recognition—not violence—breaks the deal. The watch fob's ghost-tick links three generations of broken promises, and the girl's refusal to chase or gloat charges the ending with renunciation rather than triumph. The final image—sunrise will come, market swallows her—offers a non-literal answer to whether trust can be captured or only witnessed. No didactic summary mars the closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Voice is atmospheric and consistent, with strong perceptual signature: "ghost-tick," "tar poured over whispers," "silence after Marla's exhale." Psychic distance remains stable in tight third, filtering market chaos through the girl's mission-focused attention. Dialogue is minimal but functional (The Chain's "Lighthouse blood" hiss). Some diction drifts elevated—"calcified into purpose," "slithered through the salt air"—in ways that occasionally exceed the girl's plausible lexicon, though the effect remains legible and voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully: short declarative beats ("The Chain was coming") alternate with longer sensory sweeps. Information density is high; most lines advance setting, character, or pressure. Minor template cadence appears in the middle third with repeated "She [verb]" stems across three consecutive paragraphs, slightly dulling momentum. One paraphrase loop: "She didn't plan to fight. She planned to listen" followed immediately by "The girl edged nearer" restates intent without added pressure. No loops touch the closure beat, which remains sharp and imagistic.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The premise—break a deal by triggering ancestral memory through a charged object—offers a fresh angle on noir betrayal and generational debt. The "false starts" method and "sound of trust breaking" motivation combine in non-obvious ways, avoiding the direct confrontation template. The watch fob as ticking ghost rather than mere heirloom, and the climax hinging on tactile memory rather than violence or revelation, demonstrate thoughtful transformation of familiar pirate-market tropes. The synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight and commits fully to its premise without retreat.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The moonshine runner's daughter frames the premise, drives all major beats (two prior failures, false-start recovery, fob-dangle climax), and makes the closure choice to walk away without pursuit. Her decisions alter tactics across the arc and her final renunciation forecloses the path of confrontation with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The antique watch fob appears in the opening shadow-crouch, is pressed to her ear for the ghost-tick mid-story, and becomes the active instrument at closure when it brushes Marla's wrist to trigger memory. Its inherited guilt and tidal timekeeping are irreplaceable properties that charge the final beat; removing it would collapse the story's causal spine.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The "truce of hush" shapes both historical backstory (Harbor Wars, lighthouse keeper's silence) and present tactics (the market's muffled menace, the girl's strategic silence, the deal's murmured ritual). It reappears explicitly when "the truce of hush settled again, thicker now" and breaks at closure "not with violence, but with recognition." The concept constrains choices and charges the ending, though it functions more as atmospheric rule-set than direct tactical lever.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Curiously steadfast" is introduced early and demonstrated through "false starts, feigned stumbles, sudden retreats" and her refusal to laugh or curse at the right moments. The trait enables her calculated persistence under pressure and contrasts with typical fear responses. However, it reads more as authorial observation than a visible tradeoff or constraint that costs her something specific on the page.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Thwart" is the stated mission in paragraph four and structures all major turns: two prior failed attempts, the drunkard false-start, and the fob-pendulum climax that breaks the deal. The action is irreplaceable; swapping it for "witness" or "join" would require full rewrite. The thwarting succeeds through induced memory rather than force, redefining the expected confrontation into a subtler victory.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Through false starts" is signaled early (paragraph six: "Each step forward was a gamble—through false starts, feigned stumbles, sudden retreats"), demonstrated in two prior failed disguises, and enacted on-page when the drunkard collision creates a false start that Marla dismisses. The method shapes her tactical approach and provides the cover for her final move; removing it would flatten her strategy into linear approach.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The pirate market beneath Pier Seven provides spatial resources (stall, crate of singing eels, anchor-chain curtain) that enable the girl's approach and concealment. The groaning timbers, swaying lanterns, and fish-gut stall create sensory cover. The setting's layered secrecy (hidden market, beneath pier, pre-dawn) mirrors the girl's tactics and pressures the sunrise deadline. It is integral rather than postcard.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Until sunrise" is stated in paragraph four and bookends the story ("Sunrise would come"). However, time remains largely atmospheric; no on-page moment shows the girl checking the horizon or adjusting tactics as dawn approaches. The deadline creates thematic pressure but does not tighten decisions beat-by-beat as a live clock would.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The motivation "to capture the sound of trust breaking" is introduced in paragraph two, deepened when she presses the fob to her ear for the ghost-tick (paragraph eleven), and fulfilled at closure when she hears "the brittle snap of trust shattering" in Marla's exhale and The Chain's retreat. The desire is dramatized through her listening stance rather than fighting, and the final success comes with the cost of solitude and no celebration.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Comforting unease" manifests in the girl's calcified fear ("fear had long since calcified into purpose"), the market's menace laced with laughter, and the ending's quiet rather than triumphant closure. Tone remains coherent through sensory dread (salt-rot, shark teeth, drowned nets) and modulates at closure when the silence becomes achievement rather than threat. The oxymoron charges the final image of the market swallowing her again.</comment>
