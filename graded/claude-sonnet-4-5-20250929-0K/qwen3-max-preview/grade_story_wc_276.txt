<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The fisher's cool-headedness is asserted more than dramatized under pressure; her choices feel guided by world-mechanics rather than internal contradiction. The transliteration ability reads ornamental—"maps feelings into phonemes, syllables into sonar"—without showing micro-choices or visible cost until the spike-slamming climax. Embodiment is present ("teeth ache," "bare feet whispering") but emotions remain largely label-free abstractions ("maternal fury," "acoustic wrath") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece coheres through density and sonic imagery building to a cadence shift when the spike cracks and releases the echo. Orientation is delayed—we learn who/where/what gradually through the first third—but the pattern teaches disorientation as texture, so waiving the penalty. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (the echo absorbed by constellations, the fisher carrying shards forward), but the cost is conceptual rather than viscerally felt on the page, weakening the final image's charge.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The sound wave garden is vividly realized through "tones bloomed like iridescent kelp," "choral ferns," "chime-bloom shattered," and the sonic strata. The rail spike constrains the fisher's final action (conducts the bass note) and charges the closure image (cracked, tucked as tuning fork). Spatial choreography remains clear throughout (kneeling, raising spike, standing). The micro-setting (body, spike, soil) shapes tactics and the ending, meeting the 9+ gate test, but sensory hierarchy could be sharper—urgency doesn't consistently narrow perception.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (catch the echo) is signaled early and pursued throughout. One meaningful tightening occurs when the fisher matches the feral lullaby pitch and the garden shudders, narrowing options. Agency is present (voicing silence, slamming spike) but the fisher's moves feel procedural rather than forced by escalating cost. The echo's release forecloses the hunt with visible cost (spike destroyed, echo carried by constellations), but coincidence—the constellation drifting close at the right moment—aids rather than complicates the resolution.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: grief as tide, patterns breaking, maternal rage into lullaby. The rail spike's transformation (prayer-carrier to tuning fork) charges meaning without overt statement. However, the final image—constellations orbiting "like pilgrims around a shrine"—edges toward explicitly naming the sacred rather than letting the image resonate. The piece resists moralizing but the echo's journey from "not caught" to "carried" feels slightly too tidy, resolving the complexity into a near-binary without lingering ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited, anchored in the fisher's perceptions. Diction is distinctive—"transliterates," "voicing silence," "choral ferns"—and purposeful compression ("not silent, but settled") fits the accumulative mode. However, elevated register occasionally drifts from the fisher's implied lexicon: "distilled into pure acoustic wrath," "somnambulant arcs" feel authorial rather than character-filtered. The prose rhythm modulates with pressure (short bursts during the spike-slam, longer lines in the aftermath), and the perceptual signature (sonic priority) remains consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Information density is high and figurative language is patterned (sonic metaphors throughout). However, overwriting clusters in key beats: "maternal fury distilled into pure acoustic wrath" stacks abstractions, and "not to possess, but to pass through" / "not caught. Not captured. But carried" repeat the same negation-then-correction template within two paragraphs (−0.5 for template cadence). Mixed metaphor: "silence became teeth" contradicts the established sonic-floral world logic without setup (−0.4). Line-level clarity suffers slightly under figurative density in the climax, but propulsion remains strong and no loops touch the closure beat directly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The sonic-garden premise and transliteration mechanic offer fresh synthesis, avoiding stock fisher-quest templates. The rail spike's dual function (ghost-train relic, acoustic conductor) feels specific and earned. However, the emotional arc—grief processed into purposeful carrying—follows a familiar shape, and the sleepwalking-constellations concept, while vivid, functions more as atmospheric texture than a transformation of the central conflict. The feral-lullaby fusion and the inversion moment ("sky became floor") show bold choices that heighten stakes without obscuring clarity, earning modest risk distinction.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The cool-headed fisher appears throughout and makes key choices (kneeling, voicing silence, slamming spike) that drive beats. Setup clear, development present (matching pitch, conducting the note), closure participation strong (standing, carrying shards). However, the cool-headedness itself is asserted rather than tested—no moment forces her composure to crack or be paid for, so the trait feels more like narrative stance than a constraint with cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Rail spike present early (salvaged sky-rail relic), used in multiple beats (trembling with her silence-carving, glowing cherry-red, slammed into earth, cracking to release echo), and transformed at closure (shards as tuning fork). Setup, development, and payoff all strong. The spike's properties (vibrating with ghost-trains, absorbing resonance) are irreplaceable and causally active. Scores well for beat involvement, causal pressure, and closure linkage, with visible cost (destruction) tied to its final use.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Sleepwalking constellations are vividly described and present across beats (drifting, pausing, weeping light, absorbing echo). Setup clear, closure participation strong (orbiting the spike's remains). However, their somnambulant state doesn't constrain the fisher's tactics—they observe and react but don't alter her options or create friction. The grief they embody enriches atmosphere but remains thematic rather than mechanical; the fisher would pursue the echo identically if they were absent.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Transliteration is explained early ("maps feelings into phonemes, syllables into sonar"), used in one key beat (matching feral pitch, humming backward), and mentioned at closure ("transliterated its rage into a single vowel"). Setup and payoff present; middle development arguable. However, the mechanics remain abstract—how transliteration differs from ordinary sonic mimicry or empathy is never shown through visible constraint or cost. The trait could be replaced with "attuned to sound" without altering the plot, capping score below 6.0.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Zigzag appears in two contexts: the fisher "zigzagged through the garden's sonic thickets" (first third) and constellations' "zigzag paths now purposeful" (closure). Setup and closure participation present, but middle development absent—the action doesn't constrain a mid-scene choice. The fisher's zigzag could be replaced with "moved carefully" without breaking causality; the constellations' shift from aimless to purposeful zigzag charges the ending image but doesn't drive a turn. Late first mention and swappability cap score.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Voicing silence is signaled early ("she began voicing silence"), dramatized in the middle beat ("carving hollows in the air where sound should be," "matched the feral pitch… humming backward"), and used at closure ("voiced that silence into the rail spike one final time"). Setup, development, payoff all clear. The method's mechanics—creating negative space, shaping absence—are specific and irreplaceable, enabling the echo's release. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage, with the spike's cracking as visible cost tied to the method.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Sound wave garden is anchored early, provides tactile constraints ("fragile chords that held this realm together," sonic thickets, buried bass note), and shapes the fisher's tactics (stepping carefully, kneeling to press the ground, slamming spike into sonic strata). Setup, development, and payoff all strong. The garden's unique properties (soil as auditory medium, vibrato vines, chime-blooms) are irreplaceable and causally active at closure (shuddering, folding, settling). Micro-setting functions as both stage and active pressure, meeting high-band criteria.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The timeframe phrase "when patterns break themselves" appears in the opening and recurs at the climax ("When patterns break themselves, they don't just fracture—they invert"). Setup and payoff present, but the phrase functions as thematic motif rather than live temporal pressure—no clock tightens decisions, and the fisher's tactics aren't altered by urgency. The inversion moment is vivid but could occur at any story-time without changing her choices. Lyric resonance lifts the score slightly but swappability and lack of causal constraint cap it mid-low.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The motivation (catch the echo of a goddess) is stated early, pursued through every beat (searching, voicing silence, conducting the note), and resolved at closure (echo released, carried). Setup, development, payoff all clear. The fisher's want is dramatized through action rather than told-only, and the shift from "catch" to "carry" reweights the goal with conceptual cost (renunciation of possession). However, internal conflict is minimal—no friction between wanting to possess vs. release, or competing desires that complicate the hunt—so the motivation trends high within band but lacks the layered contradiction for 8.5+.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Feral lullaby appears at the key turn (constellation's whisper "so feral it made the fisher's teeth ache") and recurs at closure ("dirge for what was lost, a lullaby for what might yet be reborn"). The tone—maternal ferocity softened into cradle-song—charges the final image and modulates with pressure (ache → wrath → settled quiet). Setup and payoff strong, middle presence arguable. Coherence holds across turns, and the tonal oxymoron (feral + lullaby) is specific and irreplaceable, but the element trends more atmospheric than causal—it enriches mood without altering the fisher's options.</comment>
