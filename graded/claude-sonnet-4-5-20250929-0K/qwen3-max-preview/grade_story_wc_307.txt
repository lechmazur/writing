<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elira's motivation (teaching vanishing as emergence) is clear and her backwards-aging contradiction creates embodied stakes. However, her interior life tilts toward philosophical abstraction rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene—"the weight of what she withheld" and her grief remain largely told rather than shown through micro-choices under pressure. Kael is present but passive; his single question and bow do not reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost. The final choice (his agreement to descend tomorrow) is accepted rather than wrestled with on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The piece establishes a clear Accumulative/Textural lens: the stone-toss creates ripples that become temporal notation, and the final vow crystallizes Kael's readiness to vanish. Closure reads as Charged Poise—Kael's bow and Elira's promise to descend frame the next step with undeniable pressure. Orientation anchors (floating platform, Elira, Kael, starlit grotto) arrive within the first ~100 words. The cost, however, is largely deferred ("tomorrow"); the on-page price is implied through atmosphere rather than a forfeited option or visible trade-off in this scene.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The floating obsidian platform, magnetic grotto, and circular pond are vivid and purposeful. The platform's suspension "by forces even Dr. Elira Voss no longer tried to name" and the grotto's "temporal echoes no machine could replicate" anchor the world's metaphysical logic. The pond constrains the teaching method—Kael watches ripples that become symbols—charging the final image when starlight fractures through the canopy and he reads time. Sensory detail (cool stone, sycamore hush, cobalt and pearl light) is selective and filtered through the scene's meditative urgency.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—teaching Kael to vanish so he can appear—is signaled early and maintained. The stone-toss moment creates a micro-turn (frustration → fascination → recognition) that tightens Kael's readiness. However, escalation remains conceptual; no live choice forces a trade-off on the page. Elira withholds explanation, but this is pedagogy, not conflict that narrows her options. The ending defers the true test ("tomorrow, you'll throw the stone"), so the pressure crystallizes without paying a visible cost in this scene window.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme—vanishing as preparation for emergence, absence more present than presence—arises from concrete particulars (the stone, the rings, the grotto) rather than assertion. "The stone is gone. But its meaning expands" offers a resonant, non-literal answer. Subtext operates in Elira's withheld truths and Kael's silent bow. Minor slip: "Vanishing isn't erasure—it's preparation" edges toward thesis statement in dialogue, and the final paragraph's repetition of "through the trance / through patience / through the sycamore hush" risks rhythmic assertion over earned image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited to Elira is stable; distance and focalization are clean throughout. Perceptual signature is distinct—Elira's backward-aging researcher lens colors the grotto as "temporal echoes," and her grief over rejected papers and lost lovers anchors her withholding pedagogy. Dialogue is sparse but purposeful: Kael's "Why?" and "You've been teaching me to read time" advance plot and reveal his shift. Diction ("sycamore hush," "weave truth carefully") is controlled and voice-consistent. No head-hopping or filter-verb clutter in peak beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally and information density is high in the stone-toss beat. However, scaffold and near-loops appear: "She weaved no more truths tonight. / She withheld nothing now" is a paraphrase pair, and "Elira said nothing. / She withheld explanation" closely restates the same intent within adjacent paragraphs. Template cadence runs: "Through the trance. / Through patience. / Through the sycamore hush" in the final lines, while rhythmically intentional, flatten propulsion at closure. Figurative density ("temporal notation," "fractured light") remains controlled and legible. Proofreading clean; no grammar breaks.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The backwards-aging researcher teaching delayed revelation through pond ripples is a specific synthesis that avoids stock templates. The floating platform and magnetic grotto create a non-generic mystical setting. However, the mystical-teacher-and-student frame and the "withholding truth until the student is ready" arc are familiar; transformation depends on the temporal-notation twist, which is signaled but not yet tested on the page. The ending defers the boldest choice (Kael's vanishing) to tomorrow, leaving this window in the setup phase of a larger arc. Risk-taking is present in the backwards-aging conceit but not yet leveraged for high-stakes choice within this scene.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elira (backwards aging researcher) frames the teaching, tosses the stone, and delivers the central lesson. Her backwards aging is mentioned twice—once in exposition, once tied to her grief—but does not constrain an on-page choice. She decides to withhold explanation (setup), orchestrates the stone-toss (middle), and promises descent tomorrow (ending), so she touches all three beats. However, her decisions flow from her established pedagogy rather than creating a key turn; Kael's realization is the pivot, not Elira's choice.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The magnetic grotto is introduced early (paragraph 4), described as pulsing with temporal echoes. It appears again at the stone-toss moment ("the grotto below in streaks of cobalt and pearl") and is invoked at closure ("we'll descend into the grotto"). Setup, middle visual reprise, and closure promise all present. However, the grotto itself does not alter a tactic or supply a resource on the page; it remains atmospheric and deferred to tomorrow's action. Its meaning does not evolve within this scene—it stays a destination.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Delayed revelation shapes the entire arc: Elira withholds explanation, the stone's ripples delay their symbolic meaning, and Kael's recognition ("You've been teaching me to read time") arrives only after watching the rings slow. The concept is signaled early ("premature clarity would shatter the trance"), drives the middle beat (Elira's silence after the toss), and charges the ending (the promise of tomorrow's vanishing after the revelation has ripened). It constrains Elira's pedagogy and alters Kael's stance on the page.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Weaves truth carefully" is introduced early ("She wove truth carefully, syllable by syllable, silence by silence") and shown in the stone-toss beat when Elira withholds explanation. It reappears at the end ("She weaved no more truths tonight"). Setup and closure present; middle beat is the withholding silence after the toss. However, the trait constrains pedagogy rather than creating a felt cost or enabling a risky choice. Swappable with "teaches patiently" or "guards knowledge" without major restructuring.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Withhold (the action) is signaled in paragraph 7 ("she withheld explanation, withheld reassurance, withheld the truth"), performed in the stone-toss beat (Elira says nothing after Kael asks "Why?"), and thematically reprised at closure ("She withheld nothing now—except the final step"). All three beats present. The action drives the middle turn (Kael's frustration melts into fascination) and defines Elira's teaching method. However, "withhold" as verb is broad; substituting "delay" or "conceal" would preserve most of the arc.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The pond, stone, and rings are introduced early (paragraph 12), used in the middle beat (Kael watches ripples that become temporal notation when starlight fractures), and invoked at closure ("tomorrow, you'll throw the stone. And I'll watch the rings"). The method shapes the teaching: without the rings, Kael does not learn to read time. It is specific (not merely "meditation" or "observation") and its mechanics—concentric circles carrying the stone's memory—matter to the revelation. Present in all three beats with clear causal work.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The floating rock meditation platform is named in the opening line, establishes the setting for the entire scene, and is invoked at closure when Kael bows "forehead to stone" and Elira turns toward the platform's edge. Setup and closure present; middle beat is atmospheric (the platform remains the stage). However, the platform does not constrain a choice or supply a resource—its floating nature and obsidian material are described but do not alter tactics. Swappable with "clifftop temple" or "mountaintop hermitage" without loss of causal structure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Through the trance" is invoked early ("Through the trance, Kael's breathing deepened") and reprised in the closing lines as part of the method. It frames Kael's meditative state during the stone-toss beat and is promised again at closure. However, the trance itself does not tighten decisions—Kael remains passive throughout, and the timeline ("tomorrow") is stated rather than pressured. The timeframe is present but does not function as a live clock that alters moves within this scene.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Elira's motivation—to teach vanishing to appear—is stated in paragraph 6 ("Her motivation was simple, if paradoxical") and drives her withholding pedagogy in the stone-toss beat. It is dramatized through her choice to toss the stone and withhold explanation, and it charges the ending promise ("you'll vanish. And then—only then—you'll learn how to appear"). Setup, middle choice, and closure all present. However, the motivation is more explained than conflicted; Elira's grief over colleagues and lovers is told rather than tested against her teaching aim on the page.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Sycamore hush" appears in the opening line, recurs twice in the middle ("barely louder than the sycamore leaves overhead"), and closes the story in the final line ("let the sycamore hush settle over him like a vow"). The tone is quiet, meditative, and sustained without rupture; it modulates slightly when the starlight fractures and Kael gasps, then returns to stillness at closure. The hush charges the final image by framing Kael's silent acceptance. Tone is coherent and purposeful, supporting the delayed-revelation concept throughout.</comment>
