<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The poet's motivation ("to discover the texture of time") reads as abstract thesis rather than earned interior need. Her "ethically playful heart" is asserted but never shown constraining a choice with visible cost. Silas exists only in exposition; the village elders appear in the final third without prior setup, and their tears of "recognition" arrive without earned contradiction or struggle on the page. The protagonist observes and interprets but makes no micro-choice that forecloses a path or tests competing impulses.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural through the grotto nights, but the village-square climax pivots to situational without teaching the shift. The rope's "revelation" (frays = record) is told by narrator assertion rather than dramatized through the poet's changing tactics. Closure offers a Conceptual Repricing (the rope becomes a bridge metaphor), but the cost is purely social and off-page; no felt or visible sacrifice by the protagonist anchors the final image. Orientation is present but vague: "seven moons" and "the week the energy beings descended" float without concrete anchor to present action.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The grotto's terra-cotta warmth and violet moonlight are vivid but postcard-static across repeated nights; the setting does not constrain a choice or shift tactics. The rope is handled in multiple beats (tracing, spiral layout, village uncoiling), which lifts the score, but spatial choreography in the village square lacks blocking—where the factions stand, how the rope "brushes both sides" physically. The energy beings' light "stitches" the rope, a strong lyric reprise that charges the final image and meets the 9+ gate for object-as-micro-setting.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake ("discover the texture of time") remains abstract and is never tested by a concrete dilemma on the page. The poet faces no live choice between competing goods; she descends to the village and offers the rope without friction, cost, or reversal. The elders' paralysis is told, not shown as escalating pressure. Silas's impossible choice is backstory; the poet "celebrated his refusal" but never inhabits a parallel bind herself. No tightening forecloses a path or forces a tradeoff with visible price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Theme (impossible choices as invitation, not binary) emerges clearly but through narrator thesis rather than contradictory particulars. The poet's final speech ("true wisdom lies not in picking a side, but in holding the tension") is explicit moralizing that replaces scene pressure, triggering the thematic-echo penalty. The rope's symbolic arc—from escape tool to bridge—is purposeful but arrives without irony or counter-reading. The piece states rather than earns the insight that "morality isn't fixed, but fluid."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Narrative distance is stable third-limited, and the poet's perceptual signature (texture, attention, ethical play) is consistent. However, purple density pervades high-pressure beats: "auroras humming hymns older than language," "tears into revelation," "something softer, deeper, and finally, mercifully, possible." Register drifts into elevated poeticism ("tactile archive," "knot in time's fabric") that exceeds the POV's embodied lexicon under stress. The village elder's single line of interior reaction ("recognition") leaks certainty the narrator cannot possess. No dialogue on the page to evaluate naturalism or subtext.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Heavy figurative density without pattern-teaching: "silence like an onion," "tea into bone," "stones in a brook," "stitching night into something softer" pile metaphor without coherent vehicle. Paraphrase loops: "not as a trophy, but as a tactile archive" / "a knot in time's fabric she refused to let unravel" restate the same idea. Template cadence in the grotto nights: "Each night… she laid / She'd begun… she'd whisper / One evening… she laid." Stock therapy-speak: "moral ambiguity," "courage to pause," "holding the tension." Filter-verb stack in peak beat: "she gasped… wasn't repair—it was revelation… proof that morality wasn't fixed." The final paragraph ("something softer, deeper, and finally, mercifully, possible") is rhythmically inert and vague. Artifacts touch closure, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The frame (roadside poet, mystical beings, moral parable) echoes familiar lyric-fable templates without fresh synthesis. The rope-as-metaphor and "impossible choice" concept are present in countless craft essays; here they function as thesis illustration rather than lived particular. The village elder's epiphany and bridge-building feel like allegory with transparent stand-ins. The poet's method ("uncovering layers") is asserted but never shown constraining her tactics. No bold structural risk or non-obvious angle; the moral ("hold the tension") arrives as expected from the setup.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Present throughout and named as protagonist, but her sole on-page action is descending and laying the rope; no decision alters tactics or forecloses a path. Observation dominates; the poet interprets Silas and the energy beings but never chooses under pressure herself.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Rope appears in grotto tracing (night sequence), spiral layout with energy beings, and village square uncoiling—three beats. Its frays are reweighted from damage to record, charging the thematic turn. Closure linkage is symbolic (bridge metaphor) rather than causal; the rope does not constrain her choice to descend. Swappable with another artifact (e.g., Silas's journal) with minor edits. Strong setup and development, but final use is ornamental metaphor rather than plot necessity.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Impossible choices frame Silas's backstory and the village dilemma, but the poet herself faces no such bind on the page. The concept is told and thematized ("invitations to uncover layers") without shaping her tactics or narrowing her options. Present as theme claim rather than dramatized pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Ethically playful" is asserted twice ("never cruel, never careless—but delighted in moral ambiguity"; "her ethically playful heart alight") but never shown constraining or enabling an action. Label-only trait without visible tradeoff or cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Uncovering layers" (pattern recognition) drives the grotto sequence and the rope revelation, shaping two beats. The poet's method is signaled early and returns at closure when she offers "texture" to the village. However, the final turn (rope becomes bridge) is executed by the villagers off-page, not by her continued pattern work. Integral to middle development but not indispensable to closure mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"By uncovering layers" is named explicitly and enacted through nightly rope tracing and the poet's advice to "uncover layers, not cut through them." Method appears in setup (grotto nights), middle (revelation via energy beings' light), and closure (village teaching). Mechanics remain abstract—what does uncovering look like as a distinct tactic?—but the method recurs and the closure speech echoes it. Just meets two-gate threshold with lyric reprise; swappable with "contemplation" or "patient witness."</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Grotto is named and revisited across nights; its terra-cotta warmth is felt, and it frames the revelation beat with the energy beings. Setup and development present, but the setting does not constrain her choice or supply a resource that alters the outcome. The climax occurs in the village square, which is introduced late without prior anchor. Grotto functions as lyric frame rather than pressure source.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"After the energy beings arrive" anchors backstory (Silas vanished "the same week") and provides the grotto's auroras, but no ticking clock tightens tactics. "Seven moons" of carrying the rope is told duration without urgency. The timeframe sets context but does not escalate decisions on the page.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"To discover the texture of time" is stated as her quest and repeated in the grotto method, but it remains abstract. She seeks understanding, not a concrete goal with friction or cost. The motivation anchors her actions (carrying the rope, nightly tracing) but never conflicts with a competing want or fear. Told desire without on-page tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Tone blends lyric elevation ("hymns older than language," "tears become revelation") with sensory grounding (rope fibers, warm clay). The passionate subtlety holds through the grotto nights and modulates at the village square, where diction remains heightened but shifts to direct speech. Consistent and purposeful, though the final paragraph's density ("softer, deeper, and finally, mercifully, possible") tips into abstraction. Tone charges the thematic turn but does not sharpen the closure image with fresh urgency.</comment>
