<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elira's motivation is stated clearly but her choices lack meaningful internal conflict or embodied cost. The transformation from seed-sorter to memory-weaver unfolds through exposition rather than dramatized struggle; we're told she "understood" and "realized" without showing contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The grandmother's benediction ("You sorted silence") arrives as external validation rather than earned insight from prior micro-choices. Interiority relies on label-only feelings ("mossy delight," "gasped") and the final state feels declarative rather than costly.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within acceptable range, but the inferred lens remains ambiguous—accumulative texture competes with causal seed-to-revelation without teaching a stable pattern. The closure unit attempts Resonant Reconfiguration (transformed always), but cost is asserted rather than shown: Elira "still sorts seeds" with no visible forfeiture or narrowed option on the page. The grandmother's emergence and knowledge-flood bypass prior causality, functioning as exposition rather than earned turn. Multiple story-lengths (decades of folklore, traveler influx, monument evolution) compress the 600–800 word window without legible transitions or a coherent pressure arc to the ending.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The ashen skyborne arbor is vividly rendered with specific sensory choices (petrified roots, petrichor and starlight, dew-glass beads) that establish atmosphere. However, the environment remains largely decorative: spatial choreography is vague (canopy heart, root-knot, arbor floor) and the setting does not meaningfully constrain Elira's choices or alter her tactics. The dust-specks and monuments are handled, meeting the micro-setting option, but their mechanics feel interchangeable rather than essential to pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—decode the arbor's message—is signaled early but never tested under pressure; Elira encounters no obstacle,误解, or trade-off. The moonstone speck revelation arrives as gift rather than reversal, and the grandmother's appearance resolves without agency or cost. No meaningful tightening occurs; the narrative expands outward (monuments grow taller, travelers ascend) rather than narrowing options. Coincidence (a glint catches her eye) drives the central turn, and the ending declares harmonization without showing what Elira forfeited or failed to achieve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Theme—memory woven into matter, the past as perpetual unfolding—emerges through concrete images (dust-specks, twig monuments, the lullaby thread) rather than abstract statement. However, the grandmother's dialogue ("You sorted silence") and the final paragraph's summary ("the past didn't haunt—it harmonized") veer into overt thematic articulation that replaces scene pressure. The story resists tidy morals but leans on "mossy delight" as emotional shorthand, diluting specificity at key beats.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping, and the voice carries a distinct lyric texture through elevated diction ("arbor exhaled its secrets," "communion," "emotional resonances"). However, register drifts into anthropological summary ("regional folklore," "skyborne scholars," "emotional resonances") that flattens Elira's perceptual signature under pressure. Key beats—prodding the speck, the grandmother's emergence—lack embodied interiority and rely on stock metaphor ("coiled around her wrist like a vine") and template phrasing ("mossy delight" recurs without evolution).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Figurative language saturates high-pressure beats without pattern-teaching or payoff: "cathedral of petrified roots," "silence thicker than fog," "stitching memory into matter," "liturgy," "harmonized"—mixed metaphors (roots/cathedral, stitching/loom, arbor exhaling/speaking) muddle clarity. Paraphrase loops cluster: "not mere cataloging; it was communion" / "not just speaking through leaves" / "not a ghost, not a god" repeat negation-plus-correction stems. Scaffold sentences abound ("She understood then," "From that day," "And so she walked," "From then on"), and the final paragraph summarizes rather than shows the transformation. Template cadence and synonym churn ("mossy delight" twice, "transformed always" as title-drop) touch the closure beat, triggering elevated penalties per the artifact pack and disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The premise—arbor speaks through falling leaves, dust-specks hold memory—offers a fresh micro-fantastical angle, and the image of tiny monuments to forgotten things is specific and memorable. However, the emotional arc (patient cataloger discovers magic, gains wisdom, becomes sanctuary-keeper) follows a template hero's-reward structure without meaningful transformation through lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The grandmother's appearance and knowledge-flood resolve without cost, and the final state (travelers ascend, echoes harmonize) reads as wish-fulfillment rather than earned consequence.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Elira is present throughout and her role (seed sorter → memory weaver) frames the arc, but her choices lack causal pressure. The decision to prod the speck and embed dust in monuments unfolds without opposition or trade-off; observation dominates over decision-making that narrows options.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The moonstone cabochon dust speck appears in three beats: discovery, prodding/unspooling, and embedding in monuments. It enables the central turn (lullaby revelation) and recurs with reweighted meaning (other specks conjure scent, echo). However, it arrives late (past the midpoint) and resolves a problem it did not help create, capping score per late-element and piggyback rules.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Regional folklore is mentioned as backstory and cited by elders, skyborne scholars, and the codices, but it shapes stakes only abstractly. The concept echoes thematically rather than altering on-page tactics or choices; Elira's work proceeds without friction from competing interpretations or folklore-derived constraints.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"Transformed always" appears as a label in the grandmother's emergence scene and the final paragraph, but the transformation is told rather than dramatized. No on-page action is constrained or enabled by this attribute; it functions as ornamental phrasing rather than a trait with visible cost or tactical consequence.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Prod" drives the inciting incident (moonstone speck unspools) and recurs as method (prodding moss to summon the grandmother). The action is specific, irreplaceable, and causally necessary for both key turns. However, it arrives late and the second use feels symmetrically echoed rather than escalated under new pressure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Building tiny monuments is signaled early, recurs across beats (child's whistle, soldier's letter, baker's loaf), and evolves (embedding dust-specks, towers humming with voices). The method shapes Elira's ritual and the story's accumulative texture, but the mechanics remain vague and the monuments do not constrain her choices or impose cost—they grow "taller, intricate, alive" without obstacle.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The ashen skyborne arbor is vividly described and present throughout, framing all action. It supplies resources (leaves, dust-specks, root hollows) and the canopy's heart is the site of the grandmother's emergence. However, the setting does not meaningfully pressure Elira's choices or alter her tactics; she moves freely without spatial or access constraints.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"During the hush where past meets prophecy" opens the story as atmospheric framing but remains metaphorical. Time is neither tracked nor tightened; decades compress without urgency, and the arbor's "dawn" and "twilight" markers are decorative rather than tactical. The timeframe does not constrain decisions or escalate pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Elira's motivation—to decode the message in falling leaves—is stated early and sustained, but it lacks on-page friction. She encounters no误解, rival interpretation, or cost; the arbor cooperates, specks reveal secrets, and travelers validate her work. The desire is told rather than dramatized through conflicted micro-choices.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Mossy delight" recurs twice as a label but does not modulate with pressure. The tone remains uniformly lyric and celebratory across discovery, transformation, and sanctuary-building; no tonal shift marks cost or complication. The phrase charges neither the final image nor the emotional arc, functioning as static mood descriptor.</comment>
