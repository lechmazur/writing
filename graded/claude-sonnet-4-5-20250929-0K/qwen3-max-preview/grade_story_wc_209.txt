<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The artist's motivation is clear and embodied through her collection, journey, and careful observation. However, the protagonist's trajectory is largely observational—she discovers encoded flowers, weeps in understanding, then paints—without a decision that forecloses a meaningful path with visible cost. The final stance ("she still reckons—not to solve, but to surrender") feels asserted rather than earned through on-page contradiction or sacrifice. Internal conflict is minimal; she encounters no competing impulse that would test her quietly driven nature under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: the journey gathers density (postcards → cathedral → discovery → mural → garden) and the final cadence shift ("The world sleeps. She stays awake. The flowers bloom.") reweights the opening mystery with conceptual cost—her perpetual vigil. Orientation anchors early (artist, pavilion, autumn). The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): she chooses ongoing observation over solving, forecloses explanation, and accepts the cost of nocturnal solitude. Minor weakness: the cost is felt but not dramatized in a concrete choice that alters tactics on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and filtered through the artist's lens: turpentine and lavender, brittle leaves, cathedral incense, melting snow. The amber pavilion bookends the story and the cathedral's etched glass constrains her discovery method, charging the final mural image. Spatial choreography is clear across locations. The flowers in her garden at the ending constrain her nocturnal vigil, satisfying the 9+ gate requirement (environment shapes the final image). Minor deduction: the pavilion itself does not pressure a choice during the narrative; it serves primarily as frame.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding why flowers bloom at night—is signaled early and drives the journey. However, escalation is largely investigative: she travels, kneels, traces glass, discovers encoded blooms. The "tightening" is the accumulation of discovered flowers leading to her weeping realization, which deepens understanding but does not narrow options or force a trade-off with visible cost. Her final painting and vigil feel like continuation rather than a choice that forecloses an alternative path. Under the Accumulative lens one meaningful deepening suffices, but agency remains passive.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: night-blooming flowers encode reverence for beauty in obscurity, vulnerability in darkness. The discovery of encoded blooms in glass, the artist's tears, and her perpetual vigil all render the theme without stating it. The final image—watching real flowers unfurl beneath the moon—offers a resonant answer to the central question without moralizing. Minor slip: "Some truths are not for speaking, but for living" edges toward direct statement, though it remains embedded in narration rather than dialogue.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited; perceptual signature is consistent (artist's eye for detail, lyric attention to textures and light). Diction is elevated and poetic throughout, matching the contemplative tone. However, the voice lacks sufficient modulation under pressure: the cathedral discovery beat and the weeping moment carry the same textured, rhythmic cadence as the opening and closing frames. The prose reads as a single sustained mood rather than syntax that tightens or loosens with emotional intensity. No dialogue present to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Figurative language is dense and often lovely ("shadows deepen into velvet," "dusk bruised the horizon"), but the saturation is high across most sentences, creating a steady wash rather than purposeful peaks. Template cadence appears in the closing sequence: "She still carries... She still kneels... She still reckons" is effective as pattern, but earlier passages loop similar constructions without taught payoff. Paraphrase loop: "not by fame or spectacle, but by the gnawing need" and "not to solve, but to surrender" recycle the same syntactic frame. Information density is moderate; several beats (the three nights sketching, the fourth morning) summarize rather than dramatize. Clarity remains high; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The premise—artist discovers encoded night-blooming flowers in cathedral glass—offers a fresh synthesis of art history, botany, and mystery. The final mural and nocturnal vigil feel earned from prior particulars. However, the emotional arc is contemplative throughout with minimal friction; the turn from mystery to understanding lacks a non-obvious complication or cost that would test her commitment. The resolution feels like fulfillment of expectation rather than a synthesis that surprises in hindsight. The piece commits fully to its lyric mode and avoids hedging, which elevates within its band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The mural artist frames the story (pavilion studio, postcards, final mural) and her observation drives the journey. However, her choices are largely investigative (packing, traveling, kneeling, tracing) rather than decisions that alter tactics or foreclose paths. She appears in the setup, middle journey, and closure mural, satisfying all three gates. Causal pressure is moderate: her need to understand initiates the journey, but the discovery unfolds without meaningful obstacle or trade-off. The final painting is continuation rather than a turn shaped by prior cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The postcards appear in the opening (fingers tracing brittle edges), incite the journey (the faded sepia Saint Elise's postcard with the anomaly lily), and return at the cathedral altar as tribute/continuation. Three distinct beats with clear reweighting: the postcards shift from secrets of unlived places to a map she has now walked. However, their specific properties after the opening are generic; any artifact with an image could serve the same function mid-story. The closure reprise adds resonance but does not constrain the ending action.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The phrase "dawning hush" appears three times: opening ("the dawning hush that had settled over the garden since the solstice"), middle ("felt in the dawning hush between breaths"), and is echoed conceptually in the closing ("the umbral tenderness of night"). It colors tone and theme but does not shape stakes or tactics on the page. The artist's investigation and vigil would proceed identically without this specific concept. Present in setup and closure, but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The attribute "quietly driven" is named in the opening ("She was quietly driven—not by fame or spectacle, but by the gnawing need") and echoed in the closing ("quietly driven, her fingers stained"). It characterizes her sustained investigation and nocturnal vigil, but does not constrain a specific on-page action with visible cost. She never faces a competing impulse (fame, rest, doubt) that would test her quiet persistence. Label-only use across setup and closure without middle development.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Reckon" appears as the story's spine: "the mystery that had haunted her... why flowers bloom at night," "she had to reckon... with the hidden layers," "she still reckons—not to solve, but to surrender." The action defines the journey (cathedral investigation) and the final stance (perpetual observation without resolution). It shapes the middle beats (kneeling, tracing, discovering) and the closure choice (accept the ongoing question). Major turns trace to this action, though the final reconfiguration is conceptual rather than a concrete choice that alters tactics.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The method is signaled at the opening ("sketches of moonlit petals, roots coiling like veins, and cathedral spires") and dominates the middle investigation: "she had to reckon... with the hidden layers of etched glass," "lens in hand, tracing each pane," "Layer by layer, she uncovered... beneath the saint's outstretched hand... behind the archangel's wing." The mechanics matter—her magnifying lens and close observation enable the discovery of microscopic precision flowers aligned with lunar cycles. The method shapes attempts and enables the closure realization. All three gates satisfied with strong causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The amber pavilion frames the opening (studio tucked behind its curling eaves) and closing (back beneath the pavilion, she paints; when it dims, she watches). It appears in both the opening postcard mystery and the final mural. However, it does not pressure choices or supply resources that affect outcome; the investigation occurs at the cathedral, and the pavilion serves as bookend location. Lyric reprise reweights the dominant stake (mystery → painted answer), reaching mid-band, but the setting itself remains static description.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Time is signaled ("across the melting of winter's last snow"), marks the journey duration ("She spent three nights there... On the fourth morning"), and closes with seasonal shift ("autumn now a memory"). The progression from autumn through winter's melt to spring's warmth tracks the investigation and provides gentle rhythm. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions or tactics; she could take one night or ten without altering the outcome. Present across setup, middle, and closure, but the clock does not constrain moves.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The motivation—"to understand why flowers bloom at night"—is dramatized in the opening (gnawing need since childhood), drives the cathedral journey (seeking the anomaly), and is fulfilled in the closure realization ("beauty persists in obscurity... life chooses the hush"). It shapes the middle investigation (three nights sketching) and the final vigil (watching real flowers unfurl). Friction is minimal: no competing want tests her commitment, and the discovery satisfies without cost. Present across all three gates with moderate causal pressure, but the desire is unopposed.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The tone of "umbral tenderness" is coherent throughout: "shadows deepen into velvet," "when the world holds its breath," "the cold air that smelled of stone and candle wax," "the umbral tenderness of night, everything makes sense." The diction and rhythm sustain a lyric, nocturnal softness from opening to close. The tone modulates slightly—opening mystery, middle reverence, closing acceptance—but remains within a narrow emotional band. It charges the final image (moon, flowers, quiet vigil) and is indispensable to the piece's effect. All three gates with strong closure linkage.</comment>
