<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The myth buster's grief over her lost sister grounds her actions, but interiority leans heavily on abstract phrases ("emotional coordinates," "ephemeral compass") rather than embodied sensation. The reimagining of conversations is told rather than dramatized with micro-choices under pressure. The final laugh ("cracked bells tumbling down stone stairs") gestures toward contradiction but arrives as metaphor rather than felt ambivalence. The shift from seeking to acceptance reads more like announced resolution than earned renunciation with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors who, where, and what early. The closure unit—myth buster stops seeking answers, walks away with shell fragments—qualifies as Earned Stasis, but the cost (courage to stop seeking) is asserted rather than dramatized through a forfeited option or visible price. The compass shattering and shell cracking function as symbolic markers rather than causal beats that narrow tactics. The riddle's answer ("What do you bury when you refuse to speak?") arrives as epiphany without prior friction that made silence a live stake.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The abandoned observatory on a cliff is vividly rendered with shattered glass, cracked domes, wind as "choir of forgotten astronomers." The rusted tripod becomes a seat; the environment charges the atmosphere. However, spatial details do not constrain the protagonist's actions—she could perform the same ritual anywhere. The setting functions as backdrop rather than pressure, though the final dawn and cliff edge image do lend resonance to the departure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—decoding a universal riddle—is signaled early. Pressure accumulates through the retelling ritual and compass spin, but escalation is textural rather than tactical; no live option is foreclosed. The riddle's answer emerges as revelation rather than a turn forced by prior choices. The cello's hum and compass's shattering feel illustrative rather than causally linked to a decision that narrows her path. Cost (stopping the search) is told in the final paragraph without dramatized forfeit.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme—grief, revision of memory, the limits of seeking closure—emerges organically from the sister's death and the protagonist's ritual. The painted seashell and cello function as recurring images that reweight meaning at closure. However, the riddle's answer ("What do you bury when you refuse to speak?") arrives as a thesis statement rather than non-literal resonance. The final image (walking away with humming shell halves) gestures toward living beside riddles but the insight is spelled out rather than embedded in action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Single POV holds throughout with no head-hopping. Diction is ornate and consistent ("gloomy cheerfulness," "bracelet of sound"), but register tilts toward elevated metaphor even in peak moments where urgency might compress syntax. No dialogue appears. The perceptual signature—grief-charged attentiveness to shell and cello—remains stable. Filter verbs ("she felt," "she believed") cluster in the opening third but do not obscure immediacy at closure. Purposeful compression in the final beats supports the lyric mode.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout: "emotional coordinates," "needle trembling toward meaning," "bracelet of sound," "bruised the horizon." While individually legible, the accumulation in nearly every sentence dilutes impact and slows momentum. Paraphrase loops: "retell/reimagined/revisions" across adjacent paragraphs re-state the same act without added pressure (−0.4). Template cadence in the opening half: "She wasn't," "She'd spent," "She'd retell" (−0.4). Mixed metaphors: a compass "spins wildly toward emotional coordinates" blurs vehicle and tenor. Closure beats avoid these issues but prior density lowers band entry.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The myth buster frame and the ritual of retelling into a seashell/cello hybrid offer a specific angle on grief. However, the core emotional arc—letting go of a lost loved one through symbolic ritual—is familiar, and the piece does not transform it through non-obvious moral calculus or lived friction. The riddle's answer is abstract rather than rooted in concrete choice. The lyric mode and object constellation feel purposeful but do not cohere into an inevitable synthesis; swapping seashell for another keepsake would not break the logic.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Myth buster is the protagonist throughout. She performs the ritual (seats herself, retells, lowers shell), but the key turns—compass pointing inward, riddle's answer arriving, decision to stop seeking—are presented as events that happen to her rather than choices she makes under pressure. Present across beats but agency remains observational until the final walk-away, which is narrated rather than dramatized with a visible forfeit.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Painted seashell appears early (first third), is used in the retelling ritual mid-story, cracks at closure, and its halves are carried away humming. Three distinct beats with evolving function. The crack spills "a single, perfect hum" that reweights the object from memory container to sound-source. However, the mechanics (why it cracks, what the hum does) remain symbolic rather than causal; the shell does not constrain a prior choice. Lyric reprise with closure linkage elevates score, but swappability (any sister keepsake could work) caps higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Ephemeral compass is named and described in the first third, spins during the ritual, then shatters. Its function—pointing "toward emotional coordinates"—is metaphorical rather than mechanical; it does not enable or constrain tactics. The needle's final direction (inward, to her own silence) is thematic revelation rather than a choice-shaping tool. Present but ornamental; removing it would not break the closure logic.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Reimagining past conversations is the protagonist's habit, described early and enacted in the retelling ritual. One beat shows the trait in action (she retells the final argument "as it should've"). However, the cost of this revision is asserted ("polished by regret") rather than dramatized through a visible tradeoff or forfeited option. The trait serves as setup but does not constrain a mid-story choice or pivot at closure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Retell is the central action of the ritual: she retells the final argument, exhales it into the shell, and the cello responds. Present early (setup), executed in a key beat (middle), and referenced at closure ("didn't need to retell anymore"). The turn—stopping the retelling—shapes the ending but is told rather than shown through a dramatized choice. The action is essential to the ritual but could be substituted with another verbal act (pray, confess) without breaking structure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Resonant hums in the half-finished cello appear early and are used twice: once as she retells into the shell, once when the cello emits a "final resonant hum" at closure. The method is described but its mechanics remain vague—why the cello hums, how the hums affect the compass. The hum charges the atmosphere but does not enable a tactic or constrain a choice. Present in setup and payoff (two gates), but development beat is thin; the hum illustrates rather than drives.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Abandoned observatory on a cliff is established early with vivid detail (shattered glass, cracked domes, wind, rusted tripod). She seats herself on the tripod and performs the ritual. The setting provides atmosphere and a resonant backdrop for the closure image (dawn, cliff edge, sea below) but does not constrain her actions or supply resources that alter tactics. Postcard description with thematic echo; micro-setting use (tripod as seat) is minimal.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>"Inside the whisper of closing pages" is invoked once mid-story as a phrase from the sister's journal, but timeframe is not tracked or dramatized. The story unfolds in a single ritual session with no live clock or deadline. The phrase functions as motif rather than temporal pressure. Absent as a constraint on tactics or decisions.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>To decode a universal riddle is stated early and drives the ritual scene. The riddle is foregrounded, and the protagonist's actions (retelling, listening for hums) are motivated by this desire. However, the desire is told rather than shown through friction—no cost is paid to pursue the riddle, no competing want complicates it. The riddle's answer arrives as epiphany, not through a choice that traded one option for another. Present and functional but not conflicted.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Gloomy cheerfulness is named explicitly ("a sound like cracked bells tumbling down stone stairs—gloomy cheerfulness, the tone her sister always said she wore like a favorite sweater") and modulates the laugh at the riddle's answer. The tone colors the narrative voice (ornate metaphor, dark whimsy) and charges the final image (walking away with humming shell halves, "still warm"). Coherent through turns and integrated at closure, though the label itself is on-the-nose rather than purely embodied.</comment>
