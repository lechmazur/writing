<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The recluse demonstrates consistent interiority through embodied perception—tracing the box rim, wrapping her body around it during storms, interpreting ghosts through contextual clues. Her tranquil perceptiveness functions as a trait that shapes her observational method, though the story withholds micro-choices that would reveal contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The covenant binding her is stated but never tested through a live dilemma that forces her to choose between competing goods with visible cost. The beekeeper ghost's final gratitude moment gestures toward closure but lacks the protagonist's agency-driven alteration or renunciation that would earn higher scores.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who (the recluse) and where (abandoned oasis) by the second paragraph, though when remains vague ("after ghosts become visible" sets a threshold but not a ticking clock). The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: density increases through layered ghost-stories and the box's charged reprise, culminating in the beekeeper's grateful gaze and the honey-gold glyph image. However, the closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the beekeeper turns, gratitude is acknowledged, light refracts meaning) whose cost remains oblique—no explicit path is foreclosed, no tactical option visibly narrows. The Orientation Test penalty (−0.3) is waived because the disorientation serves the timeless, ritualized atmosphere that charges the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The scorched wasteland, ruined hives, fractured roof, and stained glass box function as micro-setting that constrains the recluse's ritual and charges the final image with refracted light. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: "slants of ashen light," "grit," "dust at her feet," "honey-gold glyphs." The box's cobalt/amber/emerald panels return with reweighted meaning at closure, grounding the conceptual covenant in a tactile object. Spatial choreography is coherent; the eastern wall, honey press, and collapsed hive anchor ghost-stories without confusion.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving unspoken weights—is signaled early and held throughout. Pressure accumulates through the recluse's ritual actions (kneeling, tracing, shielding) and the ghosts' hovering presence, but escalation under the Accumulative lens relies on density and pattern rather than a tightening choice that narrows options. The beekeeper's turn is a micro-shift, not a reversal that forces a trade-off with visible cost. The story opts for Earned Stasis (she continues vigil, does not open the box, acknowledges gratitude) without dramatizing a live dilemma where opening or speaking would test her covenant with felt consequence. Agency is endurance without a foreclosed path legible on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from images and actions: silence as sanctuary, unspoken burdens preserved as architecture, the box's sealed murmurs as sacred weight. The final honey-gold glyphs offer a resonant, non-literal answer—"a language only silence could speak"—that reweights prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture (the beekeeper's turn, the woman sifting phantom pollen) and the recluse's refusal to open the box. The piece resists tidy resolution and invites reflection through purposeful ambiguity, though the thematic echo "language only silence could speak" in the final line edges toward articulation of the thesis rather than letting the image stand alone.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with consistent psychic distance and a distinct perceptual signature—"tranquilly perceptive," selecting silence and stillness over speech. Diction is elevated and poetic ("mute eloquence," "scribe of sighs") but remains coherent under the timeless, ritualized atmosphere. Filter verbs ("she believed," "she knew") appear frequently yet feel voice-motivated, grounding the recluse's interpretive stance. No dialogue is present. The prose texture is uniform and lush, sometimes edging toward overwriting ("honey-gold glyphs," "bruising sky") without pattern-teaching that would justify the density at every beat. Sentence openings vary, though many begin with "She" or "The," creating mild template cadence in the middle third.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Figurative language is dense throughout—"sky bleached of mercy," "ghosts draped in residue of unspoken words," "stones in a dry riverbed"—without clear pattern-teaching or escalation, triggering −0.4 for overwriting that does not intensify at closure. Several lines paraphrase adjacent content: "not by choice but by covenant" followed immediately by "a tangled covenant, frayed by time," and "not with fear, but with reverence" near "she watched them...as an archivist," applying −0.2 for paraphrase loops. Sentence structure varies purposefully and information density is generally high, but the lush texture occasionally slows momentum in the middle third (the ghost-catalog paragraphs). No major scaffold or synonym churn, and the final image is clear. Cumulative deduction: −0.6 total in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The premise—recluse bound by covenant to preserve ghosts' unspoken words via stained glass box—offers a specific synthesis of silence, ritual, and grief that avoids stock haunting tropes. The ghosts' contextual-clue storytelling (tilt of shoulder, lingering glance) and the box as sealed archive of murmurs are particular and non-obvious. However, the emotional arc (vigil → acknowledgment) and the final gratitude beat follow a familiar template: guardian receives validation from the watched. The piece commits fully to its premise and resists easy resolution, but the "language only silence could speak" closure image, while resonant, does not transform prior material through an unexpected hinge—it crystallizes what has been stated throughout. Transformation test: swapping the oasis for another ruin and bees for another lost craft would not fundamentally alter the emotional logic.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The astonished recluse is present throughout and her perception drives the ghost-catalog, but her choices are limited to observation and ritual maintenance. She does not face a live decision that alters tactics or stakes. The covenant is stated early and her adherence is unwavering; no moment tests her commitment with visible cost. Setup and development gates are met (she is named in the opening, her actions populate the middle), but closure participation is passive—she bows her head in acknowledgment, does not choose. Cap for missing closure agency: 4.6. Her astonishment is label-only (mentioned in paragraph 3, never embodied in a reaction or micro-choice), applying −0.3 for decorative trait. Score: 4.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The stained glass box appears in setup (paragraph 7), development (she kneels before it each morning, traces its rim at dusk, wraps her body around it during storms), and closure (the box catches dying light, casting honey-gold glyphs). It is handled across multiple beats and its sealed state constrains the recluse's choices (she never opens it). The box's unique properties—cobalt/amber/emerald panels, fractured light, vibrations within—are irreplaceable and charge the final image. However, the box does not create a problem it later resolves, and its presence in the ending is primarily symbolic rather than causally active. Strong integration across all gates with clear closure linkage, but no on-page cost directly tied to the box's use (e.g., temptation to open it is stated but never tested). Score: 7.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The tangled covenant is introduced in paragraph 3 ("binding her to this hollow sanctuary") and shapes the recluse's presence and endurance throughout. It constrains her options (she must hold the unsaid in place, cannot release the ghosts by speaking) and is referenced at closure ("To open it would break the covenant"). However, the covenant is never tested through a live dilemma—no moment where she is tempted to break it, no visible cost paid for upholding it beyond continued presence. Setup and closure gates are met; middle development is thematic rather than tactical. The covenant functions as premise and stake but does not change tactics on the page. Score: 5.9.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Tranquilly perceptive is introduced early (paragraph 4: "tranquilly perceptive, she absorbed the silence") and enables her method—interpreting ghosts through contextual clues rather than speech. It shapes her observational stance and differentiates her from a fearful or hurried character. However, the trait is label-heavy (stated once, then demonstrated through calm actions) and does not constrain a choice with visible tradeoff—her perceptiveness never fails her or force her to choose between competing interpretations with cost. Setup and development gates are met; closure participation is atmospheric rather than causal. Score: 5.1.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Gaze is the recluse's primary action: "Her gaze, steady and unblinking, swept the horizon," "she watched them," "reading the air like scripture," and the climactic moment when "the master beekeeper's ghost...met her gaze." The action is foregrounded throughout and the final mutual gaze triggers the closure beat (gratitude, acknowledgment, light refraction). However, gaze is largely receptive—observation without decision. Removing "gaze" and substituting "attention" or "vigil" would not fundamentally alter the logic; the specificity of eye contact matters at closure but the middle beats could be rewritten around presence. Strong closure linkage and beat involvement, but swappability and passivity lower the score. Score: 6.7.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Through contextual clues is signaled early (paragraph 10: "She deciphered their stories...through contextual clues: the tilt of a spectral shoulder, the direction of a lingering glance") and demonstrated in the middle ghost-catalog (beekeeper at the eastern wall, woman sifting pollen). The method shapes her interpretive process and differentiates her vigil from speech-based interaction. However, the method does not constrain tactics or force a choice—she never misreads a clue or faces ambiguity with cost. Setup and development gates are met; closure participation is thematic (the final glyphs are "a language only silence could speak," extending the method) rather than causal. Score: 6.3.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The abandoned beekeeping oasis in a scorched wasteland is established in the opening (paragraphs 1–2) and provides the recluse's spatial anchor, the ghosts' habitat, and the stained glass box's shelter. Setting details—collapsed hives, fractured roof, eastern wall with child's drawing—supply the contextual clues the recluse interprets. The scorched environment constrains survival (she is bound here, the land is lifeless) and the fractured roof enables the final light effect. The setting is irreplaceable (the bees/beekeepers/oasis history grounds the ghosts' unfinished sentences) and charges the closure image. Strong setup, development, and closure participation with clear causal pressure. Score: 7.2.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>After ghosts become visible is the temporal threshold that frames the story (paragraph 5: "the ghosts had become visible now"), but the timeframe does not tighten decisions or track progression. The story operates in a timeless ritual mode—each morning, at dusk, when storms come—without a clock that alters tactics. The beekeeper's turn at closure ("one twilight") is temporally marked but does not indicate how long the vigil has lasted or what urgency the passage of time imposes. Setup gate is met; middle and closure do not leverage time as pressure. Cap for missing development and weak closure participation: 4.6. Temporal framing is functional but replaceable. Score: 4.8.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>To preserve the weight of unspoken words is the recluse's stated motivation (paragraphs 14–15: "The recluse preserved these weights...to honor the architecture of silence," "her covenant demanded she hold the unsaid in place"). The motivation shapes her refusal to open the box and her interpretive vigil. However, it is told rather than tested—no moment where she is tempted to speak the ghosts' words or open the box, no on-page friction between the burden of silence and the desire for release. Setup and development gates are met; closure participation is passive acknowledgment rather than a choice that pays a visible cost. Score: 6.4.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Mute eloquence is introduced in paragraph 4 ("She moved with mute eloquence") and sustained through the recluse's silent, expressive actions—tracing, kneeling, bowing—and the ghosts' soundless mouths. The tone is coherent and modulates subtly (calm ritual → storm intensity → quiet acknowledgment at closure). The final image ("a language only silence could speak") charges mute eloquence with thematic weight. However, the tone is somewhat static—reverent and hushed throughout—without a decisive break or intensification under peak pressure. Setup, development, and closure gates are met; the tone charges the final image but does not transform under stress. Score: 6.5.</comment>
