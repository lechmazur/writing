<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elira's interiority shows embodied sensation (pulse spikes, tremors, diaphragm tightening) that drives moment-to-moment choices, and her stance as "affectionate skeptic" modulates plausibly from skepticism to willowglass hope. However, key micro-choices—patching oscilloscope to synth, painting somatic glyphs—feel more like illustrated concepts than pressure-tested decisions with visible tradeoffs. The final choice to "open the studio doors" arrives as declaration rather than earned cost; we don't see what she forfeits or risks by making this pivot public.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation Test: "who" (Elira), "where" (light painting studio), and "when" (after the static shock) anchor by the third paragraph. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural—somatic markers accumulate, fractals recur, biofeedback patches together—and the final image (somatic glyphs, opening doors) offers a Conceptual Repricing: true communion is somatic, not chemical. Cost is conceptual but not viscerally legible on the page; no forfeited relationship, resource, or on-page vulnerability dramatizes the pivot. The FDA recall shapes backstory but doesn't narrow live options in scene.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The studio is vividly rendered—blackout velvet, resin-flecked floor, indigo LEDs, oscilloscope, analog synth—and the muscovite geode functions as micro-setting, its fractally precise layers both object and constraint. The geode pulsing "in rhythm with her heartbeat" and the walls blooming with "living constellations" charge the final image. Spatial choreography (cross-legged on floor, bare feet on concrete, moving through studio) remains clear and the setting pressures her method by supplying the light modulators and biofeedback tools she patches together.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—illuminate hidden pathways to reach Mateo—is signaled early and persists. One meaningful deepening occurs when the geode and studio tech converge to produce Mateo's voice, shifting from internal searching to external signal. However, the tightening is atmospheric rather than costly: no live option is foreclosed, no resource spent, no visible price paid. The static shock as "key" and the FDA recall as backstory complicate but don't test protagonist agency under live pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme—true communion is somatic/fractal, not chemical—emerges through recurring images (geode layers, studio fractals, tremors as compass) and the conceptual repricing in the final beat: "the recall didn't break connections—it revealed how artificial they'd been." The ending avoids overt moralizing and the insight is embedded in the studio transformation. However, the thematic claim "It's not about hearing thoughts, it's about feeling their shape" is articulated by Mateo in flashback, edging toward Thematic Echo; the final paragraph ("fractally precise, somatically guided, lit by willowglass hope") reiterates rather than reweights.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited, perceptual signature is consistent (sensory focus on ozone, turpentine, tremors), and diction remains elevated but character-appropriate ("willowglass hope," "somatic glyphs"). The single line of dialogue—Mateo's voice—carries subtext and goal pursuit. However, elevated register ("muscovite geode sliver," "somatic markers," "oscilloscope") persists uniformly across high and low pressure, and the prose occasionally tilts toward explanatory summary ("She wasn't trying to restore telepathy. She was trying to illuminate hidden pathways") that tells rather than trusts the image.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and figurative language is dense but purposeful (frozen lightning, radio signal underwater, afterimages that lingered like promises). Paraphrase loops appear: "wasn't afraid of the voices; afraid they were real" / "didn't break connections—revealed how artificial they'd been" restate the same inversion twice. Template stems recur ("She closed her eyes... She followed it... She picked up..."). The final third stacks elevated metaphors ("starfield of shared memory," "somatic glyphs," "willowglass hope") without varying cadence, reducing propulsion at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The synthesis—post-pharma telepathy residue navigated via somatic markers and fractal art tech—is specific and non-obvious. The light painting studio, muscovite's fractal structure, and biofeedback patching feel organically interwoven. However, the emotional arc (isolation → connection via tech ritual → communal opening) follows a recognizable recovery template, and the final gesture (opening studio doors to let others in) resolves into therapeutic-community optimism without complication. The conceptual premise is fresh; the human stakes remain abstract.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elira is present throughout and her micro-choices (tracing geode, mapping somatic signals, patching equipment, painting glyphs) shape the narrative arc. She drives the middle escalation and the final decision to open the studio. However, her choices feel more like illustrated steps in a process than pressure-tested decisions with visible costs or tradeoffs, trending toward functional integration without indispensability.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The muscovite geode sliver appears in the opening, recurs as Elira traces it and presses it to her sternum, and pulses "in rhythm with her heartbeat" at closure, shifting from inert object to somatic metronome. It constrains her method (fractally precise layers model the pathways) and charges the final image. Removing it would weaken the fractal motif and the tactile anchoring of her method.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The telepathy pill recall frames the inciting condition (psychic residue, neural misalignment) and motivates Elira's search for an alternate communion method. It shapes backstory and stakes but does not alter live on-page tactics or narrow options in scene. The recall is referenced repeatedly but functions as premise rather than active pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Fractally precise" is applied to the geode's layers and the projected studio fractals, and the final image invokes "fractally precise" pathways. The trait provides visual coherence and thematic resonance but does not constrain or enable a specific action with visible cost. It remains more descriptive motif than causal force.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Devise" appears explicitly ("began to devise—not with code or chemicals, but through somatic markers") and the middle beats show Elira assembling her method by correlating flinches with memory, patching tech, and painting glyphs. The action drives the arc's progression but could be described as "create," "build," or "synthesize" with minor edits, suggesting functional rather than indispensable integration.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Somatic markers are signaled early ("Each tremor in her wrist, each flutter behind her ribs"), developed across multiple beats (pulse in temple → memory; diaphragm tightening → whisper; pressure behind eyes → Mateo's voice), and shape her navigation method throughout. The mechanics matter: without the somatic cues, her pathfinding collapses. Removing this method would break the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The light painting studio supplies tools (oscilloscope, synth, light modulators, blackout velvet walls), frames her artistic practice, and becomes the site of her somatic experiment. The setting enables her method by providing biofeedback equipment and visual projection surfaces. The final choice to "open the studio doors" makes the setting the vehicle for communal transformation, tying it to closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"After the static shock that jolted her awake three nights prior" anchors the timeframe and motivates her sleeplessness and urgency. However, the three-night clock does not tighten decisions or alter tactics on the page; time remains static background rather than live pressure. The shock is referenced but does not escalate or constrain her choices in scene.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"To illuminate hidden pathways" is stated explicitly and dramatized through Elira's search for Mateo and her assembly of the somatic navigation system. The motivation drives her actions across beats. However, the desire is asserted more than conflicted; no visible cost or competing want tests her commitment, and the final resolution (finding Mateo's frequency, opening doors) satisfies without friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Willowglass hope" is named once ("that fragile, luminous belief that even broken things can guide you home") and the final line reprises "lit by willowglass hope." The tone threads through the imagery (amber/violet/emerald studio flare, afterimages like promises) but remains more lyric label than modulating pressure. The tone does not shift meaningfully under stress or charge the closure with undeniable cost.</comment>
