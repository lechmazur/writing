<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Ripple-mark is anchored by concrete details—map-skin, bare-foot reading of vibrations, a deliberate method—but her interiority remains thin. Internal contradiction is absent; she moves with serene competence and no visible struggle between wants. The final choice to move to "the next cavern" lacks cost or foreclosed options; it reads as continuation rather than a path lost. Embodied emotion is present in "hammered repose" but that phrase does the work for many paragraphs without fresh contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The orientation is clear by the first paragraph. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the hush blooms radially, spreading through ice and beings in a density increase that reweights the storm. However, the closure image—Ripple-mark turning "toward the next cavern"—offers continuation rather than a decisive change or meaningful repricing; no visible cost forecloses a path. The echo stone's release to the largest being is the story's strongest closure candidate, but Ripple-mark's own stance does not crystallize or shift there. Under the Accumulative lens, the final cadence should reconfigure the dominant stake with felt cost; instead, it extends the pattern without a clear before/after.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The harmonic caves constrain tactics throughout: stalactites, ice walls, crack patterns, and thermal vents all shape Ripple-mark's method. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful—"limestone throats amplifying subterranean winds into choral sighs"—and filtered through her cartographic attention. The ice wall melting "from release" charges the final third. Spatial choreography is coherent across the central chamber sequence, and the environment actively participates in the bloom of hush.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—to find quiet in the storm—is signaled early and pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens as the hush blooms outward. One meaningful deepening occurs when the stone absorbs tension and Ripple-mark adjusts pitch to match the fractures. However, agency remains constrained: the beings "settle" without resistance, and no live option is foreclosed. The final stone-release to the largest being offers a gift without visible cost to Ripple-mark; she "stepped back," work done, and moves on. Cost clarity is weak; the story substitutes competence for struggle.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: silence as architecture, fracture lines as scores, the storm tuned rather than banished. The echo chamber stone's dual function—absorbing and releasing—charges the thematic question without overt statement. The final image of the being cradling the stone "like an egg" offers a resonant, non-literal answer. However, the closing line—"the next silence waiting to be conjured"—veers toward thematic echo, restating the premise rather than reweighting it. The piece resists tidy morals and invites reflection, but the lack of protagonist cost limits emotional complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: cartographic whorls, braille-like feet, attention to harmonic frequencies. Diction is controlled and purposeful—"hammered repose," "limestone throats," "thermal vents met glacial seepage"—but the voice occasionally drifts into elevated catalog ("her motivation was to find the quiet in the storm, not to flee it") that reads expository. No head-hopping. Psychic distance is consistent. The prose has texture, though some phrases ("not sudden, not violent, but like moss unfurling") feel self-consciously poetic in a way that slows momentum.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Information density is high and most lines advance atmosphere or action. Rhythm varies purposefully, though some constructions lean on parallel negation ("not as a refugee but as a seeker," "not silence… but balanced," "not in fear, but in recognition") creating a template cadence across emotional peaks. Two paraphrase loops appear: "the caves… now, they screamed" restates the opening dissonance, and "her work here was done" + "she turned toward the next cavern" recycles the closure beat. Figurative language is dense—"storms incarnate," "lunar glow," "dawn mist"—without always serving propulsion. Clarity is maintained, but momentum sags under decorative weight in the final third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of harmonics, cartography, and fracture-reading offers a specific angle on the "taming chaos" template. Ripple-mark's method is concrete and non-obvious. However, the arc—competent specialist arrives, applies skill, problem solved, moves on—echoes familiar "expert solves crisis" structures without transformation or cost. The energy beings remain generic "storms incarnate" without adaptation or resistance. Risk is present in the premise but the execution stays safe: no failed attempts, no ambiguity, no renunciation. The story commits to its conceit but does not surprise within it.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Ripple-mark is present throughout and her choices—kneeling, tracing fissures, humming, placing the stone—drive all major beats. Her observation of crack patterns leads to the hush. However, the choices feel inevitable rather than costly; no alternative is dramatized or foreclosed. She is a vehicle for the method rather than a character whose internal conflict shapes turns. Setup, development, and closure participation are all present, but causal pressure is moderate and no felt cost is tied to her agency.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The echo chamber stone appears in paragraph 3, is pressed to ice in paragraph 11, absorbs tension and flares in paragraphs 13–15, and is placed against the largest being in paragraph 21, where it releases hush and is cradled. Four distinct beats; evolving use (capture → release); closure linkage is strong. Its properties—captured silences, lunar glow, swelling void—are specific and irreplaceable. However, the stone enables rather than constrains; no visible cost is tied to its use. Scores in the essential-across-beats band but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The bloom of hush frames the story's second half and drives the turn: "A hush bloomed… The bloom of hush spread radially… The bloom of hush had taken root." It redefines the energy beings' state and enables closure. Setup is implicit (quiet sought), development (radial spread) and closure (root taken) are on the page. However, "bloom" as concept is metaphorical; the mechanics are narrated rather than constrained by this exact phrasing. Swapping "wave" or "field" would require only light rewording. Lyric resonance is strong but causal irreplaceability is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Gently luminous" describes the echo chamber stone and appears in paragraphs 3, 15, and 20 ("soft, lunar glow"). The trait enables visibility and aesthetic charge but does not constrain action or create a tradeoff; the glow could be bright or dim without altering choices. No cost is tied to luminescence. Functional but replaceable; ornamental descriptor that supports tone without altering tactics.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Conjure" appears in paragraph 6 ("silence… could be conjured"), paragraph 24 ("the one who could conjure calm from chaos"), and the final line ("the next silence waiting to be conjured"). It frames Ripple-mark's method and bookends the arc. However, the action itself—humming, tracing, placing—could be described as "summon," "coax," or "invoke" with minimal structural change. The word charges theme but is not mechanically irreplaceable. Setup, development (implicit in acts), and closure reprise are present; causal role is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Examining crack patterns in ice is signaled in paragraph 7, executed across paragraphs 10–14 (tracing fissures, reading scores, matching harmonic signature), and the melting ice in paragraph 20 confirms the method's effect. The method is specific, dramatized, and shapes the middle beats that enable the hush. Two beats (tracing, melting payoff); setup, development, and closure participation all present. Irreplaceability is high—no generic "meditation" could substitute. However, the final closure unit (stone release to being) bypasses the ice method, so closure linkage is indirect.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The harmonic caves frame the story, supply resources (stalactites, ice walls, thermal vents, crack patterns), and pressure Ripple-mark's method. They constrain her approach (must work with cave acoustics) and their transformation (screaming → breathing) marks the story's success. Setup (paragraph 1), development (ice wall, central chamber), and closure (caves breathe, next cavern) all present. However, the setting enables rather than resists; no hostile feature forces adaptation. Essential across beats but not indispensable to the final image, which centers on the being and stone.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the energy beings arrived" anchors the opening and sets the inciting condition. However, time within the story is untracked; no clock tightens decisions. The sequence reads as a single continuous action (arrival → walk → kneel → hum → spread → place → turn) without deadline or urgency. Setup is clear, development is implicit, but the timeframe does not constrain tactics or shape closure. Functional framing device; replaceable with "during the invasion" or similar.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The motivation "to find the quiet in the storm" is stated in paragraph 2, dramatized through the tracing/humming sequence (paragraphs 10–16), and affirmed in the final line ("the next silence waiting"). It drives every choice on the page. However, the motivation is never conflicted; no cost or competing want complicates it. Setup, development, and closure participation are all strong. Causal pressure is high but specificity is moderate—"restore balance" would serve nearly as well. Friction between want and cost is absent, limiting the score.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The tone "hammered repose" is named in paragraph 19 ("a stillness forged by pressure, not granted by peace") and coherent throughout: deliberate pacing, elevated diction, lyric restraint, calm under extremity. It modulates subtly—more sensory density during the hush bloom, more declarative in the final third—without breaking. The phrase itself charges the final image by linking Ripple-mark's interior state to the story's method. Closure linkage is strong; the tone is the story's signature and irreplaceable. No swappable synonym ("quiet determination") would carry the forged/pressure etymology that ties to the cave and ice.</comment>
