<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The mapper's motivation is abstractly asserted ("patient revolution," "sculpt patience from impatience") rather than embodied through micro-choices under pressure. Internal conflict is absent—she never wavers, doubts, or makes a visible trade-off on the page; the text recounts her method in summary rather than dramatizing a difficult pivot. Emotions are generic ("wonder," "thanks") and lack contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. No visible cost forecloses a path; the ending simply reaffirms the premise without alteration or renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed: who ("horizon mapper"), where (basalt sanctuary), and when (after freeze) emerge slowly across multiple paragraphs without early anchoring, triggering the Orientation Test penalty. The piece lacks a causal turn or meaningful tightening—events accumulate but do not narrow options or change knowledge on the page. Closure reads as a restatement of the opening premise ("patient revolution") rather than a Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with visible cost. The inferred lens (Accumulative/Textural) is ambiguous; no pattern break or cadence shift reweights the dominant stake at the end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The basalt sanctuary and frozen lake are vividly described with selective sensory detail (hoarfrost, bruised sky, iron bones). However, the environment does not constrain a choice or charge the final image in a way that would break story logic if removed; it remains atmospheric backdrop. Spatial choreography is consistent across moves. Micro-setting (the viaduct) recurs but is handled in summary rather than tactile interaction that alters tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake ("patient revolution") is declared early but never tested on the page—no old rulers arrive, no credible opposition materializes, and the mapper's methods face no friction or trade-off. The piece offers no meaningful escalation, tightening, or reversal; each paragraph restates the same premise without narrowing options or raising cost. Agency is observation and ritual, not decision with visible consequence. Coincidence or summary drives outcome (children come, parents follow, regime sends "silence") rather than protagonist choice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Theme (patience as revolutionary force) is stated overtly in multiple lines ("She sculpted patience from impatience," "patience grows roots under stone") rather than emerging from concrete particulars. The final image whispers thanks to the moon—a restatement, not a resonant reconfiguration or non-literal answer. Subtext is minimal; the text explains rather than implying. One positive: the contrast between "rage burns fast" and "patience" offers a coherent thematic frame, though it remains abstract.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>POV is stable single third-person with a consistent lyric register; no head-hopping. The perceptual signature is present (mapper notices moon paths, magnetic hum, frost patterns) but the diction occasionally drifts into prompt-like abstraction ("patient revolution," "sculpted patience") that does not read as the character's own lexicon under pressure. Psychic distance remains consistent; no filter-verb stacks. Dialogue is absent, so those bullets do not apply.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Figurative language is dense and often vivid ("bruised with storm memory," "frost spreading across glass"), but multiple lines loop conceptually: "not conquest, not noise, not fire" and "not by waiting, but by witnessing; not by forcing time, but by folding" are near-paraphrases that restate rather than advance. Template cadence appears in runs of "She [verb]" and "The [noun], once [X], now [Y]" across several paragraphs. Stock metaphors ("roots under stone," "fever of presence") reduce freshness. Register occasionally elevates beyond the on-page action ("unyoke," "cadence," "resonant reconfiguration" feel imposed). Rhythm varies, but information density is low; many sentences restate the premise.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The core premise (patient revolution via lunar mapping) offers a fresh angle, but execution relies on abstraction and restatement rather than specific, irreplaceable detail. The mapper's method is described in summary; no concrete obstacle transforms the approach in hindsight. Tropes (lone visionary, symbolic resistance) are present but not transformed through lived particulars. Emotional specificity is low; terms like "wonder," "patience," "stillness" are generic. The piece reads as a meditation on a concept rather than a story whose emotional arc requires these exact elements.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The vigilant horizon mapper is present throughout and performs mapping actions, but she makes no on-page decision that creates a key turn. Her choices (kneel, mark coordinates, teach children) are recounted in summary without friction or trade-off. Observation dominates; no reversal or escalation traces to her agency. Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The magnetic viaduct after rain is introduced early (first paragraph), described in multiple beats (residual charge, iron lattice, girders), and returns in the final paragraph. However, it is not handled or used in distinct causal beats—only described and aligned with moon paths in summary. Its properties do not constrain a choice or enable a tactic under pressure. Lyric reprise elevates it slightly, but swappability (any resonant structure could serve) keeps it mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The patient revolution is declared in the opening third and restated across many paragraphs, but it shapes no on-page tactic or trade-off. The concept is echoed as theme rather than tested as stake. No old rulers arrive on the page to force a choice; the revolution "spreads" via summary ("children came first," "parents followed"). Present but ornamental, not causal.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"Softly purposeful" appears twice as a label ("softly purposeful grace," "she simply remained—softly purposeful") but does not constrain or enable an on-page action with cost. No moment shows the attribute forcing a trade-off or altering tactics. Mentioned without dramatized pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Unyoke" is used twice (unyoke compulsions, unyoke the viaduct's song) and frames the mapper's method. However, no major turn or escalation traces causally to this action—it is described in summary rather than dramatized as a choice with visible consequence. Swappable with "unbind" or "release" without structural impact. Functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Tracking moon paths is signaled early (third paragraph) and recurs across beats (marking coordinates, aligning viaduct with lunar harmonics). Its mechanics appear: she uses moon paths to map longing, syncs breath to lunar tide, marks coordinates. However, the method does not shape a key attempt or constrain a choice under pressure; it is recounted rather than tested. Present across beats but not causal.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The basalt sanctuary by a frozen lake is introduced in the opening line and returns in multiple beats (she sleeps under arches, kneels on ice, marks walls). The sanctuary "held her like a vow" and the ice is the stage for mapping. However, the setting does not pressure a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome—it remains evocative backdrop. One beat (kneeling on ice) integrates setting into action, lifting it slightly above ornamental. Micro-setting present but not decisive.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"After the lake freezes over" anchors the opening and establishes a temporal frame (frozen winter, midwinter overfill, spring thaw threat). However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions or alter tactics on the page; no clock or seasonal pressure forces a trade-off. The freeze is setting rather than stake. Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"To sculpt patience from impatience" is stated in one line and restated in variations ("unyoke the people's hunger for spectacle by offering stillness"). The motivation is declared rather than dramatized through conflicted choices; no on-page moment shows the mapper struggling between impatience and restraint with visible cost. Told-only, no friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Restrained wildness" is named once at the end ("restrained wildness humming under her skin") and the tone is coherent throughout: lyric, measured, with occasional intensity ("storm memory," "radical act"). The tone modulates slightly (calm description, then "radical," then "quiet fever") but does not charge the final image in a way that would break coherence if removed. Present and consistent, but the exact phrasing is ornamental. Mid-band for coherence without indispensability.</comment>
