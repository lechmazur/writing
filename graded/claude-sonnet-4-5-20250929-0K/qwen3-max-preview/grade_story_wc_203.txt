<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The technician's motivation (discovery vs. repair) is clear and his observant nature drives micro-choices throughout. However, the protagonist remains largely passive—he witnesses, documents, and whispers acknowledgment, but never faces a meaningful internal contradiction or makes a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. The ghost encounter proceeds smoothly without struggle or consequence that alters him. His daughter mention and the final smile feel like tidy emotional tags rather than earned complexity under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: dust patterns, ceiling artifacts, and the ghost silhouette build density toward a final witnessing. Orientation anchors early (who/where/when clear by the opening). The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant)—he documents, releases the ghost, and accepts his role as witness—but the cost is asserted rather than dramatized: "lighter now" tells us the effect without showing a foreclosed option or visible price paid by the protagonist. The final image ("keeping vigil," "witness it had been waiting for") reconfigures meaning, yet the protagonist's stance was unchanged from the opening, reducing the felt weight of the closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and specific: cracked plaster, popcorn/sawdust smell, water-stained tile, broken marquee spelling "C_R_U_." The mainspring barrel and ceiling tile become micro-settings that enable discovery. The abandoned ticket office constrains access and charges the final image ("keeping vigil"). Spatial choreography is clean (stool, counter, ceiling, door). The one miss: the environment never pressures a choice with consequence—it facilitates observation but does not force a trade-off or alter tactics under stress.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: discover what the ceiling hides. The piece tightens from general observation to focused investigation (dust patterns → ceiling tile → drawing/button), constituting one meaningful deepening under the Accumulative lens. However, the protagonist's agency is limited to methodical discovery without opposition or cost—he encounters no obstacle, makes no trade-off, and the ghost cooperates passively. The resolution ("I see you" → air stills) is clean but frictionless; acknowledgment alone suffices, with no price paid or path foreclosed on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme of witnessing neglect and releasing the unseen emerges organically from the technician's actions and the circus artifacts. The final image ("keeping vigil," "witness it had been waiting for") reweights the opening's "ghosts haunt neglect" premise without overt moralizing. Subtext operates in the dust silhouette, the daughter photo, and the "weightless burden" refrain. One weakness: the thematic line "ghosts don't haunt places; they haunt neglect" edges close to direct statement, and the closing metaphor ("tucking in a child") is slightly tidy given the established tone.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited; perceptual signature is distinct (horologist's tools, dust-reading expertise, liturgy/prayer metaphor for documentation). Psychic distance is controlled, and no head-hopping occurs. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("horologist's mainspring barrel," "weightless burden," "liturgy...prayer") that feels more authorial than character-particular for a repair technician, especially under stress. The prose texture is consistent and purposeful, but some stock constructions ("breath shallow," "smiled," "gently, as if tucking in") slightly flatten voice at peak moments.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and figurative language is generally controlled, but overwriting clusters appear in high-density passages: "disturbances in dust, as silences where laughter used to live" stacks metaphors without clear causality; "the ghost of glitter" and "lint, ash" feel ornamental. Paraphrase loops surface: "ghosts don't haunt places; they haunt neglect" is immediately followed by "this ticket office...was thick with it," restating rather than advancing. Template cadence runs in mid-section ("He didn't move...He turned...He lowered...He carefully removed") reduce propulsion. Some filter verbs ("he'd learned," "he'd seen") are voice-motivated, but their frequency dulls immediacy in a few beats. No artifacts touch the closure beat directly, so penalties remain moderate.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The ghost-witness technician premise is familiar, but specific details (horologist's mainspring used as a reflective tool, dust accumulation patterns, circus-fire backstory) provide fresh texture. The "cracks in the façade" concept is under-developed—it appears as prompt language rather than a transforming force. The central turn (dust → drawing → ghost acknowledgment → release) is earnest but predictable; no counter-move or unexpected cost complicates the arc. The ending's "keeping vigil" / "witness" metaphor is resonant but not wholly surprising given the setup.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The technician is present throughout, and his ghost-seeing trait drives all major beats: entering the office, using the mainspring, prying the ceiling tile, witnessing the dust silhouette, and whispering acknowledgment. However, his choices are methodical observation rather than high-stakes decisions—he never faces opposition or makes a trade-off that forecloses a path. He is causally active but not tested under pressure, keeping the score in the functional-but-replaceable to mid-essential range.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The mainspring barrel appears in two distinct beats: first to reflect moonlight and reveal dust patterns, then raised "like a shield—or a mirror" to capture the ghost's silhouette. It is signaled early, its unique curved brass interior matters (flat surfaces wouldn't work), and it is reweighted in the second use. However, it does not constrain a choice or charge the final image—its function is diagnostic, not pressure-creating. Strong two-gate integration (setup, development) but missing closure participation keeps it in the mid-7s neighborhood before minor adjustments.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Cracks in the façade" is invoked once in the opening (rusted button, cracked plaster) but never shapes stakes or tactics. The story's actual engine is "ghosts haunt neglect" and the technician's witnessing mission. The concept remains thematic decoration rather than a constraint or driver of the protagonist's choices, placing it in the functional-but-replaceable band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Skillfully observant" is demonstrated on-page: noticing the tilted ticket stub, drag-mark, dust curl, and using the mainspring's curve to reveal hidden patterns. It enables the discovery arc and is character-specific (horologist's eye). However, it never constrains a choice or imposes a cost—his observation is unimpeded, never traded off against another need. The trait shapes one key turn (dust → ceiling → drawing) but remains frictionless, keeping it just above mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Engage" structures the arc: he engages the dust patterns, the ceiling artifacts, and finally the ghost silhouette with "I see you." The action is character-specific (patient, present understanding vs. fear) and drives the middle and ending beats. However, the engagement is uncontested—no obstacle forces him to adapt tactics or pay a price. It shapes two beats (investigation, acknowledgment) and participates in closure, earning solid mid-integration, but lacks the irreplaceability or cost linkage for higher scores.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Dust analysis is signaled early ("dust curled away...like fleeing children"), executed in the middle beat (mainspring reveals "footsteps no living foot had made"), and its result (spiral inward, ceiling focus) drives the next choice (prying the tile). The method is specific and shapes two beats. However, it does not appear in or decisively shape the closure (ghost acknowledgment), and the mechanics feel convenient rather than constrained. Two-gate integration with mid-level causal pressure places it in the lower 6s.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The abandoned circus ticket office is present throughout: cracked plaster, popcorn smell, water-stained ceiling tile, ticket counter, broken marquee. It supplies the ceiling artifact that drives discovery, anchors the ghost's backstory (fire in '78, final show), and charges the final image ("keeping vigil"). The setting is irreplaceable—no other locale would carry the circus/sequined performer logic. It meets all three gates (setup, development, payoff) and demonstrates causal pressure and closure linkage, earning solid essential-across-beats scoring.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The timeframe ("when the overhead fluorescent buzz dies off") is mentioned in the opening and once implied ("darkness settled"). It establishes atmosphere but never tightens decisions or alters tactics—the investigation proceeds at the technician's pace without time pressure. The phrase feels more like tone-setting than a functional constraint, placing it in the functional-but-replaceable band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The motivation "to discover what ceilings hide" is dramatized: he fixes his gaze on the ceiling tile, pries it loose, and finds the drawing/button. It drives the investigation arc and is tied to his broader mission (witness what others refuse to see). However, the motivation faces no friction—he wants discovery, pursues it, and succeeds without cost or competing desire. It shapes the middle turn and participates in closure conceptually but lacks the conflict or price for higher scores.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Weightless burden" is named twice (opening and late-middle: "not guilt, not grief, but responsibility") and colors the technician's steady, unhurried approach. The tone is coherent and modulates slightly (wonder at the drawing, smile at the final drop). However, the tone remains largely static—no pressure shift charges the final image beyond what was present at the start. It shapes atmosphere across beats but does not dynamically reweight the ending, keeping it in the mid-5s to low-6s range.</comment>
