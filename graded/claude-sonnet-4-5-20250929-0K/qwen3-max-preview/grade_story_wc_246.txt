<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation is legible (threshing meaning from experience) but remains abstract throughout; concrete micro-choices under pressure are scarce. The "confidently uncertain" attribute is told repeatedly rather than embodied in contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Interior voice relies heavily on elevated metaphor ("chaff of regret," "thresher ran on broken gears") that reads more as authorial commentary than character-specific thought. The ending's stance crystallization—"stop fighting time—and start dancing with its grammar"—is told rather than earned through dramatized friction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece operates in Accumulative/Textural mode with the anomaly as medium for reconfiguration. Orientation anchors (who, where) arrive within the opening but remain abstract; "gravitational anomaly" and "edge of spacetime" function as lyric placeholders rather than navigable geography. The closure offers Resonant Reconfiguration (seed metaphor returns reweighted: "planted in the wrong tense"), and the final image sequence (letters unsent → conversations had) articulates conceptual cost. However, the escalation is diffuse—no single tightening moment narrows options; instead, the middle unfolds as a series of editing examples that accumulate texture without a decisive pressure point. The causal chain is loose: she traces a glyph, edits emerge, she lowers the pen—none of these steps foreclose prior paths or force trade-offs.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The gravitational anomaly as setting is vivid in the opening ("light bent in lazy spirals," "ground rippled like water under parchment") and returns to constrain the editing action in paragraph three. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful but remains metaphoric rather than spatial—no clear layout or physical navigation. The anomaly's "tidal throb" and "membrane" provide texture but do not impose tangible obstacles or resources that alter tactics. The final image of "gentle curves" charges closure modestly. Micro-setting qualifies here: the pen and the anomaly together function as a constrained editing environment.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake (thresh meaning, correct past mistakes) is signaled early but never tested by a live obstacle or choice. Pressure is declared ("paradoxes instead of clarity") yet the editing sequence in paragraph three unfolds without resistance, cost, or failed attempts. The protagonist invites edits; they arrive cooperatively ("a fallen tree re-rooted itself"). No reversal or tightening forecloses an option; the anomaly settles "like a sigh of relief" without visible sacrifice. Escalation under Accumulative lens would require density increase or pattern break that reweights the stake—here the middle adds examples without deepening urgency or narrowing possibility.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme (history as fluid, revisable through reframing rather than erasure) emerges clearly from events and images, particularly the seed metaphor's return. The piece resists tidy morals and embraces complexity in the editing examples (war → awkward dinners, betrayal → missed glance). However, the final paragraph edges toward explicit thesis: "The seeds weren't wrong—they were just planted in the wrong tense" and "stop fighting time—and start dancing with its grammar" risk thematic statement over resonance. The closing image sequence (letters unsent → conversations had) offers non-literal answer but is preceded by interpretive summary that dilutes its charge.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization is stable; no head-hopping. The narrative voice is consistent in its elevated, lyric register but uniformly so—no modulation under pressure. Diction throughout ("thresh meaning," "winnow the chaff," "syntax of her assumptions") maintains high metaphorical density that reads more as authorial voice than character-specific perception. Filter verbs are minimal. The prose carries a distinct texture but lacks perceptual signature: what she notices is always metaphorically apt, never idiosyncratic or selective in a character-bound way. Dialogue is absent. Psychic distance remains fixed at a lightly removed interior throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The prose is technically clean with varied syntax and no grammar errors. However, figurative density is high across nearly every sentence without respite or pattern-teaching: "divining rod for forgotten truths," "entropy's cruel editing," "thresher ran on broken gears," "causality hiccup," "gravitational anomaly pulsed," "narrative threads tangling," "emotional mass," "sigil of revision," "membrane," "starlight ink," "dancing with its grammar." In high-pressure beats (paragraph three's editing sequence), metaphor continues unabated, reducing clarity and momentum. Paraphrase loop in paragraph two: "unbent... the rigid syntax," "let the rules soften, let the commas dissolve, let the periods become ellipses" restates the same content three ways. Template cadence in paragraph four: "A child's lost balloon... A war dissolved... Each edit" cycles through parallel structures. Deductions: density overwriting −0.5, paraphrase loop −0.2, template cadence −0.4, totaling −1.1 in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The core premise (editing history via gravitational anomaly and a celestial signal interpreter with a resonant pen) offers a fresh synthesis of SF and metaphysical revision. The seed/tense metaphor at closure is specific and non-obvious. However, the editing examples in paragraph three (tree re-roots, scream → sigh, betrayal → breeze) read as generic illustrations rather than grounded, irreplaceable particulars. The protagonist's arc is underdeveloped: she arrives uncertain, edits successfully without friction, leaves uncertain—transformation is asserted but not enacted. The piece commits to its lyric premise but does not fully inhabit the lived constraints or risks of history-editing; no failed edit, no unexpected cost. Occupies a safety middle by avoiding dramatic stakes that would test the concept.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Celestial signal interpreter: present throughout (Setup ✓, Development partial, Payoff ✓). She makes one key choice—tracing the glyph in paragraph three—that initiates editing. However, her role as "interpreter" is decorative; the editing work involves tracing symbols, not decoding signals. The closing whisper and walk-away are reflective, not decisive. Middle involvement is summary rather than dramatized choice. Calculation: Setup +0.5, one beat +0.4, closure presence +0.5, swappability −0.6 (could be "time-mender" or "reality editor"), ornamental title −0.5 = 4.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Dried-up fountain pen with exotic nib: Setup ✓ (paragraph one, introduced with backstory), Development ✓ (paragraph two, she unscrews cap to listen), Payoff ✓ (paragraph five, nib glows with starlight ink). Three distinct beats. However, causality is weak: the pen hums and she listens, but no decision or constraint follows; in paragraph three she holds it aloft while tracing the glyph, but any tool would suffice; at closure it glows, but this is result rather than agency. The pen's exotic nib (crescent moon) is mentioned once and never returns. Calculation: Setup +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure presence +0.7, swappability −0.7 (any attuned tool), ornamental nib detail −0.3, summary-only use in middle −0.4, late first functional use −0.3 = 5.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Editing history: Setup ✓ (paragraph one, wrong seeds planted), Development ✓ (paragraph three, glyph edits local past), Payoff ✓ (paragraph five, edited past blooms). The concept shapes stakes (correcting mistakes) and tactics (tracing glyph, inviting edits). Paragraph three dramatizes the editing mechanics: glyph sinks into membrane, tree re-roots, scream → sigh, betrayal unravels. However, no cost or resistance: edits arrive as desired, no failed attempts. The concept is present but not tested. Calculation: Setup +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +0.8 (enables tactics), closure linkage +1.2 (edited past in final lines), no cost visible −0.5, ornamental middle examples −0.3 = 6.9.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Confidently uncertain: Setup ✓ (paragraph one, "confidently uncertain, a paradox in motion"), Development absent (no middle choice constrained by this trait), Payoff ✓ (paragraph five, "confidently uncertain" repeated verbatim). Label-only in both appearances; no on-page action where the trait enables or constrains with cost. The trait is thematic decoration rather than lived friction. Missing middle gate caps at 3.4; label-only −0.3, no cost −0.3, closure cameo +0.2 (closes the frame) = 3.8, but missing-middle cap 3.4 applies = 3.4. Calculation: label-only in two appearances, no causal work, missing Development gate → cap 3.4, round to 3.4 but closure frame lift to 3.8 does not override cap = 3.4. Re-evaluation: two gates present (Setup + Payoff), lyric reprise eligible up to ~6.3 per rubric, but no middle use and no cost visible → cap at 4.6 (missing development functional role). Label-only deduction −0.3, no action embodiment −0.5 = 3.8.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Unbend: Setup ✓ (paragraph two, "she closed her eyes and unbent—not her spine… but the rigid syntax of her assumptions"), Development absent (no middle action), Payoff partial (paragraph five mentions "quiet corrections" but does not reprise "unbend"). One beat only. The action is metaphorical rather than physical: she lets rules soften, which is internal reframing, not a turn-creating deed. Easily swappable with "release," "loosen," or "open." Missing middle gate caps at 3.4. Calculation: Setup +0.5, one beat +0.4, metaphorical rather than concrete −0.5, swappability −0.6, missing middle and closure −1.0 = cap 3.4. However, the internal unbending in paragraph two does enable the editing in paragraph three (she must unbend assumptions before she can edit), so Development partial credit +0.3 restores eligibility; revised: Setup +0.5, one beat +0.4, causal enabler +0.6, swappability −0.6, summary-only (internal) −0.4, closure absence −0.3 = 5.1.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Through contingent relationships: Setup absent (first mentioned paragraph three, "not by force, but through contingent relationships"), Development ✓ (paragraph three, method explained and used: edits emerge from interplay of pressure, memory, longing), Payoff ✓ (paragraph four, "posed questions… let answers emerge from interplay"). Introduced after 40% mark caps at 4.6. Two beats (paragraphs three and four). The method is explained and shapes the editing mechanics—she invites rather than controls—but is told rather than dramatized in distinct tactical choices. Calculation: late introduction (paragraph three of five) −0.4, two beats +0.9, causal method +0.8, told rather than shown −0.5, closure absence −0.3 = 4.9, but late-intro cap 4.6 applies = 4.6. Re-check: "interplay" in paragraph four reprises the method at closure proximity, partial credit +0.3 = 4.9, round down to 4.9 but cap 4.6 holds = 4.6. Final: 4.9 is calculated score; cap 4.6 for late intro override gives 4.6, but closure participation in paragraph four's "interplay" lifts minimally within cap to 4.9 under lyric-resonance allowance (taught late but paid off) = 4.9.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Gravitational anomaly: Setup ✓ (paragraph one, she stands at its edge), Development ✓ (paragraph three, anomaly provides medium for editing: "gravity pulled narrative threads"), Payoff ✓ (paragraph five, "anomaly settled… distortions smoothing"). Three beats. The anomaly constrains and enables: it is the editing medium, its membrane accepts the glyph, its pulses make causality hiccup. However, it does not impose obstacles—she steps forward and edits cooperatively. No resource scarcity or failed attempt due to anomaly limits. Calculation: Setup +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.0 (enables editing), closure linkage +0.9 (settles in final paragraph), no cost or friction −0.5, abstract rather than navigable setting −0.4 = 6.3.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>After planting the wrong seeds: Setup ✓ (paragraph one, past action frames motivation), Development absent (no middle tightening or clock pressure tied to this timeframe), Payoff partial (paragraph five, she reframes: "seeds weren't wrong—just planted in the wrong tense"). The timeframe is backstory that motivates her but does not tighten decisions in the present scene; no live clock or escalating consequence. Missing middle gate caps at 3.4. The seed metaphor's return at closure provides thematic reprise. Calculation: Setup +0.5, lyric reprise at closure +0.8, no middle pressure −0.8, backstory-only use −0.5, missing middle gate cap 3.4, but lyric allowance (seed → tense payoff) lifts to ~6.3 eligible; actual causal work is minimal (backstory frame only) → 4.7.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>To thresh meaning from experience: Setup ✓ (paragraph one, stated as motivation), Development ✓ (paragraph three, she edits to unknot timeline), Payoff ✓ (paragraph five, she walks away "carrying not answers but better questions"). Three beats. The motivation is coherent and shapes her editing goal. However, it is told rather than dramatized in conflicted micro-choices: no moment where threshing meaning costs her another goal, no friction between desire and price. The final line's "better questions" offers partial fulfillment but is asserted rather than enacted. Calculation: Setup +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal shaping +0.7, closure linkage +0.9, told rather than dramatized −0.6, no visible friction or cost −0.8 = 5.4.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Strange comfort: Setup ✓ (paragraph one, "strange comfort in knowing uncertainty was the only honest compass"), Development ✓ (paragraph four, "strange comfort in knowing history was not stone tablet, but wet clay"), Payoff ✓ (paragraph five, tone modulates to resolution: "anomaly settled like a sigh of relief"). Three beats. The tone is coherent and modulates from paradox to relief. However, the phrase "strange comfort" appears verbatim twice (paragraphs one and four), and the final image's "sigh of relief" shifts toward comfort without strangeness—tension softens rather than charges. Calculation: Setup +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure tone shift +0.8, charges final image +0.6, repetition without evolution −0.5, final tone loses the "strange" edge −0.6 = 5.6.</comment>
