<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The embroiderer's motivation is clear and her actions under pressure are consistent, but interiority remains abstract and label-driven rather than embodied. Key moments like "listening for unheard stories" and "disguising wisdom as foolishness" are told attributes without micro-choices that reveal contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final sleep feels convenient rather than earned through visible exhaustion or cost, and the character's internal experience during the coup's culmination is summarized rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed—who, where, and when coalesce only gradually across the first third, though the pattern is eventually legible (−0.3 applied here; Q3 capped at 7.0). The piece reads as Accumulative/Textural: density builds through repeated stitching beats and the flame's tremor, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant) when she sleeps beside the completed work. However, cost at closure is asserted rather than shown on the page—"They called her a fool still, even as they bowed" tells us the outcome without dramatizing the felt price of her renunciation or exhaustion. The causal chain from adjacent-layer witness to counter-pattern sabotage to loyalist victory relies heavily on summary rather than scene pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The cobalt observatory and autumn setting are vividly described, and the eternal flame functions as a recurring constraint that shapes her synchronization choices. However, spatial choreography during the conspirators' seizure is vague—no legible staging of how they enter, what they examine, or how she remains undetected. The setting provides atmospheric texture but does not materially constrain a peak choice or charge the final image beyond decorative recurrence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preventing the coup through stitched warnings—is signaled early and pressure accumulates through the flame's tremor, the adjacent-layer vision, and the conspirators' arrival. However, escalation is largely told: "false stars had led traitors into ambush" and "hidden paths saved the Crown Prince's life" summarize outcomes rather than dramatizing a on-page choice that narrows her options or forces a visible trade-off. The final stitch with the silver filament is described but its cost or tactical price is not legible on the page; the resolution feels delivered rather than earned through protagonist agency under pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme—wisdom disguised as foolishness, unheard stories given voice through craft—emerges organically from the embroiderer's actions and the conspirators' dismissal. The final image of her sleeping beside the loom offers a resonant non-literal answer, and the closing line "her needle still moves" reweights prior material with Charged Poise. However, the penultimate paragraph's explicit summary ("They called her a fool still, even as they bowed") borders on moralizing, and the piece occasionally substitutes atmospheric vocabulary for scene pressure when dramatizing the thematic question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable throughout with a distinct lyric texture in diction and rhythm—"whispers buried in the warp of thread, the weft of forgotten stars" establishes voice early. Perceptual signature is consistent (craft-focused, metaphor-laden) and psychic distance modulates purposefully during the adjacent-layer sequence. However, narrative certainty occasionally exceeds what the focalizer can plausibly infer: "the conspirators seized the observatory… they saw only a madwoman's art" asserts their collective interiority without dramatized cues, and the final summary paragraph shifts toward omniscient overview rather than holding the embroiderer's focalization through closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The prose is richly textured with varied sentence rhythm and strong figurative language, but density issues accumulate: paraphrase loops appear in adjacent lines ("not for beauty alone, but to listen for unheard stories—whispers buried in the warp of thread, the weft of forgotten stars"), and several beats recycle the stitching action with synonym churn rather than advancing new information. Peak moments—adjacent-layer witness, conspirators' arrival—are summarized rather than shown through concrete action, flattening momentum. The final third stacks summary sentences that reduce line-level propulsion, and metaphoric density in most sentences of high-pressure beats (flame tremor, coup climax) occasionally obscures clarity without pattern-teaching or payoff (−0.5 in Q7 for density and loops).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The combination of galaxy-chart embroidery, adjacent-layer perception, and the eternal flame as synchronization compass is specific and non-obvious, avoiding template fantasy premises. The embroiderer's disguised sabotage—"fool's gold stitched beside real gold, nonsense verses bordering prophecies"—offers a fresh angle on the wisdom-as-folly archetype. However, the coup-prevention plot follows a familiar structure (hidden threat, secret knowledge, last-minute intervention) and the resolution's mechanics are told rather than shown, reducing the felt transformation. The piece commits fully to its lyric-mythic register and takes risks with dense figurative language, though the opacity occasionally undercuts rather than heightens stakes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The galaxy-chart embroiderer is present from the opening line, drives the mid-story adjacent-layer witness and counter-stitching beats, and appears in the closure image sleeping beside her loom. Her choices—synchronizing with the flame, entering the adjacent layer, weaving counter-patterns—create the story's key turns and alter tactics under pressure. The character is indispensable to the plot's logic and the final image's charge.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The eternal flame appears in the fourth paragraph, guides the embroiderer's needle rhythm in multiple beats (tremor, cobalt-blue shift, final steadiness), and returns in the closure sentence as a marker of synchronization complete. Its evolving states—tremor, cobalt core, steady and small—constrain her actions and charge the final image. The flame's mechanics (trembling from adjacent-reality pressure) are specific and irreplaceable; removing it would break the story's synchronization logic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Unraveling conspiracies is the dominant stake signaled early ("before the coup") and shapes all major beats: the flame's warning, the adjacent-layer vision of the Chancellor's betrayal, the counter-pattern sabotage. The concept alters her tactics on the page (stitching decoy routes, false star-signs) and the closure image—loyalists warned, traitors ambushed—directly dramatizes the concept's resolution. The conspiracy's defeat is summarized rather than shown in climax, which lowers score slightly, but the concept is causal throughout.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Disguises wisdom as foolishness" is attributed early ("courtiers called her a dabbler, a dreamer") and pays off when conspirators dismiss her tapestries as "a madwoman's art" and leave her be, enabling her sabotage. However, the trait is told rather than shown through on-page dialogue or scene pressure—no conspirator speaks, no micro-choice reveals the cost of maintaining the disguise. The attribute constrains one key beat (the conspirators' decision) but lacks visible tradeoff or friction on the page, trending mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Synchronize" appears in paragraph six, recurs in the adjacent-layer sequence ("synchronized her heartbeat to the eternal flame's rhythm"), and returns at closure ("synchronization complete"). The action is specific—breathing with the flame's pulse, stepping perceptually into the adjacent layer—and drives the major turn (witness of conspiracy details) that enables all subsequent counter-moves. The mechanics are taught and irreplaceable; removing synchronization would collapse the story's causal spine.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Adjacent possibilities" is introduced in paragraph five (the flame's tremor signals "realities brushing too close"), taught through the aurora tapestry's mechanics, and drives the mid-story vision beat where she witnesses the conspiracy's details. The method shapes her attempt—she must synchronize to step into the adjacent layer—and its unique properties (echo-chamber of almost-was, whispers become shouts) provide information she could not obtain otherwise. The method is essential to the story's logic and appears in closure as "adjacent possibilities had collapsed into one: hers."</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The cobalt observatory is named in the opening line, provides the isolated work-space that allows her secrecy, and returns in the final paragraph as "a sanctuary of stitched truth." Autumn appears as texture (amber leaves scraping walls) but does not constrain choices. The setting pressures her by isolation (working alone) and enables her sabotage (conspirators arrive but leave her be), appearing across setup, middle, and closure. However, spatial details do not alter tactics in peak beats—the observatory functions as backdrop rather than active constraint during the coup itself.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Before the coup" is signaled in paragraph four and the timeframe tightens visibly: "the night before the coup" when conspirators arrive, then "dawn" when the coup strikes. The deadline pressures her final stitching sprint ("She stitched faster") and the coup's timing (solstice coronation, meteor showers) shapes her counter-tactics (false star-signs to mislead). The timeframe is causal and appears in closure, though exact elapsed time across beats is not tracked with granular precision.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"To listen for unheard stories" is stated in paragraph two and frames her work throughout (stitching to hear whispers, witnessing the conspiracy in the adjacent layer, giving voice to warnings). However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized through conflicted micro-choices—no moment shows her weighing the cost of listening or struggling with the burden of knowledge. The desire drives the plot but lacks on-page friction between want and cost, trending mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>"Echoed silence" as tone is established through diction (whispers, silence thickens, "quiet courage," "echoed silence between heartbeats") and modulates under pressure: the flame's violent shudder breaks stillness, the coup's drums echo beyond cliffs, then silence returns at closure when the flame burns "steady and small." The tone coheres through turns and charges the final image's hush. However, "echoed silence" is slightly abstract—silence functions more as atmosphere than structural constraint—and the final paragraph's summary voice shifts away from the established quiet register, lowering score slightly.</comment>
