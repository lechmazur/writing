<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Silas's interiority is vivid and particular—his belief that "memory could be borrowed" through residue shapes his investigation. However, his choices remain largely observational until the ending; the pinning gesture feels more thematic than a choice that forecloses options with visible cost. The stranger's backstory (alpine pass, Elara Vogt) arrives summarized rather than earned through embodied struggle. Internal contradiction is present but muted; Silas's eccentric stance never truly collides with a competing impulse on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story teaches a pattern of sensory fragments and memory-residue that accumulates toward the final pinning gesture and lantern lighting. Orientation anchors arrive cleanly (opal dock, Silas, three nights prior). One meaningful deepening occurs when Silas experiences the shard-memory on night four, reweighting the boutonnière from mystery to signature. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis/Charged Poise hybrid): Silas chooses not to report, accepting witnessed isolation as the cost; the lens holds. The cost is conceptual and felt but could be more viscerally legible on the page—"Some truths belong to the sea" verges on summary.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The opal dock, mist, and nautical twilight are rendered with strong sensory specificity and filter through Silas's eccentric perception ("sky bled indigo," "mist thickened like breath held too long"). The boutonnière functions as micro-setting: its crackle, texture, and scent anchor choices and charge the closure image when Silas pins it beside Elara's photograph. The lighthouse's lowest drawer and lantern beam also constrain the final gesture. Spatial choreography is clean throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—decoding the stranger's gesture—is signaled early and coheres throughout. One tightening occurs on night four when the sensory shard narrows interpretation from mystery to deliberate signature, changing Silas's knowledge. The resolution (not reporting, pinning the flower, lighting the lantern) is driven by Silas's stance crystallization under accumulative pressure. However, agency leans heavily on witnessing rather than decision that forecloses a live option with sharp cost; the refusal to report feels predetermined by his character rather than a costly trade-off tested on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—borrowed memory, witnessed isolation, and softly persistent love—emerges organically from the boutonnière, Silas's method, and the closure image. The final pinning beside Elara's photograph offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. However, "Some truths belong to the sea, and to those who listen in the gaps" edges toward thesis statement in the penultimate paragraph, diluting earned resonance. The Edelweiss and lighthouse motifs constrain choice and reweight meaning at closure, avoiding token recurrence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and atmospheric with controlled diction ("breath held too long," "blade through gauze"). Psychic distance is stable; Silas's perceptual signature (noticing gaps, textures, silences) remains consistent. No dialogue appears, so those bullets are not applicable. Brief overwriting moments ("the taste of salt clinging to abandoned gloves") and elevated register in peak beats ("guiding no ships tonight—only ghosts") create minor drag but do not obscure clarity. POV modesty holds; inference reads as inference.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully and information density is generally high. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "not stolen, not implanted, but gently inherited" and the repetition of "the stranger" across adjacent paragraphs. Template cadence emerges in the list of collected echoes ("the sigh in a rusted hinge, the ghost-song in warped floorboards, the taste of salt..."). Figurative density is high throughout without pattern-teaching, especially in the opening third. Sentence openings recycle "He" and "The" stems. These artifacts do not obscure causality but dull momentum in non-closure beats (−0.6 cumulative in Q7).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The borrowed-memory premise and the method of "observing gaps" offer a fresh inflection on the detective-mystery frame. The boutonnière as signature rather than lover's token is non-obvious and earned in hindsight. However, the lonely-keeper-decodes-a-mystery arc follows a familiar template, and the transformation relies heavily on atmosphere rather than a bold structural or moral choice. The Elara Vogt reveal (shipping manifest, Swiss ridge photograph) arrives conveniently late and summarized, reducing ingenuity at the closure beat.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Silas is present throughout and his choices (claiming the flower, walking the dock nightly, pinning it beside the photograph, not reporting) create the ending. However, most moves are observational or consolidative rather than turn-generating decisions that alter tactics under pressure. Present by setup, involved in two beats (claiming, final pinning), shapes closure, but causal pressure is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The Edelweiss appears in setup (claimed from the corpse), development (carried over Silas's heart, triggers the night-four memory shard), and closure (pinned beside Elara's photograph). It constrains Silas's method (sensory anchoring) and charges the final image with reweighted meaning. Earns ≥7.0 for beat involvement and closure linkage, though the cost tied specifically to *this object* is more conceptual than visceral.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Borrowed memories is articulated as Silas's belief and applied in the night-four sensory experience. It shapes his investigative method but does not narrow options or force a costly choice on the page—Silas's stance was already set. Functions thematically more than tactically. Present in setup and development, but closure participation is passive (the concept is illustrated rather than tested).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Softly persistent" is invoked as label ("Silas, softly persistent as tide-worn stone") and demonstrated in his nightly dock walks and refusal to report. It enables endurance but does not visibly constrain a choice with tradeoff or cost. The trait matches tone but remains more descriptor than causal lever. Present across beats but without sharp pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Investigate" drives the dominant stake and structures the plot (walking the dock, waiting for the gap to speak, pinning evidence). The night-four memory shard and the drawer scene are direct products of this action. However, the investigation is more atmospheric accumulation than a sequence of choices that redefine options. Present in setup and development, contributes to closure, but the action could be swapped for "contemplate" or "witness" with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Observing gaps" is signaled early ("the hollows between waves, the pause before gulls cry, the silence that follows a name spoken too late") and operationalized in the night-four beat when Silas closes his eyes and waits. The method shapes his investigation and distinguishes it from conventional detection. However, the mechanics remain abstract; what qualifies as a "gap" and how Silas's attention harvests memory is asserted more than dramatized. Present in setup and development, shapes closure image, but specificity is limited.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The opal dock is the story's spatial anchor, recurring in four evening scenes and the closure image ("witnessed isolation of the opal dock at nautical twilight"). Its mist, slick planks, and edge-position enable Silas's nightly ritual and sensory method. The setting charges tone and supports the final gesture but does not constrain a tactical choice with visible cost. Strong atmospheric contribution and closure participation elevate the score above mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Nautical twilight recurs as the investigation window and frames each dock scene. It establishes mood and rhythm but does not tighten decisions or impose a live clock. The time of day is more atmospheric marker than constraint. Present in setup, development, and closure image, but swappable with "dusk" or "evening" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Decoding the stranger's gesture is the dominant stake, signaled in paragraph four and pursued across the investigation. Silas's motivation is dramatized in his nightly walks and sensory anchoring, and the closure delivers an answer (signature, not lover's token; Elara connection). However, the motivation faces minimal friction—no competing want or cost challenges Silas's pursuit. Coherent and present across beats, but lacks conflicted pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Witnessed isolation" pervades the prose ("eccentric keeper of lights and losses," "Some truths belong to the sea, and to those who listen in the gaps") and modulates with the night-four memory shard and final lantern-lighting. Tone is coherent through turns and charges the closure image. The final paragraph ("guiding no ships tonight—only ghosts") crystallizes the tonal stance. Strong integration, though one phrase ("witnessed isolation") is overtly named in the last line, reducing subtlety slightly.</comment>
