<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's interiority is richly textured ("creeping normality she tracked," "sanctified thresholds") but her motivations remain abstract and external conflict is absent. The character observes and performs a ritual without facing embodied stakes or making a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. Internal contradiction is gestured at ("not to preserve, but to honor") but never dramatized through simultaneous impulses in scene. The walking figure remains more archetype than individual under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the ritual at the bay accumulates sensory and conceptual density. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive by paragraph four—acceptable for lyric mode but delayed enough to create mild drift. The closure offers Resonant Reconfiguration (a ritual completion that reweights the vanished cottage's departure) but the cost is conceptual and diffuse rather than felt on the page. The final paragraph summarizes intent ("keep walking, keep noticing") instead of landing a decisive image, weakening the closure beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The bay setting is rendered with strong sensory specificity ("moss-slick stone," "salt-kissed air") and the orris root shard functions as micro-setting, constraining the ritual's physical choreography. The streetlights "daydreaming" and the vanished cottage beneath the hedge charge the atmosphere. Spatial choreography is clear throughout. The setting participates in the closure by providing the tide that will dissolve the shard, meeting the 9+ gate requirement for constraint or charge.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—sanctifying the vanished cottage's departure—is signaled early and sustained, but no on-page reversal or tightening occurs. The ritual proceeds without opposition, complication, or cost that alters tactics. The protagonist kneels, places the shard, and rises; the cottage "unclenches" off-page. Under Accumulative lens escalation should emerge through density increase or pattern break; here the action is linear and the pressure static, with no meaningful deepening that narrows options or changes knowledge.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme—memory, architectural haunting, and the sanctification of loss—emerges through concrete particulars (orris root's "ghost-notes," the cottage "curled beneath a manicured hedge"). The final image of walking "eyes open, heart alight with hushed blaze" gestures toward resonance but the closing two paragraphs over-explain the thematic question ("not to preserve, but to honor") rather than letting the ritual image answer it non-literally. Subtext operates well in the middle passages; the ending dilutes it with direct statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct and lyric, with controlled diction ("butter-yellow glow," "pollen to the inside of her ribs") and a perceptual signature rooted in sensory memory and architectural haunting. POV remains stable in close third with no head-hopping. Psychic distance modulates purposefully during the ritual. The prose compresses and patterns ("hush...shard of hush...hushed blaze") in service of the accumulative design, teaching the reader the lyric mode early and maintaining it through closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and figurative language is dense but mostly coherent ("silence pooled like spilled ink," "houses...their doorframes leaning like old friends"). Two issues: the final two paragraphs loop conceptually, restating intent across adjacent lines ("keep walking, keep noticing, keep sanctifying" then "she would find another object...place it where it didn't belong"). Template cadence appears in the ritual sequence ("She knelt...placed...closed...pressed"). These artifacts dull momentum in the closure zone, triggering −0.4 to −0.6 under the patterned-artifact penalty pack and disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The premise—a "creeping normality noticer" who sanctifies lost houses through displaced objects—offers a fresh synthesis of psychogeography and ritual. The orris root shard as scent-memory architecture is specific and non-obvious. Execution, however, defaults to a single ritual without complication or transformation, and the final image is diluted by thematic summary. The piece commits to its vision but does not take narrative risk; the protagonist's walk is safe and unopposed, trending toward the "safety middle."</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The character is present throughout and her role as noticer frames the ritual, but she makes no on-page decision that alters tactics or forecloses a path. Observation without choice; the ritual proceeds as planned with no complication. Present by setup and in closure, but lacks middle development beat with cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The orris root shard is introduced early (paragraph five), handled physically at the bay (placement, palm press), and its dissolution by tide shapes the ending's temporal and material logic. It appears in three beats (acquisition backstory, ritual placement, closure fate) and its scent-memory properties are irreplaceable. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage, but the shard does not constrain a choice or narrow options—it enables the ritual without cost.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"A shard of hush" recurs as phrase and image: "sliver of suspended time," "hush deepened," "shards of hush placed like breadcrumbs." The concept shapes the ritual's tone and the protagonist's method, appearing in setup, middle suspension, and closure. It reweights prior material through repetition but does not constrain a tactical choice or create a felt cost on the page. Lyric reprise qualifies for mid-band under the allowance.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Inadvertently profound" is labeled in paragraph six ("not because it was magical, but because it remembered") but the trait does not enable or constrain an action. The shard's profundity is described, not dramatized through a tradeoff or cost. Ornamental use; swappable with "unintentionally meaningful" or similar phrasing.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Sanctify" drives the ritual structure: placement, intentionality, whispered textures, and the protagonist's closing vow to continue. The action is present in setup (paragraph nine), middle (paragraphs eleven–seventeen), and closure (final two paragraphs). It defines the protagonist's method and shapes the ending's charge. However, the sanctification proceeds without opposition or cost, making the action essential but not irreplaceable—another ritual verb could serve with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Through displaced objects" is signaled early (orris root "tucked inside a secondhand novel") and the method is foregrounded: "through displaced objects, she sanctified thresholds." The ritual demonstrates the method in the middle beats (placement of the shard) and the closing vow promises repetition ("chipped teacup, a rusted key, a child's marble"). The method appears in all three gates and its mechanics matter to the ritual's logic, though no cost or constraint tests its necessity.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The quiet bay in spring provides sensory anchors (reeds, tide, moss-slick stone, salt air) and the tide serves as a constraint: it will dissolve the shard by dawn, making the ritual's temporality material. The setting is present in setup, pressures the ritual's choreography (kneeling, placement), and participates in closure (dissolution). The bay's stillness and the nearby houses' "pulse" charge the final image. Essential across beats and ending.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"While the streetlights daydream" establishes dusk/evening and recurs in paragraph ten ("The streetlights, still daydreaming, stretched their glow"). The timeframe is evocative but does not tighten decisions or alter tactics; the ritual could occur at any hour. Present in setup and briefly in middle, but absent from closure and functionally replaceable with "at twilight" or similar phrasing.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The motivation "to understand why some houses feel alive" is stated in paragraph three and demonstrated through the ritual (sensing the vanished cottage, sanctifying its departure). It drives the protagonist's actions across the piece and appears in the closing vow. However, the desire is never conflicted or tested; no friction arises between the want and a cost. Told and shown, but not dramatized under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Hushed blaze" appears as phrase in paragraphs fifteen and twenty-four, and the tone—quiet intensity, suspended time, warmth beneath ash—is sustained throughout. The tone modulates subtly (stillness deepens, warmth blooms) and charges the ritual beats. It is coherent through the piece and present in the final image ("heart alight with hushed blaze"), but the closing paragraphs' thematic summary flattens the tonal charge slightly. Strong lyric integration, minor dilution at closure.</comment>
