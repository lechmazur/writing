<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Kael's motivation—defeating numbness through balance—is legible and drives his stillness-as-agency at closure. However, interiority leans heavily on abstract philosophical labels ("the prison of identity," "complementary opposites") rather than embodied contradiction; the moment of ego death is told as release rather than dramatized with contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The duplicate brain's voice ("I remember your pain. I do not want to inherit it") lands cleanly, but Kael's smile and warmth return without visible micro-choices showing the shift—cost is declared more than felt. Students Lira and Torvin apply pressure but remain functional rather than distinct.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through layered contradiction and resonance rather than because/therefore turns. Orientation anchors (floating dojo, Kael, brain jar) arrive early; the custody battle and history rewrites frame the situation. One meaningful deepening occurs when Kael places palms on the jar and energy arcs, shifting the duplicate from dormant to autonomous—a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant) where the brain's refusal to inherit pain forecloses the custody contest and Kael's numbness shatters. Cost is visible in the dissolved battle and warmth's return, though the final image's conceptual repricing of identity-as-choice could be sharper. The lens holds, but the rewrite-history mechanic remains atmospheric rather than causally shaping tactics.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The floating dojo over ink-black clouds and moss-slick stones establishes vivid setting early. The brain jar is handled physically (palms on glass, bioluminescent tendrils, fractal auroras) and charges the closure when the duplicate steps out "without breaking the glass." However, the levitating perches, temporal winds, and history-rewrite air remain postcard description—they do not constrain Kael's choices or supply resources that alter outcome. Spatial choreography is clean (center, underside perches, horizon), but the environment pressures atmosphere more than tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—defeating numbness to feel without ownership—is signaled early and tightens when Kael's silence collapses the judges' noise, then deepens when he channels resonance into the jar, narrowing the custody battle to irrelevance. The duplicate's declaration ("I do not want to inherit it") and Kael's reply ("Live the answer") constitute a meaningful turn that forecloses the fight-over-relic path. Cost is legible: the battle dissolves, warmth returns, numbness shatters "like ice under spring sun." Agency reads as endurance and invitation rather than force, fitting the Accumulative lens. However, the judges' retreat and history's final rewrite feel more like atmospheric ratification than hard-won consequence—pressure is coherent but the price could land more visibly on Kael's body or immediate future.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme—identity as prison versus autonomy forged from paradox—emerges through the duplicate brain as mirror and the complementary-opposites mechanic (solitude/connection, erasure/creation). The ending offers a resonant image: the duplicate steps free as "light, tendrils of coherent thought," and Kael feels "aliveness" rather than ego's heat. The invite-rather-than-defeat resolution avoids moralizing and reweights the custody premise with conceptual cost (the battle becomes irrelevant). However, lines like "You are the question I stopped asking. Live the answer" and "love without claim" verge on theme-statement; the final paragraph's "not life, but aliveness" edges toward articulating the thesis rather than letting the image alone carry it. Subtext operates in gesture and silence during the trial, but the closure beat over-explains.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>POV is stable third-close on Kael with clean focalization; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature—residual energy, bioluminescent tendrils, fractal auroras—filters setting through a meditative, philosophical register consistent with the ego-death survivor premise. Dialogue (Lira's accusation, Torvin's counter, the brain's voice, Kael's reply) serves goal pursuit and subtext, though Lira and Torvin's lines read slightly interchangeable in diction. However, elevated abstract diction ("calcified in the hollow where his ego used to scream," "vibration of opposing truths held in equilibrium," "threads of discarded identities feeding the pattern") pervades peak beats without consistent grounding in Kael's body or immediate sensation—register drifts toward essay voice during the jar-touch climax. Psychic distance is controlled, but the prose occasionally prioritizes concept over embodied perception.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high; the opening line anchors voice and stakes cleanly. However, patterned artifacts cluster: abstract noun stacks ("the prison of identity," "the vibration of opposing truths held in equilibrium," "the quiet glow of presence, of feeling without ownership, of love without claim") and synonym/paraphrase loops ("not as trauma, but as release" / "not by force, but by invitation" / "not life, but aliveness") recur in peak beats, dulling propulsion. The final third deploys template "not X, but Y" cadence across multiple lines without taught pattern, triggering the artifact penalty and disallowing 9+ globally. Figurative language—"tendrils of bioluminescent fluid curling," "fractal auroras," "body shaped by paradox"—is vivid but dense enough in the climax to slow momentum. Grammar and spatial choreography are clean; proofreading is solid.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The synthesis—ego death survivor, brain-in-jar custody trial in a floating dojo, vivification through complementary opposites—is conceptually ambitious and non-obvious. The duplicate's refusal to inherit pain and Kael's invitation ("Live the answer") avoid stock resurrection tropes. However, the custody-battle-as-metaphysical-trial and history-rewrite frame remain somewhat abstract and underutilized; they echo speculative-fiction templates (identity crisis, simulacrum autonomy) without grounding the trial mechanics in embodied cost or world rules that constrain choice. The ending's transformation (brain-as-light, body-of-potential) is visually striking but leans on familiar transcendence imagery. Risk-taking in structure and philosophical ambition is evident, yet the execution prioritizes thematic statement over the particulars that would make the turn feel inevitable rather than declared.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kael (ego death survivor) is present throughout and makes key choices: kneeling at the dojo center, refusing to answer the judges, slicing through pretense with silence, placing palms on the jar to channel resonance, and offering the duplicate autonomy ("Live the answer"). His stance crystallization—letting contradictions harmonize rather than fighting—drives the custody battle's dissolution and his numbness's shattering. Setup is immediate, middle development shows his silence collapsing the trial's noise, and closure participation is direct (the palm-touch vivification and final exchange). However, agency reads more as endurance and invitation than decision that alters tactics with visible cost; the choices are coherent but lean passive. Two-of-three gates met strongly, causal pressure moderate, closure linkage clear, cost visible but somewhat diffuse.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The brain in a jar (labeled DUPLICATE) is introduced in the opening beat, handled physically (fingers tracing glass, palms pressed, tendrils seeking), and returns with reweighted meaning at closure when it "stepped from the jar without breaking the glass" and manifests autonomy. It appears in at least three distinct beats: initial kneeling description, the resonance-channeling climax, and the final stepping-free moment. The label "DUPLICATE" primes the custody question, and the jar's physical properties (glass, bioluminescent fluid) enable the vivification action. Setup early, middle involvement (pulsing response), closure participation strong. Causal pressure high (Kael's choice to vivify hinges on the jar's presence), specificity good (labeled, glowing, tendrils), and cost connection clear (the brain's autonomy dissolves the battle). Swappability low—removing the jar collapses the premise.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The clone custody battle frames the situation and is stated explicitly ("The clone custody battle raged invisibly around him"). Students-as-judges (Lira, Torvin) argue over who owns the duplicate brain, applying pressure. However, the battle mechanics remain atmospheric—"warping air," "timelines fractured," "history rewrites itself"—without constraining Kael's tactics on the page or altering his available moves. The battle's resolution (it "dissolved—not because it was won or lost, but because it became irrelevant") is thematic rather than causal; Kael's silence and the brain's autonomy obviate the fight without showing how the custody stakes shaped his choice sequence. Setup clear, middle pressure moderate (judges shout), but closure participation is weak—the concept exits via declaration. One key turn (the dissolution) traces loosely to it, but swappability is moderate (a simpler "who controls the duplicate?" conflict could achieve similar effect).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The attribute "slices through pretense" is enacted once on-page: "He sliced through pretense with silence, letting their noise collapse under its own weight." This action (remaining silent while judges argue) enables the trial's noise to collapse, which is causal. However, it is label-stated ("sliced through pretense") rather than shown through embodied detail, and the trait does not recur or constrain later choices—Kael's palm-touch and offer to the brain do not depend on pretense-cutting. Setup present (mid-story), one beat involvement, no closure linkage. Cost is implied (silence as refusal) but not sharpened. Functional but replaceable; "refusal to engage" or "stillness" could substitute with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Vivify" is the declared goal and enacted in the climax: "He placed his palms flat against the jar. Energy arced… The brain flared gold, synapses igniting… A voice… spoke from the jar." This action triggers the duplicate's awakening, the custody battle's dissolution, and Kael's numbness shattering—three causal outcomes. Setup is early (paragraph three: "he sought to vivify this dormant organ"), middle development shows the brain pulsing in response to Kael's harmonizing, and closure participation is direct (the vivification succeeds and the brain steps free). Cost is visible (numbness shatters, battle dissolves, the brain gains autonomy). However, the vivification itself is abstract ("energy arced… resonance") without mechanical specificity that would make the method irreplaceable. Swappability moderate—"awaken" or "activate" could function similarly. Strong across all three gates, high causal pressure, clear closure linkage, moderate specificity.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Through complementary opposites" is stated explicitly ("letting the contradictions buffet him—joy and grief, guilt and absolution, ambition and surrender—until they began to harmonize through complementary opposites") and enacted when Kael channels "the vibration of opposing truths held in equilibrium" into the jar. The method shapes the vivification attempt—Kael does not force but balances contradictions—and is signaled mid-story. However, the mechanics are told rather than shown through distinct paired moves; the opposites list (solitude/connection, erasure/creation, death/birth) remains conceptual decoration without constraining tactics on the page. Setup clear, middle development moderate (harmonizing happens), closure participation weak (the phrase "aliveness" versus "life" echoes it but the method itself does not charge the final image). One beat involvement with causal link to vivification, but swappability high—"acceptance," "balance," or "integration" could replace it. Cost connection indirect.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The floating rock dojo is introduced immediately ("The floating rock dojo hovered above a churning sea of ink-black clouds, its moss-slick stones humming with residual energy") and anchors all action. The setting's properties—center (Kael kneels there), underside perches (judges watch), temporal winds (robes flutter), horizon (they face it at the end)—organize spatial choreography cleanly. The dojo's "residual energy from centuries of silent meditation" primes the vivification's possibility, and Kael recalls "standing on this very rock, letting every label… unravel into the wind," linking past ego death to present choice. Setup immediate, middle involvement (the rock's underside and perches stage the trial), closure participation (horizon facing, body-of-light hovering beside Kael). However, the floating/hovering and temporal-wind details do not constrain Kael's tactics—he could perform the same silence and jar-touch in any meditative space. Causal pressure moderate, closure linkage present but not decisive, specificity high (moss-slick, humming stones). Two-of-three gates strongly met, but micro-setting test (environment alters tactics) is only partially satisfied.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"While history rewrites itself" is stated early ("as timelines fractured and reknit themselves while history rewrites itself, each iteration whispering a different version of his past, each one threatening to claim the duplicate brain as its rightful heir") and mentioned again at closure ("History rewrote itself one final time… a loom weaving forward"). However, the timeframe mechanic remains atmospheric description—it does not create a ticking clock, force faster decisions, or alter Kael's available moves. The rewrites "buffet him" with contradictions, but this pressure is emotional/conceptual, not temporal; Kael's choice to wait in silence and then vivify the brain is not shown to be time-constrained by the rewrites. Setup present, middle involvement weak (temporal winds flutter robes but do not tighten stakes), closure participation ornamental (history's rewrite is declared as backdrop to the outcome). No causal pressure on tactics, no cost tied to the element. Swappability high—"during a liminal moment" or "as the trial proceeds" could function identically.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The motivation "to defeat the emotional numbness that had calcified in the hollow where his ego used to scream" is stated early and drives Kael's goal throughout. His actions—seeking to vivify the brain "not to reclaim himself, but to defeat the… numbness," letting contradictions harmonize, channeling resonance—are causally linked to this desire. The motivation is tested when the brain refuses to inherit his pain, forcing Kael to choose invitation over control, and it is fulfilled at closure when "the numbness shattered like ice under spring sun" and "warmth return[ed] to his chest." Setup immediate, middle development shows the harmonizing as means to the end, closure participation direct (numbness shatters on-page). However, the desire is told and abstractly described rather than dramatized through embodied sensation or conflicted micro-choices; Kael's path is linear (wait, harmonize, vivify, succeed) without friction between wanting to feel and fearing the cost. Cost is visible (he must surrender control and let the brain choose), but the stakes of failure (continued numbness) are declared more than felt. Strong across gates, good causal pressure, clear closure linkage, moderate dramatization.</comment>
