<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The ferry guides remain more symbolic presences than embodied characters with contradictory impulses. Elira and Torvin are given distinct gestures (humming, ear-to-bark listening) but these actions feel illustrative rather than pressure-driven choices that foreclose paths. The final vigil reads as thematic statement ("Courage doesn't rust") rather than earned insight from dramatized struggle. Internal conflict and embodied emotion are largely absent; the guides move through the piece without visible cost or friction that would make their stance crystallization feel inevitable.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The piece establishes a coherent Accumulative/Textural lens and delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) at closure when the guides sit in vigil and the star-punches chart "inner constellations." Orientation anchors arrive within the opening lines (ferry guides, dusk, ridgeway). The cost is conceptual—waiting, reverence, shared burden—but legible in the final image of star-holes punched into doorframes by dawn. However, the tightening is modest: the discovery of the shoe and whistle deepens meaning but does not narrow prior options or force a tactical shift, keeping the escalation gentle rather than decisive.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The veiled ridgeway, moss-slick railings, gnarled willow, and crumbling shrines create a vivid, purpose-driven environment that reflects the guides' reverent search. Spatial choreography is clear (ridge's crest, descent through switchbacks) and sensory detail is filtered through the POV ("salt and silence on their tongues," "moon-bathed ferns"). The recurring star-punch holes function as micro-setting, leaking quiet light to guide the way. The shoe and whistle—small objects half-buried in clover—charge the final image and constrain the guides' ritual response, satisfying the 9+ gate for environment shaping closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding where unused courage waits—is signaled early and remains coherent throughout. The guides' pilgrimage deepens at the ridge's crest when they discover the shoe and whistle, reweighting the abstract quest into concrete artifacts of halted bravery. However, escalation under the Accumulative lens is modest: the guides move with "gently persistent grace" and encounter no reversals or tactical friction. The final vigil crystallizes their stance, but the cost (patience, reverence, shared burden) is conceptual and soft rather than a visible forfeiture that alters later options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the particulars: the broken leash, star-punches marking thresholds, the shoe and whistle as artifacts of unused courage. The final image—star-shaped holes in doorframes and bread crusts—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. "Unused doesn't mean lost. It means reserved" risks abstraction but is grounded in the guides' kneeling vigil and the concrete objects. The piece resists false equivalence; courage is treated with reverence, not as a binary solved state. Subtext operates through gesture (Elira's humming, Torvin's ear to bark) and the fox slipping through bracken, inviting reflection beyond the immediate plot.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable in a close third plural ("they") with consistent distance and perceptual signature ("tasted salt and silence," "sighs between stones"). The prose carries a lyric, incantatory rhythm that fits the vigil tone. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register that feels writerly rather than embodied ("erosion and regret," "stitched with starlight"). Dialogue is minimal but purposeful when present; Elira's and Torvin's lines carry distinct idiom. Psychic distance is controlled, though the narration occasionally leans toward expository interiority ("truth hides in bends, not straightaways") that tells rather than shows the guides' perceptual filter.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The prose is rhythmically controlled with strong sensory specificity ("moss-slick railings," "bracken that sighed open and shut"). However, figurative density is high throughout, especially in peak beats: "leash broke…with a sigh," "star-punch holes in the fabric of the world," "inner constellations," "stitched with starlight." Mixed metaphors appear ("fabric of the world" / "leaking quiet light"). Template cadence emerges in repeated participial constructions and "they + verb" stems. Paraphrase loops are minimal, but the accumulation of metaphorical language without dramatized action dulls momentum. Stock phrasing ("half-remembered dreams," "question marks") reduces specificity in places.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The premise—wise ferry guides seeking unused courage along a veiled ridgeway—offers a fresh mythic frame, and the star-punch as ritual tool is a distinctive, non-obvious choice. The final image of tiny star-shaped holes in doorframes and bread crusts provides a memorable, organic ending. However, the emotional arc (pilgrimage → discovery → vigil → descent) follows a familiar quest template without significant transformation. The guides' "gently persistent" approach and indirect routes are thematically consistent but lack bold risk or friction that would elevate originality. Specificity in objects (shoe, whistle, clover) anchors the abstract premise, preventing drift into generic allegory.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The wise ferry guides are present throughout and make key choices: gathering without summons, choosing indirect routes, kneeling at the ridge's crest, punching stars into air and earth, and descending through hidden switchbacks. They appear in the setup, drive the middle beats (tracing moss, listening to bark), and shape the ending vigil. However, their decisions feel more ritual than pressure-driven; they encounter no friction or cost that their choices must overcome. The guides are essential to the story's frame but their agency does not create reversals or narrow options under stress, keeping them in the mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The ticket punch with star stamp appears in multiple beats: Elira's *click-click-click* as metronome, Torvin punching a star "into the air itself," the guides punching stars above the shoe and beside the whistle, and the final payoff of star-shaped holes in doorframes and bread. Early signal establishes its ritual function, middle beats show its use under pressure (marking thresholds crossed in spirit), and the ending reweights it as quiet proof that courage waits. The element is causally active across setup, development, and closure, though the cost tied to its use is conceptual rather than visceral.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The vigil in twilight shapes the story's stakes and tactics from the opening ("twilight deepened…into a vigil") through the ridge's crest discovery to the final sitting vigil where "no words passed." The concept constrains the guides' approach: they move with "gently persistent grace," neither rushing nor lingering, listening for hollows where courage pooled. The vigil reconfigures the quest from action to patience, altering the final image (star-holes as proof rather than reclamation). Present in setup, middle beats (sitting at the crest), and closure, the concept earns mid-to-high integration, though its cost is more conceptual than material.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Gently persistent" is signaled early ("they moved with gently persistent grace") and demonstrated through on-page actions: choosing indirect routes out of reverence, pausing to listen rather than pursue the fox, sitting in vigil rather than rushing to conclusions. The trait enables their approach and constrains their tactics (patience over pursuit). It reappears in the ending ("persistent enough to stay") and charges the final image of carry-through. However, the cost of gentleness is implied rather than dramatized; no visible tradeoff where aggression might have succeeded faster or at lower social price.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Traverse" is the central action: the guides traverse the veiled ridgeway from gathering through forks, crumbling shrines, and the ridge's crest to the final descent via hidden switchbacks. The action frames the entire pilgrimage and enables the discovery of the shoe and whistle. Present in setup ("ridgeway ahead"), middle beats (traversing past willow, mirrors, bracken), and closure (descending through switchbacks). However, the traversal itself is gently paced without friction or tactical shifts that make it irreplaceable; a similar quest structure (seek, find, return) could replace it with minor edits, keeping it mid-band despite strong presence.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Through indirect routes" is signaled early ("they chose indirect routes—not from fear, but reverence") and its mechanics shape on-page tactics: following glimmers of star-punch holes, not chasing the fox, pausing at the triple fork to listen. The method enables discoveries (shoe and whistle) that direct pursuit might have missed and constrains the guides' approach throughout. Present in setup, demonstrated in middle beats (listening to hollows, following curved paths), and paid off in the ending descent through hidden switchbacks. The method is causally active and charges the final image of patience inviting courage, earning high integration.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The veiled ridgeway is established in the opening, frames every beat (forks beneath willow, crumbling shrines, ridge's crest, hidden switchbacks), and charges the closure by supplying the micro-settings where courage is found (clover, earth). The setting constrains tactics: moss-slick railings guide Elira's fingers, the dry creekbed prompts Torvin's listening, the crest provides the discovery site. Strong setup, development across multiple beats, and direct closure participation. The ridgeway is indispensable; removing it would collapse the story's spatial logic and the guides' pilgrimage structure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"After the leash breaks" anchors the inciting condition and the opening line establishes the temporal frame ("at dusk"). The timeframe tightens through "twilight deepened" to the final "by dawn" payoff when star-holes appear. However, the leash-breaking itself is abstract—no on-page dramatization of what it tethered or what freedom it cost—and the passage from dusk to dawn does not constrain the guides' choices or create urgency. Present in setup and closure, but the middle beats ignore the clock, making time a poetic marker rather than a tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The motivation "to find where unused courage waits" is signaled early (the guides' mission is "pilgrimage: to find where unused courage waits") and drives the entire traversal. It is dramatized through searching gestures (tracing moss, listening to bark) and crystallizes at the discovery of the shoe and whistle. The motivation shapes the ending vigil and the final image of star-holes as proof. However, the desire is presented as unified and uncontested; no internal friction between competing wants or costs that would elevate it to high-band. Present in setup, middle beats, and closure, but the lack of conflicted choice keeps it mid-range.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The "shoreline lullaby" tone is established early (townsfolk "humming shoreline lullabies") and sustained through Elira's humming, the "soft, watchful, tender" vigil, and the "salt-laced zephyrs" carrying the lullaby up from cottages at closure. Tone modulates subtly with pressure: from the opening sigh to the deepening twilight to the final lighter steps, always maintaining a reverent, lyric register. The lullaby charges the final image by linking the guides' ritual to the townsfolk's rest. Coherent across turns, purposefully modulated, and integrated into the closure beat, earning high integration.</comment>
