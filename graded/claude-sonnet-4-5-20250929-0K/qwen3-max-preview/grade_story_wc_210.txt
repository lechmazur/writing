<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The alchemist's motivation is clear—to reimagine rather than restore—but interior contradiction and embodied emotion are thin. His actions (sweeping dust into mandalas, placing objects at lanterns) feel symbolic rather than driven by urgent internal conflict. The child's question and the alchemist's answer provide a micro-choice moment, but the protagonist never faces a decision that forecloses a path with visible cost; he simply continues his process until the town responds. The lack of genuine struggle or earned change keeps this in the functional but limited band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates images and motifs (lanterns, amber bottle, discarded objects) toward a conceptual repricing of "revival" as collective becoming rather than restoration. Orientation is clear early. The closure—lanterns emerging from collective memory, the bottle now "belonging to the becoming"—offers a resonant reconfiguration, but the cost is conceptual and oblique rather than felt on the page. No pointed sentence makes the price of this transformation legible; the accumulation teaches a pattern but doesn't impose visible sacrifice or tradeoff, keeping this below high-band entry.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Paper-Lantern Cove is vividly anchored with tattered silk globes, sagging awnings, and cobblestones. Sensory detail is selective and atmospheric. The amber bottle and lanterns function as micro-setting elements that recur and gain charge across beats. The bottle constrains the alchemist's approach (he holds it nightly, never opens it) and the lanterns emerging from cobblestones supply the town's shift. The setting subtly mirrors internal states—emptiness pooling, dust settling—without overt symbolism, and the spatial choreography (workshop, crossroads, child's windowsill) remains clear throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—reimagining civilization without nostalgia—is signaled early. Pressure accumulates through the alchemist's nightly work and the townspeople's gradual re-engagement, but there is no meaningful tightening or reversal that narrows options. The lanterns appear as emergent consequence rather than through protagonist agency forcing a trade-off. The alchemist's decisions (placing the bottle in the child's hands, leaving sculptures at crossroads) invite participation but don't foreclose paths or impose visible cost. One tightening or deepening under the Accumulative lens would lift this; instead, the escalation is gradual and unfocused.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme—revival as reinvention, not restoration—emerges organically from action and image without didactic statement. The amber bottle as "working memory made manifest" and the lanterns fed by "unspoken stories" avoid generic abstraction. The alchemist's line "a town dies twice" and his refusal to explain mechanisms resist over-articulation. The final image (bottle glowing in a child's room, civilization "reborn") offers a resonant, non-literal answer. Minor slip: "he knew nostalgia was a narcotic, not a blueprint" edges toward overt thematic commentary, but the piece earns most of its resonance through particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on the alchemist with consistent psychic distance. Perceptual signature is present—he notices "dust settled on thresholds like uninvited heirs"—but diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("narcotic, not a blueprint," "consequence...weight of what we didn't dare try") that feels writerly rather than character-bound. The dialogue with the child is natural and goal-driven. Filter verbs ("he knew," "he envisioned") are frequent but voice-motivated. Minor template cadence in exposition ("He called it," "He envisioned," "He didn't preach") but not enough to trigger heavy penalty. No head-hopping; distance control is clean.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Prose is clear and often vivid ("tattered silk globes swayed," "silence pooled in alleyways"). Information density is moderate; many sentences advance atmosphere and character. However, paraphrase loops appear: "not storage, but synthesis; not archive, but forge" and "not with hope, but with wary curiosity" are formulaic parallelisms that recur without adding pressure. Template cadence is present: "He rejected," "He called it," "He envisioned," "He sketched," "He didn't preach" across adjacent paragraphs. Minor overwriting in figurative density ("narcotic," "tapestry of discarded dreams," "altars of the ordinary") without pattern-teaching. These artifacts don't obscure causality but dull momentum in mid-story beats. Apply −0.6 for template cadence and −0.2 for paraphrase loops = −0.8 total in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The core premise—alchemist in a ghost town reimagining civilization through working memory—offers a fresh synthesis of fantasy elements and conceptual stakes. The amber bottle as container of "abandoned formulas" and lanterns grown from cobblestones transform familiar tropes. However, the emotional arc and conflict structure are generic: solitary visionary works alone, child bridges gap, town gradually responds. The transformation test is borderline—plot and arc could transfer to other settings (artist in abandoned village, inventor in post-collapse settlement) with minimal change. The "working memory" concept is intriguing but not deeply integrated into tactics or cost. No close echoes of famous lines; tone is coherent. Within-band positioning: fresh concept, predictable execution.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The deserted alchemist is present throughout and his actions (holding the bottle nightly, sketching blueprints, placing objects at crossroads, giving the bottle to the child) are on the page. However, these are process-driven rather than decision-driven; no single choice creates a key turn or narrows options with visible cost. The child interaction is the closest to a decision beat, but it's an invitation rather than a high-stakes choice. Setup is clear (first paragraph), development shows his ongoing work (middle), payoff shows the town responding (end). Functional presence but replaceable; a generic "visionary outsider" could serve the same role. Two gates met (setup, payoff), beat involvement modest, no causal pressure or closure linkage where his agency transforms stakes. Cap at 4.6 for missing strong middle development; land at 4.2 for swappability and lack of decisive choice.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The amber bottle is signaled early ("he kept the amber bottle—sealed without opening"), handled across multiple beats (held to candlelight nightly, placed in the child's hands, glowing on the windowsill), and returns at closure ("now glowing softly in a child's bedroom"). Its meaning evolves from personal archive to communal catalyst. All three gates met (setup first third, middle transfer to child, payoff at end). Beat involvement: at least three (nightly ritual, transfer, final glow). Causal pressure moderate—it frames his method but doesn't constrain a choice under stress. Closure linkage present but the final mention is passive (resting on windowsill) rather than actively shaping the ending action. Specificity high—"sealed without opening" and "working memory made manifest" are irreplaceable. Lift for early signal +0.5, beat involvement +0.9, closure linkage +0.8, specificity +0.5 = ~6.8. No major friction beyond mild passivity at closure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Ghost town revival is the story's dominant stake, shaping the alchemist's tactics (reimagining rather than restoring) and the townspeople's gradual return. Setup is immediate (first paragraph describes the emptied town post-plague), development shows the alchemist's process of revival (middle third), and payoff lands at closure (lanterns emerge, town "reborn"). The concept changes options: the alchemist rejects restoration and chooses participatory reinvention, the townspeople shift from watching to contributing. Beat involvement: at least three (initial emptiness, alchemist's nightly work, collective lantern-making). Causal pressure present—the town's prior depletion forces the alchemist's approach. Closure linkage strong—the final image crystallizes revival as "reborn" rather than "restored." Lift for setup +0.6, beat involvement +1.4, causal pressure +0.8, closure linkage +1.2 = ~7.1. Minor friction: the mechanics of revival (lanterns emerging from cobblestones) are conceptual rather than grounded in choice-under-pressure, but the concept itself is indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Rejects false comfort" is dramatized in one beat: "He rejected false comfort, refusing to believe revival meant restoring what was lost; he knew nostalgia was a narcotic, not a blueprint." This frames his approach but doesn't constrain an on-page action with visible cost. The attribute appears in setup (first third), informs his tactics (he doesn't preach or promise, leaves space for others), but never forces a tradeoff where rejecting comfort costs him something tangible. Development weak—it's a stance, not a friction. Payoff: the attribute supports the ending's theme but doesn't actively shape the final image. One gate clearly met (setup), arguable development, weak payoff. Functional but replaceable; any "unconventional visionary" trait could serve. Lift for setup +0.4, thematic support +0.3 = ~5.4. Cap at 4.6 for missing strong middle constraint would apply, but the attribute's thematic integration at closure nudges it slightly higher within the friction allowance.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Conceive" (to imagine, design, create) is the alchemist's central action: "he conceived—not of potions or spells—but of civilization reimagined," "he sketched blueprints...each line a thread pulled from the tapestry of discarded dreams." The action is present across beats (nightly bottle ritual, sketching, placing sculptures, transferring the bottle). Setup clear (first third), development sustained (middle work), payoff indirect (the town's lanterns are conceived collectively, echoing his process). However, major turns do not trace directly to this action; the lanterns emerge as consequence of collective will rather than a single act of conception by the alchemist. Swappability test: "create," "design," or "imagine" could replace "conceive" with minor lexical edits. Beat involvement +0.9, setup +0.4, thematic resonance +0.4 = ~6.3. Not indispensable—the story would hold with a synonym—but well-integrated thematically.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Through working memory" is signaled early ("he called it his working memory made manifest: not storage, but synthesis") and shapes the alchemist's method: the bottle holds "every formula he'd abandoned, every half-baked theory." The method matters—he uses the bottle's glow to guide his sketches, and the final image repositions working memory as communal ("the town learning to open itself"). Setup clear (first third), development present (bottle guides nightly work), payoff strong (working memory becomes collective revival mechanism). However, the mechanics are conceptual; the method doesn't constrain a specific attempt or force a tactical shift under pressure. Beat involvement: two (nightly ritual, transfer to child). Causal pressure weak—it's thematic rather than tactical. Closure linkage moderate—the method is echoed in the ending's theme. Lift for setup +0.5, closure linkage +0.9, beat involvement +0.4 = ~5.9. Friction: summary-only use in middle beats −0.3, conceptual rather than tactical −0.4 = net ~5.9.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Paper-Lantern Cove as setting pressures every beat: the emptied streets force the alchemist's approach, the "sagging awning" houses his workshop, the cobblestones supply the ground from which lanterns grow, the crossroads become altars. Setup immediate (first paragraph), development sustained (workshop, crossroads, windowsill), payoff strong (lanterns emerging from the setting itself). The setting constrains choices—there are few townsfolk, silence forces solitary work—and charges the final image (lanterns grown from cobblestones, bottle on a windowsill). Beat involvement: pervasive. Causal pressure high—the setting's depletion necessitates reimagining. Closure linkage strong—the cove's physical space transforms. Lift for setup +0.7, beat involvement +1.4, causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage +1.4, specificity +0.6 = ~7.6. No significant friction; the setting is indispensable and irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"After the last wish is granted" establishes the temporal frame (the plague is cured, the town's soul drained) but functions as backstory rather than live pressure. The timeframe is past-anchored, not forward-tightening; no clock constrains the alchemist's process. Setup clear (first paragraph), development absent (time is vague—"each night," "one child...crept close," "each morning after"—without urgency), payoff weak (closure doesn't hinge on when events occur). The timeframe sets context but doesn't alter tactics or decisions. Functional presence but replaceable; the story would work with "after the plague" or "in the town's decline." One gate met (setup). Ornamental use −0.8, swappability −0.5 = ~4.8. Cap at 4.6 for missing middle/payoff gates, but the element's framing role lifts it slightly within tolerance.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The motivation "to reimagine an entire civilization" is dramatized: "he conceived...of civilization reimagined: not as a return, but as a reinvention," and enacted through his nightly work, sketches, and placement of objects. Setup clear (first third), development sustained (his process across middle beats), payoff lands (civilization "reborn"). However, the motivation is never conflicted or tested; he works steadily without friction between want and cost. No moment where reimagining civilization forces him to sacrifice something personal or face a competing desire. Beat involvement: three (nightly work, transfer of bottle, witnessing lanterns). Causal pressure moderate—his motivation drives his actions. Closure linkage strong—the ending fulfills the motivation. Lift for setup +0.6, beat involvement +1.4, closure linkage +1.2 = ~6.6. Friction: told-only depth, no internal conflict −0.6 = net ~6.6.</comment>
