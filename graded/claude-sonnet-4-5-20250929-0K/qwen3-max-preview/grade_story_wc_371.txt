<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's interior life is consistently rendered through embodied perception—fingers brushing archway, kneeling by fountain—and her motivation (seeking permission from earth to feel sacred) drives her micro-choices. Internal contradiction surfaces in the tension between grief-as-wallpaper and active resistance through seed-planting, though the contradiction could press harder at closure. The "uncloaking" moment reads more symbolic than psychologically costly; removing a shawl doesn't foreclose a live option with visible stakes. Interiority avoids therapy-speak and grounds in concrete sensory anchors, keeping the voice character-particular throughout.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors early (courtyard, vanished bakery memory, tea house discovery) and the piece holds a stable Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure accrues through remembered loss, present ritual, and guerrilla gardening, culminating in the hidden-spring drip and star moment. Closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the protagonist doesn't solve grief but reconfigures her stance—"she's remembered how to ask"—and the final star image reweights prior material with quiet absolution. Cost is felt (seasons of armor, bread untouched, seeds that may not grow) but oblique; the conceptual price of vulnerability is legible in the wheat-dress exposure and seed-gestures. One meaningful deepening occurs when seed-planting shifts from passive noticing to active defiance, tightening the dominant stake.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The overgrown courtyard—vines, moss, cracked fountain, wisteria—constrains movement (she kneels, doesn't rush) and the tea house's warped floorboards and spider-silk teacups charge the final ritual. Sensory detail is selective and purpose-driven: damp soil, jasmine scent, water dripping from a newly stirred spring. The bread and seeds function as micro-setting objects that anchor choices (offering, planting) and recur with reweighted meaning at closure. Spatial choreography remains clear; body, object, and place interweave without postcard excess. The environment subtly mirrors internal state—overgrowth as accumulated grief—without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: seeking "tenuous absolution" / permission to feel sacred again after loss. Pressure accumulates through Accumulative lens as passive observation (bread offering) deepens into active defiance (seed-planting, uncloaking). One meaningful tightening: the protagonist moves from carrying stale bread to placing seeds, narrowing options from mourning to resistance. Agency is primarily renunciation and endurance; the bread remains untouched, guerrilla gardening doesn't promise growth, yet these acts foreclose passivity with on-page cost (vulnerability, uncertain outcome). The hidden spring's drip signals a micro-turn but doesn't reverse prior trajectory; it resonates as confirmation rather than complication. Cost clarity is solid but quiet; stakes remain interior and symbolic throughout.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: stale bread, wildflower seeds in cracks, the gray shawl discarded to reveal wheat-colored dress. "Creeping normality" is dramatized through the vanished bakery and boarded door, not stated as concept. The final image—first star unnamed, water dripping, cross-legged tea-sipping—offers a resonant, non-literal answer: the sacred isn't reclaimed but recognized in small acts of defiance and presence. Subtext operates in silence (bread untouched, no birds to take it), gesture (kneeling, uncloaking), and image (spring newly stirred). The piece resists moralizing; the protagonist's smile signals acceptance without resolution, and "tenuous absolution" remains tenuous. One line late leans didactic—"The sacred isn't in grand cathedrals…"—but it's filtered through her realization rather than authorial voice, keeping theme embodied in scene work.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains stable psychic distance and the narrator's perceptual signature is selective and character-specific: noticing "loss becomes wallpaper," "grief gets folded into routine," the ghost of laughter absorbed by ivy. Diction is consistently lyric and compression serves the textural mode—"patience is the grammar of absolution," "beauty erased without resistance." Filter verbs ("she feels," "she remembers") appear frequently but are voice-motivated and don't dull immediacy in this reflective register. One late slip: "The sacred isn't in grand cathedrals…" shifts into summarizing voice rather than staying in her embodied perception. No dialogue to evaluate. Focalization remains controlled; what she knows (bakery closure, tea house discovery) unfolds through memory anchored in present stimuli (bread, courtyard). Tense and stance are stable throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies naturally and information density is high—most lines advance character, atmosphere, or stake. However, multiple figurative constructions cluster without pattern-teaching: "patience is the grammar of absolution," "silence steep," "memories refusing to settle," "tiny defiance," "prayer whispered into dirt." In a high-density lyric mode this density can work, but here it occasionally obscures clarity (what does "grammar of absolution" concretely mean for her choice?). Minor paraphrase loop: "She doesn't know if they'll grow. That's not the point. The point is the gesture…" restates across three sentences. Stock metaphor: "loss becomes wallpaper" is familiar phrasing. Filter-verb stacks appear in reflective passages but stay under three per cluster. The prose is clean and proofread, with strong verb choices (squats, swallow, muffles, stirred) and no major syntactic monotony. Opening and closing lines are purposeful. Figurative density in non-peak beats and one loop trigger moderate deductions but don't obscure closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The premise—grief-as-creeping-normality, guerrilla gardening as ritual resistance—offers a fresh angle on mourning and reclamation. Specific details (vanished bakery, secret tea house, wisteria burial, wildflower seeds in flagstone cracks) ground the voice and avoid generic "everywhere" setting. Transformation test: the emotional arc and plot rely heavily on the particular images (bread, seeds, shawl, tea house) and couldn't transfer unchanged. However, the arc follows a familiar template: solitary protagonist processes loss through symbolic acts in a decayed setting, finding quiet epiphany. "Guerrilla gardening" is mentioned by name, which feels prompted rather than discovered. The final turn—hidden spring dripping, unnamed star—is poetic but not unexpected given the accumulative design. Risk is present in the quiet, open ending and refusal of tidy resolution, but execution stays within established lyric-realism conventions. No close echoes of famous lines detected, and emotional truth feels authentic rather than ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The "creeping normality noticer" role is present throughout: she observes loss becoming wallpaper, grief folded into routine, the vanished bakery, the overgrown courtyard. Her noticing drives two key choices—offering bread and planting seeds—both shaped by her observation that "truth hides in the slow dissolve." The trait enables her heuristically gentle pace and guerrilla gardening tactics. However, "noticing" alone doesn't create the sharpest turns; the decisive acts (uncloaking, seed-planting) stem more from accumulated grief than from a new observation. Setup is early (first paragraph), development occurs mid-story (seed-planting decision), and payoff is present in the closure moment (she's remembered how to ask, implying renewed noticing). Causal pressure is moderate; the role constrains her approach but doesn't force a high-cost trade-off. Swappability is low—removing "noticer" would flatten her methodology—but the role could be described differently without restructuring.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Bread from the vanished bakery appears in three beats: wrapped in yellowed wax paper, broken and placed on moss as offering, and left untouched on a chipped saucer in the tea house. It carries reweighted meaning from "blessings" to "old promises" to "some offerings are meant to linger." Setup is early (courtyard arrival), development occurs when she places it as offering, and payoff is the final acceptance that it remains untouched. The object enables her ritual gesture and its stale, hardened state mirrors her emotional state. Specificity is strong—the vanished bakery anchors her loss concretely—and the bread's untouched state at closure charges the image of tenuous absolution. However, the bread doesn't constrain a choice with visible cost; she places it, then moves on to seeds. It's essential to atmosphere and theme but not indispensable to plot logic. Causal pressure is moderate; removing it would weaken resonance but not break the arc.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Tenuous absolution" is named explicitly and shapes the dominant stake: she seeks "permission from the earth itself to feel sacred again." The concept drives her tactics (offering bread, planting seeds, uncloaking) and the final image—unnamed star, hidden spring, quiet smile—embodies tenuous absolution without declaring it solved. Setup occurs early (first third), development is woven through each ritual act, and payoff lands in the closure moment where she accepts incompleteness. However, the concept is more thematic frame than on-page constraint; it describes her goal but doesn't force a choice between competing paths with legible cost. The word "absolution" itself appears twice, signaling prompt-alignment rather than organic discovery. Specificity is solid (earth as granter, not gods or kings) and the "tenuous" quality persists at closure. Causal pressure is present but diffuse; the concept reweights the ending but doesn't narrow options mid-story.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Heuristically gentle" appears explicitly in the opening: "her pace is heuristically gentle, adjusting to the rhythm of rustling leaves." The trait constrains her approach—she doesn't rush, kneels by the fountain, lets silence steep—and enables the slow, observational methodology that leads to seed-planting. Setup is immediate (first paragraph), development is implicit in her patient choices throughout, and payoff is visible in the closure posture (cross-legged, eyes closed, listening). However, the trait is more label than lived contradiction; no moment shows a cost to gentleness or a temptation to rush that she resists. The adjective "heuristically" reads as elevated diction slightly outside natural voice. Swappability is moderate—"patient" or "deliberate" would function similarly. The trait aligns with her choices but doesn't force a visible trade-off or escalation. It's functional and consistent but not indispensable to story logic.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Uncloak" occurs explicitly in the mid-section: she removes her gray wool shawl, revealing a wheat-colored dress. The act is framed as "shedding armor she didn't know she carried" and immediately precedes guerrilla gardening, suggesting it enables vulnerability and action. Setup is deferred (second half), development is the uncloaking moment itself, and payoff is implicit in her subsequent openness (sitting, sipping tea, smiling). The action redefines her emotional posture from protected to exposed. However, uncloaking doesn't create a sharp plot turn or foreclose a prior path with legible cost; she could have planted seeds while still cloaked. Specificity is solid—gray wool to spring wheat visually charges the shift—but the act functions more as symbolic milestone than tactical necessity. Swappability is low (no other single gesture carries the same weight) but the action is easily moved or removed without breaking causality. It's purposeful and integrated but not load-bearing.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Guerrilla gardening" is named explicitly and executed in one extended beat: she plants wildflower seeds into cracks, beneath roots, beside the fountain. The method is framed as "tiny defiance against forgetting" and shapes the closure image (seeds pressed into earth, hidden spring stirred). Setup is late (final third), development is the planting act itself, and payoff is the protagonist's acceptance that growth is uncertain ("She doesn't know if they'll grow. That's not the point"). The method enables her shift from passive mourning to active resistance. However, naming it "guerrilla gardening" feels externally imposed; the phrase is used once and then described. The mechanics are simple (handfuls of seeds, no tools) and don't require specialized knowledge or constraint. Causal pressure is moderate; the act charges the ending but arrives late and doesn't shape earlier tactics. Specificity is solid (wildflower seeds, specific placements) but swappability is moderate—another small act of defiance could serve similarly.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The "secret tea house in an overgrown palace courtyard" is present throughout: vines, moss, crumbling archway, cracked fountain, wisteria-buried tea house, warped floorboards. Setup is immediate (first paragraph), development occurs as she navigates the space (kneeling, entering, lighting candle), and payoff is the closure scene (cross-legged on floorboards, sipping tea, listening to hidden spring). The setting constrains movement (overgrowth slows her, floorboards are warped) and supplies resources (moss for bread, cracks for seeds, fountain basin, teacups). Spatial choreography is clear and the environment charges the final image—hidden spring dripping suggests the courtyard itself responds. Specificity is strong (palace courtyard distinct from generic garden; tea house distinct from generic ruin) and irreplaceability is high—no other setting would support the archaeology-of-loss stakes. The setting enables ritual acts and mirrors internal state without overt symbolism. Causal pressure is solid; removing this exact setting would require restructuring the arc.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"After the birds fly south" appears in the opening line and is referenced once more ("No birds remain to take it"). The timeframe signals autumn or early winter and contributes to atmosphere (absence, migration, ending). However, it doesn't tighten decisions, create urgency, or track causally through the story. No clock or seasonal pressure shapes her choices; she could perform these acts in any season. Setup is immediate, but development and payoff are absent—time doesn't escalate or constrain. The detail is purposeful (birds' absence underscores isolation and the bread's futility) but ornamental to plot logic. Swappability is high; another seasonal marker would serve similarly. The timeframe is present and consistent but entirely replaceable without structural impact. It enriches setting and tone but doesn't alter tactics or outcomes.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"To find the sacred in the ordinary" is dramatized through her actions: offering stale bread, planting seeds in cracks, sitting with cold tea, removing the shawl. The motivation is named explicitly ("she seeks… permission from the earth itself to feel sacred again") and drives every beat. Setup is early (first third), development is woven through ritual acts, and payoff is the closure realization ("The sacred isn't in grand cathedrals… It's here"). However, the motivation is more frame than friction; no competing desire or cost tests her commitment. She wants to feel sacred and takes steps toward it without obstacle or trade-off. The final paragraph leans didactic, naming the theme rather than letting the image speak. Specificity is solid (earth as permission-granter, ordinary acts as site) and the desire shapes all tactics. Causal pressure is present but gentle; the motivation is consistent and drives choices but doesn't force a high-stakes decision or visible sacrifice. It's functional and integrated but lacks sharp conflict.</comment>
