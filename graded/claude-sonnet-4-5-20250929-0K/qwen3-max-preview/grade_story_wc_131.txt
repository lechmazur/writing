<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The dweller's motivation is clearly established and her methodical reverence for objects drives action, but the character remains more symbolic than embodied. Her tears at the end earn the emotional beat, yet the interior texture leans abstract ("warmth spreading through her ribs, like light through stained glass") without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The sense-memory fragment delivers one on-page micro-choice (placement atop the microfilm reader), but key turns lack the messy friction of competing wants. No therapy-speak intrudes, and the final choice forecloses invisibility with felt cost, lifting the score.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who, where, and when by the opening beat; no penalty applies. The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis transitioning toward visibility) with felt cost: the dweller remains hidden yet achieves connection, foreclosing pure isolation. The dominant stake (becoming visible to those who need you) is signaled early and tightens when she places the fragment where it will be found. Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the density of sensory echoes and cached objects builds pressure, and the staff notice completes the reconfiguration. One meaningful deepening is sufficient at this length, and the cost is legible in her decision to defer full emergence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The library's crawl spaces, pipe chases, and stained-glass windows supply vivid, selective detail filtered through the dweller's reverent attention. The tape fragment's "cold, angular" texture and "scent of ozone" embody micro-setting that constrains her handling and charges the closure placement. Spatial choreography remains coherent across the nest, ducts, rafters, and AV archive floor. The 9+ gate (environment constrains choice or charges final image) is nearly met: the microfilm reader's placement is deliberate, but the choice would survive in any similar archive space without structural loss, capping the score just below 8.5.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake (visibility) is signaled in paragraph three and tightens when the dweller moves from caching to placing objects where they can be received. One meaningful escalation occurs when she places the tape fragment atop the reader, forecloses pure hiding, and accepts the risk of partial visibility. The intern's discovery and the staff notice crystallize the cost: connection without full emergence. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure coheres through the mosaic of cached items and the final placement reweights her isolation. Agency is present in the decision to place rather than hoard; coincidence does not resolve. The cost is felt but not visceral enough to break into the 8+ band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme (invisibility as soul erosion; visibility as resonance, not spectacle) emerges through the dweller's ritual of caching and her tears at the staff notice. The tape fragment's ghost-voice ("if you're listening, you're not alone") seeds the ending message without overt echo. Subtext operates in the placement ritual and the dweller's choice to remain hidden "not yet," resisting both total erasure and premature emergence. The final image (tears, perch behind biography stacks) offers a resonant answer without moralizing. Minor slip: "Visibility wasn't spectacle. It was resonance" borders on authorial thesis statement, though it flows from prior action. The non-literal answer criterion is met, keeping the score in the high 7s.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. The dweller's perceptual signature is consistent: reverent, tactile, attuned to relics. Diction fits her voice ("archaeology of abandonment," "sacrament") without register mismatch. The intern's brief dialogue ("You won't believe this—") carries naturalistic urgency and advances plot. One minor slip: "warmth spreading through her ribs, like light through stained glass" leans slightly elevated under peak emotion but remains voice-plausible given the library setting. Psychic distance modulates purposefully from close interior to wider observation in the rafters. No filter-verb stacks or template cadence intrudes. The 9+ gate (distinct perceptual signature with rhythmic control under pressure) is narrowly missed due to the single figurative reach at the climax.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies naturally; no algorithmic patterns. Information density is high in the caching sequence and placement beats. Two minor frictions lower the score: (1) "She began to cache" / "She began to leave traces" use identical stems across adjacent moves (−0.4 for template cadence), and (2) "echo" appears three times in close proximity ("sensory echo," "echoing to her alone," "Thematic Echo" effect in "you're not alone" → final notice), risking synonym loop but not quite crossing the threshold (−0.2 caution). The figurative density in peak beats ("pulsed with ghost-sound," "mosaic of lives," "light through stained glass") approaches overwriting but remains legible and voice-motivated, avoiding the −0.3 to −0.7 penalty. Clarity and propulsion hold; no paraphrase loops or scaffold obscure causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The crawl-space urban hermit archetype is familiar, but the specific synthesis (analog tape archaeology + library setting + gradual self-revelation through object placement) offers a fresh angle. The dweller's choice to curate rather than hoard, and to place rather than display, transforms the "hidden helper" trope. Emotional specificity in the caching ritual and the intern's discovery avoids generic templates. One friction: the "Lost Oral Histories" detail and the staff notice's mirrored phrasing ("if you're listening… you're not alone") verge on neat coincidence, reducing bold risk-taking. The premise is not derivative enough to trigger the Derivative Premise Guardrail, but the ending's symmetry prevents the unconventional-risk bonus. The score lands in the mid-high 6s.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Crawl space dweller is present throughout and drives three beats: uncovering the fragment, caching it alongside other relics, and placing it atop the microfilm reader (setup, development, payoff all met). Her choice to place rather than hoard narrows options and charges the closure when she reads the staff notice. The cost is visible in her tears and decision to remain hidden "not yet." Early signal (+0.5), three beats (+1.4), causal pressure (+0.8), closure linkage (+1.0), cost connection (+0.4). Base 3.0 + 4.1 = 7.1, rounded down to 7.1. Slight irreplaceability lift (+0.1): her specific archaeology ritual and methodical reverence are integral. Final 7.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Ferromagnetic tape reel fragment appears in three beats: discovery (jagged, cold, angular), sense-memory flashback (ozone, oxide, ghost-voice), and placement atop the microfilm reader where the intern finds it. Early signal (+0.6), three beats (+1.4), causal pressure (+1.2; enables the staff notice), closure linkage (+1.5; intern discovery triggers the resonance), specificity (+0.6; its analog nature and "Lost Oral Histories" identity matter), cost connection (+0.4; dweller relinquishes sole possession). Base 3.0 + 5.7 = 8.7. Minor swappability friction (−0.3; another relic could serve, though the tape's voice-echo is apt). Resolved 8.4, but the charged reprise of "you're not alone" lifts it slightly. Final 8.1.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Sense memory shapes one extended beat: the dweller closes her eyes, smells ozone, hears the ghost-voice, and experiences static cling. This flashback primes her decision to treat the fragment as sacrament rather than salvage, altering tactics. Setup present (+0.5), one beat (+0.4), causal pressure (+0.8; shifts her handling), closure participation indirect (the concept echoes in the staff notice but does not reappear as a distinct on-page moment; −0.3). Base 3.0 + 1.4 = 4.4. Lyric-resonance allowance: the early seed (sense memory) and final reprise (staff notice's auditory echo) reweight the stake without mid-scene use, lifting to ~5.8. No late penalty; introduced in first third.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Kindly methodical" is established in the opening line ("methodical grace, fingertips brushing dust") and informs her caching ritual and careful placement. Setup present (+0.5), constrains two actions: dusting pipe chases and tenderly positioning offerings (+0.9), causal pressure modest (+0.4; her method enables discovery but does not narrow high-stakes options). No closure linkage beyond tonal consistency. Base 3.0 + 1.8 = 4.8. Label-only friction (−0.3; "kindly" is declared, not dramatized through a choice that costs her). Swappability (−0.3; "patient" or "deliberate" would serve). Final 4.2.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Cache drives the structure: she caches the fragment alongside ribbon, key, ticket, then shifts to placing them in findable locations, culminating in the tape placement that triggers closure. Setup (+0.6), three beats (initial cache, the collection description, the shift to placement; +1.4), causal pressure (+1.3; the transition from cache to placement redefines her goal), closure linkage (+1.4; the intern's discovery of the placed fragment completes the arc), cost (+0.5; she relinquishes sole control). Base 3.0 + 5.2 = 8.2. Specificity (+0.4; "to cache was to honor" distinguishes it from mere hiding). Minor swappability (−0.2; "gather" or "preserve" could substitute, though cache carries connotation of intentional burial). Final 8.0, lifted by the honor/resist erasure duality to 7.8 after rounding discipline. Corrected to 7.8.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Uncovering in pipe chases is signaled in paragraph eight ("her ritual, her archaeology of abandonment") and demonstrated in the discovery beat where her fingers snag the fragment. Setup (+0.5), one development beat (+0.4), mechanics matter (tracing ducts "like veins" and the tactile snag are specific; +0.6). No closure participation; the method does not return or shape the ending. Base 3.0 + 1.5 = 4.5. Causal pressure (+0.6; the method enables discovery). Irreplaceability (+0.3; the pipe-chase setting and methodical search distinguish it from casual finding). Lyric-resonance lift (+0.5; the ritual framing in paragraph eight and the closure's archaeology metaphor create a modest reprise). Final 6.4.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Shadowed library at dawn appears throughout: opening line, stained-glass windows, boiler room, rafters, circulation desk, microfilm reader, biography stacks. Setup (+0.7), three beats (dawn concealment, placement during prep, rafter observation; +1.4), causal pressure (+1.1; the library's pre-opening emptiness enables her unseen movements), closure linkage (+1.2; the biography-stacks perch frames her tears and the staff notice). Micro-setting (the microfilm reader) constrains the placement choice. Base 3.0 + 4.4 = 7.4. Specificity (+0.5; the library's archives and AV space are integral). Minor swappability (−0.3; another institutional space could serve, though the "Lost Oral Histories" fit is tight). Final 7.6.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>Timeframe "while the city's lights flicker after an unexpected outage" appears in paragraph five as a single atmospheric beat but does not constrain decisions or tighten the clock. The outage ends immediately ("trembling gloom"), and the dweller's subsequent actions occur "each morning before librarians arrived" and "that afternoon," untethered to the outage. Setup (+0.3 for late first third mention), zero development beats, no closure participation. Base 3.0 + 0.3 = 3.3. Ornamental use (−0.5; description without pressure). Swappability (−0.4; "at dawn" already covers timing). Late appearance in second act (−0.2). Final 2.2, but the "trembling gloom" moment primes her decision to act, lifting slightly to 3.1.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Motivation "to become visible to those who need you" is declared in paragraph three and dramatized through the shift from caching (paragraphs 17–18) to placing objects where they can be found (paragraphs 19–20), culminating in the tape placement and the dweller's tears at the staff notice. Setup (+0.7), three beats (declaration, placement shift, closure tears; +1.4), causal pressure (+1.4; the desire drives every placement choice), closure linkage (+1.6; the staff notice validates her need and she accepts partial visibility with cost), cost connection (+0.6; "not yet" defers full emergence, foreclosing immediate rescue). Base 3.0 + 5.7 = 8.7. Friction from want/fear balance being understated (−0.3; her fear of full visibility is implied but not viscerally felt in a peak moment). Final 8.4, adjusted to 8.3 for slight tell-heaviness in paragraph three.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Tone "sapphire hush" is named in paragraphs five and fourteen and sustained through "trembling gloom," "single battery-powered lantern," "tenderly positioned," and the dweller's tears. The tone modulates from reverent stillness to quiet elation without rupture. Setup (+0.6), coherence across beats (+0.8), closure charge (+0.9; "sapphire hush softened into gold" reweights the opening mood). Base 3.0 + 2.3 = 5.3. Static-mood friction (−0.4; the tone does not tighten or shift dramatically under pressure; the "gold" transition is gentle rather than escalating). Lyric-resonance lift (+0.6; the reprise in paragraph fourteen echoes and reweights the opening). Final 5.5, lifted by the purposeful dawn-to-gold arc to 6.1.</comment>
