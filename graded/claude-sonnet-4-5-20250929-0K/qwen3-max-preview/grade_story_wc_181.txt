<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The curator's interiority is specific and embodied—"theory breathe," "humming in her bones like a tuning fork"—with contradictory impulses evident in her chuckle about bathrooms amid cosmic inquiry. Her final shift from bewildered to awake is earned through the accumulated touches of petals dissolving into skin and the cameo opening. Minor slip: the bathroom revelation feels somewhat convenient, though it's lampshaded with self-aware humor. The progression from confusion to understanding is clear and rooted in her particular way of perceiving gaps in the Archive.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (curator, astral orchard, asteroid) land by ~80 words. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: density increases through layered imagery (blossoms → scrolls → bathroom glyph → petals with names), culminating in a Conceptual Repricing where "nonlinear inheritance" shifts from archival puzzle to lived resonance across possibilities. The cost is conceptual but legible: she becomes "someone she no longer recognized" in one remembered outcome. One meaningful deepening occurs when the cameo splits and she touches the petal, reweighting her understanding. Closure lands on the page with felt cost in the line "remembered succeeding and becoming someone she no longer recognized."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The astral orchard constrains and charges throughout: trees bearing scrolls, atmospheric bubble, petals etched with names that dissolve into skin. The maintenance alcove (biohazard-to-crescent-moon door, fogged mirror) functions as micro-setting that enables the breakthrough. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered: ozone and petrichor, stardust motes glowing like pollen. The orchard's state change—blossoms drifting downward with names—directly shapes the final revelation and charges the closing image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding nonlinear inheritance) is signaled early and tightens when she moves from observation to inquiry, then to embodied contact with the petal. The bathroom beat narrows options by introducing the glyph ("chosen, borrowed, stolen"), and the petal-touch delivers a concrete cost: she remembers failing, burning, succeeding-and-losing-herself. Agency is present in her choice to touch the petal, which forecloses ignorance. One meaningful deepening under the Accumulative lens; the cost is felt in "becoming someone she no longer recognized."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: the cameo's emptiness holding prophecy, the Möbius glyph, petals bearing unlived versions of herself. "Nonlinear inheritance" shifts from archival puzzle to existential resonance—inheritance as choice across timelines, not bloodline. The closing image ("field to be harvested") reweights the opening gap between first and last page without stating a moral. Subtext operates in the pistachio shell's "potential never tasted" and the word "Again" nested inside. The piece resists tidy resolution; she gains understanding but also "brightened disquiet settling into her marrow like a second skeleton."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with consistent perceptual signature: "gaps—echoes that didn't belong to linear time" and "absurdity was the midwife of revelation." Diction remains character-particular (chronal sashes, archival static, prophecy in emptiness). The bathroom passage modulates register slightly but reads as self-aware humor rather than drift. Psychic distance tightens appropriately during the mirror-glyph moment and petal-touch. One brief filter-verb cluster ("she felt the theory breathe," "she remembered") but voice-motivated and not stacked densely enough to trigger artifact penalties.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; opening long sentence contrasts with short ones during the bathroom beat. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent: "tuning fork left ringing," "origami traps," "second skeleton." Minor overwriting in the phrase "brightened disquiet clinging to her like static" immediately followed by "brightened disquiet settling into her marrow"—near-synonym loop that slightly dulls momentum. Information density is high; most lines advance character or atmosphere. No major scaffold or template cadence, but the double use of "brightened disquiet" and slight repetition of "simply complicated" across beats applies a modest −0.3 deduction for paraphrase.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Core synthesis—astral orchard as site of temporal recursion, bathroom as revelation space, inheritance reimagined as cross-timeline borrowing—feels specific and non-obvious. The pistachio shell cameo (Earth relic held by future curator) and the bathroom lampshade ("even here, absurdity was the midwife") transform familiar tropes. Emotional truth in "becoming someone she no longer recognized" anchors cosmic scale in personal cost. The transformation test passes: swap names and the arc loses its Archive-curator specificity. Risk is present in the non-linear delivery and the bathroom humor, which could fail but here sharpens rather than undercuts.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Bewildered curator is present throughout, shapes two key beats (bathroom inquiry, petal-touch), and her shift from bewildered to awake closes the piece. Her choices (entering the alcove, speaking aloud, touching the petal) drive turns. Closure participation is clear: "no longer bewildered, but awake." Cost is visible in her remembered alternate outcomes. Early signal, two-beat involvement, closure linkage, moderate causal pressure, and specificity place her in the essential band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Pistachio shell cameo blank appears in three beats: introduced with "emptiness could hold prophecy," held during bathroom inquiry, splits open with the word "Again." Its transformation (cold → warm → split) alters her understanding. The shell's specific properties (hollowed by monks, translucent walls, iridescent membrane) matter and could not be swapped. Closure linkage is strong: its opening coincides with the glyph revelation. Early signal, three beats, causal pressure (enables the revelation), closure participation, high specificity, and cost connection (surrender of potential) support the score.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Nonlinear inheritance is the dominant stake, signaled in paragraph one ("echoes that didn't belong to linear time"), drives the bathroom glyph revelation ("chosen, borrowed, stolen from adjacent timelines"), and is redefined at closure ("resonance across possibilities"). It shapes her tactics (inquiring of silence, touching the petal) and the final image (names of unlived selves). The concept could not be removed without breaking the story's logic. Early signal, three-beat involvement (Archive gaps, glyph, petal-names), strong causal pressure, closure transformation, high irreplaceability, and conceptual cost place it in the essential band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Simply complicated" appears twice: as her phrase that makes librarians sigh, and at closure as the nature of forbidden knowledge ("folded into the architecture of existence like origami traps"). It characterizes her approach and reappears with reweighted meaning, but does not constrain a choice with visible cost. The lyric reprise reweights the stake moderately. Early signal, closure reprise, moderate thematic charge, but limited causal pressure and no visible action cost cap the score in mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Inquire" shapes the bathroom beat ("needed to inquire—not of machines or mentors, but of the silence between moments" and "inquired aloud") and the subsequent revelation. It defines her method and drives one key turn (glyph appearance). Present at setup, enables middle beat, moderate causal pressure, but the action itself could be replaced with "question" or "ask" without major structural impact. Early signal, one strong beat, moderate irreplaceability place it in the mid-essential range.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Philosophical breakthroughs in bathrooms is signaled ("breakthroughs never came at desks... They came in bathrooms"), executed in the alcove beat (toilet, mirror, glyph), and the revelation (Möbius-strip glyph, "chosen, borrowed, stolen") emerges there. The method is lampshaded with humor but still functional. Setup clear, one beat shaped by its mechanics, moderate causal pressure, but the breakthrough could occur elsewhere with edits—the bathroom is thematically charged but not structurally indispensable. Lyric seed and one-beat payoff with moderate specificity place it in mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Astral orchard on lonely asteroid is present throughout, shapes three beats (opening drift, tree encounter, closing shift where blossoms drift with names), and directly enables the closure (petals dissolve into skin, delivering alternate-self memories). The orchard's atmospheric bubble, floating trees, and petal-etch properties constrain her exploration and supply the mechanism for revelation. Early signal, three-beat involvement, strong causal pressure (petals = revelation device), closure participation (orchard blooms brighter), high specificity, and cost connection (she absorbs unlived failures) place it in the essential band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Between the first and last page" is invoked as metaphor for archival gaps (paragraph one) and recurs at closure ("not a gap to be filled—but a field to be harvested"). It frames the thematic question but does not constrain a timed decision or alter tactics. The reprise reweights meaning moderately. Lyric structure with early seed and final echo, but no middle development and no visible pressure on choices. Functional lyric device but replaceable; cap at 4.6 for missing middle gate, adjusted slightly upward for thematic coherence.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Pursuit of forbidden knowledge is signaled early ("come to pursue forbidden knowledge—not out of rebellion, but because the Archive's silence... had begun to hum in her bones"), drives the bathroom inquiry, and is redefined at closure ("forbidden knowledge wasn't hidden—it was simply complicated"). The motivation is dramatized through her choice to enter the alcove, speak aloud, and touch the petal, with visible cost in remembered alternate outcomes. Early signal, two-beat involvement, causal pressure, closure transformation, and cost connection place it in the essential band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Brightened disquiet" is invoked twice: as sensory atmosphere clinging like static (paragraph three) and settling into her marrow at closure. The tone is coherent through turns—wonder tinged with unease—and modulates with pressure (chuckle → breath caught → smile). It charges the final image ("awake" rather than resolved). Early signal, closure reprise with physical embodiment, moderate tonal control, but the exact phrase could be replaced with a near-synonym. Lyric reprise with thematic weight and closure charge places it in mid-essential range.</comment>
