<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is stated rather than tested under pressure. The eclipse scene shows her singing and offering the curl, but no internal contradiction or meaningful choice emerges—she acts smoothly within her established role without visible cost or foreclosed path. The little girl and others join, but their presence doesn't force Elara to confront competing impulses or alter her stance. Therapy-speak intrudes ("nurture lifelong wonder," "softly adaptive") without embodied tension.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The eclipse arrives as coincidence and provides spectacle but not causal pressure. Elara's actions (singing, showing the curl) do not narrow options or test her mission; the gathering happens to her rather than because of her choices. The ending image (curl in the girl's palms, humming as she walks away) offers a mood but no decisive change or visible cost—no path is foreclosed, no stance crystallized. Orientation is clear early, but the closure lacks felt consequence under any lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Sage Ridge is anchored with sensory detail (moss, junipers, crushed sage, cedar) and the setting frames the gathering effectively. However, the environment does not constrain Elara's choices or alter tactics—it remains a backdrop. The curl rests in her palm and later in the girl's hands, but spatial choreography and object handling are static description rather than pressure points. Micro-setting (body, tool, recurring object) does not charge the final image with consequence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake ("nurture lifelong wonder") is declared but never tested on the page. The eclipse complicates the scene but does not escalate Elara's internal or external conflict; she responds with ease, singing without friction or trade-off. No reversal narrows options, no tightening forces a choice with visible cost. The gathering's participation feels passive convergence rather than earned escalation driven by protagonist agency.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through image and motif (curl, lullaby, eclipse, "ordinary magic"), avoiding overt moralizing until the final paragraphs where "joy, when nurtured softly, adapts" edges toward prompt-like articulation. The piece resists binary resolution and invites reflection on wonder and presence, but the final image (humming as she walks away) does not reweight prior material with a non-literal answer—it restates the mission rather than transforming it. Subtext operates in gesture and silence during the gathering, but the protagonist's arc lacks friction to charge the thematic question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>POV is stable, focalized through Elara without head-hopping. Voice carries a distinct lyric texture ("slow tides," "velvet pause," "link by link") and diction remains consistent with her interiority. However, elevated register ("etched with lichen runes," "coiled like a sleeping vine") pervades even high-pressure beats without modulation, creating textural density that slows momentum. Dialogue (the girl's whisper, Elara's reply) is brief and functional, carrying subtext without clutter. Perceptual signature is present but uniform across emotional shifts.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Figurative language saturates most sentences ("bowl-shaped hollow," "dissolve into the soil," "a vow," "fragile moment"), creating density without corresponding propulsion—many images repeat thematic claims rather than advance causality. Template cadence appears in the eclipse sequence: "She didn't stand. / Didn't explain. / She simply began..." and later "one by one, others joined" structures. Paraphrase loops: "not for grief, but as an anchor" echoed by "I kept it to remember how small wonders feel before we forget to look for them." Rhythm varies but often prioritizes lyricism over clarity at peak beats. Line-level artifacts deduct −0.8 in Q7 and disallow 9+ globally per the cross-cap.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The premise (music therapist nurturing wonder during an eclipse) follows a recognizable template without transformation through specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. "Ordinary magic" and "softly adaptive" read as prompt labels rather than irreplaceable synthesis. The curl's transfer and the gathering's silence offer a fresh inflection, but Elara's smooth execution avoids bold risk or constraint that would heighten stakes. Emotional specificity is present in gesture, yet the arc's shape (arrival, spectacle, convergence, departure) feels familiar without surprise in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her profession frames her actions (tuning lyre, singing lullaby, offering the curl). However, her choices do not create key turns—she responds to the eclipse with ease, and the gathering's convergence happens around her rather than because of a difficult decision. Her role is signaled early and developed across beats, but she observes and facilitates without agency that narrows options or incurs visible cost. Setup, development, and closure participation are present, but causal pressure and cost connection are minimal.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The curl is introduced early (first pocket mention), handled twice (resting on her palm, then in the girl's palms), and returns in the final image with reweighted meaning (passed "from one tender keeper to the next"). It constrains one choice (Elara's decision to show it during the eclipse) and charges the ending by embodying the story's theme. Setup, development, and closure participation are clear, and the transfer adds specificity. However, the curl does not narrow options or incur a felt cost—Elara gives it freely without trade-off or renunciation.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Ordinary magic" is named explicitly ("This was ordinary magic—not lightning or levitation") and echoed thematically throughout, but it does not shape stakes or tactics on the page. The concept remains abstract assertion rather than a constraint or enabling condition that alters Elara's choices. It appears early and is woven through imagery, but its mechanics do not pressure the protagonist or change outcomes—it functions as theme claim rather than causal force.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Softly adaptive" is labeled in exposition ("Her plan was softly adaptive") and echoed in the ending ("joy, when nurtured softly, adapts to every step"), but it does not constrain or enable a specific on-page action with visible cost. Elara's approach is described as flexible, yet no scene shows her adapting tactics under pressure or paying a price for this trait. The attribute is present in setup and closure but remains label-only without embodied friction or trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Link" is invoked multiple times ("linking pulse to pulse," "link by link, moment by fragile moment") and the gathering itself enacts connection through song and shared stillness. The action shapes the eclipse scene and charges the ending image (the curl passed, the community's refusal to leave immediately). However, major turns do not trace directly to "link" as a causal force—the convergence is facilitated rather than driven by Elara's linking choices. Setup, development, and closure participation are present, but causal pressure and irreplaceability are moderate.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The eclipse arrives unplanned but becomes the scaffold for the climactic gathering. Its mechanics matter: the dimmed sky draws villagers, the "velvet pause" enables shared stillness, and the peak eclipse moment crystallizes the communal experience. Signaled at the turning point and shaping the entire second half, the eclipse constrains Elara's tactics (she sings in response to the sky's shift) and charges the closure by marking the boundary before light returns. Setup is mid-story but the element drives two beats (arrival, peak) and is essential to the ending's charge.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Sage Ridge is described with vivid sensory detail and anchors the setting from the opening line. However, the ridge does not pressure Elara's choices or supply resources that affect outcome—it remains atmospheric backdrop. The moss quilt, junipers, and hollow provide mood but do not constrain action or alter tactics. Setup is early, development and closure participation are present, but the setting's integration is thematic rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Beneath the hush of dreaming roots" appears in the opening and closing paragraphs as a lyric frame, but it does not function as a timeframe that tightens decisions. The phrase evokes mood and continuity rather than a temporal constraint or clock. The story's time is vague (the eclipse event provides a brief window, but "dreaming roots" itself does not shape tactics or escalation). Setup and closure participation are present, but the element is ornamental rather than mechanically active.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Elara's desire "to nurture lifelong wonder" is stated explicitly in exposition and motivates her presence at Sage Ridge. However, it is not dramatized through conflicted choices or friction between wants and costs—she acts smoothly within her mission without obstacle or trade-off. The motivation frames her actions (tuning lyre, singing, offering the curl) and is present from setup to closure, but it remains told rather than tested under pressure. Functional but not charged with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The tone blends lyricism with gentle forward momentum, coherent across the piece but lacking modulation under pressure. "Cautious exuberance" is implied in Elara's smile when the eclipse arrives and in the gathering's quiet joy, but the narrative maintains a uniform register even at the peak beat—no acceleration or restraint that charges the final image. Setup and closure participation are present, but the tone is static mood rather than a dynamic force that reweights stakes.</comment>
