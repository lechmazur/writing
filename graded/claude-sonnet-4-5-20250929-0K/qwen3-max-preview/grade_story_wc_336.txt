<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elira's motivation is clear and emotionally grounded—she "could not bear a world without that shimmer"—but her interiority remains static and leans on elevated abstraction rather than embodied contradiction. The weaving scene demonstrates agency through micro-choices (selecting memories, tracing arcs), yet emotional progression is smooth and affirmed rather than conflicted; no genuine mistake or renunciation forecloses a path with visible cost. Backstory fragments (grandmother's lullaby, first kiss, apprentice's graft) anchor present action but inflate to near 25% without creating friction or a pivot that alters her stance on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a pattern of layered essence-weaving that culminates in the seed's opening—a Resonant Reconfiguration (the parapet seam seals, wonder anchors in this world). Orientation is swift (Elira, parapet, waterfall, dawn), and the lens holds through accumulation of memory-filaments into closure. However, cost is conceptual and atmospheric ("worlds sigh in relief") rather than a visible forfeiture or tactical change that narrows Elira's options; the seed's success feels destined rather than hard-won, weakening the felt price required for higher bands.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The verdant parapet beside the waterfall constrains the weaving (a seam where worlds whisper), and the spatial threshold directly enables the essence-capture that cracks the seed. Sensory detail—moss that "sighed," mist on skin, waterfall's breath—is vivid and filtered through Elira's reverent focus. The body and seed function as micro-setting, charging the final image when the tendril curls around her wrist and she tucks it against her ribs, grounding wonder in tactile presence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: preserve the color of wonder by succoring the seed. The weaving sequence tightens through accumulation (lullaby, kiss-arc, rain-scent) until the seed cracks, a meaningful deepening under the Accumulative lens. Yet no live choice forces a trade-off; Elira's actions proceed unobstructed, and the resolution arrives through her technique without visible sacrifice or complication. The hush and tendril-pulse register transformation but lack agency-driven escalation or a price that alters her tactics.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme—wonder as a perceptual color at risk of erasure—emerges from the seed's mechanics and Elira's woven essences without overt moralizing. The final image (seed glowing at dawn, parapet seam sealing) offers a resonant, non-literal answer rooted in particulars. However, thematic weight leans on abstraction ("the hue of awe," "radiant hush made audible") that borders on allegory without grounding in a conflicted moral calculus or earned ambiguity; the ending affirms rather than reweights prior material with tension.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Elira; perceptual signature ("insatiably creative, not in the way of painters...") and elevated diction ("lullaby between realms," "tissue-thin veil") are consistent and voice-motivated. Psychic distance modulates purposefully during the weaving ritual. Register occasionally drifts toward poetic abstraction ("vibration of awe that stirs in a soul") that edges beyond Elira's grounded pruner idiom under peak pressure, and no dialogue tests subtext or advances plot.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and figurative language is lush ("moss that sighed with ancient memory," "filament—shimmering, supple, alive"), but density of metaphor in nearly every sentence risks overwriting without pattern-taught payoff. Paraphrase loops appear: "not with soil or sun, but by capturing essence. Essence of joy. Essence of surprise" repeats the concept across adjacent lines without added pressure. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes cleanly, and no grammatical errors obscure meaning, but the elevated texture becomes uniform rather than modulating with urgency.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The seed-of-wonder premise and essence-weaving method synthesize fantasy tropes (last seed, world-veil) with lyric specificity (iridescent veins, memory-filaments). Yet the core remains a familiar savior-steward arc without a non-obvious moral calculus or risk that heightens stakes; Elira's technique succeeds as expected, and the transformation hinges on poetic atmosphere rather than a turn that grows from prior constraint. The "color of wonder" abstraction, while striking, trends toward allegorical convenience.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Elira appears in setup, decides to weave essences (middle choice), and tucks the seed into her tunic at closure. Her pruner identity frames expectation but does not constrain the weaving action with a visible cost tied to her craft; the role is more thematic anchor than causal driver.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The heirloom seed is cupped in Elira's palm (setup), cracks and unfurls a tendril during the weaving (middle beat), and is tucked against her ribs at closure—three distinct beats with evolving state. Its obsidian-and-blue veining and faint pulse are irreplaceable specifics, and the closure image (glow answering dawn) is charged by its presence. The seed enables rather than complicates, limiting higher score.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Weaving between worlds is declared (child from the Between, parapet as seam, veil thinning) and shapes the setting's threshold logic, but the weaving itself remains internal and atmospheric—memory and melody, not a tactical negotiation of realms. The concept echoes thematically without constraining Elira's options or forcing a visible cost tied to crossing.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Insatiably creative" is asserted in exposition ("not in the way of painters or poets, but...") and demonstrated through the weaving ritual (selecting and distilling memories). Yet the trait does not force a tradeoff or mistake; her creativity succeeds smoothly without friction, making it a label that colors action rather than constraining choice with cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Succor frames the entire weaving sequence (nourish, shelter, sing to the seed by capturing essence) and is present at closure when she tucks it safely and descends. The action is signaled early, drives the middle ritual, and shapes the ending. Swappability test: the mechanics (essence-capture rather than soil/sun) are specific, but the emotional arc could function with other nurturing methods, capping score below 7.5.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Capturing essence is signaled ("not with soil or sun, but by capturing essence") and enacted through the weaving of memory-filaments (lullaby, kiss, rain-scent). The method shapes the middle beat's mechanics and enables the seed's opening. However, the essence-capture itself arrives as technique rather than a contested choice; its mechanics are atmospheric (distilled emotion becomes filament) without visible cost or friction tied to the capture process.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The verdant parapet beside the waterfall is present in setup, enables the weaving (a seam where veil is tissue-thin, waterfall's roar softens), and reappears at closure when the seam seals. The setting's threshold properties constrain the action (essence-weaving must occur here) and charge the ending. Specificity (moss, mist, roar-to-murmur shift) is strong, lifting score into the 6-band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Upon the hush of budding hope" frames the opening and is reprised ("upon the hush of budding hope" in the weaving paragraph and "radiant hush" as the climactic state), but the timeframe remains poetic anchor rather than a live clock. Dawn arrives at closure, but no ticking urgency tightens Elira's choices; she "simply sat" and "rose, slow as sap rising," indicating no time pressure that alters tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The motivation "to preserve the color of wonder" is dramatized early (children forgot how to gasp, adults stopped looking up) and drives the weaving sequence. Elira's choices (selecting joyful memories, shielding the seed) enact the desire. Yet the motivation proceeds without internal friction or competing want; her commitment is total and uncontested, limiting the felt cost tied to preserving wonder versus another value.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Radiant hush is established through diction (reverence made audible, waterfall's murmur, birds holding songs) and modulates during the weaving ritual (from roar to stillness to the seed's pulsing glow). Tone coheres across beats and charges the closure image (dawn's ray answered by the seed's glow). The elevated register is consistent but static; under peak pressure the tone affirms rather than tensing, capping score in the mid-6s.</comment>
