<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The revolutionary's interiority is concrete and embodied—"fingers tracing the crystal vase shard like a rosary of regrets"—and his arc from militant to mourner to translator is causally grounded. Internal contradiction surfaces when he shifts from burying the old order to exhuming it, though the transition feels more declared than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. Dr. Voss arrives late and her presence accelerates the ending, but her own interiority remains thin; the final weeping and "shared awe" edge toward label-only emotion rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through discovered glyphs, the superstition-turned-method of covering mirrors, and the collaborative transcription, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant: he accepts that the real rebellion is "against forgetting"). Orientation anchors clearly by the opening paragraph (who, baroque asteroid salon, post-visible-time epoch). The closure lands with felt cost ("alive, not in triumph, but in translation"), and the haiku reprise reweights prior material. One meaningful deepening is present, though Voss's unannounced arrival and immediate validation feel slightly convenient.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The baroque asteroid salon is vividly realized—"marble veined with fossilized starlight," comet-tail silk drapes—and the setting constrains choice: covering mirrors creates "pockets of stillness" that enable the glyphs to stabilize, directly shaping the breakthrough. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (chrono-winds, violet/gold time-streams), filtered through the protagonist's priorities. The crystal shard functions as micro-setting, charged in the opening and returning to project glyphs at closure, meeting the 9+ quick test for constraint and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: reimagining a lost civilization from fragments, with the academic dispute as secondary pressure. The protagonist's method—covering mirrors during storms—emerges from superstition, is tested, and proves effective, narrowing his approach and enabling the breakthrough. One meaningful tightening occurs when Voss validates the glyphs' resonance, forcing a shift from solitary mourning to collaborative transcription with visible emotional cost ("wept—not for loss, but for possibility"). The final image reweights the stake under the Accumulative lens, though Voss's arrival feels somewhat convenient.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the protagonist's shift from militant revolution to curatorial rebellion, crystallized in "the real rebellion was against forgetting." The covering-mirrors motif accrues pressure without being forced, and the haiku fragments serve as micro-reckonings rather than decorative inserts. The final image—"alive, not in triumph, but in translation"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of how to honor lost ideals. No overt thesis statements; complexity remains intact, though the phrase "quieter and more vital" edges toward authorial commentary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Narrative distance is stable third-limited with strong perceptual signature ("sonnets to dust motes," "ghost-letters from a language no one remembered"). Diction is elevated and baroque-adjacent, fitting the setting and the protagonist's poetic inclination. However, clusters of abstract or elevated phrasing—"burnished sorrow," "reimagining of an entire civilization"—occasionally drift into essayistic register during peak beats. The single line of dialogue from Voss ("You're not mad… mourning in a language the universe forgot how to speak") lands cleanly and advances plot, but her voice is not tested enough to distinguish from the narrator's.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is high, with many sentences doing double duty (e.g., the opening line establishes character, setting, and tone). However, several figurative stacks appear in close proximity—"ribbons of visible time, violet and gold currents flowing like liquid memory"—without pattern-teaching, and the haiku insertions, while thematically motivated, interrupt momentum in the middle third. Template cadence surfaces in repeated clause structures ("not by choice, but by…"; "not to restore, but to reimagine"), and the phrase "academic guilds dismissed him as a romantic" uses generic diction where specificity would sharpen. Minor paraphrase loops: "barricades fell" / "failed his revolution" restate without added pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of defunct revolutionary + archaeological fragment + visible time-streams + mirror-covering superstition feels fresh and non-obvious, earning points for conceptual integrity and specific world logic. The transformation of mirrors from reflective surfaces to "time echoes" that must be veiled is a purposeful inflection that grows from prior particulars. Risk-taking in the baroque prose and haiku structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. However, the emotional arc—militant to mourner to translator—follows a familiar redemption template, and the phrase "reimagining an entire civilization" echoes writing-prompt abstraction without fully grounding the stakes in lived detail.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The defunct revolutionary is present from the opening, drives the devising of the mirror-covering method (middle beat), and his final realization ("hadn't failed his revolution; he'd merely fought the wrong war") shapes the closure image. His choices—shifting from storming barricades to covering mirrors, from solo research to collaboration with Voss—create key turns with visible cost (solitude, prior certainty). The weeping and shift to "translation" are anchored in prior causality. All three gates satisfied; causal pressure and closure linkage strong.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The crystal vase shard appears in the opening ("fingers tracing"), returns in the breakthrough beat ("caught the ambient glow… refracted it into trembling glyphs"), and is explicitly present at closure ("Beneath the crystal shard's glow, the ceiling bloomed"). Its specific property—refracting time-streams into glyphs—is irreplaceable and drives the discovery. Three distinct beats, closure linkage strong, causal pressure evident. Specific cost: the shard's origin (royal vase shattered during the siege) ties the protagonist's violent past to his present curatorial work.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The archaeological dispute is mentioned in the opening third ("scholars and scavengers alike quarreled over shards") and briefly recurs near the end ("The archaeological dispute would rage on"), but it remains background texture rather than on-page pressure. The protagonist's goal to decode glyphs is personal/thematic, not a tactical response to rival academics. No choice is constrained by the dispute; it's told rather than dramatized. Setup present, middle development absent, closure participation weak (cameo mention only).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Poetically inclined" is signaled early ("whispered sonnets to dust motes," "each metaphor a tombstone for ideals") and the haiku composition is an on-page action. The trait constrains his method—he documents findings "in haiku scrawled on silk scraps" instead of technical notation—and the final haiku reweights the closure. However, the cost is oblique: his "aesthetics over evidence" draws academic dismissal, but this friction doesn't visibly alter his tactics or force a trade-off. Setup and closure present; middle development weak.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Devise" is signaled in the breakthrough beat ("He'd spent three lunar cycles devising a method to decode them") and the method—covering mirrors—is the pivot that enables the glyphs to stabilize and the collaboration with Voss to succeed. The action is not easily swappable; removing it would collapse the causal chain. However, the devising itself is summarized ("three lunar cycles") rather than dramatized in real-time pressure. Setup and payoff strong; beat involvement spans two major moments.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Covering mirrors is introduced in the middle third as superstition ("a folk remedy from his grandmother's tales"), tested and validated ("when reflective surfaces were veiled, the distortions lessened"), and enacted at closure ("they covered every mirror in the salon with velvet drapes"). The method's mechanics matter—mirrors "echo time, multiplying its fractures"—and the action enables the climactic transcription. Three beats, causal pressure high, closure participation direct. Irreplaceability strong; the mirror-covering is the hinge of the breakthrough.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The baroque asteroid is anchored early ("gilded ruin," "grand salon," "marble veined with fossilized starlight") and supplies the mirrors that must be covered and the ceiling that displays the glyphs. The setting's ornate, reflective surfaces are integral to the problem and solution. However, the asteroid itself doesn't pressure tactical choices beyond providing the physical space; it's vivid but not dynamically obstructive. Setup strong, closure participation indirect (the salon hosts the final act), middle development present but thin.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The timeframe "after time becomes visible" is signaled early ("the era after time became visible") and the chrono-winds complicate the protagonist's work by warping perception, forcing the mirror-covering tactic. However, the temporal logic remains decorative: visible time-streams are described but don't tighten decisions or create a live clock. The three lunar cycles of devising are told, not tracked on the page. Setup present, middle and closure participation weak; time exists as atmosphere more than constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The motivation "to reimagine an entire civilization" is stated early ("sought to exhume it—not to restore, but to reimagine") and drives his three-lunar-cycle effort, the mirror method, and the final collaboration. Friction surfaces when Voss arrives and validates his work, forcing a shift from solitary reimagining to shared transcription with visible emotional cost (weeping, "shared awe"). The final image ("alive, not in triumph, but in translation") reweights the motivation's meaning. Setup, development, and payoff all present; causal pressure and cost legible.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Tone of "burnished sorrow" is established from the opening ("rosary of regrets," "tombstone for ideals," "mourning in a language the universe forgot") and modulates under pressure: quiet melancholy in solo research, shared grief when Voss validates him, tentative hope at the storm's end ("felt, for the first time… exactly where he was meant to be"). The final image charges the tone with forward motion ("alive… in translation") without abandoning the elegiac register. Coherent across beats, modulates purposefully, payoff strong.</comment>
