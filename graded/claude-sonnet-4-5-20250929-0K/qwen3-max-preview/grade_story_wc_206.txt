<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The repairman's internal state is established through embodied guilt (the child who never smiled again) and his voice/actions shift under pressure (trembling hands, singing rather than mechanical repair). However, interiority frequently defaults to elevated register ("mourning the lie before it's even spoken," "the weight of honesty made manifest") that reads more like thematic narration than character-particular thought. The moment of singing to the box offers a concrete micro-choice, but the final weeping "not from sorrow, but wonder" risks label-speak at a pivotal beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density increases through layered metaphors (resonance chamber, covenant of rust, dancer's reformation) toward a final image where reclaimed light repels shadows. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration (the song doesn't stop, seeps into walls/bones) with felt cost (he carries the tune's weight always). However, orientation debt is present—"who" is established early but "where" (vaulted attic) and "when" (tonight/midnight approaching) require assembly across dispersed lines past the 120-word mark, and the causal chain between singing → chip glowing → dancer reforming → shadows defeated compresses multiple metaphysical moves without clear mechanics, risking opacity even under an accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The resonance chamber (copper pipes, glass bells) supplies sensory texture and the chamber "answers" his song with chimes, contributing to the Accumulative payoff. The stone chip and dancer function as micro-objects that constrain choice (chip wilts near dishonesty, forcing truth; dancer's reformation depends on embedded chip). Spatial choreography is mostly clear (workbench, windows, chamber walls), but the transition from attic space to metaphysical conflict (shadows at windows, light pooling at his feet) blurs physical grounding at the climax.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: reclaim stolen light by redeeming a lie. Pressure tightens when the chip wilts (sensing his dishonesty), forcing him to "tether the chip to something true"—a meaningful deepening. The cost is legible (he carries the song/weight forever, another box will arrive tomorrow), and midnight's approach supplies a clock. However, the escalation mechanism—singing a lullaby causes the chip to glow, which reforms the dancer's arm from "condensed resonance," which then repels shadows—relies on thematic logic rather than clear cause-and-effect under pressure, making the resolution feel more declared than fought-for.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme (truth through erosion, covenant of rust as revelation not decay) emerges from concrete particulars: the replaced music box, the wilting chip, rust as connection rather than corrosion. The final image—song seeping into walls, carrying truth forward—offers a resonant answer without moralizing. However, the penultimate paragraph ("not with tools, but with truth, not with force, but with resonance") edges into thematic summary, and the phrase "Tinkersong wonder—the kind that lives in mended things" in the final third articulates the premise label rather than letting the image carry it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>POV remains third-limited to the repairman; no head-hopping. However, diction frequently elevates beyond the focalizer's plausible lexicon under pressure: "sympathetic vibration," "condensed resonance," "oxidation," "covenant of rust," "tethering past to present, loss to lullaby, lie to redemption" read as authorial rather than character-particular perception. The phrase "Tinkersong wonder" appears twice as a concept label, and the final paragraph's litany ("the keeper of unsung melodies, the mender of silent sorrows") shifts into essayistic register at the story's most critical image.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout without pattern-teaching: "wilted... like a flower folding at dusk," "shadows grew teeth," "light pooled... like spilled mercury," "sunflower toward dawn," "heat haze over summer fields" cluster in adjacent beats, creating decorative layering rather than propulsion. Paraphrase loops appear: "He wasn't just fixing toys; he was restoring echoes, coaxing memory from metal" is immediately followed by "mending what isn't torn: the invisible fractures in melody." Template cadence in the final paragraph: "not with tools, but with truth, not with force, but with resonance... between breakage and song, between rust and revelation" stacks parallelism without advancing the image. The metaphor "shadows... claws scraping glass" then "light... unmaking, reducing them to mere absence" mixes vehicle (claws suggest physical, unmaking suggests ontological) without coherence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of music-box repair, philosopher's stone, and rust-as-covenant offers a non-obvious frame, and the specific lie (replacing a soulless box) grounds the redemption arc. The transformation of rust from decay to revelation provides a fresh angle on worn tropes. However, the climax—singing causes metaphysical reformation and light that defeats shadowy midnight—closely echoes template fantasy beats (song-as-magic, light-vs-darkness) without sufficient lived resistance to make the victory feel earned rather than thematically ordained.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Present from the opening line, the repairman's choices drive two key beats: pressing the chip to his chest (it wilts, revealing his lie) and choosing to sing rather than mechanically repair (triggers the resonance that restores the dancer). His past lie creates the central conflict, and his final acceptance of ongoing work ("Tomorrow, another box") crystallizes his role. The character is essential to causality and closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The chip appears in beat one (arrives sealed in wax), beat two (pressed to chest, wilts), beat three (glows brighter during song), beat four (embedded in dancer's chest, reforms her arm), and closure (pulsing in the dancer, song seeping into walls). It wilts near dishonesty and blooms near truth, narrowing the protagonist's tactical options and shaping the ending image. The object is causally indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Introduced in paragraph six ("covenant of rust, a pact that deepened with decay"), the concept is explained thematically ("Rust strips away pretense") and returns at closure ("by the covenant of rust"). However, it does not constrain an on-page choice; the protagonist sings and embeds the chip—actions that would work under many metaphors. The covenant functions as a thematic label rather than a rule that alters tactics.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The chip "wilts near dishonesty" in beat two, immediately after the protagonist presses it to his chest, forcing him to confront his lie. This visible reaction narrows his options: he cannot proceed mechanically; he must "tether the chip to something true." The attribute enables the middle turn and participates in closure (the chip "no longer wilting" once truth is restored). It shapes one key choice with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Tether" appears as a verb in the crisis beat ("He had to tether the chip to something true") and as a noun in the resolution ("threads... tethering past to present"). It describes the protagonist's goal but does not specify unique mechanics—singing and embedding the chip could be framed as "binding," "fusing," or "anchoring" with minor edits. The action is present and goal-linked but not irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Introduced early ("mending what isn't torn: the invisible fractures in melody") and returns at closure ("by mending what wasn't torn but forgotten"). The method is signaled as the protagonist's philosophy, but the actual repair—singing to remind the box, embedding the chip—does not mechanically differ from standard restoration. The phrase functions more as thematic frame than a tactic-shaping method.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The resonance chamber is introduced in paragraph two with concrete detail (copper pipes, glass bells) and actively participates in the climax: "The resonance chamber answered. Glass bells chimed in sympathetic vibration. Copper pipes hummed like cellos." This response enables the dancer's reformation and charges the final image (song seeping into pipes, walls, bones). The setting supplies the mechanism for closure and is causally essential.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Tonight" is established in paragraph four, "midnight was approaching" in paragraph ten, and "midnight struck" in paragraph seventeen, creating a loose clock. The timeframe tightens urgency (shadows attack at midnight) but does not visibly constrain the protagonist's process—he sings, embeds the chip, and the light repels shadows within the same beat. The clock is present but does not force a visible trade-off or alter tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The motivation ("To reclaim the light stolen by midnight") arrives with the philosopher's stone in paragraph five and frames the climax ("reclaimed the light stolen by midnight—not by force, but by fidelity"). The desire is stated rather than dramatized through conflicting wants, but it connects causally to the lie he must redeem and shapes his choice to sing. It participates in closure but without on-page friction between competing motives.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Tone is coherent and lyric throughout: elevated diction, metaphor-dense descriptions, and earnest emotional peaks ("he wept... from wonder"). The phrase "Tinkersong wonder" appears twice (paragraphs eighteen and twenty-four) as a concept label, reinforcing the tone at closure. However, the tone remains uniformly reverent without modulation under pressure—intensity rises but register does not tighten or shift, limiting dynamic range.</comment>
