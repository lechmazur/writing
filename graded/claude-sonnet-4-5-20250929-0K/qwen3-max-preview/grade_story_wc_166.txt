<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's interiority relies heavily on abstract, poetic declaration rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. Her exile and dance are asserted through elevated language ("vessel launching verses into the void") but we see no micro-choices that reveal competing impulses or genuine cost until the collapse. The final interaction with the child gestures toward change, but the decision to teach feels inevitable rather than earned through prior internal conflict. Motivation remains coherent but lacks the messy, contradictory texture required for higher bands.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece establishes a lyric pattern—dance as inscription, memory as rebellion—and the moonstone speck provides a concrete turn that deepens the dominant stake. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (the villagers' arrival reweights her exile from solitary to communal), but the cost remains largely asserted rather than viscerally felt on the page. Orientation is delayed (who/where/when unclear until ~150 words in; the "nostalgia ban" and "court choreographer" are introduced late), triggering a −0.3 penalty and capping Q3 at 7.0. The ending image of teaching the child reconfigures her stance, but the price—what she forfeits by returning to community—is more implied than dramatized.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The twilight garden is vividly rendered with sensory specificity (dew-laced moss, petals folding, velvet hush), and the moonstone speck functions as micro-setting that charges the closure. However, the garden itself remains largely atmospheric backdrop; it does not constrain her choices or supply resources that alter tactics. The lyric mode prioritizes texture over spatial choreography, which fits the lens but limits the setting's causal pressure. Because orientation debt was applied in Q2, this category is capped at 7.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving memory through dance against the nostalgia ban—is signaled early and sustained. The moonstone discovery provides one meaningful deepening that reweights her exile, and the final arrival of villagers shifts the social calculus. However, escalation under the Accumulative lens feels more asserted than dramatically tightened; the dance sequence is described in elevated language but lacks visible tactical choices or tradeoffs that narrow options. The cost of her action (bleeding feet, exhaustion) is mentioned but not leveraged to complicate her stance before the resolution.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme—memory as resistance, embodiment as protest—emerges organically from the dance and moonstone motifs without overt moralizing. The ending offers a resonant answer ("trust they'll catch you") that reweights exile from solitary to communal without stating a thesis. However, the cosmic verse conceit and "fledge" metaphor feel slightly abstract and under-dramatized; the piece gestures toward profundity through poetic language rather than earning it through fully specific, embodied particulars. The final image of the child holding wildflowers is evocative but risks sentimental convenience.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Voice is lush and lyric, with a consistent elevated register that fits the protagonist's identity as poet-choreographer. Psychic distance remains stable; no head-hopping. However, the prose occasionally drifts into stock poetic phrasing ("gravitational sighs and stellar sighs," "obsidian grace in every line of her face") that feels more decorative than character-specific. The child's single line of dialogue reads natural, but the protagonist's final speech ("To fledge, you must first learn to fall into the gaps") feels slightly writerly and thematically helpful rather than urgent. Perceptual signature is present but not deeply individuated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Figurative language is dense throughout, often appearing in consecutive sentences without clear pattern-teaching or payoff: "gravitational sighs and stellar sighs," "vessel launching verses into the void," "architecture of her scars." This creates textural richness but also reduces clarity and momentum, especially in high-pressure beats where the dance itself is described abstractly. Paraphrase loops appear ("not with reflected light but with stored resonance—a captured echo") and template cadence recurs ("each step was choreography, each sway a stanza"). These artifacts cluster across the piece, triggering cumulative deductions of approximately −1.2 and disallowing 9+ globally. Stock metaphor strings (tide, vessel, verse, glyph) and elevated diction ("obsidian grace," "velvet hush") occasionally feel generic rather than particular to this voice.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The premise—dancer-poet in exile from a nostalgia ban—offers a fresh conceptual angle, and the moonstone speck as mnemonic object is specific. However, the execution leans heavily on familiar poetic templates: rebellion through art, body as text, cosmic/universal stakes declared but not fully grounded. The dance-as-inscription conceit is evocative but risks abstraction; removing the specific ban and substituting another totalitarian edict would leave the emotional arc largely unchanged. The ending gesture (villagers with wildflowers, child asking to learn) feels archetypal rather than inevitable from prior particulars. Mid-band originality: present but not transformative.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The tide dancer identity is introduced early and frames her spontaneous cadence, but her skill does not drive key turns. The dance is described lyrically rather than shown as a series of choices; we do not see her adjust tactics or face tradeoffs within the choreography. The collapse and the decision to teach are outcomes, not decisions enabled by her dancer expertise. Present and thematic, but replaceable with another artistic identity.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The moonstone speck appears at midpoint, triggers an emotional surge, is pressed to her collarbone, fuses to her skin, and remains visible at closure ("permanent asterisk on her throat"). It drives one key beat (the memory surge) and charges the final image, satisfying setup, development, and payoff. However, its function is largely symbolic amplification rather than a constraint or enabling tool that alters her tactics. Strong lyric reprise but not indispensable to story logic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Elective exile is established early ("quiet severance from a society that feared memory's weight") and motivates her presence in the garden. It shapes the dominant stake—solitary preservation of memory—and the ending explicitly reweights it from isolation to teaching. However, the concept is more backdrop than active constraint; we do not see her navigate a choice between return and exile, or sacrifice one for the other on the page. Setup and payoff present; middle development weak.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Spontaneously anchored to the rhythms of lunar tides" is introduced early as a trait, mentioned again when the moonstone surges her inner tide, and implied in the final dance. However, it functions as poetic descriptor rather than a constraint or enabler with visible cost. We do not see her exploit this anchoring to achieve something or suffer a price for it. Label-only use trends low; present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Fledge" is the story's thematic hinge, named explicitly in the opening act ("to fledge—her body a vessel launching verses") and returned in the final line as instruction to the child. It frames the cosmic-verse ambition and the final turn toward teaching. However, the action itself is abstract; the piece does not dramatize what fledging entails beyond metaphor. Setup and payoff strong; causal development absent. Lyric reprise lifts it into mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Observing gaps—the hollows between breaths, the pause before birdsong, the negative space in leaf shadows" is introduced at the one-third mark and credited as her method for learning absence. The final speech echoes it ("fall into the gaps—and trust they'll catch you"). However, the method is told rather than shown in action; we do not see her use gap-observation to solve a problem or constrain a choice. Setup and payoff present; middle development weak.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The twilight garden is introduced in the opening line, sustained throughout as the sole location, and remains present at closure ("stepped into the twilight garden under stars"). It provides sensory texture (moss, petals, constellations) and charges the final image. However, it does not constrain her choices or supply resources that alter tactics; it functions as stage rather than active pressure. Strong setup and payoff; weak development. Lyric coherence lifts it slightly.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The nostalgia ban is mentioned early as backstory and establishes the world's stakes, but the timeframe "after the ban" does not tighten her decisions on the page. The "third waning crescent since her exile" anchors one beat, but time otherwise remains vague. The ban motivates her exile but does not create a live clock or deadline. Setup present; development and payoff weak.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"To pen a cosmic verse on mortal skin" is introduced early and sustained as her declared goal throughout the dance sequence. The collapse marks completion, and the final teaching gesture extends the ambition communally. However, the motivation is more asserted than dramatized in conflicted choices; we do not see her weigh competing desires or face a tradeoff between cosmic ambition and immediate need. Setup and payoff strong; friction weak.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Obsidian grace" is declared at the resolution ("obsidian grace in every line of her face") and the prose throughout maintains a lush, elevated, nocturnal tone that fits the twilight-garden setting. The tone is coherent and modulates slightly from solitary intensity to communal warmth at the end. However, it remains largely static across pressure beats; the dance sequence and collapse do not shift register or rhythm to reflect heightened stakes. Present and coherent, but does not charge the final image with a tonal turn.</comment>
