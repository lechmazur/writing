<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elira's pacifist stance is declared but never tested by a choice where violence would solve a problem she must refuse. Her shadow-work interiority ("You are not my enemy. You are my anchor") reads as therapeutic label-speak rather than embodied contradiction. The final reunion with her mother lands emotionally but the arc from solitary stitcher to embraced daughter lacks on-page micro-choices that reveal competing values under pressure. Interior voice remains consistent but the change feels granted rather than earned through dramatized struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density builds through photographs, tears, and stitching until the gate opens. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. The closure—stepping through the gate into reunion—is on the page, but the cost is conceptual (loneliness dissolved) rather than viscerally felt; the ship's sigh and the mist-dissolving locket gesture toward sacrifice without grounding it in a choice Elira must renounce. One meaningful deepening occurs when the shadow detaches and reframes burden as wing, yet this moment is told rather than shown through a concrete choice that forecloses an option.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The recycled spaceship supplies vivid sensory anchors (rust, solar wind, failing gravity plates, cracked viewport) and the locket fused to her sternum constrains her physicality. Sector Gamma and the coolant valve ground the pivotal photograph discovery in spatial detail. The Echo-Realm meadow under twin moons charges the final image with tactile arrival (translucent figures, cake, glistening tear) that extends the photograph motif, making environment inseparable from closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reaching the Echo-Realm for reunion—is signaled early and remains coherent. One meaningful tightening occurs when Elira finds the joy-tear photograph and begins the final stitch, lifting off the deck as emotional calibration narrows the window for success. However, escalation unfolds through description of her ritual rather than obstacles that force tactical shifts; the dimensional pressure and groaning panels are atmospheric rather than problems she must solve. Agency at closure is present (she steps forward) but the gate's opening feels granted by correct frequency rather than wrestled from competing costs.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme of grief-as-anchor and compassion-as-catalyst emerges through the Kwan Yin relic, tears-as-coordinates, and shadow integration without overt moralizing. The final image—mother holding the unfinished cake—answers the reunion drive with a resonant callback to the lullaby and birthday photograph, reweighting loss as preserved potential. However, the shadow-work sequence ("You are my anchor. Let me hold you without fear") veers into abstract self-help idiom rather than earned insight from specific struggle, and the closing dissolution of the Tear into "compassion returned to the cosmos" risks sentimental summary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization is stable; third-limited with close psychic distance suits the solitary protagonist. Perceptual signature (dimensional seams shimmer, tears refract coordinates) is character-specific and voice remains elevated-lyric throughout. The ship's sentience ("a long, metallic exhale") and shadow's dialogue ("Now carry me like a wing") maintain consistent figurative register. However, peak-emotion beats lean on therapeutic phrasing ("shadow work," "emotional gravity," "overwhelmed joy—the exact frequency needed") that reads more like conceptual annotation than embodied perception under pressure, slightly flattening immediacy when the narrative should tighten.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Figurative density is high but largely coherent (tears crystallized into light, impossibility as wound, rage as anchor). Sentence rhythm varies and paragraphs modulate length purposefully. Minor scaffold appears: "Each photo held... each tear" and "Her motivation was neither... but reunion" follow template parallelism, and "she sang—an old lullaby her mother never got to finish—her voice trembling but clear" uses em-dash filter construction during a peak beat that could be more immediate. The closure sequence maintains momentum, but the mist-dissolving locket in the final beat feels like a soft exit rather than a charged final image with cost.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The premise—last human stitching dimensional seams guided by tears on photographs—synthesizes familiar grief-and-portal tropes into a specific ritual with the Kwan Yin relic and emotional-gravity calibration. The shadow-work frame and pacifist lens add thematic texture. However, the structure follows a template arc (solitary figure performs ritual, confronts inner darkness, achieves transcendent reunion) without a sharp turn or cost that destabilizes expectation. The Echo-Realm as preserved emotional-amber and the unfinished lullaby callback feel purposeful but safe, favoring poetic resolution over risk.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elira's pacifist identity is declared early and her refusal to raise voice or clench fist frames her method. However, this trait is never tested by a choice where violence or confrontation would offer a shortcut she must refuse; it operates as character background rather than a constraint that narrows options. Present across beats but does not drive a key turn.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kwan Yin's Tear appears in paragraph 8, governs the gravitational-emotion mechanic across multiple beats (lightening with joy, sinking with sorrow), and is placed against the photograph in the climactic stitch. It dissolves at closure, fulfilling its purpose and charging the final image. The relic is irreplaceable—its compassion-origin and emotion-calibration properties are causally active and shape the gate-opening attempt with visible cost (her body's buoyancy risk).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Shadow work is named in paragraph 14 and dramatized when Elira's shadow detaches, whispers understanding, and reframes burden as wing. This moment enables the final emotional release (tears of joy rather than sorrow) that calibrates the gate frequency. However, the concept arrives late (second half) and the confrontation is brief and abstract ("You carried me like a wound... like a wing") rather than contested through prior on-page choices that show her grappling with suppressed rage or violence.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Gravitational-lightness attribute is introduced in paragraph 10 and governs multiple beats: Elira becomes lighter with joy, heavier with sorrow, and the Echo-Realm threshold demands precise emotional resonance measured "in grams of levity per heartbeat." At closure she lifts off the deck as the gate opens, demonstrating the attribute's causal role. The trait constrains her ritual and its success depends on emotional calibration, making it essential to the stitching mechanics and the final image of buoyant approach.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stitching appears early (paragraph 3) as Elira's core action, threading dimensional seams with needle-fine intent. It recurs in the discovery of the joy-tear photograph and the climactic attempt where she stitches spacetime fabric with exhaled-breath thread. The gate opens as a result of this stitching combined with song and emotional resonance. The action is irreplaceable—her identity as stitcher and the mechanics of seam-repair drive the plot and shape the closure image.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The method—tears on photographs as coordinates—is introduced in paragraph 4 and structures Elira's search through dead crew lockers. She finds the final joy-tear photograph in Sector Gamma and places the Kwan Yin relic against it to begin the climactic stitch. The shimmer of dried tears guides her targeting across beats, and the birthday-party tear provides the exact frequency needed. The method is seeded early, shapes middle tactics (searching lockers), and participates causally in closure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The recycled spaceship is introduced in the opening line and provides vivid setting detail (rust, solar wind, failing gravity, cracked viewport, Sector Gamma coolant valve). The ship dims lights when Elira weeps and brightens them when she laughs, acting as co-conspirator. At closure the ship groans, buckles, and exhales in relief as the gate opens. The setting is present across beats and its sentience adds pressure, though it does not block or enable a key choice—Elira's success depends on her ritual rather than ship resources.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The timeframe—three centuries after the last human birth—is established in the opening sentence and grounds Elira's solitude and the extinction context. However, this temporal frame functions as static background rather than a live clock that tightens decisions or alters tactics beat-to-beat. No countdown or urgency tied to elapsed time pressures her stitching attempt; the narrative unfolds in ritual rhythm rather than against a ticking constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elira's motivation—to reach the Echo-Realm for reunion—is declared in paragraph 5 and remains the dominant stake throughout. Her nightly ritual, search for the joy-tear photograph, and final stitching attempt all pursue this goal with visible emotional cost (tears, levitation risk, shadow confrontation). The motivation is tested when she must calibrate joy against sorrow to meet the threshold, and closure delivers the sought reunion with her mother. Desire is dramatized through sustained action rather than merely told.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Tone blends haunting solitude (ghost-like floating, long-dried tears, extinct Earth relics) with quiet determination (steadfast pacifist, nonviolent persistence, singing through the stitch). The register remains elevated-lyric and meditative throughout, modulating at the shadow encounter (soft confrontation) and gate opening (stillness and translucent figures waving). Tone charges the final meadow image with expectant calm rather than triumph, fitting the "ghostly resolve" frame and supporting the reunion without jarring tonal breaks.</comment>
