<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The bell tuner remains an archetype rather than a person—no contradictory impulses, no visible internal friction, only "infinitely patient" action. Her choices (strike fork, walk patterns, leave fork) flow from declared method rather than pressure that tests commitment. Interiority is entirely absent; we watch stylized gestures without access to doubt, cost, or trade-off. The piece treats her as an instrument of concept, not a character under stress.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece builds density through layered imagery (footsteps → ripples → flickers → embodied echoes) and lands a Resonant Reconfiguration when the tuner leaves the fork and the town "breathes" in shared balance. Cost is felt in her departure and the fork's abandonment, which forecloses her return. The orientation anchor is late (dawn, archway, Virelle named, but "who" remains cryptic past 120 words); apply −0.3. The accumulative method holds, and the closure image reweights "collapse" into "continuity."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Cobblestones, archway keystone, fountain rim, and the ebony fork function as micro-setting that constrains choices: the third cobblestone's precision, the fountain as final platform, the fork as fulcrum. Sensory detail is vivid and selective (moss-slicked, eyeless windows, choked chimneys, air-born rain). The setting charges the closure when roofs seal and gardens burst. Spatial choreography is clean throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake: restore shared balance between lost and echoing. One meaningful deepening occurs when windows flicker, children peek, and the town hums—moving from silence to presence. The tuner's agency is renunciation (leaving the fork) that forecloses return, with felt cost in her now-silent footfalls. No reversals test her commitment; the walk proceeds without obstacle or friction. Pressure accumulates via imagery rather than narrowed options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: rhythm as language, patience as reconstruction, shared balance between living and lingering. The fork left in the fountain and the final line's "next step, next note, next act" offer a resonant answer without stating a moral. Subtext operates in the children "never born" and elders woven from resonance. Minor slip: "infinitely patient" borders on abstraction and is declared rather than demonstrated through specific struggle.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Single-POV omniscient with stable third-person distance and a consistent lyric register. Perceptual signature is present (metronomic precision, the tuner's proprioceptive focus on vibration). Diction is elevated and purposeful, though occasionally drifts into abstraction ("frequencies," "disharmony," "continuity") that edges away from the tuner's embodied experience. No head-hopping; compression and elision are taught early and sustained. Psychic distance remains controlled.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully and figurative language is dense but mostly coherent. Two paraphrase loops: "not to prevent it, but to rebuild through it, to restore shared balance" restates the same idea across clauses; "Not resurrected. Not restored… But rebalanced—shared between" cycles synonyms without added pressure. Template cadence in the middle third: repeated "The + [noun] + [past tense]" openers across four sentences flatten propulsion. Apply −0.6 for loops and template runs. Information density is high, but scaffold phrasing ("simple, absurd, and absolute"; "infinitely patient") appears without dramatization.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of rhythmic tuning, ghost-town revival, and Earned Stasis via renunciation is specific and non-obvious. The image of footfalls tuning a town back into shared existence through cobblestone resonance is fresh. Risk: the piece commits fully to its lyric, accumulative mode without hedging. Slight deduction for "infinitely patient" as declared rather than cost-inflected trait, and the final paragraph's "next bell tuner" frame edges toward convenient symmetry.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Present early; drives three beats (striking fork, walking patterns, leaving fork); shapes closure by departure. Causal pressure is moderate—her choices enact method rather than navigate friction. Cost is felt in the final silent footfalls, but no on-page decision alters her course under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Signaled early (inner pocket, centuries worn); used in two beats (struck at archway, laid in fountain); charges closure as "fulcrum" and "silent conductor's baton." Its abandonment forecloses return. Specificity (ebony, thumb-worn, calibrated to memory) matters. Strong closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Frames stakes from the opening (Virelle "before the collapse"); shapes all tactics (tuning via footsteps to restore shared balance); drives closure when the town "breathes" in continuity. The concept is indispensable—remove it and the story collapses. Causal across all beats.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Declared twice ("infinitely patient," "patience the score") but not constrained by cost or friction. No on-page moment tests this patience or trades it against urgency. Label-only trait without dramatized choice or visible price.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Signaled early; enacted across multiple beats (walking spirals, crossing paths); drives closure when the rhythm finds counterpoint and the town hums. The act is irreplaceable—swapping "rebuild" for another verb would break the logic. Causal pressure and closure linkage are strong.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Introduced early (third cobblestone, metronomic precision); mechanics shape middle beats (spirals, sigils, crossing paths); drives closure when cobblestones hum within themselves. The specificity (heel striking, tempo, rhythm absorbed into pulse) is indispensable. Causal across beats and closure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Present at opening; serves as threshold and reappears at closure when fractures knit. The archway frames entry and exit but does not constrain middle choices. Closure linkage is clear (threshold to continuity), but middle development is thin. Two-of-three gates met; lyric reprise reweights meaning.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Mentioned ("before the collapse," "seven decades," "since 1893") but does not tighten decisions or alter tactics. The clock ticking backward-then-forward is ornamental. No live countdown or urgency test. Present but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stated early and enacted through walking, striking, leaving. The desire shapes all beats and closure (town breathes in shared balance). Friction is minimal—no on-page cost tests her commitment to restoration versus another want. Causal but not dramatized through conflicting pulls.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Established early ("wild hush," "held breath of anticipation") and modulates with pressure (thickening, humming, rain). Charges the final image ("wild hush remained… as presence holding its breath"). Coherent through turns and integrated with the accumulative rhythm. Strong closure linkage.</comment>
