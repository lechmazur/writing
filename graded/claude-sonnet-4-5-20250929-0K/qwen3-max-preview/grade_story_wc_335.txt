<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The archivist's motivation—to teach "how to hold broken things without cutting themselves"—is concrete and drives her combative pedagogy. Her walking backwards under stress embodies internal conflict, and the cartographer interaction shows micro-choices (sliding the tea cup, annotating margins) that reveal hierarchy of values. However, the reversible exile mechanism remains abstract; the threat that "the stacks may exhale her into the void" lacks embodied stakes that force a peak choice with visible cost on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: tea-leaf geometry, backward movement, and the trapped shadow accrete meaning until the cartographer's laugh signals closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration where mentorship succeeds and the exile holds. Orientation anchors (archivist, library rotunda, afternoon) appear early. The cost is felt but oblique: her continued isolation and the perpetual threat of exile. One deduction: the reversible exile's mechanics (three riddle-solvers restore her) are told in backstory rather than tested on the page, weakening the stakes' immediacy.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The library's spatial choreography is coherent (rotunda, skylight, eastern alcove, spiral staircase, western window), and micro-setting elements constrain choice: the trapped shadow pulses when she misreads, the swing's hush signals when "the library listens hardest," and tea cups anchor the pedagogy. The fractured skylight and shard-mirrors charge the final image of multiplicity. Occupational detail (archival annotation, vellum handling) grounds her expertise without excess.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—maintaining the reversible exile by correct tea-leaf annotation—coheres and tightens when the cartographer's leaves shift from siege spiral to branching delta, proving her method works. Her backward retreat and the shadow's containment verify the pressure. However, the exile's reversal condition (three independent riddle-solvers) never becomes a live test; the story stays within one mentorship cycle, so escalation reads as deepening rather than a narrowing choice with an on-page tradeoff that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme—resilience through missteps, combative care, holding brokenness without false wholeness—emerges from the tea-leaf method, the shard-mirror self-image, and the line "you must be the broken thing that teaches others how not to shatter." The cartographer's shift from despair to laughter offers a non-literal answer without moralizing. The playground swing annotation ("teach them to push it anyway") and the final compass line tie the pedagogical ethic to the closure image with quiet resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, with perceptual signature (topology over chronology, bergamot-stained oolong predicting rebellion) and diction that matches archival expertise ("vellum," "curvature of chamomile residue"). Dialogue is spare, goal-driven, and carries subtext: "Not what. Where." The two brief passages of backstory (exile history, prior annotation) anchor in present stimuli (the shadow's pulse, the empty swing) and tilt present stance. One slip: "combative tenderness" is named rather than fully embodied in rhythm at peak pressure moments.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Information density is high: "afternoon shadow caught in glass stretches diagonally across the marble floor—not cast, but trapped" does triple work (world rule, visual anchor, stakes seed). Rhythm varies purposefully, accelerating in the cartographer exchange, breathing in the staircase retreat. However, figurative language clusters densely in early paragraphs without pattern-teaching: "curl of bergamot-stained oolong predicting rebellion," "radial fracture of pu-erh signaling bureaucratic collapse" reads ornamental until the method pays off mid-story. Minimal loops; one template stem ("She walks backwards") recurs but voice-justified.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis—archival practice as divination, exile reversible by pedagogical success, mentorship via withholding rather than comfort—feels specific and non-obvious. Tea-leaf topology, the trapped shadow as exile gauge, and walking backwards under stress transform stock mentor/archivist tropes. The cartographer's laugh (finding process over destination) offers a fresh inflection. However, the "forgotten library as refuge" frame and the "broken mentor teaching brokenness" premise echo widely; transformation comes through method (tea geometry) rather than a bold structural or moral reversal.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The archivist's choice to slide the tea cup and annotate the cartographer's margin (37-degree line) enables his breakthrough, and her backward retreat to monitor the shadow demonstrates agency under exile threat. She appears in setup (opening walk), middle (tea-cup intervention), and closure (final backward walk, exile held). However, the peak decision—whether to risk misreading or withhold correction—is not dramatized on the page; her actions feel assured rather than forced by competing pressures with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The trapped shadow is seeded early ("afternoon shadow caught in glass...not cast, but trapped"), reappears when the archivist monitors its pulse mid-story ("the shadow in the glass pulses faintly, breathing"), and anchors closure ("The afternoon shadow caught in glass does not escape"). Its containment measures her success; if she misreads tea leaves, "the glass shadow may slip its frame." The object shapes tactics (backward monitoring walks) and charges the final image with the exile's persistence. One limitation: the shadow's mechanics (why trapped, how it breathes) remain atmospheric rather than causally leveraged in a tightening choice.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Reversible exile frames the stakes (she's "been exiled before," returned by three riddle-solvers) and the closure confirms it "remains reversible." The concept enables the tea-leaf method (misreading risks exile) and the mentorship motive (she hides riddles to engineer her return). However, the reversal mechanism never activates on the page; no seeker arrives mid-story to test a riddle, and the exile threat stays potential rather than imminent. The concept shapes background more than on-page tactics, landing it in the functional-but-not-indispensable band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Walking backwards appears in the opening beat (perimeter trace), recurs when she "turns away, walking backwards again—not retreat, but recalibration," and closes the story ("She walks backwards to her chair"). The trait embodies nervous vigilance and constrains her spatial movement (monitoring the shadow's edge while retreating up the staircase). Cost is visible: the backward posture limits forward engagement and marks her exile's precarity. However, the attribute never creates a tightening choice—no moment where walking backwards causes a misstep or prevents an urgent act—so it reads as characterization plus atmosphere rather than plot-critical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Annotation drives three beats: early (fingertip smudges on scrolls, calibrated to tea-leaf geometry), middle (the 37-degree margin line that bisects the cartographer's despair), and closure (adding beneath her prior note: "draw the line that holds it—not to cage, but to compass"). The action defines her method, enables the cartographer's shift, and resolves the exile test. Swapping "annotate" for "inscribe" or "mark" would lose the archival specificity and the marginal, non-authoritative stance central to her pedagogy. The action is indispensable to plot and theme.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Tea-leaf geometry is seeded in the first third ("curl of bergamot-stained oolong predicting rebellion, radial fracture of pu-erh signaling bureaucratic collapse"), applied in the middle beat (black tea "steeped too long, leaves settled in a jagged spiral resembling siege trenches"), and confirmed at closure when the leaves shift to "branching delta—possibility, not collapse." The method shapes the archivist's annotation tactic and the cartographer's breakthrough. However, the mechanics remain impressionistic; why a 37-degree angle matters or how bergamot curl predicts rebellion is asserted rather than demonstrated, limiting causal specificity.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The forgotten library supplies spatial pressure: the rotunda for backward pacing, the skylight and trapped shadow as exile gauge, the eastern alcove where the shadow pulses, the western window framing the swing, and the spiral staircase for monitoring. The Rare Cartographies aisle and whalebone-bound treatise anchor the final beat. The setting enables the pedagogy (reading desks with tea saucers, stacks as shelter, vellum and scrolls) and the closure image (fractured mirrors, the shadow contained). Removing the library's layout or the trapped-shadow mechanism would break the exile stakes and spatial choreography.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The timeframe "at the hush as an empty playground swing drifts" is invoked once mid-story ("At the hush...she halts. That hush...is when the library listens hardest") and echoed in closure ("The swing outside creaks, empty but swinging still"). The hush signals peak risk (when misreading could trigger exile), but the swing's motion does not tighten a deadline or alter tactics. The element reads as atmospheric marker rather than temporal constraint; no clock presses decisions, and the "afternoon" setting permits leisurely annotation and reflection without urgency.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Mentorship motivation is dramatized through withheld answers ("sharp corrections, withheld answers, challenges scrawled sideways"), the combative tenderness speech to the novice, and the tea-cup intervention with the cartographer. The goal—to teach resilience through missteps—drives her backward retreat (recalibration, not flight) and the riddle-hiding tactic for future return. Friction surfaces when the cartographer doesn't thank her ("Good. Gratitude is glue. She wants grit"), proving she values struggle over comfort. However, no on-page moment forces her to choose between immediate comfort for a student and long-term resilience at visible relational cost, leaving the motivation slightly under-tested.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Combative tenderness coheres through diction ("sharp corrections," "growls," "single line bisecting his despair") and rhythm (clipped imperatives, withheld warmth). The tone modulates under pressure: harsher with the novice who dropped a book, quieter with the cartographer ("voice low as settling dust"), and allows "one forward step—rare, deliberate" when his leaves shift to delta. The final image—"spine straight, eyes sharp, heart quiet"—balances steel and care. The tone charges closure by holding both edges without collapsing into either pure severity or sentimentality, making "combative tenderness" legible as lived stance rather than label.</comment>
