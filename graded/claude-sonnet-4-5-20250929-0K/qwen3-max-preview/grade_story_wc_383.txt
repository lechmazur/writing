<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's interior voice is distinct and voice-motivated ("charmed skeptic," "alchemy," "sovereignty"), with embodied moments ("dread pooling in her ribs," "vines curled gently around her ankles"). However, the piece leans heavily on abstract interiority ("geometries of grief, lattices of longing") that hovers near label-speak, and the final shift to "sovereign" reads more asserted than earned through a concrete prior struggle. Micro-choices (placing the shell, whispering the vow) are present but do not foreclose a legible path with visible cost—she arrives already resolved.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation is clear by the opening (who, where, when). The piece offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant: she chooses to archive rather than heal, leaving the shell as a node for others), but the cost remains abstract—no tactical option is visibly foreclosed, and the "before" stance is only told in reflection. Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the ending image (walking away at dawn) reweights the opening dread, yet the escalation is primarily mood-driven cadence rather than a causal tightening that narrows her choices on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The velvet garden at twilight is anchored early with vivid, selective sensory detail (petals that sighed, jasmine and damp earth, vines curling around ankles) and the willow functions as a micro-setting anchor for the shell's placement. The "last star fading" timeframe and the shell itself constrain her ritual sequence, and the final dawn light charges the closure image. Spatial choreography is clear (kneeling, temple, lips, moss at base of willow), and the setting subtly mirrors the protagonist's internal quarantine motif without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—archiving memory to translate isolation into independence—is signaled early and remains coherent. However, escalation is primarily a deepening mood and cadence shift rather than a causal narrowing: she arrives resolved, performs the ritual without opposition or reversal, and leaves. The shell's warming pulse offers a micro turn (it "offers" rather than "pleads"), but no live option is foreclosed with visible cost; the piece reads as a ceremony enacted rather than a choice forced under pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme (memory as architecture, isolation as sovereignty, fragility as resilience's first draft) emerges organically from the shell ritual and the garden setting, avoiding overt thesis statements. The final image—walking away with memories "turned into a compass"—offers a resonant answer without moralizing, and the recurring motif of "quarantined" memories evolves from locked-away pain to structured waypoint. The vow ("I remember you. I carry you. You are not lost. You are archived.") borders on thematic echo but is voiced as ritual speech and earns its place through the shell's harmonic closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature ("charmed skeptic," "alchemy," "fluency in its language") and purposeful lyric compression ("tragically radiant," "resonance structures"). Psychic distance modulates intentionally from close sensory detail to elevated metaphor. However, elevated register ("geometries of grief, lattices of longing, crystalline frameworks") pervades high-pressure beats without clear pattern payoff, and some constructions drift toward abstraction ("translate it," "resonance anchor") that risks obscuring the concrete ritual. No head-hopping; filter verbs are sparse and voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout ("sky bled indigo," "tragically radiant," "supernovas collapsing," "silver thread unraveling") with mixed coherence: "memories go to be quarantined" by "the soul's own mercy" is evocative, but "resonance structures" and "lattices of longing" veer toward abstraction in adjacent beats without on-page dramatization. Template cadence appears in the archive sequence ("She did not flinch. She cataloged. She labeled. She archived.") and near-paraphrase loops occur ("Not healed, not whole, but sovereign" / "not locked, not buried, but structured"). Information density is moderate; some scaffold ("This was her alchemy") could compress. No major causality breaks, but elevated diction in peak beats reduces immediacy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of "charmed skeptic" archiving memory through a whispering seashell in a velvet garden is specific and voice-driven, avoiding template plot. The "resonance structures" metaphor and the framing of grief as translatable data offer a fresh angle on memory-ritual stories. However, the core arc—character performs solitary ritual, achieves internal shift, leaves artifact for the next soul—is a familiar lyric-essay structure, and the transformation relies on assertion ("Her independence was not freedom from the past, but fluency in its language") rather than an on-page surprise that reweights prior material in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The charmed skeptic is present throughout and her choices (kneeling, placing the shell against her temple, whispering the vow, leaving the shell at the willow) drive all major beats and the closure. However, her stance is fixed from the opening—she arrives resolved to archive rather than heal—so the ritual enacts a pre-formed intention rather than forcing a turn under pressure. Two gates (setup, closure participation) are met; middle development is limited to deepening rather than decision.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The whispering seashell half is handled across multiple beats (found, placed against temple, whispered to, placed at the willow) and its properties (humming, salt-tongued secrets, warming pulse, harmonic surge) evolve and constrain the ritual sequence. It is present in the closure image as the waypoint anchor. Early signal is strong ("relic from a shore that no longer existed"), and its resonance-mapping function is specific to this story. Swappability is low; without the shell's voiced offering, the protagonist's vow and the final "node" placement would lack grounding.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Quarantined memory is signaled early ("memories go to be quarantined") and shapes the dominant stake: the protagonist seeks to "archive" what is "locked away not by force, but by the soul's own mercy." The concept recurs (the girl "quarantined too," "memories were safe now—not locked, not buried, but structured") and is thematically central. However, it primarily functions as metaphor and thematic frame; it does not constrain a tactical choice or force a reversal on the page. The cost is conceptual (isolation translated to independence) rather than a visible sacrifice.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Tragically radiant" is introduced mid-story ("The memories were tragically radiant") as a descriptor for the quality of her archived memories. It is label-only, explained in the following sentence ("not because they were beautiful, but because their glow came at the cost of everything that followed"), and does not constrain or enable an on-page action with visible cost. Missing setup gate (not present by the end of the first third) and no beat involvement beyond the single metaphorical claim.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Archive is the protagonist's stated goal ("She was here to archive") and the core action across all major beats: she catalogs, labels, maps memories onto her mental scaffold, and ultimately "archives" the girl she used to be. The final vow ("You are archived") and the shell's placement as a "waypoint" both derive from this action, and the closure image ("memories were safe now—not locked, not buried, but structured, translated, turned into a compass") reweights the opening dread through this lens. Early signal, beat involvement (temple, vow, placement), and closure linkage are all strong. Swappability is low; "preserve" or "remember" would not carry the same systematic, translational connotation.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Through resonance structures" is signaled at the shell-temple beat ("let the resonance structures inside her mind unfold—geometries of grief, lattices of longing") and shapes the archive method: echoes map onto nodes, illuminating sealed corridors. The final harmonic surge and the shell left "humming" as a "resonance anchor" tie the method to closure. However, the mechanics remain abstract—"resonance" is asserted but not dramatized with concrete cause-effect (e.g., what happens if she resists the resonance, or if the shell's hum fades). Middle development is thematic rather than tactical.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The velvet garden at twilight is anchored early and appears in every major beat (kneeling in the garden, vines around ankles, air smelling of jasmine and damp earth, willow base for the shell, iron gate at departure). It constrains the ritual spatially (willow as the quarantine site, moss as the cradle) and temporally (twilight to dawn bracket the sequence). The garden's "ghostly resolve" and "reverent sigh" modulate tone and charge the closure image. Swappability is moderate—another liminal natural setting could serve—but the "velvet" texture and "quarantine" connotation are specific.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The timeframe ("when the last star fades into morning light") is signaled early ("the last star above was fading") and tracked across beats: stars winking out, the last star's silver thread unraveling, horizon blushing gold, first birdcall, the last star's ghost dissolving. It tightens the ritual window and charges the closure image ("stepped beyond the garden's iron gate just as the horizon blushed gold"). However, it does not force a tactical choice under pressure—she completes the ritual at her own pace, and the dawn arrival feels ceremonial rather than a live deadline with cost.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The motivation "to translate isolation into independence" is present throughout ("This was her alchemy: turning solitude into sovereignty, translating isolation into independence") and shapes the dominant stake. It is dramatized in the vow and the departure ("not healed, not whole, but sovereign"), and the final image reweights isolation as "fluency in its language." However, the friction between isolation and independence is told more than shown—no on-page moment forces her to choose between connection and self-sufficiency. The cost is conceptual (enduring isolation) rather than a visible tactical sacrifice.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Ghostly resolve" is coherent across all beats: the garden's "ghostly resolve of those who'd sat here before," the shell's whispers that do not plead but offer, the protagonist's steady breath "despite the dread," her refusal to flinch, and the garden's reverent sigh after her departure. Tone modulates from dread to resolve to "completion" without false uplift, and the final "mercy" and "waiting" images maintain the ghostly timbre. It charges the closure by framing the departure as neither triumph nor defeat but as haunted persistence.</comment>
