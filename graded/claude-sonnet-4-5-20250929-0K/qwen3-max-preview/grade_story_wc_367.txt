<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The herald remains abstract throughout—no contradictory impulses act in scene, no micro-choices under pressure that reveal hierarchy of values. Interiority consists of poetic declarations ("Not chaos. Catalyst.") rather than embodied thought degrading under stress. The final gesture (blowing a kiss, waiting) reads as posture without visible cost or foreclosed path. Motivation is asserted in elevated register but never tested by a dramatized trade-off on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation Test penalty applied: who, where, when remain vague past 120 words; the "emerald lighthouse" and "storm herald" are titles without grounding detail until well into the piece. No decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing with visible cost occurs—she climbs, whispers, laughs, and waits in an unchanging cycle. The ending returns to the same routine without narrowing options or altering stakes. Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural in intent, but no cadence shift or pattern break reweights the dominant stake with cost at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Vivid sensory phrases ("salt-slick cliffs," "jade meteorite," "nest of storm feathers") anchor the tower setting with distinct texture. The glass lantern wick is handled and returns with thematic weight at the ending, charging the final image. However, environment does not constrain a choice or alter tactics—the setting remains postcard-vivid without forcing a trade-off. Micro-setting qualification (body/tool/recurring object) is partially met by the wick's reappearance but does not reach the 9-band threshold.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>One dominant stake (steering the world's dreaming edge) is signaled early, but no on-page tightening or deepening narrows options or raises cost. The herald's actions (whispers, laughter, raising the lantern) do not escalate—each beat restates the same gesture without reversal or consequence. The fisherman observes an effect but experiences no agency; coincidence (nets heavy with silver) resolves his need without protagonist cost. No visible price paid, no option foreclosed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Theme (light must dance with dark; stories older than ink) emerges through vivid imagery and the lantern/shadow motif. The final image of shadow as invitation carries resonance, but the piece states its thesis overtly in multiple lines ("She believed light alone blinded; only when draped in velvet night could it be truly seen") rather than dramatizing it through specific conflict. The ending offers a poetic summation without a non-literal answer earned by prior particulars, and the fisherman's experience functions as illustration rather than earned wisdom.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited, perceptual signature is consistent (elevated, mythic register), but diction never modulates under pressure—peak moments ("Catalyst," "Not chaos") match the texture of calm description. Free indirect style is clean, but no psychic distance shift occurs across emotional states. The prose reads as a single voice-layer throughout, with no compression or intensification to reflect urgency. Filter verbs are minimal; no head-hopping. The narrator's certainty about unseen consequences (fisherman's dreams, future children) exceeds plausible focalization.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Overwriting is pervasive: nearly every sentence carries figurative language ("wind chimes forged from lightning," "velvet night," "silver needles stitching warnings"), flattening hierarchy and dulling closure charge. Template cadence in the middle third: "Each night, she climbed... Each dawn, she whispered..." Paraphrase loops: "She was accidentally prophetic" is restated in the next three sentences. Mixed metaphor: "inverted shadow, a darkness that illuminated" contradicts physical logic. Register drift into cosmic abstraction clashes with the concrete fisherman beat. Artifacts touch the closure paragraph ("her shadow stretched long and luminous"), triggering −1.7 baseline and disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The lighthouse-keeper premise is familiar; the storm herald's routine echoes archetypal guardian-of-threshold stories without transformation through specific lived detail. The "accidentally prophetic" twist and the lantern wick offer modest freshness, but the emotional arc (waiting, laughing, waiting again) is static and could be transplanted to any mythic setting with minor edits. The post-newspaper timeframe is mentioned once and does not shape tactics or stakes. One specific synthesis: "libraries grown from coral" signals a concrete future, but it remains vision rather than earned plot material.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The laughing storm herald is present throughout and her actions (climbing, whispering, raising the lantern, laughing) occupy multiple beats. However, no on-page choice alters tactics or narrows options—she performs the same routine without reversal. Her laughter "birthed tidal omens" and the fisherman's nets return heavy, but these effects are asserted outcomes, not decisions under pressure. The character shapes atmosphere but does not create a key turn. Swappable with any mythic sentinel.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The glass lantern wick appears early (paragraph 4), is raised and handled in the middle visionary beat, and returns in the final paragraph ("The lantern wick dimmed, but did not sleep"). Its "filament spun from the last breath of a forgotten god" and "inverted shadow" charge the imagery. However, its mechanics remain decorative—it does not constrain a choice or enable a tactic with visible cost. The reprise reweights thematic meaning (light/dark synthesis) but does not drive causality. Two gates met (setup, closure participation); mid-development use is present but static.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Otherworldly routine" is named explicitly and the text describes climbing stairs, whispering paradoxes, and sleeping in storm feathers across multiple beats. The concept frames the piece but does not change options or tactics on the page—each iteration is identical without escalation. It functions as atmospheric container rather than pressurizing force. Present and logically consistent, but swappable with "ancient vigil" or "timeless duty" with minimal edit.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Accidentally prophetic" is named and illustrated: "her offhand chuckles birthed tidal omens; her sighs seeded droughts." The trait appears in one paragraph and is restated in summary without constraining an on-page action. The fisherman's nets benefit from her laughter, but this effect is told rather than dramatized as a choice with cost. Label-only mention without visible trade-off or dramatized consequence.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Steer" is named repeatedly and the text specifies "she steered—not ships, not clouds, but thresholds" and "With each breath, she bent possibility." The action is present across beats (raising the lantern, whispering, laughing) and tied to the visionary middle sequence where she glimpses futures. However, no major turn traces to a specific steering act—outcomes (fisherman's nets, future libraries) are asserted rather than earned by on-page causality. One beat involvement (vision sequence) with thematic payoff, but swappable with "shape" or "guide."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Through total internal reflection" is named once in paragraph 3 ("to steer the world's dreaming edge... through total internal reflection, bending fate's light like a prism within her own fractured soul") and restated in the final third ("to steer through total internal reflection was to become the mirror"). The method is described metaphorically but its mechanics never shape an attempt or constrain tactics. Ornamental; no causal pressure. Late summary in the closure paragraph does not constitute payoff.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The emerald lighthouse under stars is named in the opening line, described with vivid detail (jade meteorite stairs, emerald beacon), and returns in the final image ("emerald stone and stellar script"). The fisherman looks up at the beacon, creating one beat of interaction. However, the setting does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome—it functions as vivid backdrop. Early setup, closure reprise, and one middle beat meet three gates, but micro-setting test (environment pressures tactics) is not satisfied.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"After the last print newspaper" is named once in paragraph 6 ("The world below had long abandoned print newspapers; headlines now pulsed in neural streams") and echoed in the final third ("The newspapers were gone, yes—but stories?"). The timeframe does not tighten decisions, create urgency, or shape tactics. The contrast (neural streams vs. stories) serves theme but does not function as live clock or constraint. Ornamental context; no causal work.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"To shape a new dawn using ancient shadows" is named explicitly in paragraph 12 and restated in the closing image ("the next dawn begging to be shaped from the velvet dark"). The motivation frames her routine and ties to the light/dark theme, but it is never dramatized in a conflicted choice—no friction between this want and a competing cost appears on the page. Told and thematically consistent, but not tested under pressure. Present in closure image but without visible trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Shadowed elation" is enacted throughout: laughter ("low, rolling thing"), smiling, blowing a kiss coexist with storm, darkness, and "velvet dark." Tone modulates subtly (the fisherman's nets return heavy; her laughter keeps "the void from weeping") and charges the final image where shadow becomes "invitation" rather than "absence." Coherent across beats, but no sharp tonal turn under pressure—mood remains steady rather than escalating or breaking. The ending reprises the established tone without reweighting it through cost.</comment>
