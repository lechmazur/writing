<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The courier's interiority is vivid and character-particular, with embodied contradictions—trembling "not from cold but from the weight of his absence"—and the micro-choice at the fork (choosing Hollow Market "not for efficiency, but because its lanterns flickered like dragonfly wings") reflects a hierarchy of values. However, the mentor's influence operates primarily through memory rather than dramatized internal conflict acting *in scene*, and the final release of the pendant reads as pre-decided rather than wrung from competing impulses. The child encounter materializes suddenly without enough resistance to charge the courier's choice with visible cost; we see generosity but not sacrifice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (courier, ridgeway, aurora, delivery casket) land cleanly in the opening lines. The piece accumulates density through the pendant's vibration, mentor memory, market encounter, and final release; the ending image (pendant dissolving into aurora) reweights the opening wonder-versus-routine stake and delivers Conceptual Repricing—wonder as transmission, not possession—with felt cost (she descends "empty-handed"). One meaningful deepening occurs when the child's "It remembers" crystallizes the courier's role shift from keeper to seeder. Minor slip: the casket delivery, introduced as urgent ("due before dawn"), vanishes with a single phrase ("handed the casket to a waiting archivist") that deflates stakes mid-resolution.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The aurora-lit ridgeway is anchored early and its "hidden frequencies" constrain the courier's movement; the pendant functions as micro-setting, vibrating against her sternum and guiding the fork choice. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered: "frost that sang," "lanterns...flickered like dragonfly wings," "air...thick as pollen." The Hollow Market's moth-wing canopy and the final ridgeway bend charge the closure image when the pendant returns skyward. Spatial choreography remains clear across ridgeway, market, and descent.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether to honor routine (delivery) or seed wonder (lingering for encounters)—is signaled at the fork and tightens when the courier chooses the Market path. The pendant-sharing with the child narrows options by externalizing the relic's power, and the final release forecloses possession with visible cost ("empty-handed"). Agency is clear: she extends the auroral encounter, chooses the less efficient path, and lets the pendant go. The casket's urgency, however, evaporates off-page without dramatized consequence, weakening the trade-off's felt weight at closure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—wonder as cultivated transmission rather than hoarded artifact—emerges through the mentor's teaching ("residue of attention paid too generously"), the child's resonance, and the final image of the pendant returning to sky. The courier's shift from keeper to seeder is earned by the child's whispered "It remembers" and her own realization: "wonder isn't inherited, it's cultivated—across the fade from memory to myth." The ending avoids moralizing; the empty-handed descent and hummed lullaby offer a resonant, non-literal answer. Minor: "What was routine for her became legend for others. That was the pact" edges toward explicit theme statement but stays rooted in the courier's role.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited; perceptual signature is consistent (wonder-attuned sensory detail, the mentor's ghosted voice as internal cue). Diction elevates appropriately for the lyric-fantasy register: "marrow," "germinate," "pollen," "fertile." The child's brief dialogue ("It remembers") and the courier's reply feel natural and carry subtext. Minor slips: "vibrating sympathetically" and "fade from memory to myth" edge toward prompt-language rather than fully naturalized interiority, and "Everything does, if you vibrate sympathetically enough" reads slightly expository in the dialogue beat. Psychic distance narrows smoothly at the pendant-release climax.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully, with longer lyric sentences during wonder-extension and shorter beats at the fork and child encounter. Information density is high; most lines advance character or atmosphere. However, density artifacts cluster in the opening and middle: "vibrated sympathetically," "attuning to...hidden frequencies," "translating landscape into lullaby, dread into delight" stack metaphoric abstractions without concrete payoff, and "germinate awe in barren moments" repeats conceptually across adjacent beats. The phrase "across the fade from memory to myth" (appearing twice) functions as thematic anchor but borders on loop. "She walked faster now, not fleeing, but seeding—each footfall a tiny tremor, each breath a note" demonstrates strong figurative control under pressure, but earlier sections show template-lyric cadence (dash-linked oppositions recurring mechanically). Clarity remains high; no major ambiguities.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The premise—relic courier who seeds wonder rather than hoarding artifacts—offers a fresh angle on mentor-legacy and occupational fantasy. The dragonfly-pendant-as-primordial-memory and the child's three-heartbeat vision provide specific, non-obvious particulars. However, the emotional arc (solitary wanderer chooses generosity over possession) follows a familiar template, and the aurora-as-glyphs, moth-wing-silk-market, and "First Bloom" world-building read as genre-conventional high-fantasy dressing. The mentor's absence motivates but does not complicate; no counter-pressure tests the courier's choice to release the pendant. Transformation test: swap "dragonfly pendant" for another mystical heirloom and the arc holds unchanged, signaling mid-range originality.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The jittery courier is present throughout; her trembling, fork choice (Market over Archive), pendant-sharing with the child, and final release of the pendant create three distinct on-page turns. Each decision alters tactics: the Market detour risks delivery time, sharing externalizes the relic's power, and release forecloses possession. "Jittery" is embodied in repeated trembling and breath-stilling rather than label-only. The character drives escalation and closure; removing her agency would collapse the narrative.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The dragonfly-wing pendant appears in paragraph one (clutched beneath tunic), drives the ridgeway vibration and fork choice (paragraph six–seven), is drawn out and shared with the child (paragraphs eighteen–twenty), and is released in the final third (paragraph twenty-eight), where it dissolves into aurora and charges the closure image. Its properties (vibration, resonance with landscape, primordial memory) enable the courier's wonder-seeding method and constrain her final choice: she cannot keep it and fulfill her new role. The pendant's reweighted meaning—from personal tool to transmissible seed—is indispensable to closure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The absent mentor is seeded in paragraph three ("Her mentor, long absent"), returns in the dilated auroral vision (paragraph eleven: "she saw her mentor...as he taught"), and his teaching ("wonder is the residue of attention") frames the courier's final realization. His absence motivates her trembling and shapes her stake (honoring his lesson by seeding rather than hoarding), but he does not constrain middle tactics or appear in the closure beat. The concept operates thematically rather than as live pressure; it could be replaced with a different loss (parent, friend) without restructuring the plot.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Extends brief encounters" is demonstrated twice on the page: the courier pauses at the crest to let the pendant "extend the brief encounter with the sky's memory, stretching seconds into suspended dream" (paragraph ten), and the child's three-heartbeat vision extends contact with the primordial dragonfly (paragraph twenty). The trait is her secret method (paragraph six) and aligns with her choice to linger at the Market rather than rush the delivery. However, no visible cost or trade-off is dramatized for the extension itself; the casket deadline vanishes without consequence, so the attribute shapes mood more than constrains choice.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Germinate" is introduced as her secret method (paragraph six: "to germinate awe in barren moments"), enacted when she shares the pendant with the child (the flare and resonance "germinate moments like this, where routine cracked open and wonder spilled through," paragraph twenty-three), and reprised in the final third: "she walked faster now...seeding" and "the child's wonder lingered...fertile as spring soil" (paragraphs twenty-seven, twenty-six). The action drives the middle turn (child encounter) and the ending's conceptual shift from possession to cultivation. Swapping "germinate" for "spark" or "ignite" would require only minor edits, holding it in the upper-mid band rather than indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Vibrating sympathetically" is named as the pendant's mechanism in paragraph five ("attuning to the ridgeway's hidden frequencies") and paragraph six ("let the pendant sing through her bones"), guides the fork choice (paragraph nine: "the pendant pulsed"), and is taught to the child in dialogue: "Everything does, if you vibrate sympathetically enough" (paragraph twenty-five). The method is signaled early and matters in two beats (ridgeway resonance, child's vision), but its mechanics remain abstract; the how of vibration is told rather than dramatized through physical cost or failure. The method could be replaced with "resonating" or "attuning" without altering structure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The aurora-lit ridgeway frames the opening (paragraphs one–two) and closing descent (paragraph thirty), and its "hidden frequencies" cause the pendant to pulse, guiding the fork choice (paragraphs five, nine). The ridgeway supplies the auroral glyphs that the courier reads (paragraph nine) and the final visual into which the pendant dissolves (paragraph twenty-nine). However, the ridgeway does not constrain movement or tactics; the courier's ascent and descent proceed without environmental obstacle. The Market (lanterns, moth-wing canopy) briefly supplies atmosphere but no spatial pressure. Postcard lyricism dominates over micro-setting constraint.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Across the fade from memory to myth" appears twice (paragraphs twenty-seven, five as foreshadowing) and names the thematic arc: the mentor's teaching fades into the courier's practice, which seeds future legend. The phrase charges the ending conceptually (her actions become stories for merchants and children), but no on-page clock or progression tracks the fade itself. The delivery deadline ("due before dawn," paragraph eight) could tighten temporal pressure but is abandoned. The timeframe operates as theme rather than constraint, making it functional but replaceable with "from past to future" or similar phrasing.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The motivation to coax wonder from routine is stated early (paragraph two: "she wasn't supposed to feel wonder anymore—routine had calcified") and dramatized in three choices: pausing to read the auroral glyphs (cost: time against delivery deadline), choosing the Market path for its dragonfly-wing lanterns (cost: efficiency), and sharing the pendant with the child (cost: secrecy, later possession). The final release—"She descended, empty-handed, humming"—completes the shift from routine keeper to wonder-seeder with visible cost. The mentor's teaching ("coax...from cobblestones, from silence") frames the desire and the courier's internalization ("Now...she climbed") shows friction between past scoffing and present commitment.</comment>
