<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's interiority is heavily abstracted through poetic metaphor ("cathedral of unfinished hymns," "stardust that clung to her soul") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. Her motivation to free trapped creativity is told and summarized across paragraphs rather than dramatized through on-page micro-choices with visible tradeoffs. The climactic winter scene shows her tracing meteors and weeping, but the internal conflict—why now, what specific cost she pays, what she forfeits—remains ornamental. The change at closure (voices "released") is asserted rather than earned through prior causality that forced a choice with legible price.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece operates in Accumulative/Textural mode: recurring images (stardust, archway, tracing) and tonal density build toward the winter climax. Orientation is delayed—who she is, why she does this, and when "now" occurs—past the 120-word mark without a taught pattern that pays off at closure, triggering a −0.4 penalty. The closure effect is a Resonant Reconfiguration (she "finally, truly, rested" after releasing the voices), but the cost is conceptual rather than felt on the page: no visible forfeiture, no tactical shift, no legible price in the final image. The lens holds, but the closure lacks the undeniable weight required for higher bands.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The aurora-lit archway is vividly rendered and recurs across beats, but it functions primarily as backdrop rather than constraint. The instrument is handled in the climax and "grew warm," yet its mechanics do not alter her tactics or foreclose an option. The setting charges the final image with auroral glow and frozen tears, meeting the micro-setting allowance, but the archway itself does not pressure a choice. Sensory detail is selective and atmospheric, filtered through her moonstruck lens, lifting the score into the mid-6s.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>One dominant stake is signaled: freeing trapped creativity. The winter escalation ("voices grew louder—not pleading, but furious") tightens pressure, and her response (tracing "dozens, hundreds" of meteors) deepens the action. However, the escalation is emotional intensity rather than a narrowing of options or a trade-off with visible cost. The resolution—voices "released," she "finally, truly, rested"—is told rather than shown through a protagonist decision that forecloses a path. Agency is present but the cost at closure is conceptual, not felt on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the recurring image of stardust, tracing, and the archway, and the piece avoids moralizing. The final image of "stardust, sky, and silence, finally in harmony" offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the question of creative release. However, the thematic weight rests on assertion ("creativity had slipped its cage") rather than a concrete particular that reweights prior material. The piece invites reflection and maintains ambiguity, but the specificity of the ending image is diluted by abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with a consistent lyric register and perceptual signature (upward gaze, invisible arcs, star-paths). The voice modulates appropriately at the climax ("She dropped to her knees," "She wept"), and the diction remains within the focalizer's poetic lexicon. However, sustained elevated register across high-pressure beats ("cathedral of unfinished hymns," "cosmic midwife catching sparks") risks overwriting. Distance is controlled, and no head-hopping occurs, but the prose does not meaningfully compress or shift rhythm under peak stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Figurative language appears in nearly every paragraph ("echoed like a cathedral," "stitching silver thread through velvet night," "stardust that clung to her soul like pollen"), creating sustained poetic density that risks overwriting in high-pressure beats. Template cadence is minimal, but paraphrase loops occur: "not sleep, not stillness, but the kind of surrender" and "not silenced, but released" restate rather than advance. The climax is abstracted ("she saw not stars, but souls") rather than concretely propelled. No major grammar or clarity errors, but the figurative density dulls momentum and accumulates to −0.8 in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of moonstruck dreamer, auroral archway, and meteor-tracing as a method to free trapped creativity is specific and purposeful. However, the core premise—a sensitive soul who alleviates others' creative blockages through mystical communion—closely matches archetypal templates (the empath-healer, the cosmic midwife) without sufficient lived-detail transformation. The winter escalation and the instrument's warmth add specificity, but the emotional arc (isolation → cathartic release → rest) follows a familiar trajectory. No close echoes of famous lines, and the piece commits fully to its premise, lifting it into the mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The moonstruck dreamer is present throughout and her tracing action drives the climax, but her choices are more responsive than agentic. She "ran to the archway" and "began to trace" when the voices "grew louder," a reaction to external pressure rather than a decision that alters tactics. Her role is observational and facilitative; the turn is emotional (weeping, resting) rather than tactical. Meets setup, middle use, and closure participation (all three gates), but causal pressure is indirect.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The astronomical instrument appears in the first paragraph ("antique astronomical instrument, brass and tarnished") and returns at the climax ("raised the instrument to her eye"). It is handled in two beats and "grew warm," gaining charged specificity, but its mechanics do not constrain a choice or enable a tactic that could not occur without it. She could trace meteors with her finger alone (as she does throughout). Meets setup and closure participation but lacks middle beat involvement and irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Remembered stardust" is introduced early ("the remembered stardust that clung to her soul") and recurs in the final line ("stardust, sky, and silence, finally in harmony"). It functions as thematic anchor and poetic motif but does not shape stakes or tactics on the page. She does not trade stardust, lose it, or use it to enable a specific action. Present in setup and closure, absent in middle development; functions as atmosphere rather than causal driver.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Hears unspoken words" is introduced in the second paragraph and drives her motivation throughout. The winter escalation shows the trait intensifying ("voices grew louder—not pleading, but furious"), and her climactic action responds to this ability. However, the trait does not constrain a choice with visible cost; she never hesitates, pays a price, or trades the ability. It enables action but lacks tradeoff or specificity of cost. Meets all three gates but lacks cost linkage.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Rest" is her recurring need, signaled early ("Her only reprieve came at the aurora-lit archway... she could rest"), shaping her motivation and the archway's function. The climax inverts the pattern: she does not rest first but acts ("began to trace"), and only after releasing the voices does she "finally, truly, rested." This reweighting drives the ending's closure effect (Earned Stasis / Charged Poise). Meets all three gates, shapes two beats, and charges the final image with specificity and cost.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Tracing the path of falling stars" is introduced early ("tracing the path of falling stars, finger extended to the sky") and returns as the climactic method ("she began to trace. Not one falling star, but dozens, hundreds"). The method is signaled, repeated across beats, and its mechanics matter (each arc "seemed to snap a chain"). However, the mechanics are told rather than shown with visible constraint, and the method could be swapped for similar mystical gestures. Meets all three gates and shapes two beats but lacks irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The "aurora-lit archway" is introduced early and recurs as the setting for rest and the climactic tracing. It provides atmospheric charge ("ribbons of emerald and violet") and spatial focus, but it does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome. She could perform the tracing elsewhere; the archway is a favored location, not a necessary condition. Meets setup, middle reference, and closure participation, but lacks causal pressure or irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Across an unwritten calendar" is stated explicitly ("She came here across an unwritten calendar, no dates marked") but does not constrain tactics. The winter escalation introduces urgency ("One winter, colder than memory, the voices grew louder"), yet the timeframe remains vague and untracked. No on-page clock narrows her options or forces a trade-off. Present in setup and referenced at the climax, but it does not tighten decisions. Missing middle development gate and lacks causal work.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"To free trapped creativity" is her stated motivation, introduced early ("She came to free trapped creativity") and dramatized in the climax (tracing meteors "seemed to snap a chain," releasing creativity in the sleeping town). However, the motivation is told and summarized rather than shown through conflicted micro-choices with visible cost. She never hesitates, sacrifices something personal, or faces friction between freeing others and her own needs. Meets all three gates and shapes the climax but lacks dramatized friction and cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Shadowed rapture" is coherent throughout: lyric elevation ("cathedral of unfinished hymns," "cosmic midwife") mixed with darkness ("hollow deeper into her ribs," "tears froze on her cheeks"). The tone modulates appropriately at the climax (urgency, weeping, then quiet certainty) and charges the final image ("stardust, sky, and silence, finally in harmony"). The tone is consistent, purposeful, and elevates the ending, but it does not shift decisively to reweight the stake; it maintains a steady register. Strong coherence and closure charge lift it into the mid-6s.</comment>
