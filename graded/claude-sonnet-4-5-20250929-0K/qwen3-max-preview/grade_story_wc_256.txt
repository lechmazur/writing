<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elira's motivation ("discover the texture of connection") is signaled early and sustains the pilgrimage frame, but her interiority remains abstract and label-driven throughout—"feeling the grain of each vanished voice like braille on her soul" asserts emotional texture rather than dramatizing contradictory impulses. No meaningful internal conflict or on-page choice alters her stance; she performs reverent actions (striking the tuning fork, singing) without risk, cost, or foreclosed path. The weeping moment ("not from sorrow, but from recognition") is told rather than embodied, and the final clip of the lens carries no visible consequence or changed option. Apply −0.4 for diagnostic label-speak in peak beats ("Seeds of texture, of friction") and cap at 8.3 per BRR mode without present micro-choices that tilt stance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers sensory echoes and questions to reweight the premise of connection. The midpoint tuning-fork strike and the singing beat deepen density, and the final charged lens offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where options crystallize—Elira now carries "seeds" forward. However, cost remains conceptual and oblique; no on-page action forecloses a path or changes her tactical options. The Cost proof test fails: the closing glow in the lens is metaphorical warmth, not a legible price paid. Orientation is clean (who/where/when anchored by ~90 words). Apply −0.8 for cost ambiguity at closure under the Non-closure Accumulation Cap.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The laboratory is vividly rendered with vacuum tubes, wire harps, and quartz pedestal—each detail serves the ritual and charges the sensory release at climax. The miner's lens as micro-setting object constrains the central action (refracting the tuning fork's vibration into prismatic echoes) and reappears in the final beat, glowing and transformed. Spatial choreography is coherent, and the lab's "breath in pulses" reflects Elira's reverent attention without postcard excess. The 9+ gate is narrowly satisfied: the lens and pedestal constrain the key choice (where to place the lens, how to angle it) and charge the final image. Minor deduction for the lab's rules (why vacuum tubes hum sympathetically) being asserted rather than discovered through goal-directed action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"discover the texture of connection"—is signaled early but remains abstract and unchallenged. No opposition, constraint, or live trade-off narrows Elira's options; she performs each ritual step (lens placement, fork strike, singing) without resistance, error, or cost. The piece accumulates sensory density rather than escalating pressure under the Accumulative lens, yet the tightening is minimal—no foreclosed path, no visible price. The weeping and the lens's glow are outcomes granted by the world, not earned by protagonist agency. Band guardrails for 8.0+ require a tightening that forecloses a live option; here the "pilgrimage" completes unopposed. Apply −0.6 for lack of visible cost and −0.4 for no trade-off under the Non-closure Accumulation Cap.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the lab's layered silence, the miner's lens as talisman, and the returning questions ("What if quiet is the space where true listening begins?"). The tuning fork and lens reappear with reweighted meaning at closure, and the final image of "golden shadows" ties to the story's title phrase. However, the questions are over-articulated and veer into thematic echo ("Why do we believe connection must be instant to be real?") rather than rising from scene pressure. The final paragraph ("these were not ghosts, but seeds") states the thematic answer explicitly rather than letting the charged lens image do the work. Apply −0.5 for mid-beat moralizing and −0.3 for thematic statements that replace scene pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent (reverent, synesthetic attention to sound-as-color). Diction is elevated and lyric, fitting the ritual frame, though register occasionally drifts into workshop abstraction ("artificial pilgrimage," "powerfully gentle"). The piece teaches its patterned, incantatory rhythm early and sustains it through closure. Elision of motive conflict and elision of how Elira knows to perform each step are purposeful compressions in service of the Accumulative lens. Minor penalty for filter-verb stack in the climax paragraph ("feeling the grain," "letting it rise," "amplified by the lens") which dulls immediacy in the peak beat. Apply −0.3 in Q7 for filter stack and do not duplicate here.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Figurative density is high but mostly coherent: "echoes had fossilized into silence," "prism-song," "golden shadows" sustain the synesthetic frame. However, several beats suffer from paraphrase loops and template cadence: "Each hue carried a texture: cobalt for longing, amber for comfort, violet for grief" is a list that restates the synesthesia claim three times without adding pressure. The phrase "powerfully gentle" appears twice with identical framing. Register drifts into academic abstraction ("artificial pilgrimage," "sediment holding the bones of forgotten conversations") in high-pressure moments. The final beat's "seeds of texture, of friction, of imperfect, unoptimized, gloriously human resonance" stacks three synonym clusters. Apply −0.6 for paraphrase loops, −0.4 for template cadence in the color-texture list, and −0.3 for register drift (total −1.3 under artifact cap). Disallow 9+ globally per the filter-verb stack rule.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The core synthesis—bell ringer + miner's lens + laboratory of lost sounds—offers a fresh angle on the "solitary ritual recovers lost art" template. The synesthetic refraction (sound → color → texture) is specific and non-obvious. However, the "artificial pilgrimage" frame, the questions about digital saturation versus human connection, and the climactic weeping of recognition all echo widely used workshop templates for theme-driven speculative literary fiction. Transformation is partial: the miner's lens and prism-song bell ringer are particular, but the emotional arc (lone artist performs reverent ritual, weeps at beauty, leaves charged) follows a median safe path without risk or surprise. Apply −0.7 per Derivative Premise Guardrail for close template match with incomplete transformation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elira is present throughout and her actions (placing the lens, striking the fork, singing) drive the ritual sequence. However, these are performed steps rather than choices that alter tactics or narrow options. No decision point where she could refuse, err, or pivot. She observes and facilitates the lab's response but does not make a turn. Functional but replaceable agency. Two gates (setup, payoff in final clip) but no middle development choice. Cap at 4.6 per missing-development gate; score 4.2 for swappability.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The miner's carbide lamp lens appears in three beats: belt introduction, pedestal placement/angling under the tuning fork (middle development that constrains the refraction action), and final clip with glow (closure charge). Its cracked surface and talisman role are specific and irreplaceable—removing it would break the prism-refraction logic and the closure image. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage; visible cost is minimal (the glow is gain, not price). All three gates satisfied; score 7.8 for strong integration with minor cost ambiguity.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The concept is named early ("artificial pilgrimage: not to a mountain or shrine, but inward") and the text structures Elira's journey as ritual steps toward a reweighted understanding. However, the mechanics are metaphorical—no on-page obstacle, map, or choice between paths. The concept shapes framing and tone but does not alter tactics or create a turn. Two gates (setup, thematic payoff) but no middle constraint. Lyric reprise qualifies for mid-5s; score 5.1 for thematic presence without mechanical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Powerfully gentle" is labeled twice: "inquiries weren't loud; they were powerfully gentle" and implicitly in "with a breath, she struck the fork—not with force, but with reverence." No on-page scene where this trait constrains action or creates a visible trade-off; it describes tone rather than enabling/limiting a choice. Present but ornamental. Cap at 3.8 per swappability rule.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Propel" appears explicitly in the climax: "Her voice, amplified by the lens, didn't overpower—it propelled." The action moves the lab's trapped harmonies and alters the ending state (lens now glows). The verb is thematically charged and drives the key beat. However, the beat could be rewritten with "released" or "freed" without breaking story logic. Two gates (middle action, closure charge) plus causal work; moderate irreplaceability. Score 6.7 for solid integration with partial swappability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The method is explicitly named and demonstrated: Elira asks three question clusters about connection, intimacy, and solitude. The questions frame the pilgrimage and appear before the tuning-fork strike. However, they do not shape attempts or create friction—no moment where questioning fails, misleads, or costs. The method is told and thematic rather than mechanical. Two gates (setup, thematic presence) but no development constraint. Functional but replaceable; score 4.9.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The laboratory is introduced in the opening line, detailed with vacuum tubes and wire harps in the second paragraph, and its responsive properties (glass hums, wires tremble, walls release harmonies) enable the climax and shape the final charged image. Spatial choreography is coherent and the lab's rules (sympathetic vibration) constrain Elira's placement and angling of the lens. All three gates satisfied; strong causal pressure and closure charge. Score 8.1 for essential integration with minor rule-assertion rather than discovery.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"After the power grid stabilized" appears in the second line and motivates the world's shift to digital saturation, but no on-page ticking clock or time constraint. The timeframe is backstory context, not a live pressure. Setup gate only; ornamental. Score 2.6 per missing-closure-participation cap.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The motivation is stated early ("not to recover what was gone, but to discover the texture of connection") and sustained through the ritual. The climax delivers sensory texture ("cobalt for longing, amber for comfort") that dramatizes the goal. However, no on-page friction between this want and a competing fear or cost—Elira pursues it unopposed. Two gates (setup, payoff) plus thematic charge; minimal conflict. Lyric reprise with thematic weight; score 5.8 for functional presence without friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Golden shadows" appears in the title reference and the penultimate paragraph: "the silence that followed was golden shadows—warm, alive, layered with the afterglow of presence." Tone is warm, reverent, and layered throughout, modulating subtly from dust and silence to vibration and glow. The final image is charged by this tonal shift. All three gates satisfied; the tone reweights the closure image. Score 6.4 for coherent modulation with moderate specificity—"golden shadows" could be replaced by "amber glow" without breaking logic.</comment>
