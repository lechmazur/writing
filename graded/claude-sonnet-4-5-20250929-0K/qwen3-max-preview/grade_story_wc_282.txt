<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The sensory map maker is presented with a consistent perceptual signature (heat-mapping emotions, thermal data reading), and her motivation to "become the voice of the unknown" generates the climactic engagement with the fossil. However, interiority leans heavily on abstract concepts ("transitional objects," "calibration," "existential") rather than embodied contradiction. The final transformation moment—singing through biothermal modulation—reads as executed competence without visible internal cost or renunciation that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers sensory mapping beats until the fossil's activation crystallizes a Resonant Reconfiguration (the protagonist shifts from solitary recorder to active participant/conduit). Orientation anchors arrive within the first ~100 words (coastal cave, post-hibernation timeframe, sensory mapper role). The closure lands on the page—"her purpose no longer solitary"—with felt cost (the fossil dissolves, the solitary mission transforms). One meaningful deepening occurs when the fossil floats and she responds by modulating her own output, narrowing her stance from observer to co-creator.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The cave network is vividly rendered with bioluminescent lichen that reacts to emotional heat, salt-crusted stalactites, and named chambers (Chamber Seven, Whispering Grotto, Tidal Sanctum) that guide her mapping work. The Tidal Sanctum's wet stone becomes the stage where the fossil floats, and the cave's "tidal rhythm" syncs with her breath at closure, directly shaping her final transformation. Sensory hierarchy reflects her professional focus: thermal gradients, lichen color shifts, and damp stone textures dominate, filtered through her heat-mapping expertise.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake—documenting and voicing dormant human emotions—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure tightens when the fossil grows warm and floats, forcing her to shift from passive observation to active thermal call-and-response. The move from "not to observe, but to participate" is protagonist-driven and forecloses the prior solitary stance with on-page cost (the fossil dissolves, her isolation ends). One meaningful escalation point; the piece does not require multiple reversals at this length, and the final reconfiguration is legible under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the arc of "transitional objects" as conduits that "carry meaning across thresholds, from silence into signal." The elm leaf's transformation from relic to relay, then dissolution into motes of light, embodies the central question—"Who remembers us?"—without overt moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: emotion rendered visible and voiced through active participation, not mere documentation. The final image reweights the entire mapping mission as a two-way conduit rather than a one-way archive, avoiding abstract thesis statements.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-person limited, anchored in the mapper's perceptual signature: thermal gradients, heat-mapping metaphors, and tactile cave engagement. Diction is consistent and voice-particular ("factually mystical," "biothermal output," "thermographic" voice). Free indirect style is clean, with no head-hopping. Minor register drift occurs in phrases like "existential" and "anticipatory, expectant," which edge toward elevated abstraction under pressure, but the voice recovers quickly and the final beats remain grounded in embodied action (breath syncing, pulse syncing, motes of light).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and rhythmically controlled, with strong sensory anchors and varied syntax. However, paraphrase loops appear: "not to observe, but to participate; not to record, but to respond" and "not from her body, but from the cave itself" employ parallel negation constructions that approach template cadence. Filter verbs ("she called them," "she did not mourn") are voice-motivated but cluster in reflective beats. No major loops obscure causality or closure, so deductions remain modest. Information density is high; most lines advance atmosphere, character, or plot.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of sensory mapping, post-human hibernation, emotional archaeology, and bioluminescent feedback is specific and non-obvious. The "factually mystical" leaf—surviving eons with cellular memory—and the thermographic voice ("degrees Celsius" encoding a plea) offer fresh inflections on relic-as-conduit tropes. The final transformation (protagonist as instrument, fossil as relay) feels earned in hindsight. Risk-taking in the biothermal call-and-response sequence heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, though the emotional archaeology frame echoes familiar "last human" templates; transformation through the specific heat-mapping mechanics and lichen responsiveness restores originality.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The sensory map maker's choices drive key turns: she presses the fossil to her chest for calibration, lays it on wet stone when it warms, traces the air to decode the thermographic question, and responds by modulating her biothermal output. These decisions shift her from passive observer to active participant, enabling the fossil's transformation and the final reconfiguration of her purpose. Her agency is present in setup (mapping), development (calibration ritual), and payoff (singing through thermal modulation). Causal pressure is strong; the closure depends on her responsive choice.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The elm leaf fossil appears in setup (carried in her satchel, pressed to her chest each dawn for calibration), development (grows warm in the Tidal Sanctum, floats, encodes the thermographic question), and payoff (dissolves into motes of light that carry human feeling deeper into the cave). It is handled across multiple beats with evolving function: relic → calibration tool → conduit → dissolved relay. The closure image directly depends on its transformation; removing it would collapse the story's logic and final reconfiguration. Specificity (single leaf defying entropy, cellular memory, thermal resonance) makes it irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The core concept of "transitional objects" is explicitly named and frames the protagonist's mission: they are "anchors between what was felt and what could be voiced." The fossil functions as the primary transitional object, bridging dormant human emotion and active expression. However, the concept is more thematic scaffold than tactical pressure; it describes what is happening rather than constraining on-page choices. The mapper's actions (calibration, thermal response) are motivated by her mapping mission, not by the logic of transitional objects per se. Present in setup (definition) and payoff (the leaf "had done what transitional objects do"), but middle development leans descriptive.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Factually mystical" is defined early (the leaf's preservation "defied entropy" without magic) and establishes the world rule that cellular memory can hum with emotion. This trait enables the fossil's later activation (it grows warm, floats, encodes a voice), making the climactic exchange possible. However, the attribute itself does not constrain or impose cost; it is a permission rather than a tradeoff. Setup and payoff are present, but the middle beat does not test or stress the factually mystical quality in a way that alters tactics. The label does specific conceptual work but remains more backdrop than active pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The float action is the story's fulcrum: the fossil rising from the wet stone triggers the protagonist's shift from observation to participation and launches the thermographic exchange. It redefines her options, forcing her to respond with her own biothermal output rather than merely document. Present in development (the floating moment) and payoff (the lattice forms, the fossil dissolves). Swapping "float" for "glow" or "hum" would dilute the anti-gravity wonder and the sense of a threshold crossed. The action is causally central and charges the final image.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Heat-mapping emotions is signaled early (she reads "thermal ghosts of longing, fear, and wonder") and shapes her entire methodology: tracing air currents, documenting grief gradients, calibrating with the fossil's resonance. The method enables the climactic exchange when she modulates her biothermal output to answer the thermographic question. Present in setup (definition of her tools), development (calibration, lichen responses), and payoff (singing via thermal projection). The mechanics matter throughout, and removing heat-mapping would require a fundamental rewrite of the protagonist's skill set and the story's sensory logic.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The coastal cave network is present in setup (cathedral-like ceilings, bioluminescent lichen, named chambers), development (Chamber Seven's indigo dimming, Whispering Grotto's gold blaze, Tidal Sanctum's wet stone stage), and payoff (the cave's tidal rhythm syncs with her breath, motes of light carry feeling into "deeper veins"). The lichen's emotional responsiveness and the Tidal Sanctum's specific conditions (wet stone, tidal pulse) directly enable the fossil's activation and her responsive transformation. The setting is not mere backdrop; it is an active participant that constrains her movements and charges the final image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The timeframe "after humans hibernated" is established in the second paragraph and creates the existential backdrop (silence, dormant sentient presence, geothermal sighs). However, it does not tighten decisions or impose a live clock. The mapper works at her own pace; no deadline or countdown pressures her choices. The timeframe is thematic (explaining why she is alone and why emotions are "the last language") but does not constrain tactics. Present in setup, absent from development and payoff as an active force. Swappable with "after humans left" or "in the long silence" without structural impact.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The motivation "to become the voice of the unknown" is stated explicitly ("her motivation was not academic, nor sentimental—it was existential") and drives her mapping mission. It is present in setup (explaining why she documents emotions) and payoff (she becomes the translator, her purpose "no longer solitary"). However, the motivation is more told than dramatized through conflicted micro-choices; the story shows her executing the mission competently, not wrestling with competing desires or costs. Development lacks visible friction between wanting to voice the unknown and the price of doing so. The final transformation feels like fulfillment rather than a trade-off.</comment>
