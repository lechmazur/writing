<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The vendor is established through ritual and transaction rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Her backstory ("daughter, debtor, deserter, dreamer") is told rather than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. The customers appear as abstract symbols rather than individuals who force choices; their interactions are static exchanges without visible friction. The final "lighter" claim tells emotional state rather than embodying it through concrete action or perception.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece builds through repetition and density rather than causal turns. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive clearly in the opening paragraph. Closure qualifies as Conceptual Repricing—the final image of seven glimmers and the open ledger reweights the premise—but the cost remains abstract ("distribute its weight") rather than a visible forfeiture on the page. The inferred lens holds, but the ending gesture does not tighten options or charge prior material with undeniable pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The glass orchard library on clouds is vivid and sustained through sensory detail (ozone, pearlescent gates, glass petals, shifting shelves). The counter incisions and bottled moonlight function as micro-setting elements that constrain ritual action. The final image of seven incisions charging the ceiling links setting to closure, elevating the score. However, the clouds and orchard remain postcard backdrops; they do not alter the vendor's tactics or choices during transactions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—unwriting her past through brokered erasures—is signaled early but remains abstract. No meaningful tightening occurs; the seven transactions are identical in structure and lack escalating cost or narrowing options. The customers drift in and out without testing the vendor's commitment or forcing a trade-off. The piece accumulates texture rather than pressure, and under the Accumulative lens, a single decisive intensification or cadence shift that reweights the stake is missing.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme—measuring absence as foundation for beginnings—emerges from the bottled moonlight and ledger mechanics rather than meta-commentary. The final image of distributed weight and seven glimmers offers a resonant but abstract answer. The piece resists overt moralizing, yet the closing line "the shape of your next beginning" edges toward thematic statement. Particulars (3.7 heartbeats, 12 grams) create texture but do not constrain choice, limiting thematic charge.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV distance is stable; the vendor's perceptual signature (ritual incisions, ledger arithmetic) is character-specific. Dialogue carries subtext ("I sell the method: by quantifying absence") and advances stakes. However, elevated diction ("cacophony of roles," "syrupy," "tectonic plates of narrative") drifts from the vendor's established idiom during peak ritual beats, creating register inconsistency. Free indirect style is clean, and no head-hopping occurs.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Overwriting clusters in high-pressure beats: "tectonic plates of narrative," "frozen breath stylus," "static and starlight," "glowing labyrinth" stack metaphors without pattern-taught payoff. Paraphrase loop: "She felt lighter, not because her burden had lessened, but because she had learned to distribute its weight—parcel it out in measured doses, trade it for other people's hollows" restates the same idea across two clauses. Template cadence appears in the transaction sequence: "A patron drifted in... He hesitated, then nodded... She watched him wander... A second patron entered... The patron selected." Deductions: −0.6 for density/coherence, −0.4 for template runs = baseline ~6.2.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The premise—vendor of erasures in a liminal library—offers a fresh synthesis of abstraction and commerce. The ledger's quantified absence (3.7 heartbeats, 12 grams) is specific and memorable. However, the emotional arc (vendor as mirror to customers) and the serial transaction structure read as template-adjacent; swapping customer details would not alter the core dynamic. The piece commits to its premise but does not risk a turn that would test or fracture the established pattern.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The vendor is present throughout and performs ritual actions (arranging, placing bottles, incising marks, recording). However, her choices do not create key turns; she facilitates identical transactions without escalation or cost that alters her tactics. She observes and processes customers but does not face a decision that narrows options. Setup and development are present; closure participation is weak (packing the cart is logistical, not decisional). Cap at 4.6 for missing closure participation, but strong beat involvement (+0.9) and early signal (+0.5) lift to 4.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Bottled moonlight appears in multiple beats: arranged in rows, placed before the patron, selected by the second patron, and implied in the seven sales. The object enables transactions and is causally active. It recurs with consistent meaning (glimmering parole) and is mentioned in the final paragraph ("jars of dawn mist and vials of unsung lullabies" reinforce the product line). Setup, development, and closure participation are present. Beat involvement (+0.9), causal pressure (+0.8), closure linkage (+0.7), early signal (+0.5) = ~7.2.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Glimmering parole is named and explained ("conditional release from the weight of memory") and frames the vendor's product line. It shapes the patron's choice to buy the bottle. However, it does not narrow options or create friction; the concept remains a label for the transaction mechanics. Setup and development are present; closure participation is weak (the concept is not reweighted in the final image). Early signal (+0.5), one beat involvement (+0.4), ornamental use (−0.7) = ~5.9.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Mindfully scattered" appears once in the opening: "Her fingers, mindfully scattered across the counter as she arranged bottled moonlight." The phrase describes a physical state but does not constrain or enable any on-page action with cost. It is ornamental description without causal pressure. Setup only (no development or closure). Ornamental use (−0.8), swappability (−0.6), late or absent in closure (−1.0) = cap at 3.4 for missing middle development; residual credit for setup = ~3.2.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Incise appears three times: the vendor cuts the countertop after each sale, and the cuts gleam/refract light. The action is ritualistic and marks transactions, contributing to the ledger-keeping frame. It recurs with consistent meaning and charges the final image (seven incisions, seven glimmers). However, removing "incise" and replacing it with "mark" or "score" would not break story logic. Setup, development, and closure participation present. Beat involvement (+0.9), closure linkage (+0.9), early signal (+0.5), swappability (−0.6) = ~6.8.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"By quantifying absence" is explained in dialogue and demonstrated in the ledger entry (3.7 heartbeats, 12 grams). The method is signaled early and shown in one transaction. However, it does not shape multiple attempts or alter tactics; the vendor applies it identically across all seven sales. Setup and development present; closure participation weak (the method is mentioned but not reweighted). Early signal (+0.5), one beat (+0.4), summary-only at closure (−0.6) = ~4.1.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The glass orchard library on clouds is vividly described and provides the spatial anchor. The setting enables the vendor's presence and frames the transactions. Shelves "shift" and the library "sighs," contributing to atmosphere. However, the setting does not constrain choices or alter tactics; transactions would function identically in a generic shop. Setup, development, and weak closure participation (setting is mentioned but not causally active in the final image). Early signal (+0.7), beat involvement (+0.4), ornamental in peak beats (−0.7) = ~5.4.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>The timeframe "during the lull on a store's very first opening day" is mentioned in the opening paragraph and establishes the vendor's arrival context. However, time does not tighten decisions or create urgency; the vendor processes seven customers without time pressure or a closing deadline. Setup only; no development or closure participation. Early signal (+0.3), ornamental (−0.8), missing closure (−1.0) = cap at 2.8 for missing closure participation; adjust to ~2.6.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The vendor's motivation "to find the place where stories begin" is stated in the opening and echoed in the closing paragraph. It frames her journey but is not dramatized in choices; she has already arrived and operates without friction or conflict tied to this desire. The motivation is told rather than shown through competing wants or visible cost. Setup and weak thematic echo at closure; no middle development. Early signal (+0.5), summary-only (−0.7), swappability (−0.5) = ~4.3.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Tone reads as contemplative lyricism with fragmented, elevated diction ("ozone and unread epilogues," "tectonic plates of narrative"). The tone is consistent across beats and modulates slightly during transactions (directness in dialogue vs. poetic interiority). The final image of seven glimmers and the open ledger maintains the established tone and charges it with quiet resonance. However, tonal density does not shift under pressure; the mood remains static. Coherence across turns (+0.8), closure linkage (+0.7), static mood (−0.5) = ~6.3.</comment>
