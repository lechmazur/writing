<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's carving work and ribbon-tying show embodied action, but his motives remain largely reflective rather than pressure-tested through on-page choice. The spectral mentorship is described as guiding his wrist, yet no moment dramatizes him resisting or choosing between Silas's phantom instruction and his own impulse. Interiority leans toward poetic assertion ("grief had geometry") without the contradictory impulses acting simultaneously under stress that would reach higher bands. The final choice to "begin the next" stone arrives without visible cost or foreclosed path—no alternative was legibly at stake.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who, where, and when clearly within the opening. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: sensory detail, ribbon-tying, and poem fragments build density toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) in the penultimate paragraph when Silas places his palm over Elias's heart and Elias understands grief as "a current to be joined." However, the cost is conceptual and asserted rather than felt—no on-page forfeiture, trade-off, or altered tactic proves the reweighting. The ending image ("no longer carving alone") restates the epiphany without additional pressure or price, leaving closure underdeveloped for high-band entry.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The greenhouse setting is vivid and purposeful: moss-slicked flagstones, glass panes, iron rafters, and the overgrown lemon tree create tactile grounding. Ribbons tied to the rafters and the butterfly migration brushing the glass charge the space with accumulative meaning. The setting constrains Elias's action (he comes here nightly, ties ribbons, carves in this specific sanctuary) and the final storm's "bass note" modulates atmosphere to support closure. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—discovering the shape of collective grief—is signaled early and coherent. Pressure accumulates through the nightly ritual, the spectral mentorship, and the ribbon-tying, creating a meaningful density increase. Yet escalation under the Accumulative lens requires a tightening or cadence shift that narrows options or raises cost; here the protagonist continues the same ritual without friction, trade-off, or visible price. The final realization arrives as epiphany rather than through a choice that forecloses a live alternative, capping escalation credit.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the interplay of carving, ribbons, poems, and migration without overt moralizing. The final insight—"grief was not a void to be filled, but a current to be joined"—is earned by the accumulation of particulars (butterfly wings, phantom hand, tied ribbons). However, the resolution into a single declarative understanding flirts with thematic summary rather than letting the final image resonate ambiguously. The crimson ribbon for the grandmother's poem and Silas's spectral palm charge the ending without stating a moral, lifting the score above mid-band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-person-limited; focalization is clean throughout. Diction is purposefully elevated ("bruised hues of twilight," "thundering calm") and consistent with the lyric mode the piece teaches early. The phrase "fiercely meditative—not still, but vibrating with quiet intensity" exemplifies voice control. Minor slippage: "he believed grief had geometry" tells rather than shows the belief through choice. No dialogue appears. Psychic distance is consistent; narrative certainty matches Elias's plausible knowledge.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; sensory detail is dense and specific. However, several lines loop conceptually: "not to recite but to feel the weight each word bore" is restated in "syllable by syllable, stanza by stanza"; "he carved names he'd never met" is followed by a near-paraphrase "epitaphs for strangers." The phrase "the gravestone carver, Elias Voss" front-loads apposition where "Elias Voss carved gravestones" would be leaner. Figurative language is controlled but dense in every paragraph without clear pattern-teaching, risking over-decoration. No severe artifacts touch closure, capping deductions at −0.8 under the non-closure rule.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of gravestone carving, spectral mentorship, and poetic ritual is specific and memorable. The greenhouse-as-sanctuary and butterfly migration as soul metaphor feel purposeful rather than ornamental. Yet the premise—solitary craftsman finds peace through supernatural guidance and inherited tradition—trends toward familiar template; transformation relies on atmospheric execution rather than a non-obvious moral calculus or structural risk. The ending smile and resumption of work lean toward comfort rather than complexity, limiting ingenuity credit.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias is present throughout and his carving anchors every beat. Setup is immediate; development shows him tying ribbons and retracing poems; closure shows him picking up the chisel again. However, his choices are observational and ritualistic rather than turning the plot—no moment dramatizes him choosing between alternatives with cost. The smile at the end signals stance but not a forfeited path. Two gates (setup, closure participation) are met; middle development is weak because his carving continues unaltered by friction.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The ribbon roll is introduced in paragraph three, tied to the grandmother's memory. Elias ties ribbons to the rafters in paragraph fourteen, and the final crimson ribbon (paragraph twenty) closes the sequence. Three beats with escalating meaning: keepsake → loom for memory → final tribute. The object charges the closure image indirectly (the ribbon-tying completes before Silas's palm-to-heart gesture). All three gates met; causal pressure is moderate—the ribbons map memory but do not constrain a choice. Swappability is low; removing the ribbons would hollow the ritual.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Spectral mentorship is introduced at paragraph seven and recurs in paragraphs nine, sixteen, and twenty-one. Silas guides Elias's wrist and watches from the shadows, culminating in placing his palm over Elias's heart. Setup and closure gates are met; middle development is descriptive rather than altering tactics. The mentorship teaches Elias to see letters as vessels (told) but does not create on-page friction or force a choice between ghostly instruction and independent impulse. Lyric resonance is present; causal necessity is modest.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Fiercely meditative" is labeled in paragraph two and echoed in "thundering calm" (paragraph seventeen). The trait is asserted rather than dramatized through a constrained action or visible trade-off. No moment shows the intensity enabling a carving decision or foreclosing an alternative through excess focus. Label-only mention trends low; missing middle development and cost linkage cap the score.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Retrace" appears in paragraph five: "he retraced those poems in his mind, syllable by syllable, stanza by stanza." The act is central to the ritual and primes the ribbon-tying in later beats. Setup and development gates met; closure linkage is indirect (the retracing habit informs the final ribbon, but the verb does not recur at the end). One major beat shaped; swappability is moderate ("recall" or "recite" would function similarly). Cost is implied through time and attention but not foregrounded.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The family custom of trading poems is introduced in paragraph four and recurs as the source of the ribbons Elias ties (paragraph fifteen: "one for each poem traded at his family's table"). The crimson ribbon for his grandmother's favorite poem (paragraph twenty) completes the pattern. All three gates met; the custom shapes the ritual's content and emotional charge. Causal pressure is moderate—the poems inform the inscription work but do not constrain a tactical choice. Specificity is high; irreplaceability is strong.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The ancient greenhouse is named in the title and anchors every beat. Setup immediate; the space provides the moss-slicked flagstones, glass panes, iron rafters for ribbon-tying, and the overgrown lemon tree near which Silas appears. Closure: the thunder rolls outside as Elias picks up the chisel again, grounding the final image. The greenhouse constrains Elias's ritual (he comes here nightly, it was Silas's sanctuary) and the butterfly migration outside charges the atmosphere. Environment shapes tactics and final image; irreplaceability is strong.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Butterfly migration is introduced at paragraph six and recurs in paragraphs seven and seventeen ("the last butterflies veered south"). Setup and closure gates met; middle development is atmospheric rather than time-pressure. The migration marks the season and metaphorically echoes "souls departing," but no deadline or ticking clock alters Elias's choices—he could tie ribbons on any evening. Time is vague ("every evening, since childhood" versus "one dusk") without tracked urgency. Lyric resonance present; causal tightening absent.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The motivation "to discover the shape of collective grief" is stated in paragraph eleven and elaborated ("grief had geometry") in paragraph twelve. Elias's nightly carving and ribbon-tying dramatize the quest. Setup and development gates met; closure shows understanding ("grief was not a void to be filled, but a current") but the desire is told and reflected rather than tested through conflicting wants or visible cost. No moment shows Elias torn between carving and another impulse. Summary-only use and lack of friction cap the score.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Fiercely meditative" (paragraph two) and "thundering calm" (paragraph seventeen) bracket the piece, teaching the tone early and paying it off at closure. The paradox of "storm and stillness" is embodied in the carving rhythm and the final thunder's "bass note beneath the calm." Tone modulates purposefully: quiet intensity builds through the ribbon-tying, peaks with Silas's spectral palm, and resolves in grounded resumption. Coherence is strong; the final image charges the tone. All three gates met; closure linkage elevates the score.</comment>
