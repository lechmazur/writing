<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The mechanical arm and needle-card handling provide embodied specificity, and the partnership arc shows progression. However, interiority remains thin—the philosopher's contradictory impulses are asserted ("diplomatically fierce") rather than dramatized in competing micro-choices under pressure. The woman's arrival and their synchronized work feel more like choreographed moves than decisions that foreclose paths with visible cost. The final choice to "perform it…everywhere" carries aspiration but lacks the grounded trade-off or renunciation that would anchor agency.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who, where, and when within the opening paragraph; no penalty applies. The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens: the sundial's shadow moves toward alignment, the needle card reveals a pattern, and the partners transcribe the score. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (partnership formed, purpose declared), but the cost remains aspirational rather than legible on the page—no visible forfeiture, no path foreclosed. The causality of the discovery is clean, yet the final image ("perform it…everywhere") asserts stakes without demonstrating sacrifice or consequence in the ending beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The atrium's glass panes, sundial, and brook are vividly rendered and anchor spatial choreography throughout. The sundial's shadow at 11:03 provides a concrete constraint that drives the transcription beat, and the needle card's perforations interact with that shadow to unlock the score—micro-setting functioning as tool. The brook's "gurgling approvingly" and glass "holding its breath" veer toward pathetic fallacy but do not obscure spatial logic. The setting charges the final image (leaving the needle card on the table) with modest resonance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—uncovering the hidden overture—is signaled early and shapes the middle beat (aligning shadow and needle card). However, escalation is shallow: the philosopher waits three dawns, the woman arrives, they succeed without complication. No reversal, no foreclosed option, no visible cost paid on the page. The declaration "Now we perform it…everywhere" gestures at future stakes but does not tighten present options or dramatize sacrifice. Under the accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening occurs (the score's revelation), yet the lack of friction or trade-off limits the band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The overture as "a composition that turned philosophical queries into navigable paths" emerges organically from the sundial-and-cipher action, avoiding overt thesis statements. The partnership's shift from "duel" to "perform it" offers a non-literal answer to the opening tension. Yet the theme of questions-as-destinations remains more asserted than tested—no moment on the page where a character's question costs them something or redirects their path. The final image (leaving the needle card, walking out together) resonates modestly but does not reweight prior material with undeniable pressure or ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV anchored to the philosopher; psychic distance is stable. Perceptual signature shows in "brass fingers twitching in rhythm" and the internal chronometer detail, lending specificity. Dialogue ("You're late" / "Only by design") carries subtext and advances plot efficiently. However, the elevated diction ("prismatic shards," "diplomatically fierce," "unyielding in the architecture of his arguments") occasionally drifts above the immediate scene pressure into ornamentation. No head-hopping; filter use is light. The prose maintains coherence under the chosen lens without flattening voice, though rhythmic compression at peak beats is modest.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Information density is high in the sundial-and-cipher beats, and spatial choreography tracks cleanly. However, figurative language saturates nearly every sentence ("prismatic shards," "herald of the hidden overture," "symphony tuned to the tension," "shadow's silent song," "counterpoint"), creating textural density that slows rather than propels. Template cadence appears in repeated "The…" and "He…" sentence openings across the first third. Paraphrase loops: "not to argue, but to fence—not with steel, but with silences" and "diplomatically fierce: never cruel, never loud, but unyielding" restate concepts without adding pressure. No clarity breaks at closure, so Non-closure Accumulation Cap holds penalties to −0.8 total.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The combination of philosopher-duelist, mechanical arm, cipher-encoded score, and partnership arc synthesizes several elements, yet the core premise (hidden knowledge unlocked via sundial angles) echoes familiar treasure-hunt and academic-quest templates without a transformative twist. The "diplomatically fierce" dueling-via-logic frame is asserted but not demonstrated in on-page friction. Emotional specificity is thin: the characters' motivations and partnership formation feel efficient rather than inevitable. The needle-card cipher and sundial mechanics offer procedural freshness, but the stakes and closure do not invert or complicate the premise in hindsight. No proximity concerns; voice and world cohere. Risk-taking is present in the dense figurative texture but does not heighten stakes or clarity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Present throughout; the philosopher observes, adjusts his cuff, rotates the needle card, and co-transcribes the score. His mechanical arm is handled in two beats (opening and card alignment), and his choices advance the plot. However, his decisions do not create reversals or foreclose paths—he waits, the woman arrives, they succeed together. His role is active but not transformative; swapping him for another seeker would alter flavor but not structure. Setup, middle involvement, and closure presence are all met (three gates), yet causal pressure and cost are modest.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The needle card is introduced in paragraph four, used at the 11:03 alignment to decode the shadow, and left on the table at the end as a symbolic pass-off. Setup is late (second sixth) but within first third. It drives the decoding beat (middle development) and is reweighted at closure ("its purpose fulfilled, its secrets now theirs to carry"). However, the card's perforations as cipher is asserted rather than shown—no dramatized trial-and-error, no cost tied to handling it. Two distinct beats and closure linkage place it mid-band; the late-ish introduction and modest irreplaceability (any cipher tool could substitute with minor edits) cap upward reach.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The "hidden overture" is named in the first paragraph, sought throughout, and discovered at 11:03. It shapes the dominant stake and motivates all on-page action. The overture's mechanics (tonal intervals from geometry) are revealed, and the characters plan to perform it. Setup, development, and closure presence are solid (three gates). However, the overture never constrains a choice or imposes a cost—no wrong note, no rival, no sacrifice to access it. It functions as quest object rather than active pressure. Causal role is clear but largely ornamental; removing the "hidden" aspect would leave the structure intact.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Diplomatically fierce" is declared in paragraph five ("never cruel, never loud, but unyielding") and echoed at the score's discovery ("diplomatically fierce even in triumph, refusing to gloat"). It appears twice but remains label-only—no on-page moment where the trait constrains a choice or enables an action with cost. The philosopher's behavior reads courteous and precise, but nothing in the scene hinges on this exact phrasing. Ornamental use without development or closure pressure; present but swappable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Fence—not with steel, but with silences shaped by logic" is introduced in paragraph three. The prior duels (letters, footnotes, marginalia) are summarized, and the face-to-face meeting is framed as "the real match." However, no on-page fencing occurs—they collaborate without parry, thrust, or counter. The action is asserted as metaphor rather than dramatized. It colors tone but does not drive a turn; swapping "fence" for "collaborate" or "solve" would require only surface edits. Setup present, middle and closure absent; caps at ~3.4.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The sundial is introduced in paragraph eight, its mechanics explained (coded angles in negative space), and used at 11:03 to align the needle card and reveal the score. The method shapes middle attempts (three dawns of observation) and delivers the climactic discovery. Setup, development, and payoff are all present (three gates). The sundial's fractured shadow and the specific time (11:03) constrain the decoding beat, and the "next coded angle" in the final line recharges its purpose. However, no cost is tied to the sundial's use—no failed alignment, no consequence for missing the window. Strong beat involvement and closure linkage; modest irreplaceability (another cipher device could substitute) and zero cost limit upward reach.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The atrium is named in the opening line and detailed throughout: glass panes, marble floor, brook, sundial at center, scholars at distant tables. It anchors spatial choreography and provides the sundial, which constrains the decoding beat. The brook's presence and the glass chime add atmospheric pressure. Setup, development (via the sundial), and closure (exiting the atrium) are present (three gates). However, the atrium itself does not constrain a choice—any quiet, well-lit space with a sundial would serve. The setting supplies resources (light, shadow) but does not pressure tactics or alter outcome beyond enabling the method. Solid beat involvement and closure linkage; modest irreplaceability and zero unique constraint cap upward reach.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Waiting" frames the opening, and the philosopher has spent "three dawns" observing. The 11:03 alignment provides a live clock that triggers the decoding beat, and "by noon" they complete the transcription. Time is tracked and tightens the middle beat (the shadow must align "precisely"). However, time does not pressure a choice or impose a cost—no deadline, no rival arriving, no consequence for delay. The philosopher waits; the woman arrives "late…by design" (which deflates urgency); they succeed. Setup and middle involvement present; closure participation modest (time of day at exit not charged). Two gates met; lyric resonance absent. Causal role clear but pressure limited.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"To turn questions into destinations, not dead ends" is declared in paragraph three and echoed in the overture's description ("each note a question, each rest a destination earned"). The motivation is told rather than dramatized—no on-page moment where a character's question costs them or redirects their path. The partnership shift (duel → perform) gestures at the idea but lacks friction. Setup present, middle absent (the decoding is procedural, not question-driven), closure participation weak (the declaration "everywhere it's been forgotten" asserts future stakes without testing present desire). One gate met; caps at ~3.4. Aspiration without embodied conflict.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Dignified chaos" is introduced in paragraph six ("the rustle of turning pages…the murmur of water…the occasional chime…all of it a symphony tuned to the tension of anticipation") and sustained through the transcription ("the brook hushed its babble, even the glass seemed to hold its breath"). Tone is coherent and modulates with pressure: orderly at the start, held during the decoding, resuming at the exit. However, the tone does not constrain a choice or charge the final image with cost—it colors atmosphere without altering outcome. Setup, development, and closure presence are solid (three gates). The tone's "dignified" quality fits the characters' stance, yet "chaos" is more asserted than enacted on the page (no disorder, no friction). Coherence strong; pressure contribution modest.</comment>
