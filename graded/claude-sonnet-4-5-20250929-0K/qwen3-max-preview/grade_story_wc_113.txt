<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to decode water-damaged images is established, but her choices feel more observational than decisive until the climactic "performance." Internal contradiction is minimal—she moves through reverence and interpretation without genuine conflict between competing impulses. The ghost-conducting scene offers embodied emotion (trembling, breath held), but the final choice to leave feels like completion of a ritual rather than a decision that forecloses a path with visible cost. Interiority leans toward poetic summary ("unraveling," "resolve") rather than character-particular thought under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece builds through layered imagery and the program's gradual revelation, culminating in a wordless "performance" that dissolves the ghost. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (the ghost gains peace, she gains purpose), but the cost is asserted rather than shown—what path is foreclosed, what price paid? Orientation anchors (musician, flooded opera house, lantern, present night) arrive early. The escalation from study to performance is a single meaningful deepening, sufficient for this length, but the final image ("the flood...had composed its masterpiece") tells theme rather than letting action reweight prior material.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The flooded opera house is vividly rendered with selective, purposeful detail: ankle-deep water, drowned chandeliers, chairs floating like lily pads, mold-streaked walls. Sensory hierarchy (lantern glow, water vibration, warm skin) reflects the protagonist's reverent focus. The pit itself becomes a micro-setting that constrains her ritual (she must angle the lantern "just so," water pools in the program's creases to magnify stains). Spatial choreography is coherent throughout. The environment charges the final image of exhalation and settling, satisfying the 9+ gate for Q3.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake: decode the ghost's unfinished symphony and grant him peace. Pressure accumulates through her weeks of study, tonight's ritual setup, and the climactic "performance" in invisible bowing. The tightening is a single deepening—when the ghost appears and conducts, she mirrors his gestures, summoning harmony from ruin. However, the escalation relies on atmosphere and assertion ("the water rose slightly, swirling in eddies") rather than a protagonist choice that narrows options or pays a visible price. No credible loss or forfeiture alters her tactics; the resolution feels inevitable rather than earned by prior friction.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme (silence, absence, memory as composition) emerges organically from the flooded pit, water-damaged images, and unstruck chords. The concept of "in between spaces" recurs with purpose and the final image ("the in between spaces finally sang") reweights prior material. However, the last two paragraphs veer toward overt thematic statement: "The ghost had his peace. She had her purpose. And the flood, at last, had composed its masterpiece." This tell-not-show moralizing flattens what the imagery had already conveyed, triggering a −0.5 penalty in Q5. Subtext operates well in gesture and silence until the ending announces meaning.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV, stable and apt. The perceptual signature is consistent—musical metaphors (crescendos, fermata, arpeggios) filter all description. Diction is elevated and poetic, matched to a musician's sensibility. Psychic distance tightens during the climactic "performance" (short breaths, held silences). However, register occasionally drifts into overwrought lyricism ("the hush of unstruck chords...calcified," "summoned harmony from ruin") that risks purple prose. Free indirect style is clean with no head-hopping. The prose reads as character-driven, though the uniformly elevated diction under peak stress could compress further to reflect urgency.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Overwriting pervades high-pressure beats: figurative language in most sentences ("lily pads," "broken reeds," "smoke," "glyphs," "shimmering," "liquid shadows," "motes of glitter," "spiraling arpeggios") without pattern-teaching or payoff, triggering a −0.7 deduction. Paraphrase loops appear: "not to play, but to listen—not with ears, but with skin" / "not fame, nor closure, but unraveling" / "not in words, but in gestures" recycle parallel syntax without added pressure, adding −0.4. Mixed metaphors: water "whispered secrets" while also "composing" and "conducting"—vehicles blur. Template cadence: "She believed...she knew" / "She'd come...She'd spent" / "She laid...angled...watched." Final-third artifacts disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band entries at 8.8. Information density is moderate; momentum drags under decorative phrasing.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The ghost-conductor premise is familiar (unfinished symphony, artist haunting the site of their final work), but the water-damage-as-notation conceit offers a fresh angle. Execution transforms the trope through specific, grounded choices: stains correlated with flood patterns and seating charts, the program angled at 37 degrees, the invisible cello "strapped like armor." Emotional truth (reverence, communion with absence) avoids sentimentality until the final summary. However, the story does not take bold structural risks—it follows a linear ritual arc—and the ending's overt thematic statements retreat from complexity. Proximity check: no close echoes, but the haunted-artist-finds-peace arc is well-trodden.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Present throughout. Her choices (bringing no instrument, positioning the lantern, mirroring the ghost's conducting) create the climactic turn. However, much of her activity is observational (studying stains, wading, watching the ghost appear) until the final "performance." Her decision to leave feels like ritual completion rather than a turn that alters tactics with cost. Two gates (setup, payoff) met; middle development is thin.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The antique program appears early, is handled across multiple beats (found floating, laid flat, angled beneath lantern, stains magnified, ghost emerges from it, finally tucked into her coat dry), and its water-damaged images are the key to decoding the symphony. It constrains her method (must be angled at 37 degrees) and charges the closure (the ghost dissolves as the program dries, message complete). Strong causal pressure and closure linkage. Irreplaceability is high—no other object could serve this exact function.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"In between spaces" is named repeatedly (spaces between notes, hollows beneath stages, breath before downbeat, the hush of unstruck chords) and shapes her motivation (she listens to absences). However, it functions more as thematic accent than a stake or constraint that alters tactics on the page. The concept does not narrow options or create friction; it's a lens through which she already views the world. Present in setup and payoff (the final line: "the in between spaces finally sang"), but middle development is ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Lately inspired" is mentioned once in paragraph three as backstory context for her recent focus on absences and silence. It does not constrain or enable any on-page action, nor does it return or create a visible tradeoff. Label-only mention without causal work. Setup gate barely met; no middle or closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Disrupt" is signaled early ("her resolve to disrupt the silence") and enacted in the climax when she "disrupted the stillness not with noise, but with intention—with motion that summoned harmony from ruin." The action redefines the stakes (silence becomes song) and is causally central to the ghost's dissolution and her sense of completion. However, the disruption is enacted through invisible bowing and gestural mirroring—somewhat abstract. Present in setup, middle (her study and preparation), and payoff. Causal pressure and closure linkage are strong, though the mechanics remain metaphorical.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Water damage creating images is introduced early (ink blurred into ghostly silhouettes, stains as notes), developed in the middle (she correlates stains with recordings and flood patterns, realizes "the images weren't random—they were sheet music"), and pays off when water pools in the program's creases to magnify stains into glyphs and summon the ghost's face. The method shapes her weeks of study and tonight's ritual. Specificity is high (37-degree angle, magnifying with lantern and pooled water). Closure linkage is strong—the ghost emerges from the water-damaged program.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The flooded opera house is present from the opening line, pressures every choice (she wades, balances the lantern, uses floating podium, water vibrates and swirls with her "performance"), and charges the final image (the house exhales, pit settles). The setting is not mere backdrop—water depth, lantern light, and spatial choreography (pit, floating chairs, podium) enable and constrain her ritual. Micro-setting (body in water, lantern positioning) alters tactics. All three gates met with strong causal and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"Amid the hush of unstruck chords" recurs as atmospheric phrasing (opening, middle, final paragraph) but does not function as a timeframe that tightens decisions. No live clock or deadline. The scene unfolds in one continuous night without time pressure shaping her choices. Present as tone and motif, not as a temporal constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Her motivation to unravel the ghost's code is established early, drives her weeks of study, and is fulfilled in the climactic performance when the ghost conducts and she interprets. The desire is dramatized in action (correlating stains, angling the lantern, mirroring gestures). However, friction between wants and costs is minimal—she encounters no competing impulse or visible sacrifice. The motivation is singular and unopposed until resolution. Setup, middle, and payoff gates met; causal pressure moderate.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Wordless conversation" is signaled ("This was their wordless conversation") and enacted in the climax (he conducts in gesture, she mirrors in invisible bowing, no dialogue). Tone is coherent and modulates from reverent study to climactic communion to quiet closure. However, the label "wordless conversation" is stated rather than purely shown, and the tone does not face tonal friction or complication—it remains uniformly hushed and reverent throughout. Present in setup and payoff; middle development is atmospheric rather than pressure-driven.</comment>
