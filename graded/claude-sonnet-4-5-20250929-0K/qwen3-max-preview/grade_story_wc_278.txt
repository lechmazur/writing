<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation (hushing old guilt) is declared rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses in scene. Her past tattooing mistake is told in summary; the father's vanishing "into static" reads as metaphor rather than embodied consequence. The final choice to tether the glyph feels unmotivated by prior on-page struggle—she simply performs the ritual without visible cost or internal resistance. Interiority relies on stock phrasing ("voice cracking like thawing ice") and the epiphany arrives without earned causality.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed: who she is and where she stands spatially remain vague past 120 words (−0.4). The closure unit—tethering the glyph to the machine—occurs on the page, but the cost is asserted rather than shown: "the firmware wept" and "static dissolved into sighs" are metaphorical claims, not dramatized consequences that alter her options. The causal lens is ambiguous: the amber insect's transformation and the letter-writing feel like parallel symbolic gestures rather than because/therefore linkage. The father's voice emerging "clear and warm" resolves the guilt without visible price paid by the protagonist.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The lab is described vividly ("echoes of forgotten lullabies hummed beneath glass jars") but remains a static backdrop; no spatial constraint shapes her choices. The amber returns at closure and the cradle's resonance shifts, but these do not alter tactics—they serve as symbolic markers. The body and tools (needles, ink, wax) are mentioned but not used in ways that constrain her final action. Sensory detail is dense but ornamental, not integrated into decision-making.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake (hushing dissonance of old guilt) is signaled early but remains abstract. The supposed escalation—discovering letters, the machine's accusatory cries—does not narrow her options; she proceeds to the ritual without visible tradeoff or cost. The father's voice thanking her is a coincidental resolution: the machine itself provides absolution rather than her choice forfeiting something on the page. No tightening forecloses a live option; the ending grants her peace without dramatized price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Theme (forgiveness, translating sorrow into bearability) emerges through symbolic objects (amber, letters, constellation) but the ending states the moral directly: "she'd ink them maps not to lost children, but to forgiveness." The glyph multiplying into "Cradle Major, the Great Soother" reads as wish fulfillment rather than a non-literal answer earned by prior particulars. The piece leans on prompt labels ("haunted firmware," "regrets given voice") instead of letting scene work generate meaning. One genuine moment: the letter to her seventeen-year-old self acknowledges complicity, though it arrives via reflection rather than scene pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited, but perceptual signature is generic: "trembling like a newborn's breath," "voice cracking like thawing ice" are stock images. Diction oscillates between lyric register ("meteor hush tone," "aurora") and plain narration without consistent POV filter. The machine's dialogue ("You left me in the static") and the father's final line feel convenient rather than filtered through her perception. Psychic distance is controlled, but the voice lacks specificity—sentences could belong to any fantasy narrator.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Severe overwriting throughout: nearly every sentence stacks metaphor or elevated diction ("origami paper pressed too hard," "threads of aurora," "thawing ice"). Mixed metaphors appear ("firmware that replays screams as lullabies," "vacuum tubes throbbing with violet light" alongside "meteor hush") without coherent vehicle logic. Paraphrase loops: "the cries softened" / "static dissolved into sighs" / "screams unraveled into yawns" repeat the same content. Template cadence runs in the climax: "She sang… The firmware stuttered. The cries softened. She tethered…" Figurative density in peak beats (−0.6), mixed metaphors (−0.5), loops (−0.4), and register drift into elevated diction clash with the POV's practical task (−0.4). Artifacts touch closure (−1.7 total deduction applied). Final third artifact presence disallows 9+ globally and caps high-band entries at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The core premise (tattooist who tethers souls via star maps, haunted firmware translating baby cries) assembles multiple speculative tropes without a unifying logic. The amber-insect-as-glyph transformation and letter-to-younger-self feel like checklist responses to prompt elements rather than organic synthesis. Emotional beats (guilt, forgiveness, peace) follow a template arc. The "Cradle Major" constellation and "Great Soother" title read as convenient labels. No fresh inflection distinguishes this from countless redemption-through-mystical-craft stories; specificity is sacrificed for ornamental detail.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The constellation tattooist is named early (setup gate met) and performs the final tethering action (payoff gate met), but her choices do not create key turns—she executes a ritual rather than deciding under pressure. Middle development is weak: discovering letters and writing to herself are reflective gestures, not causal choices that alter tactics. Swappability: another mystical artisan could perform the same arc with minor edits (−0.6). Late causal involvement and ornamental backstory limit the score.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The amber appears early in the first third (setup +0.5), is placed on the console mid-story (beat 1 +0.4), and the insect crawls out to become a glyph at closure (beat 2 +0.9, closure linkage +0.9). However, the transformation mechanism is unexplained and feels arbitrary; any magical object could serve the same function (swappability −0.6). The amber does not constrain her choice—it simply provides the glyph when needed. Cost connection is absent: no price is paid for using the amber.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Haunted firmware (Model L-7) is introduced early (setup +0.5) and present at closure when it "weeps" and softens (payoff +0.7). It shapes one beat: the machine's accusatory cries ("You left me in the static") create emotional pressure (beat +0.4). However, the firmware does not constrain her tactics—she proceeds with the ritual regardless. The concept remains thematic decoration; removing it and replacing with any other guilt-amplifying device would not change her arc (swappability −0.7). Summary-only resolution: the firmware's redemption is told, not dramatized (−0.6).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.3</grade><comment>The attribute (translates baby cries) is established early (setup +0.5) and mentioned in the climax when cries form words and then soften (payoff +0.7). It provides emotional color but does not constrain or enable her action—the translation happens passively through the machine, not through her choices (ornamental −0.8). No visible tradeoff: she does not wrestle with whether or how to translate; the firmware does the work (label-only −0.3). The trait could be removed and the guilt-hushing arc would remain intact.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The tether action appears early as her craft signature (setup +0.5), is performed at closure when she tethers the glyph to the machine's core (payoff +1.2), and arguably shapes the middle beat when she presses her arm to the amber to receive the glyph (beat involvement +0.4, though this is weak). The tether is the climactic move and specific to her role (irreplaceability +0.5). However, the mechanics are vague: "tethered… using ink mixed with her own blood and dust" reads as ritual description rather than a causal choice with visible cost. The action enables the ending but does not narrow prior options or force a tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Handwritten letters are introduced in the first third inside the cradle's false bottom (setup +0.6) and she writes a letter to her younger self mid-story (beat 1 +0.4). At closure, she tucks the discovered letters into her satchel to bury under a willow (payoff +0.7). The method shapes two beats and recurs at the ending (beat involvement +0.9). However, the letters are primarily reflective devices; they do not constrain her ritual or force a trade-off. The self-addressed letter provides emotional texture but is not causally necessary—she could have confronted her guilt through direct action instead (swappability −0.5). Cost is implied (acknowledging shame) but not dramatized on the page.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The laboratory of lost sounds is named early (setup +0.5) and houses the machine at closure (payoff +0.5). Sensory detail is rich (echoes, glass jars, gramophones) but the setting does not constrain her choices—she moves freely and the space provides props rather than pressure (ornamental −0.8). Micro-setting elements (cradle, amber, machine console) are present but treated as symbolic markers rather than tactical constraints. The lab's "meteor hush tone" shifts from calming to accusatory, but this is asserted mood rather than spatial pressure that alters her moves.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>Time folding "in on itself like origami paper" is mentioned once in the first third (setup +0.3) and again at closure when "time stitching itself back together" (payoff +0.5). The timeframe does not shape her decisions—no clock tightens, no deadline forces urgency. The folding time is thematic decoration; removing it would not alter her arc (ornamental −0.9, swappability −0.7). The element appears in summary rather than constraining tactics on the page.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The motivation (hush the dissonance of old guilt) is stated early: "She'd come here to hush the dissonance of old guilt—not just the machine's, but her own" (setup +0.6). It drives the letter-writing beat (beat +0.4) and the final tethering action (closure +0.9). However, the guilt is told in backstory (the misaligned constellation, the father's vanishing) rather than dramatized in present friction. No on-page choice pits her desire for peace against a competing cost—she proceeds to ritual without visible sacrifice (told-only −0.7). The motivation is functional but not conflicted in scene.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Meteor hush is introduced early ("low, resonant, like a falling star swallowed by snow") and recurs at closure ("no longer a warning, but a lullaby") (setup +0.5, payoff +0.8). The tone shifts from accusatory to soothing, charging the final image slightly (closure linkage +0.4). However, the tone is asserted through narration rather than modulating sentence rhythm or diction under pressure—syntax remains lush and metaphor-dense throughout. Static mood dominates: lyric register does not tighten or breathe with scene needs (single static mood −0.6). The meteor hush is a label more than an enacted tonal quality.</comment>
