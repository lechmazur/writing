<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elira's interior is concrete and particular—"the operatively gentle cadence of someone who had buried too many compromises"—with embodied emotion (tracing grooves, feeling resolve beneath ribs). The solitary design limits relationship pressure; her motivation to return after failure shows endurance with cost. However, the final choice (soldiers signing) feels externalized; we lack internal contradiction or a micro-choice under pressure that forecloses a visible path for *her*. The ending reads as ceremonial completion rather than a protagonist decision that alters her own stance with legible sacrifice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors early (terrace, midsummer, triple moons, Elira alone). The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: density increases through layered ritual preparation (clipboard, ink, pen, writing clauses) culminating in soldiers arriving and signing. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—peace is "mustered" via ceremony, and the final image ("not because peace had come, but because...it had been mustered") reconfigures the dominant stake with conceptual cost (decades of failure, "the courage to return"). The cost is felt in her history and the smudged thumbprints, though the physical act of signing is done by others, slightly externalizing agency. One meaningful deepening is present; escalation coheres under the textural lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The terrace is vivid and purposeful: volcanic stone, central dais, triple-moon gaze. Sensory detail (burnt sage, distant rain, starlight shifting ink hue) is selective and POV-filtered. The terrace's ritual history constrains Elira's tactic—she resurrects the oath tradition anchored to this specific location. The ebony clipboard, meteorite ink, and dove-bone pen function as micro-setting elements that charge the final act. Spatial choreography (soldiers climbing, standing shoulder-to-shoulder) is clear. The triple moons and battlefield below anchor the moment without tourism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—anchoring peace through ceremony—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates texturally: Elira prepares alone, writes clauses, then summons soldiers who choose to sign. One tightening occurs when the soldiers arrive and face the mirror-treaty choice; their signing forecloses the old battle-line stance with visible cost (smudged thumbprints blending, symbolic of compromise). The escalation is accumulative rather than causal-reversal, fitting the inferred lens. However, Elira's own agency at closure is muted—she orchestrates but does not herself choose under visible pressure in the final beat. The cost is conceptual (decades of failure) and relational (soldiers' consent) but not sharply personal for the protagonist at the ending.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—redemption's price measured in courage to return after failure, ritual as binding strategy—emerges from concrete acts (writing with meteorite ink, soldiers pressing thumbs) without overt thesis. The clipboard's evolving inscriptions (scratched names, layered text) and the mirror-treaty metaphor avoid allegory. Subtext operates in gesture (kneeling in preparation not prayer, silence before speech). The final image reweights prior material: "mustered—not through conquest, but through ritual significance" answers the story's question with earned resonance. No explain-everything moralizing; the ending trusts implication. Minor slip: "operatively gentle" and "anchor ideals in practice" edge toward prompt-label phrasing in interiority, but the scene work dominates.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited with stable distance; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent—Elira notices grooves in ebony, meteorite ink hue, soldiers' hollowed eyes—filtered through her diplomat-mourner lens. Diction is elevated and poetic ("threading the sacred into the political") but remains voice-coherent. The single line of dialogue ("This is not a treaty. It is a mirror...") serves the beat and carries subtext. However, the prose frequently leans into elevated register that risks distancing from embodied immediacy: "operatively gentle cadence," "threading the sacred into the political," "flawed beauty of a heart still willing to try." These phrases read as authored rather than felt. Psychic distance is intentional but occasionally obscures micro-choices. No filter-verb stacks or mid-paragraph POV leakage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies; sentence openings shift. Information density is high (each line advances ritual preparation or thematic weight). However, overwriting pervades: nearly every sentence in the opening third carries figurative or elevated diction ("shield and scripture," "graveyard of ideals," "wound," "ghost," "cosmic witness") without teaching a pattern or creating lyric breath. Mixed metaphors appear: "altar" and "gods turned away" clash with the meteorite-ink science. The final third eases slightly but retains dense metaphor ("gravity they could not name," "mosaic of consent"). Paraphrase loops: lines 11–12 restate resolve-building without added pressure. Template cadence in the writing sequence (lines 14–16) stacks "she wrote" stems. These artifacts dull momentum in peak beats. Apply −0.8 for density + coherence + loops, and −0.3 for presence in closure third (final paragraph retains elevated diction that slightly obscures the image). Total: baseline 7.3 − 1.1 = 6.2.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The forever-war negotiator returning to a ritual terrace is a specific synthesis of familiar tropes (war-weary diplomat, sacred site, ceremonial peace). The meteorite ink and dove-bone pen add texture; the mirror-treaty framing is purposeful. The final turn—peace "mustered" through ceremony rather than won—grows from established ritual logic. However, the core emotional arc (lone negotiator tries once more) and resolution (collective signing as redemption) follow a recognizable template. The prose aims for lyric originality but leans on stock metaphors (graveyard of ideals, altar, gods, shield and scripture). Transformation is present but incremental. No close echoes of famous lines, yet the piece does not take bold structural or moral risks beyond its premise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elira is on-page throughout (setup ✓), prepares the ritual (development ✓), and lifts the clipboard at closure (payoff ✓). Her choices—kneeling, writing, summoning—shape two beats (preparation, writing). However, the decisive act (soldiers signing) is theirs, not hers; she orchestrates but does not herself decide under pressure at closure. Her observation and facilitation dominate. Causal pressure is moderate; she enables the outcome but does not narrow her own options with visible cost in the final beat. Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure presence +0.5 (passive), specificity +0.3. Late-agency externalization −0.4. Total: 3.0 + 2.2 − 0.4 = 5.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The ebony clipboard appears throughout: clutched in opening (setup ✓), laid on dais and traced (development ✓), lifted at closure (payoff ✓). It is handled in three beats (opening, writing, lifting) with evolving meaning—shield/scripture, then archive of failed treaties, then vessel for new pact. Its surface (scratched names, layered text) shapes Elira's reflection and the soldiers' signing. Causal role: the clipboard's ritual history anchors the summoning tactic. Closure linkage strong: lifted into moonlight as binding symbol. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +0.8, closure +1.2, specificity +0.5. Total: 3.0 + 4.5 = 7.5, capped at 7.2 for slight swappability (another ritual object could serve with edits).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The price of redemption is stated in line 7 ("measured not in coin or blood, but in the courage to return after every failure") and echoed in the final line ("the quiet, operatively gentle courage to begin again"). It shapes Elira's stake—returning despite decades of failure—and charges her kneeling and writing as payments. The soldiers' signing (smudged thumbprints) visualizes shared cost. Setup ✓ (line 7), development ✓ (writing as offering), payoff ✓ (ending echo). However, the concept is named twice rather than fully dramatized through tactical friction or a visible forfeiture that alters her options. The cost is thematic and historical, not a sharp on-page trade-off. Early signal +0.5, one beat (writing) +0.4, closure echo +0.5, thematic linkage +0.4. Theme-only delivery −0.5, label repetition −0.2. Total: 3.0 + 1.8 − 0.7 = 6.1.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Operatively gentle" appears as a label in line 3 ("the operatively gentle cadence") and echoes in the final line. It characterizes Elira's voice and approach but does not visibly constrain or enable an on-page action with trade-off. The soldiers respond to her summons and sign, but we do not see a moment where gentleness (versus force) alters the outcome or costs her another option. Setup ✓ (line 3), payoff ✓ (echo), but development is absent—no middle beat where the trait shapes a tactical choice. Early signal +0.4, closure echo +0.4, label-only use −0.6, no middle beat (missing gate cap 3.4 would apply, but lyric reprise allows modest lift). Total: 3.0 + 0.8 − 0.6 = 4.2.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Muster" is named in line 4 ("she did not come to speak, but to muster...conviction") and returns decisively in the final line ("peace had been mustered"). The action—gathering soldiers to the terrace and securing their consent—drives the plot. Setup ✓ (line 4), development ✓ (horns summon soldiers), payoff ✓ (ending turn). Two beats (summoning, signing). However, the mechanics are ceremonial rather than physically effortful; Elira prepares and the soldiers arrive, reducing the action's tactical friction. Swappability: "gather" or "summon" could replace "muster" with minor edits. Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure +1.0, cost connection +0.3. Swappability −0.5, ornamental first use −0.3. Total: 3.0 + 2.7 − 0.8 = 5.9, rounded to 5.9; lyric reprise adds +0.8 → 6.7.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Ritual significance is established early (line 9: "cosmic witness"; line 10: "resurrect that tradition") and shapes the entire tactic—Elira uses the terrace's sacred history, meteorite ink, and oath ceremony to bind the soldiers. Setup ✓ (lines 9–10), development ✓ (writing with ritual materials), payoff ✓ (soldiers sign under triple moons, fulfilling the tradition). The method is inseparable from the stakes; remove ritual and the closure mechanism collapses. Three beats (tradition invoked, ink/pen prepared, signing). Causal pressure high: the ritual's credibility enables the soldiers' consent. Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal +1.2, closure +1.4, irreplaceability +0.7. Total: 3.0 + 5.4 = 8.4, capped at 6.9 due to slight abstraction (the ritual's binding power is asserted more than tested on-page).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The ancient terrace is present throughout: Elira climbs to it (setup ✓), uses the central dais for writing (development ✓), and the soldiers arrive there at closure (payoff ✓). The setting supplies resources (dais, triple-moon witness, spatial separation from battlefield) that anchor the ritual tactic. Three beats (arrival, preparation, convergence). The terrace's history and cosmic witness enable the oath ceremony; its remoteness filters participants. Causal role strong: location is inseparable from the method. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal +1.0, closure +1.0, specificity +0.5. Total: 3.0 + 4.5 = 7.5, lightly capped at 7.0 for modest spatial pressure (the terrace hosts but does not constrain choices as sharply as a resource-scarcity or access-denial micro-setting might).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The timeframe "during the slow dance of celestial bodies" appears in the opening and "triple moon's gaze" recurs, but the celestial motion does not tighten decisions. Midsummer and the moons set atmosphere; no on-page clock or deadline alters Elira's moves. The soldiers arrive "as dawn's first blush" nears, but this is outcome not pressure. Setup ✓ (opening line), payoff ✓ (dawn mentioned), but development is absent—no middle beat where time narrows options. Two-gate minimum met (setup + payoff) allows ~4.6 cap. Ornamental first use −0.5, static clock −0.3. Total: 3.0 + 0.5 (lyric reprise) − 0.8 = 2.7; allowing lyric grace + atmospheric coherence lifts to 3.8.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elira's motivation—"to anchor ideals in practice" (line 12)—is named and dramatized through her ritual preparation and writing. Setup ✓ (line 12), development ✓ (writing clauses as binding acts), payoff ✓ (final line: "through ritual significance"). The desire drives two beats (preparation, writing) and charges closure. However, friction between want and cost is stated ("decades of ceasefires that crumbled") rather than tested in a present trade-off. Her conviction is affirmed, not conflicted, at closure. Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure +0.8, cost connection +0.4. Told-only friction −0.5, label repetition −0.3. Total: 3.0 + 2.6 − 0.8 = 4.8; thematic coherence and closure echo lift to 6.4.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Flawed beauty is coherent: Elira's scarred conviction, smudged thumbprints, "imperfect mosaic of consent," and the recurring phrase "flawed beauty of a heart still willing to try" anchor tone. Setup ✓ (line 20), present throughout (scratched names, ash-dulled armor), payoff ✓ (final image of imperfect beginning). The tone modulates—solitary resolve, ceremonial gravity, collective hesitance—without breaking. It charges the closure image (peace mustered imperfectly). Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure +1.2, modulation +0.5. Label repetition (line 20 phrases the tone explicitly) −0.4. Total: 3.0 + 3.7 − 0.4 = 6.3; coherence across pressure lifts to 6.6.</comment>
