<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The mender's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete gestures (ribbon in pocket, humming her mother's tune), and the daughter's absence creates palpable pressure. Internal contradiction emerges in the tension between persistence and the wound of rejection. However, the final "footprints beside her" and green fabric feel unmotivated—no prior scene work earns the daughter's physical arrival, weakening the cost of the mender's endurance. The choice to persist is declared more than tested in a crucible moment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors early (quartz-eye mender, cathedral orchard, post-Guild-expulsion). The accumulative lens holds: vow-gathering intensifies through the ribbon-stitching beat, and the green fabric arrival offers a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) that reweights the mender's solitary labor. Cost is visible in her solitary vigil and the daughter's hesitant, incomplete return. The daughter's footprints and fabric, however, arrive without prior causal setup—coincidence complicates but nearly resolves, blurring the line and preventing full 8+ entry.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The cathedral-orchard hybrid is vivid and purposeful: vow-trees, honey-coated spoon, ivy ladder, and thorn-caught fabric all constrain or enable the mender's actions. Sensory selection (moonlight through fruit-laden boughs, dew on cheeks) reflects POV and pressure. The spatial logic of rafters, altar, and doorway tracks cleanly. The recurring tools (spoon, honey, silver thread) anchor micro-setting and charge the closure image, meeting the 9+ gate requirement that environment shapes tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—bridging generational wisdom—is signaled early and coheres through vow-gathering. The daughter's vow ("I will never understand you") provides one meaningful tightening when it resists retrieval, forcing the mender to use honey and patience. The green fabric constitutes a micro-turn that narrows the mender's solitude and reweights her persistence. Cost is visible in her solitary sleep and the daughter's hesitant, partial return. However, the footprints and fabric lack prior causal grounding, reducing the sense that the protagonist's tactics earned the shift.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—repair across generations requires patience and the right tools—emerges from particulars (vows as fallen foliage, honey for coaxing, silver thread for stitching) without overt moralizing. The final image of the green fabric caught on a thorn offers a non-literal answer: reconciliation begins with return, not resolution. "Accidental wisdom" is dramatized rather than stated. Slight thematic echo in the closing paragraph ("wisdom...grows best when tended across generations") trends toward summary, but the honey-spoon image and footprints anchor the insight in scene.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable in close third, the mender's perceptual signature filtering the orchard through craft metaphors (gears, lenses, vows as foliage). Diction is consistent and voice-particular ("endearingly feisty," "sticky with unresolved emotion"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully, tightening at the vow-retrieval beat. No head-hopping. The dream sequence is brief and anchored. Rhythm varies appropriately, with shorter sentences during the vow-coaxing beat. Internal thought remains character-bound; no filter-verb stacks or therapy-speak in peak moments.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prose is largely clean with varied syntax and strong verbs. Information density is high in the vow-gathering beats. However, paraphrase loops appear: "She didn't believe in redemption; she believed in repair" followed immediately by "Gears could be cleaned, lenses polished, vows rewoven" restates the same idea. "Endearingly feisty" is repeated twice with near-identical phrasing ("endearingly feisty, stubborn as a root" / "Endearingly feisty, indeed"), creating synonym churn. Template cadence in the opening third ("She pulled...," "She'd come...," "Her hands...") stacks similar stems. These artifacts apply −0.6 cumulatively in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The cathedral-orchard fusion and vows-as-deciduous-foliage offer a fresh premise. The mender's craft metaphors (quartz-eye, honey spoon, silver thread) are specific and non-generic. However, the emotional arc—estranged parent seeking reconciliation through symbolic labor, child's partial return—follows a recognizable template. The green fabric twist is gentle but not surprising. Transformation is present in world-building detail, but the core parent-child reconciliation shape remains familiar. Risk-taking in the lyric accumulation and magical-realist setting adds texture without fundamentally altering the template.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The quartz-eye mender makes multiple on-page choices: deciding to gather vows, climbing the ladder to retrieve the daughter's vow, using honey to coax it, stitching it to the ribbon, and choosing to persist after waking. These decisions shape the middle beats and closure. Early setup (opening paragraph), middle development (vow retrieval), and closure participation (packing tools with renewed care) all present. Causal pressure is visible; her choices enable the ending's charge. The footprints and green fabric complicate her solitude, but her decision to persist and climb again drives the final image.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The daughter's hair ribbon appears in beat one (tucked in coat pocket), beat two (reminder of why she persists), and the climax (stitched to the retrieved vow with silver thread). The ribbon's meaning evolves from loss marker to repair substrate, and the stitched combination "pulsed faintly, warm" under the mender's touch. Early setup, middle causal use (stitching the vow), and closure linkage (green fabric arrival contrasts with the blue ribbon's absence) all present. The ribbon's specificity (faded blue, frayed edges) and its repurposing at the vow-stitching beat make it nearly indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Deciduous vows structure the entire narrative: vows fall like foliage, the mender gathers them, reads them, and stitches one to the ribbon. The concept shapes her tactics (honey to coax stubborn vows) and stakes (bridging generational wisdom through vow-repair). Early setup (second paragraph: "deciduous vows, ancient promises shed like foliage"), middle development (vow retrieval beat), and closure participation (the green fabric as a new vow-equivalent) all present. The concept is causally active, not merely thematic. Removing it collapses the story's logic and the mender's specific craft.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Endearingly feisty" is mentioned twice, applied to the daughter. It frames the mender's affection and explains the daughter's initial rejection, but does not constrain an on-page action with visible cost. The trait is told rather than shown in the daughter's behavior (she does not appear on the page). Setup present (paragraph six), but no middle development or closure participation beyond the implied link to the footprints. The trait remains label-level and does not alter the mender's tactics or the ending's charge in a specific, irreplaceable way.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"Persist" structures the narrative: the mender climbs, gathers vows, coaxes the daughter's vow, sleeps beneath the altar, wakes to footprints, and resolves to climb again. The action is declared early ("she must persist"), dramatized in the middle (vow-retrieval and stitching), and reaffirmed at closure ("She would persist"). It is irreplaceable—swapping "persist" for "search" or "wait" would lose the story's thematic core. Early setup, middle causal development (coaxing and stitching as persistence under resistance), and closure participation (packing tools with renewed care) all present. Cost is visible in solitary labor and partial reconciliation.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The forgotten bag's contents are introduced early (paragraph seven: rusted magnifier, silver thread, clock springs) and used in two beats: the honey-spoon retrieval (paragraph twenty-four) and the final packing (closing paragraph). The method is specific and irreplaceable—Guild-dismissed tools enable the mender's non-standard repair. Early setup, middle development (honey and spoon coax the vow), and closure participation (packing tools with renewed care) all present. The method shapes tactics and thematically reinforces the story's anti-bureaucratic stance. Causal pressure is visible; the tools enable success where Guild-sanctioned methods would not.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The cathedral-orchard setting is established immediately and pressures every choice: the mender kneels among fallen pears, climbs a ladder woven from ivy and hymnals, reaches for vows dangling from branches, and sleeps beneath the altar. The setting supplies resources (vow-trees, honey, thorn-caught fabric) that alter outcome. Early setup (paragraph two), middle development (ladder climb, vow retrieval constrained by branch recoil), and closure participation (footprints leading to the exit, fabric caught on thorn) all present. The setting is irreplaceable—removing the cathedral-orchard collapses spatial logic, magical-realist conceit, and symbolic resonance. Micro-setting (tools, body, altar) charges the final image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"After the breach of contract" frames the inciting incident and explains the mender's presence in the cathedral. It is mentioned in paragraph two and referenced once more ("a life before bureaucracy"). The timeframe does not tighten decisions or create a live clock; the mender's labor unfolds without visible time pressure. Setup present, but no middle development or closure participation. The timeframe is context rather than constraint—swapping "after the breach" for "after retirement" would not alter tactics or the ending's charge. The element is functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The motivation—to bridge generational wisdom before the daughter forgets—is declared early (paragraph three), dramatized in the vow-gathering and ribbon-stitching beats, and tested at closure when the daughter's partial return (footprints, green fabric) validates but does not complete the bridge. Early setup, middle development (retrieving and stitching the daughter's vow), and closure participation (packing tools with hope, not absolution) all present. The motivation is conflicted and shapes the mender's choices under pressure. Visible cost: solitary labor, the daughter's continued absence, and the mender's acceptance of incremental progress rather than resolution.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Accidental wisdom" is named once (paragraph thirty-one: "her mother used to call such moments") and dramatized through the green fabric discovery—the mender sought reconciliation but found evidence of return instead. Tone is coherent and modulates from solitary determination to surprised laughter. The tone charges the final image by reweighting the mender's labor as fruitful despite incompleteness. Early setup (implicit in vow-gathering as trial-and-error), closure participation (laughter, "accidental wisdom" line), but no middle development beat where the tone is explicitly tested. The tone is present and purposeful but not causally active across beats.</comment>
