<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The calligrapher's wilting trait creates consistent pressure and her motivation is clear, but her interiority remains largely observational rather than torn by contradictory impulses. The final shift—from seeking to becoming archive—is stated rather than earned through a dramatized internal struggle with visible cost. Minor supporting characters (child, sleepers) are ornamental; the piece functions as a solo journey through accumulative discovery without meaningful relational friction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The map-following structure provides clear causality through discrete discoveries (postal plate → child's note → chest of letters), and the final decision to become the archive constitutes a Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost (she abandons the search mode and accepts the burden of witness). Orientation is clean by the first paragraph. The cost—carrying the weight of testimony—is legible in the final image, though the turning point could be more compressed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The greenhouse city is vividly rendered with purposeful sensory detail (ochre sky, ghost vines, UV orchids, condensation) that directly affects the protagonist's wilting and route choices. The toxic atmosphere and ambient untruths create embodied pressure ("pressed a damp cloth to her forehead"). The zinc fragment functions as a tactile compass; the map guides spatial navigation through named atriums. Environmental constraints shape every movement and charge the final return into "emerald haze."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding where lost conversations pool—is signaled early and pursued across three discovery beats (plate, child's note, chest). The wilting trait generates physiological cost at each step, narrowing options. The final decision to become the archive constitutes a meaningful deepening with visible cost (she trades the search for the burden of witness), though the protagonist's agency leans more toward discovery than hard choice between competing goods.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: the contrast between propaganda murals and whispered confessions, the rice-paper note's bergamot scent, the origami birds. "They'd been waiting—not for rescue, but for witness" reframes the quest without moralizing. The oasis-to-archive transformation offers a resonant answer to the central question. Minor slip: "candor in small moments" echoes the prompt slightly, though it's mostly dramatized through found objects rather than asserted.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature (calligraphic glyphs, "emotional syntax," sensory filtering through craft). Diction remains controlled and voice-specific ("ligatures of longing, marginalia of memory"). The child's dialogue is brief but naturalistic. Minor filter-verb accumulation in the discovery sequence ("she found," "she realized") slightly dulls immediacy, but overall the prose maintains coherent psychic distance and the final image holds voice integrity under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully, sentence openings are diverse, and figurative language (sky "pressed like a bruise," silence "pooled like standing water") is vivid without overwriting. Information density is high; most lines advance discovery or atmosphere. Minor issues: "She realized then" is a mild tell scaffold, and one paraphrase loop near the ending ("not for rescue, but for witness" / "someone who could bear their weight") slightly reduces propulsion. No grammar errors; clarity is strong throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The greenhouse-city setting and wilting-near-dishonesty trait combine into a specific synthesis. The quest for pooled conversations transforms the familiar "lost knowledge" trope through calligraphic detail and sensory archives. The ending—becoming archive rather than completing the map—offers a non-obvious turn. However, the map-under-floorboards discovery and the chest-of-letters payoff follow recognizable adventure-quest beats without radical structural risk.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The gilded-leaf calligrapher is present throughout and makes the key final decision to become the archive. Her choices (following the map, reading letters aloud, packing them) drive all major beats. The wilting trait constrains her route. Early signal, multi-beat involvement, and closure linkage are strong; cost is present but the decision feels more inevitable than agonized.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The zinc-etched postal plate fragment appears early as compass, is handled physically ("cold against her palm, humming faintly"), and enables navigation to the first echo. It is wrapped in silk at the end, marking its role as complete. Two-beat involvement and early signal are solid, but it does not return with reweighted meaning at closure—packed away rather than transformed.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Candor in small moments" is embodied through the rice-paper note, unsent letters, and the child's lullaby—each discovery advances the stake. The concept shapes the protagonist's motivation and final stance as witness. However, it functions more as thematic frame than active constraint that narrows a choice; the protagonist never faces a dilemma between candor and its cost, only accumulates evidence of it.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Wilts near dishonesty" is signaled early and constrains on-page action repeatedly: she presses a damp cloth to her forehead, breathes through her sleeve, and her reversal ("color returned to her cheeks") is tied to reading the letters aloud. The trait drives spatial navigation (avoiding falsified murals) and provides embodied cost. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage; specificity is high.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Reread" is the climactic action: she spends the night rereading map scraps, then reads the letters aloud in the chamber, which reverses her wilting and crystallizes her new role. The action is irreplaceable—passive discovery would not generate the same witness-transformation. Early setup (restoring a scroll when she finds the map) and multi-beat involvement; directly shapes the ending.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Piecing together the shredded treasure map is signaled early ("spent the night rereading each scrap, cross-referencing glyph shapes") and its mechanics matter: the map's symbols guide her through forgotten atriums, and matching the postal plate to a routing sigil drives navigation. The method shapes two beats (decoding, following) and enables discovery of the chest. Solid setup, development, and payoff.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The sprawling greenhouse city under toxic sky is present from the opening line and pressures every choice: the ochre glow stains perception, ambient untruths trigger wilting, humidity and leaking pipes define the search space. Sector 7's defunct mail hub, Atrium Theta, and the filtration chamber are named and function as waypoints. The setting supplies the archive's hiding place and charges the final return into "emerald haze." Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"After the oasis dries" frames the inciting condition (no more whispered confessions) and motivates the search. "Yesterday" anchors the map discovery; "by dawn" marks decoding completion; "since the oasis dried" recurs. The timeframe shapes urgency ("She had not slept") and the ending imagines future refilling "drop by drop, word by word." Setup and thematic payoff are clear, but the timeframe does not tighten a mid-story decision.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"To find where lost conversations go" is stated early and dramatized through every beat: decoding the map, following glyphs, uncovering notes and letters. The protagonist's wilting creates friction between desire and physical cost. The final shift—from finding to archiving—reconfigures the motivation with felt burden. Strong setup, multi-beat development, and closure linkage; the motivation drives all choices.</comment>
