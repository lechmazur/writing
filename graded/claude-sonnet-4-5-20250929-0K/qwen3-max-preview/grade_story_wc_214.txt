<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The janitor's motivation is consistent—seeking strength in vulnerability through witnessing stellar deaths—and his backstory (Grand Celestial Archive transfer) provides clear grounding. However, interiority leans heavily toward poetic meditation rather than embodied contradiction under pressure; the comet encounter produces tears and recognition but no meaningful choice that forecloses a path. The final return to sweeping reads as affirmation rather than earned transformation with visible cost, limiting the score despite clear voice and stable characterization.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (janitor, tracking station, Andromeda Drift) arrive early and remain stable. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: the comet's arrival and dissolution deepen the established pattern of "flourishing stillness" rather than creating a causal reversal. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (the janitor's recognition and return to sweeping), but the cost remains largely emotional rather than visibly foreclosing a path or altering tactics. The rogue comet's unlogged bloom charges the ending image, yet no on-page decision or renunciation creates a legible before/after.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The tracking station is vividly particular ("wind-chime sensors," "analog dials"), and the yellow lantern glass anchors multiple beats with concrete handling. Spatial choreography is clean (deck, scope, console), and sensory details (star-dust whispering, embers, gravitational sigh) filter through the janitor's reverent attention. The setting does not constrain a choice or alter tactics at closure, capping the score below 9.0, but the micro-setting (lantern glass as lens) charges the final image and the station's hum aligns with the thematic release.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—honoring celestial deaths to find strength in vulnerability—is signaled early and remains coherent. The rogue comet's arrival provides one meaningful deepening (it dances, plunges, blooms in stillness), but the janitor's response is witnessing rather than agency; no decision narrows options or trades off competing goods. The comet resolves itself (unravels into efflorescence) without protagonist intervention, and the return to sweeping reaffirms rather than transforms his stance. Pressure accumulates but does not tighten into a choice with visible cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The theme of flourishing stillness emerges organically from action (tracing meteors, the comet's bloom, the final sweeping) and image (yellow lantern glass, star-dust, gravitational sigh). The poet-astronomer's journal line ("Stillness blooms where motion surrenders") primes the ending without moralizing, and the janitor's whispered "Thank you for remembering how to be still" offers a resonant, non-literal answer. However, the thematic statement risks directness in the final third, and the arc from cataloger to janitor borders on allegorical convenience rather than emergent complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and purposeful: elevated diction ("efflorescence," "benediction," "primal elegance") matches the janitor's spiritual curiosity and former academic role. POV remains stable in close third, and perceptual signature (filtering stars through memory and soul, not instruments) is character-specific. Syntactic rhythm modulates with pressure (short breaths during the comet's plunge, longer cadences during sweeping). Register occasionally drifts into abstract lyricism ("vulnerability wearing its most radiant armor") that risks authorial intrusion, but the voice remains coherent and embodied throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Figurative density is high and mostly coherent ("sky wept embers," "gravitational sigh," "ink in water"), but several beats stack metaphors without functional pressure ("hymn to impermanence sung in fire and silence," "radiant armor"). Paraphrase loops appear: "He did not mourn... he honored" and "not upward... but downward" repeat structure without advancing momentum. Sentence openings vary, and information density is strong in the comet sequence, but overwriting in reflective passages ("countless farewells," "patient dark," "sweet as breath after crying") slows momentum. No clarity breaks at closure, limiting penalty reach.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The cosmic janitor as spiritual practitioner offers a fresh angle, and the yellow lantern glass as empathic tool (not instrument) transforms trope expectation. However, the arc from institutional cataloger to solitary witness follows a familiar renunciation template, and the comet's self-resolving bloom risks convenience. The phrase "flourishing stillness" and the poet-astronomer's journal entry feel prompt-adjacent rather than discovered through lived detail. Emotional specificity (tears of recognition, sweeping as benediction) grounds the piece, but the synthesis remains more lyrical restatement than structural surprise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The cosmic janitor is present throughout, frames the opening, and returns to sweeping at closure. However, his agency is witnessing and honoring rather than decision-making; the comet's arrival and dissolution happen to him. He raises the lantern glass, traces the arc, and weeps, but no choice alters tactics or forecloses a path. The transfer backstory seeds his motivation but does not constrain a present beat. The janitor shapes tone and theme but not plot turns.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The yellow lantern glass appears in three beats: fingertip graze (salvaged memory), held before eyes to filter streaks, and resting on console at closure. It is handled and its hue/curve are specified, but its function as lens does not mechanically constrain a choice—any filter could trace the comet. The glass carries thematic weight (memory of ancient suns, poet-astronomer's belief) and charges the final image as beacon, reaching mid-6s for purposeful reprise with reweighted meaning but lacking indispensable causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Flourishing stillness" is named explicitly ("flourishing stillness hidden within collapse") and demonstrated in the comet's bloom ("a silent bloom of light... then stilling"). It shapes the janitor's interpretive lens but does not alter on-page options or create a trade-off; he witnesses stillness rather than choosing to enact or forgo it. The concept echoes as theme in multiple beats (release, surrender, efflorescence) but remains observational rather than decisional, placing it in the functional-but-replaceable band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Spiritually curious" is stated early ("Spiritually curious by nature") and motivates his transfer and method (seeking flourishing stillness, empathy over prediction). However, the trait is label-only; no on-page action demonstrates a cost of spiritual curiosity versus practical efficiency. His choices (tracing with the lantern glass, reciting the journal line, sweeping) align with the trait but do not show a trade-off where curiosity forecloses another path. The trait colors motivation but does not constrain a beat.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Empathize" is signaled early ("to empathize with the dying light") and dramatized in the comet beat: "He closed his eyes, not to block the sight, but to feel its path inward: the heat, the resistance, the surrender." The action shapes his method (soul over instruments) and produces the recognition that charges closure (tears, whispered thanks). However, empathy is internal response rather than external turn; the comet's fate is unchanged by his empathizing. The action is essential to tone and theme but does not redefine options, landing in the 6–7 band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Tracing the path of falling stars" is established early (archival glass, central scope) and shown twice: filtering streaks through lantern glass and tracing the rogue comet's arc. The method is specific (yellow lantern glass, empathy, not instruments) and its mechanics matter to his stance. However, tracing is observation rather than intervention; the method does not shape a choice or alter the comet's outcome. It defines his practice and charges the closure image but does not drive a turn, placing it in the mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The shooting star tracking station is named early, detailed (crystalline floor, analog dials, wind-chime sensors, central scope), and spatially coherent. It provides the context for the janitor's work and the comet's arrival. However, the station does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome; the janitor could witness the comet's bloom from any vantage. The station's hum at closure adds atmospheric resonance but not causal pressure, placing it in the 5–6 band for purposeful early setup without tactical impact.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Through the hush of an overlooked era" appears in the opening line and establishes tone (forgotten by timekeepers, no alarms). The timeframe is vague rather than tracked; no live clock or deadline pressures tactics. The era's "hush" supports the stillness theme but does not tighten decisions. The station's isolation in time colors setting but does not escalate or constrain, landing in the functional-but-replaceable band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"To find strength in vulnerability" is stated explicitly ("his motivation had never been glory... to find strength in vulnerability") and dramatized in the comet beat: he honors the comet's "courage" to fall visibly and finds his own strength in recognizing its offering. The motivation shapes his interpretive stance and produces the closure emotion (tears of recognition, return to sweeping). However, vulnerability is theme rather than friction; no on-page conflict pits vulnerability against self-protection. The motivation is clear and colors the arc but does not force a trade-off, placing it in the mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Primal elegance" is embodied in diction ("crystalline floor," "velvet dark," "gravitational sigh," "breath after crying") and syntax (measured cadences, elevated register). Tone remains coherent through beats and modulates subtly: contemplative during sweeping, taut during the comet's plunge, hushed at closure. The final image ("the station hummed... its soul aligned with the rhythm of release") charges the ending with tonal resonance. The tone does not shift drastically under pressure but sustains a unified aesthetic that supports closure, placing it in the 7–8 band for coherent modulation and charged final moment.</comment>
