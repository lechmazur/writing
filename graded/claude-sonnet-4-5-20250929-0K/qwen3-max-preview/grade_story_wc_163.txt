<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation ("to learn the rhythm of belonging") remains largely interior and abstract throughout. While the piece offers embodied moments (hand to glass, breath fogging), the emotional arc relies heavily on told insights ("no longer lonely," "quiet purpose") rather than contradictory impulses dramatized in scene. The final choice to ascend feels like resolution by assertion rather than a decision forged under competing pressures with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes who, where, and when within the opening paragraph. The dominant lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the astrologer drifts through chambers, encounters fireflies, and ascends with "wonder intact." The firefly sequence offers a micro-turn, but the closure—ascending with the feather "no longer an ending"—reconfigures meaning through assertion rather than a visible or felt cost that forecloses a path. The conceptual repricing is signaled but not earned by prior pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The underwater facility is vividly rendered with concrete detail: algae-slick corridors, kelp lattice, cracked viewports. The setting constrains movement (crushing depths, pressure gauges) and the fireflies' appearance through the viewport charges the final sequence. The burnt feather functions as a micro-object that signals thresholds, satisfying the constraint test for high-band entry.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—learning belonging's rhythm—is signaled early but remains conceptual. The fireflies' arrival offers a reversal (they "shouldn't exist"), yet the protagonist's response is passive observation followed by mirrored gesture. No live choice narrows options or imposes a trade-off; the ascent is framed as carrying wonder upward rather than a decision with foreclosed alternatives. Escalation reads as atmospheric intensification without tactical cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The theme of solitude transmuted into belonging emerges through image and action: the facility "no longer empty but threaded with seam-light wonder," the fireflies arranging into an open hand. However, the final paragraph summarizes the thematic payoff ("belonging isn't found, but coaxed") rather than letting the image resonate without explication. The burnt feather's shift from ending to beginning is earned by its recurrence but stated rather than embodied at closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The narrative voice is stable and carries a consistent lyric register ("shadowseam wonder," "seam-light wonder"). However, elevated diction in peak beats ("liturgy," "cadence woven from solitude and surprise") occasionally drifts above the POV's grounded perceptual mode established in the opening. The psychic distance remains close throughout with no head-hopping, and the elision of surface context is purposeful and taught early.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The prose deploys rich figurative language throughout: "barnacle sighs," "living lanterns," "comets returning to their orbits." In the firefly sequence (peak beat), nearly every sentence carries metaphor without clear escalation of pressure, creating density without propulsion. Template cadence appears in paragraph structure: "She [verb]" openings recur across six paragraphs. Paraphrase loops appear in adjacent lines: "no longer lonely" / "no longer empty," "not haunted, but inhabited" / "shadows no longer empty but threaded."</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The combination of landscape astrologer, underwater facility, and bioluminescent fireflies in saltwater offers a fresh synthesis. The burnt feather as "tuning fork for thresholds" is a specific, non-obvious detail. However, the emotional arc—solitary seeker finds wonder and ascends transformed—follows a familiar template. The fireflies' impossible adaptation and their mimicry of the reactor schematic provide a striking image, yet the transformation test suggests the core journey could persist with different proper nouns.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The landscape astrologer is present throughout and her descent frames the piece. However, her choices are largely observational: she pauses, unrolls charts, presses her palm to glass, and whispers thanks. The decision to ascend in the final third shifts her stance, but the turn reads as conclusion rather than a choice that narrows prior options with visible cost. Two-gate presence (setup, payoff) but minimal middle development.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The burnt feather appears in three distinct beats: nestled in the satchel (setup), vibrating at the threshold moment (middle), and "no longer felt like an ending" at closure. Its function as a threshold detector shapes the astrologer's recognition of the firefly moment. The final reweighting is asserted rather than dramatically shown, and swapping it for another artifact would require only modest rewrites. All three gates present; causal involvement moderate.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Luminous respite" appears as a goal ("she sought luminous respite—not from darkness, but from disconnection") but does not constrain on-page choices. The fireflies provide luminosity, yet the concept functions as thematic label rather than tactical pressure. Setup gate present; closure tangentially echoed; middle development absent. Swappable with "solace" or "transcendence" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Softly ingenious" appears twice: once describing her repurposing of the feather, once her solitude. The trait is told rather than shown through a choice that trades cleverness for cost. The feather's use demonstrates ingenuity, but no on-page action is enabled or constrained by this specific attribute in a way that another descriptor (e.g., "resourceful") could not replace. Label-only mentions without visible tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Captivate" occurs once in the line "she captivated not them, but herself." The moment marks the astrologer's shift from observer to participant, but the action itself—exhaling and mirroring the fireflies' gesture—is completed in adjacent lines without this verb driving the turn. Introduced late (final third) and swappable with "mesmerize" or "entrance." Setup and closure gates missing.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The method—"a shared exhale spotting the first fireflies of summer"—is dramatized on the page: "She exhaled—a long, slow release of tension—and in that shared exhale, spotting the first fireflies of summer, she captivated not them, but herself." The mechanics matter: the exhale coincides with the fireflies slowing and aligning. However, the fireflies appear only in this sequence; the method is not signaled earlier or used to shape prior attempts. Setup gate missing; middle and payoff present.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The forgotten underwater city research facility is established in the opening line and grounds every beat: the astrologer navigates algae-slick corridors, pauses in the central observatory, and presses against the cracked viewport. The setting's pressure (crushing depths, rusted hatches) shapes her descent, and the viewport constrains her interaction with the fireflies. The facility's history (reactor core schematic) is mirrored by the fireflies, charging the closure. All three gates present; causal pressure strong.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"Tonight, until sunrise" is declared early and the final paragraph notes "dawn had fully claimed the sky." However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions or alter tactics on the page; no clock-driven pressure forces a choice. The sunrise marks closure but functions as atmospheric marker rather than constraint. Setup and payoff gates present; middle development absent. Time is tracked but does not shape moves.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The motivation—"to learn the rhythm of belonging"—is stated in the second paragraph and drives her descent into the facility. The firefly encounter offers a moment where she feels the rhythm, and the ascent carries it upward. The desire is dramatized through her movements and the payoff image ("belonging isn't found, but coaxed"), yet the friction between want and cost is told rather than shown in a scene choice that trades one for the other. All three gates present; conceptual cost implied but not tangible.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Shadowseam wonder" is named once and "seam-light wonder" once, establishing a tonal signature: beauty stitched into fracture. The tone coheres through the piece—kelp lattices, anglerfish lanterns, gold-green radiance—and modulates as the astrologer shifts from exile to embrace. The fireflies' impossible presence charges the final third. The tone supports the closure image and remains stable under the accumulative lens. Closure linkage strong; minor reliance on direct naming rather than purely atmospheric charge.</comment>
