<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The archivist remains a static vessel for atmospheric observation rather than a character under pressure. Her "preemptive nostalgia" is asserted repeatedly as a label without dramatized internal contradiction or cost-bearing choice. The final smile and signed raindrop read as gestures rather than decisions that foreclose options. Interiority consists largely of poetic summary ("her heart ached," "she conjectured") without embodied perception or micro-choices that alter tactics.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation Test: who, where, and when are anchored early enough. However, no meaningful closure unit is legible—the archivist ascends, measures shadows, writes conjectures, and descends without on-page decisive change, renunciation with visible cost, or conceptual repricing that reconfigures prior material. The "preemptive nostalgia" motif recurs but does not shift meaning or options. The piece reads as a single atmospheric tableau rather than a pressure sequence with before/after stakes, violating the closure requirement.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The observatory, crystal forecourt, and solidified fog are vivid and sensorily dense, filtering detail through the archivist's professional lens (shadow measurement, vellum, quill). Spatial choreography is clear—spiral stair, forecourt, descent. The setting does not constrain a choice or alter the final image; it remains postcard description despite its specificity, preventing entry to the 9-band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The stated stake—"to sculpt identity from experience"—never encounters resistance, complication, or tightening. The archivist performs her task unimpeded: she measures shadows, writes, and leaves. No reversal, deepening, or narrowing of options occurs. The "deepening hush" and "preemptive nostalgia" recur as atmospheric labels rather than escalating pressure that forces trade-offs or alters tactics.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Collective memory and the act of conjecture generate thematic texture, and the "preemptive nostalgia" motif recurs across beats. However, the theme is largely stated rather than earned through on-page friction: "not to preserve, but to resurrect," "she too would become a whisper in crystal." The final image (signing along a raindrop's refraction) gestures at resonance but lacks the felt cost or conceptual repricing that would reweight prior material. The piece telegraphs its thesis rather than dramatizing it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The prose maintains a stable lyric-descriptive voice with consistent psychic distance and lexical register. Perceptual signature is present ("shadow lengths at monuments," sensory specificity). However, the voice converges into a single elevated, poetic diction across all beats without modulation under pressure; the archivist's interior at the climax reads identically to the opening. Purposeful compression and patterned repetition are legible, but the lack of rhythmic shift or variance under emotional intensity caps the score.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Figurative density pervades nearly every sentence without pattern-teaching or payoff, creating overwriting that dulls propulsion: "drowsing beast," "memory pooled and trembling," "fossils of feeling," "tapestries no eye would see," "saturation," "chiming like frozen bells." Mixed vehicles appear ("memory pressed into stone like fossils," "whispers in crystal," "shadow-length studied"). Paraphrase loops recur: "not to record facts, but to conjecture" / "not to preserve, but to resurrect"; "preemptively nostalgic" appears three times without variation. Template cadence ("She measured," "She conjectured," "She smiled," "She walked") stacks across the final third. Apply −1.2 for density, coherence, and loop debt in Q7; additional −0.5 for artifacts touching the closure beat (final paragraph). Disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band entries at 8.8 per the Patterned-artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The core conceit—measuring collective memory through shadow lengths at a stormlit observatory—offers a fresh synthesis of lyric speculation and archival detail. However, execution leans heavily on familiar lyric-fantasy templates: the solitary scholar, ruins whispering lost civilizations, poetic self-erasure, the "warm vellum pulsed faintly with ghosts." The archivist's method (shadow measurement) and attribute (preemptive nostalgia) are asserted rather than transformed through specific on-page friction. The derivative premise combines with label-reliance to prevent higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The summer-quill archivist is present throughout and performs the central action (measuring shadows, writing conjectures). She makes no on-page decision that alters tactics or forecloses a path; her ascent, measurement, and descent proceed without complication or cost. Observation without agency trends low per the rubric. Caps: missing middle development (no choice that narrows options) → 3.4; swappable role (any scholar could perform this task with minor edits) → 3.8. Subtract −0.3 for label-only trait use ("preemptively nostalgic" asserted, not dramatized with cost). Final: 3.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The crystal whispering forecourt after rain is introduced early (paragraph 3) and described vividly across multiple beats (paragraphs 4, 20, "the crystal forecourt whispered"). However, it remains a passive backdrop for observation; the archivist kneels and listens but does not handle, use, or make a choice constrained by the object. Static description trends low. Gates: setup ✓, middle development ✗ (no choice enabled/constrained), closure ✗ (mentioned in paragraph 20 but not shaping the final image in paragraphs 27–30). Missing middle and closure → cap 2.8. Bump +0.5 for early signal and +0.4 for one beat (paragraph 20 vibration scene) and +0.4 for vivid specificity = 4.1.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Collective memory frames the premise and is described across beats (paragraphs 4, 8, 24, "collective memory made tactile"). It shapes the archivist's method (measuring shadows to read pooled memory) and is present in the closure paragraph ("she too would become a whisper," "archive"). Gates: setup ✓, middle development ✓ (guides measurement method), closure ✓ (referenced in final beat). However, the concept does not constrain a choice or generate cost; it remains thematic background. Apply +0.8 for early signal, +0.9 for two beats, +0.5 for causal pressure (guides method), +0.4 for closure linkage (final "archive" image), −0.5 for swappability (any abstract memory concept could replace it), −0.3 for summary-only use (recounted, not dramatized with friction). Base 3.0 + 1.8 = 4.8, round to 5.3 given closure presence.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Preemptively nostalgic is asserted three times (paragraphs 2, 17, 26) but never constrains an on-page action with cost. The attribute reads as a thematic label rather than a trait that enables or forecloses a choice. Label-only mentions trend low. Gates: setup ✓ (paragraph 2), middle development ✗, closure cameo (paragraph 26, "preemptively nostalgic for her own eventual erasure" is assertion, not cost-bearing choice). Missing middle development → cap 3.4; label-only −0.3; ornamental −0.3. Final: 2.8.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Conjecture is the archivist's central action, signaled early (paragraph 5, "to conjecture the emotional contours") and repeated across beats (paragraphs 9, 11, 23, final "warm with conjecture"). It shapes her method and is present in the closure paragraph. However, no turn or reversal traces to conjecture; she conjectures freely without complication or cost. Gates: all three ✓. Apply +0.8 early signal, +1.4 for three beats, +0.5 causal (guides method), +0.7 closure linkage, −0.5 swappability (any interpretive action could replace it), −0.7 for no turn created. Base 3.0 + 2.2 = 5.2; bump +1.0 for pervasive structural role = 6.2.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Examining shadow lengths at monuments is introduced in paragraph 6 ("Her method was precise") and used across paragraphs 7–11 and 22 (the Arch). The method shapes middle beats and is recalled at closure (paragraph 22, "she measured the last shadow"). Gates: all three ✓. Apply +0.8 early signal, +1.4 for three beats, +0.9 causal pressure (structures middle investigation), +0.7 closure linkage, −0.5 swappability (any divinatory method could replace it), −0.4 for no visible cost tied to the method itself. Base 3.0 + 2.9 = 5.9.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The stormlit observatory above clouds is introduced in the opening line and present across beats (paragraphs 1, 19, 28). The setting provides sensory texture and frames the action but does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; the archivist's task proceeds unimpeded. Gates: all three ✓. Apply +0.8 early signal, +1.4 for three beats, +0.5 for modest causal role (frames action), +0.4 closure linkage (paragraph 28, "The observatory...kept watch"), −0.5 swappability (any isolated locale could serve), −0.9 for postcard description without pressure. Base 3.0 + 1.7 = 4.7; bump +1.0 for pervasive atmospheric role = 5.7.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>After fog becomes solid is established in paragraph 2 ("the fog below hardened into glassy sheets overnight") and referenced in paragraphs 19 and 29 ("solid fog below cracked faintly"). The timeframe anchors the setting but does not tighten decisions or alter tactics; no clock pressure is legible. Gates: setup ✓, middle ✗, closure cameo ✓. Missing middle → cap 3.4. Apply +0.3 for early signal, +0.4 for one beat (paragraph 29), −0.5 for vague tracking (no urgency or constraint tied to solidification timing). Final: 3.6.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>To sculpt identity from experience is stated in paragraph 2 and referenced in paragraphs 5, 18, 30 ("identities sculpted not from stone or star"). The motivation guides the archivist's task but is never dramatized in conflict or friction; she performs her task unimpeded. Gates: setup ✓, middle ✗ (no friction between desire and cost), closure ✓ (paragraph 30 reference). Missing middle → cap 3.4. Apply +0.8 early signal, +0.4 for one beat, +0.7 closure linkage, −0.3 told-only, −0.5 for no friction. Base 3.0 + 1.1 = 4.1; bump +0.8 for structural role = 4.9.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Deepening hush is seeded in paragraph 20 ("The deepening hush around her was not silence"), repeated in paragraph 27 ("the deepening hush now inside her"), and charges the final image. The tone is coherent and modulates subtly from storm residue to saturated quiet. Gates: setup (mid-story, paragraph 20), middle ✓ (reweights perception), closure ✓ (paragraph 27, interior transformation). Apply +0.4 for mid setup (−0.2 for late first), +0.9 for two beats, +1.0 causal (shifts internal state), +1.2 closure charge (final "archive" image), +0.5 specificity (distinct tonal signature). Base 3.0 + 3.8 = 6.8.</comment>
