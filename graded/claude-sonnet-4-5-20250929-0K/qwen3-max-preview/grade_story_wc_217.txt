<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elira's interiority is richly embodied ("fingers tracing ripples as if reading braille") and her motivation—discovering beauty in the incomplete—drives her approach to the boy. The turn from observer to tender is credible, though her internal contradiction is limited; she accepts incompletion without struggle. The boy's shift from hollow-eyed to curious feels slightly accelerated, arriving through her intervention more than his own agency. Minor voice convergence: both speak in similar lyric registers at the exchange.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land cleanly by the opening paragraph. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: density accrues through layered imagery (lagoon, feather, kite) and the final image—boy running with patched kite—reweights the opening stake (beauty in the incomplete) with visible cost (the original kite is sacrificed, the new one is "crooked" but alive). The causal chain is modest but legible: kite breaks → Elira intervenes → she reframes loss through woven reconstruction. One meaningful deepening occurs when the feather is gifted and the boy's grief shifts to curiosity, altering his stance with felt cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The cobalt lagoon supplies vivid sensory anchors ("spilled ink beneath a bruised sky," "wet sand") and the setting constrains Elira's perch and the boy's proximity. The feather functions as micro-setting, a tactile object that warms during the song and charges the closure by being laid atop the kite. Spatial choreography (shoreline → dune crest → water's edge) tracks cleanly. The setting modulates with pressure: storm memory → dune encounter → twilight resolution, each shift supporting the emotional arc.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: Elira's drive to "discover beauty in the incomplete" and her method of tending rupture. The kite-string snap provides a single meaningful complication, and her weaving act narrows options (the original kite cannot be restored). The boy's question "Will it fly?" crystallizes the trade-off, and Elira's answer ("Differently") closes with visible cost: not restoration but transformation. Escalation is modest—one turn rather than multiple reversals—but coherent under the Accumulative lens. Agency is clear in Elira's decision to intervene and reconstruct.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The theme—beauty in brokenness, incompletion as resource—emerges through concrete particulars: the drake's feather (shed to lighten flight), the patched kite (asymmetrical yet airborne), and the final image of the boy's laughter. The closing line ("Even snapped strings carry the wind's memory") reprices the rupture without stating a moral. Subtext operates in the feather's warmth, the boy's silence, and thelagoon's reflection motif. No overt philosophizing mars the resolution; the particulars (seaglass-blue scraps, crooked frame) do the work. Minor slip: "woven dawns" as a named practice feels slightly self-conscious, though it serves the conceptual frame.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Elira; psychic distance is controlled and the narrator's perceptual signature (poetic attention to tide, feather, lagoon) remains consistent. Dialogue is sparse but goal-driven: the boy's "Why?" and Elira's "So they can fly lighter" carry subtext (loss as necessity). Register is elevated throughout, risking slight uniformity between narration and Elira's speech, though her voice is distinct enough. Minor filter-verb density in reflective passages ("she knows this," "she calls this practice") slightly dulls immediacy. No head-hopping; focalization is clean.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully, with longer reflective sentences ("Her motivation was never completion—manuscripts, sonnets, endings—but to discover beauty in the incomplete") balanced by shorter action beats ("He doesn't weep. / He stares"). Figurative density is high: "spilled ink," "braille left by the tide," "jubilant ghost." In peak beats (the boy's grief, the kite's launch), metaphor stacks risk slight opacity ("breath of wind," "dancing with the rhythm of its scars"). No loops or scaffold, but template cadence appears in paired short paragraphs ("He doesn't weep. / He stares" / "Not the kite. / You."). Information density is strong; few lines idle. Minor deduction for elevated diction uniformity across narrative and dialogue registers.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The premise—shoreline poet as grief-tender via asymmetric reconstruction—transforms the "found object" and "healing stranger" tropes through specific craft vocabulary ("woven dawns") and the feather's heat-signature detail. The drakes-tail feather, though fantastical, is grounded in Elira's dream-logic and serves as compass rather than magic solution. The patched kite's crooked flight offers a fresh, non-obvious synthesis: not restoration but reconfiguration. Risk-taking in the lyric register and quiet closure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Minor proximity concern: the "broken things can be beautiful" theme is well-trodden, though execution via particulars (seaglass scraps, bamboo spine) elevates it. No derivative template detected; the voice feels singular.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elira appears in every beat, drives the intervention (decision to approach, to gift the feather, to weave the new kite), and her choice to reframe loss rather than restore it forecloses the path of simple repair with visible cost (the original kite is sacrificed). Her motivation shapes tactics throughout. Early signal (opening paragraph), middle development (encounter and weaving), and closure participation (holding space as the boy launches the kite) are all present. Causal pressure: her action alters the boy's stance and enables the final image. Cost: she gives away the feather, her compass.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The feather appears in three distinct beats: tucked in her tunic (setup), warming during the song (middle), and laid atop the broken kite (closure moment). Its properties—iridescent, humming with heat, a relic of shedding—charge the theme of lightening one's arc. The gift reweights its meaning from personal compass to shared symbol. However, the feather does not constrain a choice (Elira could have intervened without it) and its mechanics (why it warms, what the warmth signifies) remain ornamental rather than causal. Eligible for mid-band due to reprise and closure linkage, but swappability (another talismanic object could substitute) and lack of cost-friction lower the score.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Woven dawns" is named mid-story as Elira's practice and demonstrated on-page when she reconstructs the kite from fragments. It shapes the central tactic (not mending but birthing something new) and the final image (the crooked, asymmetrical kite in flight). Setup is implicit in the opening (her preference for the incomplete), development is explicit in the weaving beat, and payoff occurs when the boy asks if it will fly and Elira answers "Differently." The concept constrains her method (she cannot restore, only transform) with visible cost (the original form is lost). Early signal is soft (no explicit mention until midpoint), lowering integration slightly, but causal role and closure linkage are strong.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Warmly attentive" is demonstrated when Elira kneels beside the boy "not speaking, not touching, just present" and holds space without forcing speech. This trait enables her tending method and constrains her from rushing the boy's grief. It appears in the encounter beat and implicitly in the final scene (watching him run). The attribute shapes one key choice (to wait rather than explain) with felt cost (patience, withholding direct comfort). However, it is not signaled early (first appears at the encounter) and does not reappear explicitly at closure, limiting integration. Functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Tend" is the verb governing Elira's motivation ("to tend—to cradle the rupture before it hardens into sorrow") and drives her approach: she hums the lullaby, lays the feather, weaves the new kite, and holds space for the boy's curiosity. It appears in three beats (setup motivation, encounter, and closure watch) and the final image (boy running, Elira turning back to water) completes the tending arc. The action is specific to her method and irreplaceable; "fix" or "mend" would alter the thematic premise. Cost: tending requires her to give the feather and accept imperfection. Early signal, middle development, and closure participation are all present.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"By harmonizing discord" is signaled when Elira hums the lullaby ("a lullaby for broken things") and demonstrated in the weaving act (folding torn scraps into asymmetry). The method shapes her tactic: she does not silence grief but lets it coexist with beauty. It appears in two beats (the song, the reconstruction) and the final image (the crooked kite dancing) embodies the harmonized discord. However, the mechanics are more asserted than tested; the song's effect (the feather warms) is atmospheric rather than causal, and the weaving's success is not in doubt. Cost is implicit (time, patience) but not sharply felt. Mid-band for method presence and closure linkage, but lacks friction or trade-off that would elevate further.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The lagoon anchors the opening and closing images, and its post-rain shimmer sets the tone of mutable beauty. The wet sand provides tactile grounding for Elira's initial perch, and the dunes supply the spatial progression to the boy's location. The water's edge is the launch site for the kite, completing the spatial arc. However, the lagoon itself does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome; it functions primarily as atmospheric backdrop. Early signal and closure reprise (twilight gilds the lagoon) are strong, but lack of middle pressure-function limits integration. Lyric resonance qualifies it for mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"As a kite string snaps" is the inciting event, signaled in the timeframe slot and occurring on-page ("a kite string snaps somewhere beyond the dunes—a child's cry muffled by wind"). The snap triggers Elira's decision to intervene, driving the entire encounter sequence. Time is tracked loosely (morning lagoon → encounter → twilight) but the snap itself provides the live-clock urgency that alters her stance from solitary observation to active tending. The boy's immediate grief and Elira's prompt response maintain momentum. Cost: the interruption pulls her from her own practice. Early signal, causal trigger, and implicit closure linkage (the snapped string is transformed into the patched kite's new string) elevate integration.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elira's motivation—"to discover beauty in the incomplete"—is stated early and dramatized through her actions: she does not write in notebooks but "in the breath between waves," she keeps the feather as reminder that dragons discard, and she reconstructs the kite into asymmetry. The motivation is conflicted only implicitly (the boy wants his kite back; Elira offers transformation instead), and the cost (sacrificing restoration for reframing) is felt but not sharply tested. Friction is modest: she never doubts her method, and the boy's acceptance arrives quickly. Early signal, consistent development, and closure participation are present, but lack of internal struggle or trade-off caps the score in the 7s.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Burnished hush" describes the opening atmosphere ("salt-cured silence") and returns at closure ("burnished hush settles around her"). The tone modulates purposefully: reflective in the opening, attentive during the encounter, gentle in the reconstruction, and resonant at the ending. It coheres through turns without flattening pressure; even the boy's laughter ("a bell ringing over wet stone") sustains the hushed register. The tone charges the final image by framing the incomplete as presence rather than absence. Early signal, consistent modulation, and closure reprise with reweighted meaning justify high-7s. Minor limit: the tone is somewhat static across beats, lacking sharp contrast or friction that would push it higher.</comment>
