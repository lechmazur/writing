<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elric's motivation ("sacredly playful urge," "surrender to embrace the unknown") is asserted repeatedly but never dramatized through contradictory impulses or genuine internal friction. The swapping action proceeds smoothly without visible cost or hesitation that would prove his chivalrous nature under pressure. Interiority relies on elevated abstraction ("heart swelling with the joy of surrender") rather than embodied particulars. The widow's tear and comet's breath are ornamental rather than choices that reveal hierarchy of values.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The piece anchors who/where/when adequately and offers a closure image (sky mending, pieces moving) that reads as Resonant Reconfiguration under an Accumulative lens. However, cost remains abstract: the world "stirs awake" but no specific price or foreclosed path is made visible on the page. The swap itself encounters no resistance, and the sundial map's instruction ("SWAP THE PIECES") provides an external directive rather than protagonist-driven escalation. Closure reconfigures the premise but the felt cost required for high-band entry is missing.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The spire setting is vivid and sensory (frost-glazed stone, eerie luminescence, static-and-snow air), and the icebound environment shapes Elric's physical approach. The Obsidian Table and its pieces are described in tactile detail. However, the environment does not constrain a choice at closure; Elric completes his task without spatial resistance. Micro-setting (the board, the pieces) charges the final image but does not alter tactics, capping the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake (mend the sky by amending the board) is signaled early. Yet the swapping action unfolds without opposition, complication, or a visible trade-off; each exchange "sent a tremor" but no live option is foreclosed. The pieces move "on their own" after completion, removing agency from the peak moment. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful tightening is present (the wrong sky worsening), but no on-page cost or narrowed choice accompanies the resolution.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Theme (wonder, surrender, play vs. dominion) is stated overtly rather than emerging from dramatized choices: "not to conquer the board; he would amend it." The sundial's blank map and Elric's final bow gesture toward resonance, but the ending offers a moral summary ("invited it to play") instead of a non-literal answer. Thematic statements cluster in the final paragraphs ("not an ending, but an overture"), which triggers the penalty for overt moralizing. No contradictory impulse complicates the theme.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains a consistent elevated register and fantasy idiom throughout. However, psychic distance is unstable: the narrator asserts knowledge beyond Elric's POV ("rumored to contain," "no mortal strategist had ever conceived") without anchoring these claims in his perception. Diction occasionally drifts into abstraction ("sacredly playful urge," "cautious abandon") that reads as thematic declaration rather than lived interiority. Free indirect style is mostly clean, but filter verbs ("feeling its warmth bloom") dull immediacy in key beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Overwriting pervades: nearly every sentence carries figurative language or elevated diction ("wind howled like a choir of forgotten gods," "mystery rewrite fate's ledger"), obscuring causal clarity under decorative density. Template cadence appears in repeated stems ("He would not conquer... he would amend"; "not fixed... invited"; "not an ending... an overture"). Paraphrase loops are evident: the sky's wrongness is restated multiple times without added pressure. Stock metaphors ("heart drumming a rhythm older than kingdoms") and synonym churn ("sacredly playful," "cautious abandon") accumulate. These artifacts touch the closure paragraph, triggering the −1.7 penalty and disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The core premise (chessboard dictates sky; thief swaps pieces to mend it) is imaginative but hinges on externalized magic rather than character-driven ingenuity. The "apprentice of wonder" and "chivalrous thief" labels echo familiar archetypes without transformation through lived detail or moral calculus. Elric's motivations ("surrender," "embrace the unknown") are abstractions rather than specific stakes. The piece commits to its fantastical premise but lacks a non-obvious synthesis; the swap proceeds as instructed by the sundial with no personal cost or surprising turn that grows from prior particulars.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Elric is present throughout and performs the central action (swapping pieces), but his choices do not create key turns. The sundial's map instructs him; he complies without internal friction or a decision that alters tactics. The "chivalrous thief" label is asserted ("driven not by greed") but not tested on the page. He is present in closure but passive as the pieces move themselves.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The pocket sundial lid appears in two beats: summit (where it reveals the map) and after the swap (when it "clicked shut" with the map now blank). Its celestial-ink map provides the instruction ("SWAP THE PIECES"), shaping the action. However, it does not constrain a choice or evolve in meaning beyond task completion. Setup and payoff are present; middle development is weak. The lid is functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>The "apprentice of wonder" phrase appears twice as a label ("apprentice of wonder knows it's time to act," "ever the apprentice of wonder") but does not shape stakes or tactics on the page. It functions as thematic echo rather than a constraint that alters options. Swappable with "seeker" or "student" without structural change.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Sacredly playful" is mentioned once in the opening line and echoed at the end ("sacred playfulness") but never constrains an on-page action or decision. Elric's approach to the task is smooth and unopposed; no visible trade-off arises from playfulness versus caution. Label-only.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Amend" is the conceptual center: Elric will "amend" the board rather than conquer it. The action is signaled early, drives the swapping sequence (middle), and is echoed at closure ("other boards to amend"). However, the amending itself is executed without opposition or cost, and the pieces' self-animation removes agency from the final turn. Essential across beats but not indispensable; the story could substitute "rebalance" or "restore" with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The method (swapping hand-carved pieces with secrets inside) is signaled early, executed in detail across the middle sequence, and drives the closure: "Each exchange sent a tremor... the board shimmered. The pieces began to move." The mechanics matter—the specific secrets (widow's tear, rebel's anthem, comet's breath) replace the old truths. Present in setup, development, and payoff. The method is causal and specific, though the lack of resistance lowers the score slightly.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The icebound spire is vivid and present throughout: Elric scales it, the summit's wind and cold are embodied, the chamber's ice refracts the wrong sky. However, the setting does not pressure a choice or alter tactics; Elric completes his task without spatial constraint. The spire frames the action but does not constrain it. Setup and atmosphere are strong; causal pressure is absent.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The "wrong sky" (bruised purple at noon, stars midday) is the opening signal and returns at closure when it mends. However, no temporal urgency is dramatized; Elric takes "three winters learning" and proceeds at his own pace with no on-page clock or tightening deadline. The timeframe is thematic rather than tactical. Setup and payoff present; middle development weak.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The motivation ("embrace the unknown with open arms," "surrender") is stated multiple times but never conflicted or dramatized through a choice with cost. Elric's actions proceed smoothly without friction between desire and price. The motivation is told rather than shown, and no on-page moment reveals a trade-off between embracing mystery and another want. Present as theme but not as driver.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Cautious abandon" is named twice (opening and end: "cautious abandon... sacred playfulness") and the prose attempts a blend of careful description and elevated lyricism. However, the tone remains uniformly elevated and ornamental throughout; no modulation with pressure occurs. The oxymoron is asserted but not enacted in rhythm or diction shifts. Functional presence without dynamic charge.</comment>
