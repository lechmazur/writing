<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's identity as "crisis actor turned real crisis survivor" delivers an intriguing contradiction, and the motivation to document small gestures is specific. However, interiority remains abstract and metaphorical throughout—"raw, luminous absence" and "the trailing edge of displaced light"—without embodied sensation or micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values under pressure. The final confrontation with the new sovereign is asserted rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses acting in scene. No visible cost forecloses a path; the protagonist simply continues walking.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens inferred: Accumulative/Textural. The interregnum frame is signaled early and the piece accumulates gestures (baker weighing flour, child bowing, widow unbinding) toward a final image where the protagonist spells "listen" before the new sovereign. Orientation is clear by the opening paragraph. The closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the sovereign trembles under the penumbra's gaze, options crystallize, but the cost remains conceptual and felt rather than concretely paid on the page—"the terror of being truly seen" does not visibly foreclose a path or alter tactics. One meaningful deepening is present but the price is oblique.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The whispering gallery is vivid and purposeful: its domed ceiling echoes silence, and the protagonist's walking patterns trace glyphs "only the architecture remembers." The space constrains choice—survivors walk beside the protagonist, adding their own patterns—and the gallery's echo absorbs the widow's unbinding gesture. The pawnless chessboard is placed "at the gallery's heart" and catches window-light, charging the final confrontation. Micro-setting (body, tool, recurring object) drives multiple beats and the ending image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: to become the historian of small gestures during the interregnum. Pressure accumulates through the arrival of survivors who walk their own patterns, and the widow's unbinding gesture tightens the mission. The final beat—placing the board before the sovereign and spelling "listen"—feels like a deepening rather than a turn that forecloses options. The sovereign's trembling is described but does not alter on-page tactics or cost. One meaningful accumulation is present but agency remains observational rather than decisional, and no live option is visibly foreclosed with felt price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges cleanly from particulars: the missing pawns embody "those who vanish quietly," and the pattern-walking converts silence into syntax. The piece resists tidy morals—"benevolently ruthless" penumbra does not heal but reveals—and the final image (spelling "listen" before the sovereign) offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the interregnum's incubation question. The widow's ring on the vacant square is a strong particular. However, the final paragraph edges toward thematic statement: "luminous absence of all the small gestures that had held the world together" risks summary over scene pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and the voice carries a consistent lyric-philosophical register: "nomadic penumbra," "luminous absence," "benevolently ruthless." Psychic distance is controlled and perceptual signature is distinct—seeing absence as presence, architecture as memory. However, diction remains uniformly elevated across all beats, including peak moments, which flattens urgency. The widow's whispered line "I unbind myself from the role" carries subtext but other dialogue-adjacent moments (the protagonist's word-spelling) are narrated rather than dramatized. No head-hopping, and the perceptual filter is character-specific.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout: "silences shaped like breaths," "nomadic penumbra," "trailing edge of displaced light," "benevolently ruthless," "luminous absence." In peak beats (the widow's unbinding, the sovereign's arrival) the metaphorical register does not modulate to concrete action or embodied sensation, obscuring momentum. Paraphrase loops appear: "It did not judge… nor pity… it simply mirrored" and "not with darkness, but with a clarity" repeat structure without advancing pressure. Template cadence in the penumbra descriptions ("not shadow, not spirit, but…") across multiple paragraphs. Several sentences restate the interregnum as "not emptiness, but incubation" and "law was suspended but not forgotten" without new detail. Line-level clarity is present but propulsion is dulled by stacked modifiers and synonym cycles. Artifacts touch the closure beat (the sovereign's trembling is described via metaphor rather than embodied action), triggering the high penalty and disallowing 9+ globally per the artifact rule.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The combination of crisis actor, pawnless chessboard, and word-spelling footsteps is specific and non-obvious. The interregnum frame and the historian-of-gestures mission cohere thematically. However, the walking-as-lexicon premise is asserted more than it constrains choice—spelling "remember," "release," "recede," then "listen" feels like symbolic decoration rather than a tactic that shapes outcome. The missing-pawns insight ("history isn't moved by kings alone") is resonant but edges toward abstraction. Transformation test: the emotional arc of documenting small gestures could survive with a different prop and method. Some risk-taking in the lyric-philosophical voice, but the piece does not fully commit to making the pattern-walking mechanically indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The crisis actor identity is present in the opening and frames the protagonist's survivor stance, but it does not constrain a choice or enable a tactic on the page. The protagonist documents gestures and walks patterns; the actor background is thematic coloring rather than a causal lever. Setup is present, middle role is minimal (does not alter the widow's unbinding or other survivors' arrivals), and closure participation is absent—the sovereign confrontation does not hinge on the actor/survivor duality. Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The pawnless chessboard is introduced early ("relic from the last sovereign's court"), placed at the gallery's heart in the middle section (catching window-light), and reappears at closure when the protagonist places it before the new sovereign. The missing pawns are explicitly tied to theme ("common lives had already been spent") and the board's presence charges the final confrontation. However, the board is not handled or used in a way that alters tactics—it is positioned, observed, and symbolically presented. Three gates present, causal pressure moderate, closure linkage clear but passive. Strong lyric reprise with thematic reweighting.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The nomadic penumbra is introduced early, described across multiple beats (following the protagonist, expanding to include survivors, pooling at the sovereign's feet), and present at closure. It shapes the protagonist's mission conceptually—"it simply mirrored what remained when pretense fell away"—and frames the sovereign's terror. However, it does not constrain an on-page choice or enable a tactic; it observes and reflects rather than pressuring options. Setup, development, and payoff are present, but the penumbra's role is atmospheric and thematic rather than causal. Swappable with "haunting presence" or similar abstraction.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Benevolently ruthless" is used as a repeated descriptor of the penumbra ("benevolently ruthless: offering no comfort, demanding no tribute," "benevolently ruthless in its inclusivity," "benevolently ruthless in its indifference to crowns"). The attribute is label-only; no on-page action demonstrates the tradeoff between benevolence and ruthlessness in a way that constrains choice or costs the protagonist. The widow's unbinding and the sovereign's trembling are linked to the penumbra's presence but the attribute itself is asserted rather than dramatized. Ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Unbind" appears as a verb the protagonist uses when walking word-patterns ("Each circuit unbound something: a memory, a vow, a name"), and the widow explicitly unbinds herself from her role ("I unbind myself from the role"). The action drives two distinct beats and shapes the ending thematically—the gallery echoes "the sound of a chain dissolving into dust." The unbinding reweights the interregnum's incubation premise and is tied to visible cost (the widow's ring on the vacant square, the protagonist's refusal to bow). Essential across beats and ending; swapping it would require restructuring the gesture-historian mission.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The pattern-walking is introduced early ("heel-to-toe arcs tracing glyphs only the architecture remembers"), demonstrated in the middle section (spelling "remember," "release," "recede"), and returns at closure (spelling "listen" before the sovereign). The method is specific and recurring, but its mechanics do not alter tactics under pressure—survivors walk beside the protagonist, adding patterns, but the word-spelling itself is symbolic rather than causally determinant. Setup, development, and payoff present; the method shapes atmosphere and theme more than it constrains choice. Lyric reprise with moderate reweighting.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The whispering gallery is anchored early ("domed ceiling echoing not voices but silences"), shapes multiple beats (the protagonist's circular walking, survivors arriving and walking patterns, the widow kneeling beside the board), and charges the closure image (the gallery whispers back when the sovereign arrives). The architecture "remembers" the glyphs, the space absorbs gestures, and the echo becomes syntax. The gallery's acoustics and spatial layout enable the protagonist's method and frame the sovereign's confrontation. Setup, development, and payoff with strong causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The interregnum is signaled in the opening line and framed throughout ("law was suspended but not forgotten," "the interregnum was not emptiness, but incubation," "while thrones stood empty"). It provides context for the protagonist's mission and the sovereign's eventual arrival, but the timeframe does not tighten decisions—no clock or deadline pressures tactics, and the interregnum's duration is vague. Setup is strong, middle development is thematic, and payoff occurs when the sovereign arrives, but the time element does not constrain or enable on-page choices. Functional but not decisive.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The motivation to become "the historian of small gestures" is stated early and demonstrated through the protagonist's documentation of the baker, child, and widow. It drives the protagonist's walking patterns and the mission to make absence speak. However, the motivation is never conflicted or tested—no on-page friction between this desire and a competing want or cost. The protagonist simply enacts the mission without struggle. Setup and development are present; payoff is thematic but not dramatized as a choice with visible price. Causal role moderate.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Luminous absence" appears repeatedly as a tonal anchor: the penumbra's "luminous absence," the gallery's echo of "luminous absence of all the small gestures." The tone is coherent and modulates slightly—from reflective opening to the charged final confrontation—but remains uniformly lyric-philosophical without significant pressure shift. The final image charges the tone (the sovereign trembling under the penumbra, the gallery whispering back), lifting it above static mood. Tone supports theme and is present at closure, but does not modulate sharply under escalation.</comment>
