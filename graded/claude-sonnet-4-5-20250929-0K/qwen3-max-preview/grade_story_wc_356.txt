<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elira's interiority is vivid and specific—her olfactory sensitivity shapes perception throughout. However, internal conflict remains largely abstract: her "ambition for serenity within motion" is stated but never pressured by a contradictory impulse acting in scene. The closure choice (replanting with doodles) feels like continuation rather than a path foreclosed with visible cost. Embodied emotion is strong in the bloom scene ("tears streaming not from disgust, but recognition"), but the recognition itself arrives as epiphany without prior dramatized struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through sensory density and the seed's long dormancy, culminating in the bloom's transformative stench. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (village shifts from discord to harmony), but the cost is diffuse and told rather than shown: "Arguments dissolved into apologies" summarizes off-page changes. The bloom itself is vividly on the page, yet Elira's final act (replanting) does not foreclose a live option or articulate a felt price—she simply continues her practice. Orientation is clear early; causality holds within the accumulative mode, but the ending lacks the sharp before/after that would elevate closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The treetop village, suspended greenhouse, and moss-wrapped shelf create a coherent micro-world. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered: "damp moss on her tongue before dawn broke" and "wet iron and distant lightning" ground perception in Elira's olfactory bias. The corpse flower's "velvet scream" and "infamous stench" charge the climax, and the wrapping-paper doodles function as recurring object. However, the village itself remains a backdrop—no architectural constraint shapes a choice. Spatial choreography is clean; the greenhouse setting enables the bloom but does not pressure Elira's tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: cultivate serenity and coax the seed to bloom. The seventeen-moon dormancy and the "tide's thought" turning provide a tightening, and the bloom delivers sensory escalation. Yet Elira's agency is passive—she waits, tends, and inhales; no on-page decision narrows her options or forces a trade-off. The village's transformation is consequence, not cost to Elira. The bloom's lesson ("grief is fertilizer") arrives as recognition, not a reversal that alters her stance. One meaningful deepening occurs (the bloom unfurls), but the protagonist does not drive it through a choice under pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: "stillness is not absence of motion, but harmony with it" grows from the corpse flower's dual nature (decay as revelation). The wrapping-paper doodles—roots into question marks, tide into tree—serve as non-literal motif. Subtext operates in the stench's dual reading (villagers flee, Elira finds wisdom). However, the final paragraph edges into thematic restatement: "stillness is not absence of motion, but harmony with it" and "undercurrent of wisdom she had learned to hear" risk summarizing rather than letting the image resonate. The piece avoids moralizing but flirts with explanation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with strong olfactory signature: "taste the damp moss," "smell the anxiety," "wet iron and distant lightning." Diction is lyric and consistent—"vines curled like sleeping serpents," "velvet scream"—though occasionally elevated beyond herbalist idiom ("undercurrent of wisdom that flows beneath all chaos"). No dialogue on the page. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (closer during the bloom, wider for the village's aftermath). Minor register drift in abstract phrasing ("equilibrium—the quiet eye within the hurricane") but the perceptual filter remains Elira's throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies; opening lines anchor voice ("clung to ancient boughs like lichen to stone"). Information density is high in the bloom sequence. However, overwriting clusters in exposition: "the undercurrent of wisdom that flows beneath all chaos," "serenity within motion—to find stillness not in stagnation, but in the dance of change itself" stack metaphors without clear vehicle. Figurative language saturates several beats ("sleeping serpents," "silent symphonies," "velvet scream") without pattern-teaching. The wrapping-paper detail is vivid but arrives late as backstory. No major loops, but synonym churn appears in the theme paragraphs ("serenity," "equilibrium," "stillness").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The herbalist-as-philosopher angle and wrapping-paper journaling offer fresh detail. The corpse flower as wisdom trigger transforms the decay trope through olfactory specificity. However, the "eccentric healer transforms village" arc is familiar, and the emotional resolution (discord to harmony) reads stock. The "tide's thought turns" phrase is inventive but underutilized—its mechanics remain vague. Transformation test: swap the flower for another catalyst and the arc holds unchanged. Specific sensory execution elevates, but the premise does not venture far from template.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elira is present throughout and her herbalist role enables the greenhouse and poultice work. She makes one key choice at closure (replanting the husk with doodles), but her primary action is tending and waiting—observation more than decision. The trait "ambitious" is asserted but not pressured by a conflicting want. Setup and payoff gates are met; middle development is thin (seventeen moons pass off-page). Causal pressure is modest: her expertise creates conditions, but the bloom triggers itself when the village's "tide's thought" turns, not through her agency.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The seed is introduced early (beneath moss-wrapped shelf), reappears at the split-open moment, blooms at climax, and is replanted at closure—four beats. Its transformation (dormant → sprouting → blooming → husk) drives the arc. However, Elira does not handle or use it actively; she observes and inhales. The bloom's stench is vivid and reweighted (decay → revelation), charging the final image when she replants it wrapped in doodles. Specificity is high (crimson tendril, velvet scream), and the element is indispensable to closure. Cost connection is indirect: the village changes, but Elira's personal forfeit is unclear.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"The undercurrent of wisdom" is named repeatedly and frames the theme, but it functions as label rather than shaping on-page stakes or tactics. Elira seeks it, the seed "reveals" it, and the village embodies it—all told. The concept does not constrain a choice or create friction; it is the story's thesis, echoed in closure ("undercurrent of wisdom she had learned to hear") without altering options. Present across beats but ornamental; setup and payoff gates met, middle development is thematic repetition. Swappable with "hidden truth" or "deeper knowledge" with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elira's olfactory sensitivity is seeded early ("taste the damp moss," "smell the anxiety") and used in three beats: pre-dawn greenhouse routine, the "wet iron and distant lightning" omen, and the climactic inhalation of the bloom's stench. The trait enables her unique response (tears of recognition vs. villagers gagging), shaping the ending's meaning. However, it does not constrain a choice or impose a visible cost—no tradeoff between her sensitivity and another need. Specificity is high; the trait charges the bloom scene but does not narrow her options under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Journaling appears in setup (bark-fiber journal, chlorophyll stains), reappears at climax ("journaled furiously that night"), and closes with the wrapping-paper archive growing thicker. The action translates fragrance into philosophy but does not drive major turns—the bloom happens independently. Her furious journaling after the bloom could be swapped for meditative reflection without altering the village's transformation. Setup and payoff gates met; middle development is summary ("She'd sketch root systems"). Functional but not causally essential; the bloom, not the journaling, redefines options.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The wrapping-paper doodling custom is introduced mid-story as backstory ("a family custom passed down"), reappears during climax journaling, and closes with doodles on the replanted husk. The method is vivid and specific (root systems as neural pathways, tide into tree), but it does not shape attempts or constrain her process—ordinary journaling would serve the same function. Late setup (second third) lowers integration. The final doodles (tide turning into tree, roots drinking starlight) reprise earlier images and charge the ending, qualifying for lyric resonance. Two gates (middle, payoff); setup is weak.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Virelai is introduced in the opening line, and the suspended greenhouse provides the bloom's location. The village supplies sick/anxious clients (told, not shown) and undergoes transformation at closure. However, the treetop setting functions as atmosphere rather than constraint—no architectural feature or resource alters Elira's tactics. Spatial detail is vivid (rope bridges, ancient boughs) but postcard-like. The greenhouse micro-setting houses the seed but does not pressure choices. Setup strong; middle and closure participation are scenic rather than causal. The setting enables but does not drive.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"The tide's thought turns" is introduced as the bloom trigger (rumored condition) and names the pivotal night when "collective doubt in the village crested and broke into clarity." However, the mechanism remains vague—what action or event turned the tide?—and the timeframe does not tighten decisions. Seventeen moons pass off-page without pressure; the bloom arrives when the story needs it, not through a tracked clock. Setup and payoff gates met; middle development is absent. The phrase is poetic but functionally coincidental—time does not constrain Elira's choices or force her hand.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Elira's desire "to cultivate serenity within motion" is stated early and reappears at closure ("to anchor serenity not in stone, but in surrender"). The motivation frames her herbalist practice and greenhouse rituals. However, it is never dramatized under friction—no moment where her need for serenity conflicts with an urgent want or fear. The bloom teaches her, but she does not struggle between competing goods. Told more than shown; the motivation shapes theme but not on-page choices. Setup and payoff strong; middle development is contemplative exposition rather than conflicted action.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Wildflower hush" appears in the final third ("children moved with softer steps, as if walking through wildflower hush") and closes the piece ("Virelai swayed...with wildflower hush"). Tone is lyric, meditative, and sensory throughout—coherent with the accumulative mode. The prose modulates at the bloom (intensifies to "velvet scream," villagers gagging) then softens into the hush at closure. The tonal shift reweights the village's state, charging the final image. Late explicit naming lowers integration, but the tone is maintained implicitly from the start. Two gates (development, payoff); setup is atmospheric but unlabeled.</comment>
