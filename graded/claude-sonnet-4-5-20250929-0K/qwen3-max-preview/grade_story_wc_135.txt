<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elira's core motivation—compiling fragments into meaning—drives her archive work and leads to the ritual proposal, but her internal experience remains at arm's length. The widow's melody and shipwright's grandson provide external pressure, yet Elira's choices feel observational rather than internally conflicted. Her "reactively visionary" trait is asserted more than embodied through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The ending ritual feels thematically earned but lacks a visible personal cost that would elevate character transformation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: Elira gathers fragments (valve, memories, notations) that accrete into a navigation chart of absence, culminating in the seasonal naming ritual. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration—the town adopts a new tradition that reweights loss as coordinate rather than void—and the conceptual cost (accepting absences as permanent yet navigable) is legible in the final image of the untouched valve. The two-shard structure (archive work, then council presentation and first ritual) remains coherent within one contiguous post-exile window. Orientation anchors appear early (ivory harbor, Elira's role, post-exile timeframe), and the escalation—fragments to scroll to ritual—tightens the dominant stake (honoring loss without erasure) through one meaningful deepening.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The ivory harbor, salt-warped ledgers, and customs house attic supply vivid, purpose-driven detail filtered through Elira's archival lens. The trumpet valve is handled across multiple beats (harbor silt recovery, attic layout, council presentation, town square placement), and the harbor's fog, gulls, and brine function as active collaborators in her method. The final image—valve under open sky, rust untouched—charges closure by embodying the town's new approach to absence. Micro-setting (attic archive, water's edge) constrains Elira's solitary work and grounds the ritual's spatial anchor at the quay.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—mapping grief into geography to honor silence—is signaled early and tightens through Elira's fragment-gathering (one meaningful deepening under Accumulative lens). The council presentation reverses expectation (they anticipate demands, she proposes a naming ritual), and the first evening's voices create a before/after shift: absences become acknowledged coordinates. Agency is clear in Elira's proposal and her choice to leave the valve unpolished, forecloses restoration in favor of preservation. The cost—accepting permanent loss rather than memorial monuments—is legible on the page, though the escalation could press harder against resistance or internal doubt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The theme—memory as compass through acknowledged absence—emerges organically from Elira's archive work, the valve's transformation from relic to cipher, and the ritual's rejection of statues for spoken names. The final image (valve under open sky, children asking "why") offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior material: navigation through silence rather than erasure. Subtext operates in the widow's melody, the child's sailless ship drawing, and the town's gradual trust accretion. The piece avoids moralizing; instead, it earns its insight through the specific mechanics of tide logs, valve corrosion rates, and the recurring motif of staggered intervals that shape both method and ritual cadence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable and apt, filtered through Elira's archival vocabulary ("ocean-spray archivist," "herald's trumpet valve," "gaps in coastal annals"). Perceptual signature is consistent—she notices corrosion rates, valve mechanisms, tidal notations—and diction stays within her register without drift. The prose modulates purposefully: lyric compression in the opening paragraph gives way to patient accumulation through the archive beats, then tightens at the council moment. No dialogue appears, so naturalism and subtext tests are inapplicable. The recurring "staggered intervals" phrase and the explanatory final-paragraph exchange ("That's how we learned...") edge toward thematic echo but remain anchored in the elder's voice rather than authorial intrusion.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is high (valve deduction from melody, buoy triangulation from tide logs), but several lines loop conceptually: "She worked...where salt-warped ledgers leaned beside coral-crusted sextants" restates the attic's archive function without added pressure; "mapping grief into geography, turning silence into a kind of harbor" paraphrases the core conceit. Template cadence appears in the middle third: "A widow recalled...Elira matched"; "A shipwright's grandson described...she cross-referenced." The final paragraph's twin explanatory beats ("That's how we learned to sail through silence. That's how we navigated what wasn't there") feel like synonym churn. Opening and closing images are strong, but figurative density in early paragraphs ("salt clinging...like forgotten prayers," "harbor breathe differently") occasionally prioritizes lyricism over propulsion. Applies −0.6 for paraphrase loops and template runs; −0.3 for figurative density in non-peak beats without pattern payoff.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The premise—archivist mapping absence rather than presence—transforms the grief-memoir trope through specific mechanics (valve pitch deduction, corrosion-rate triangulation, tide-silt trust accretion). The ritual proposal (seasonal naming instead of monuments) offers a fresh, non-obvious synthesis that feels earned in hindsight. Emotional specificity (widow's melody, sailless ship drawing) avoids generic templates, and the valve's journey from harbor silt to town square anchor demonstrates conceptual integrity. The "reactively visionary" attribute and post-exile timeframe add texture without feeling checklist-driven. Minor proximity concern: "honor its shape" and "navigated what wasn't there" echo broader literary conversations about negative space, but the synthesis through Elira's archival lens and the valve's mechanical role provide sufficient transformation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elira (ocean-spray archivist) is present throughout; her choices drive key turns: returning post-exile, matching melody to valve mechanism, proposing the naming ritual instead of memorials. She appears in setup (opening paragraphs), development (archive work, fragment compilation), and payoff (council presentation, first ritual, final town-square image). Causal pressure is strong—her decision to honor silence's shape rather than fill it narrows the town's options and enables the ending tradition. Cost is visible: she forgoes restoration and restitution, choosing ephemeral voices over permanent monuments. Her role is indispensable; without her archival lens and fragment-to-meaning ethic, the story's logic collapses.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The herald's trumpet valve appears in setup (harbor silt recovery, satchel), development (widow's melody matched to valve pitch, attic layout beside sketches), and payoff (council presentation as mute compass, town square placement, children's question). It is handled on the page across multiple beats and returns with reweighted meaning: from silent relic to cipher to unpolished coordinate marker. Its specific properties (brass dulled, valve mechanism, corrosion rate) enable Elira's deductions and anchor the ending tradition. Cost connection is clear—leaving it unpolished forecloses restoration. Removing it would break the story's logic; no generic object could replace its acoustic, archival, and symbolic roles.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Navigated absences" shapes stakes (honor gaps rather than fill them) and tactics (Elira's method of matching fragments to voids, cross-referencing what isn't there). Present in setup (opening "absences—those hollows"), development (mapping grief into geography, chart showing where ships were missed), and payoff (ritual as navigation through silence, valve as compass for loss). The concept constrains Elira's choices—she rejects restoration and monuments—and changes the town's options at closure. It is dramatized through specific beats (valve deduction, ghost-fleet sketches, naming tradition) rather than merely thematic. Indispensable; the story's premise and ending both collapse without this exact framing.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Reactively visionary" is introduced early ("she did not predict futures, but perceived patterns in what others dismissed as voids") and shapes Elira's archival method—she responds to fragments rather than projecting forward. However, it functions more as characterization label than on-page constraint. The trait enables her deductions (melody to valve, buoy chime to position) but does not visibly limit or cost her in a specific beat; no moment shows her reactive stance forcing a trade-off or foreclosing a proactive path. It appears in setup, informs development via her let-loss-guide approach, but is largely absent from payoff. Swappable with "perceptive" or "pattern-sensitive" with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Hearten" appears twice: Elira "heartened" fisherfolk by listening (middle), and the closing summary states she "heartened the town...by giving [loss] coordinates." It shapes one turn—villagers begin leaving offerings after sensing her approach—but is not present in the council proposal or first ritual beats where major turns occur. Setup and development participation are clear, but the payoff mention is summary rather than dramatized action. The listening-as-heartening method enables trust accretion, yet the word itself could be replaced with "encourage" or "sustain" without major structural loss. Functional but not indispensable; the story's arc pivots more on Elira's compilation and ritual proposal than on this specific verb.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Through staggered intervals" is signaled early ("Through staggered intervals—sometimes days, sometimes weeks—she returned to the same storytellers") and shapes Elira's method: trust accrues slowly, like tide-silt. It reappears at payoff ("names echoed...each name a note in a chord only absence could compose" implies temporal spacing, and the seasonal ritual formalizes the interval pattern). The mechanics matter—patience and repetition enable the archive's compilation and the ritual's cadence. Causal pressure is present: rushing would break trust; intervals allow memory to surface. Removing it weakens the story's rhythm and the ritual's logic. Not fully indispensable (a similar temporal patience could substitute), but strongly integrated across setup, development, and payoff.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The ivory harbor (after rain, slick cobblestones, bruised sky, salt-warped attic, wharves, quay) is present throughout: setup (water's edge, post-exile return), development (customs house attic as workspace, harbor fog/gulls/brine as collaborators), and payoff (quay at dusk, town square for valve). It supplies resources (silt preserves the valve, tide logs enable triangulation) and pressures choices (Elira's solitary archive work, the ritual's waterside location). Micro-setting (body/tool) also functions: the valve, satchel, and notebook constrain her method. However, the harbor itself could be replaced with another coastal or archive-rich locale without breaking core logic; the valve and fragments do more causal work. The "after rain" detail charges the opening atmosphere but does not return or alter tactics. Solid integration, not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"After the exile ends" anchors the timeframe in setup ("She had returned after the exile ended") and establishes Elira's post-return context, but the exile itself is not detailed or pressured on the page. Development spans an unspecified duration ("sometimes days, sometimes weeks," "Years later, children would ask"), and the payoff ritual occurs "One evening" without a live clock tightening decisions. The timeframe provides backstory context and closure distance ("Years later") but does not constrain tactics or create urgency. Removing it would weaken Elira's motivation (return to navigate absences) but not break the archive-to-ritual arc. Functional setup, minimal development and payoff involvement.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"To compile fragments into meaning" is Elira's stated motivation in setup ("Her motivation was...to compile fragments into meaning") and is dramatized through development: valve deduction, cross-referencing, scroll assembly. It shapes her choice at payoff—proposing the naming ritual as compiled memory rather than monuments. Friction is present: the widow's frayed memories and the council's expectation of reparations create resistance. The desire is not merely told; Elira's notebook walks, attic layout, and scroll creation embody it. Cost is visible—she forgoes fame and restitution, choosing ephemeral voices. The motivation drives all three gates and constrains her options (she cannot restore the valve or demand statues). Strong integration; removing it collapses the story's logic.</comment>
