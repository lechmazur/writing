<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The archivist's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete actions (kneeling, brushing planks, opening journal), and her internal commitment to "preserve the weight of small moments" drives consistent choices. Interiority shows some specificity ("stubborn luminescence of love preserved"), but several beats rely on abstract declaration rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously—she never wavers or struggles with competing desires on the page. The grandmother exists only as memory object; no second on-page character tests the protagonist's stance, limiting relational pressure. Emotional progression is smooth and reflective rather than irrational or self-deceiving under stress.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through recurring imagery (locket, ink, jetty, covenant) and cadence rather than causal because/therefore linkage. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): the archivist commits to return "tomorrow, and the next twilight" in an act of sustained witnessing that forecloses retreat, with cost legible in "gently thorough" devotion and the acceptance that regeneration is incremental ("stitch by ink-stained stitch"). Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph. The piece teaches its lyric pattern early (metaphor-dense reflection interleaved with sensory anchors) and sustains coherence to closure, though the accumulative deepening is gradual rather than sharply tightened.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The blooming jetty at twilight is vivid and sensory (salt-crusted planks, jasmine curling through cracks, lanterns, tide sounds), filtered through the archivist's reverent attention. Micro-setting elements—locket, journal, walnut ink—recur and are handled on the page. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; the setting functions as atmospheric container rather than pressure source. The jetty's spatial choreography is clear but static, and no environmental detail forces a decision or shifts the final image beyond backdrop.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clearly signaled early: to preserve/regenerate the covenant through witnessing small moments. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure accrues through density and cadence rather than reversal, but no single on-page tightening forecloses a live option or forces a trade-off with visible cost. The archivist's final commitment to return is volitional but uncontested—no friction, loss, or renunciation alters her path. The stakes remain abstract (cultural memory) without a concrete test that narrows her choices on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—regeneration through small, proximate acts of memory—emerges organically from the archivist's journaling ritual and the locket photo, avoiding overt thesis. The final image ("walked home beneath a sky just beginning to star") offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture and metaphor ("tea steam curled around a confession," "joy threaded with loss"). Minor slip: "proximate causes no empire could erase" edges toward statement rather than pure implication, though it remains integrated with the archivist's worldview.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, and narrative distance is controlled with lyric compression taught early ("context changes" as an idiom, metaphor-dense interiority). Perceptual signature is present (archival framing: "memory became artifact," "each syllable transcribed a resurrection") but not sharply character-specific—diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("haunted euphoria," "proximate causes") that feels authorial rather than interior to the archivist's working mind. Syntax is purposeful but shows template cadence in places: repeated "she wrote" stems and parallel constructions flatten rhythm under pressure. No dialogue to assess.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Figurative language is dense and often effective ("sepia tones held sorrow like a vessel"), but pervasive metaphor in nearly every sentence of reflective beats creates drag rather than propulsion—lines do double aesthetic duty without always advancing situation or choice. Paraphrase loops appear: "to preserve the weight of small moments" is restated multiple times across paragraphs with synonym variation but no added pressure. Template cadence: runs of "She wrote…," "She did not…," "The [noun] [verbed]" reduce rhythmic variation. Several stock constructions: "stubborn luminescence," "haunted euphoria," "small eternal weights." Information density is moderate; some lines compress well, others linger for texture without momentum gain. No major clarity breaks, but scaffold and figurative saturation prevent high-band entry.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The walnut-ink archivist and regenerated covenant premise offer a specific, non-generic synthesis, and the focus on "proximate causes" rather than grand gestures provides a fresh angle on cultural memory. Emotional specificity in the locket photo and grandmother's laugh avoids template sentiment. However, the core frame—solitary figure at twilight performing ritual act of preservation/witnessing—is a familiar lyric-essay structure, and the piece does not transform it through bold structural or perspectival risk. The ending reaffirms the opening stance without friction or surprise, and several motifs (fireflies, lanterns, starlight) echo well-worn imagery without sharp reimagining.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The walnut-ink archivist is present throughout and her choices—kneeling, opening the locket, writing in the journal, rising to leave—structure the piece. However, these are serial acts of witnessing rather than decisions that alter tactics or foreclose paths; she enacts her established commitment without deviation or cost-driven adjustment. She appears early, is present in multiple beats, and her role is causally central, but the choices are observational and ritualistic rather than pressured turns.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The locket photo is handled in at least three beats: opening paragraph (brushing the photo's glow), mid-section (describing grandmother's eyes and wind/salt connection), and near the end (closing the locket with a click). It returns with reweighted meaning as the archivist layers memory with present sensory detail. However, the locket does not constrain a choice or enable a tactic—it functions as catalyst for reflection rather than as an object whose properties or absence would change the outcome. Early signal, multiple touches, and closure proximity support mid-band placement, but lack of causal pressure or visible cost tied to the object limits the score.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The regenerated covenant is named explicitly and shapes the thematic stakes: the archivist writes clauses and describes how covenants regenerate "through proximate causes." It appears early (first third), is developed in the middle (listing what shattered the covenant, how it can mend), and is referenced at closure ("she regenerated the covenant anew"). The concept frames her motivation and final commitment, but it remains abstract—no on-page choice tests whether the covenant is regenerating or what cost that regeneration demands. It shapes theme more than tactics or plot options, trending toward mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The attribute "gently thorough" is stated twice: once early ("She worked gently thorough, never rushing") and once near the end ("in the gently thorough act of remembering"). It describes her method but does not constrain an action with visible cost—there is no beat where rushing would have solved a problem or where thoroughness forecloses speed. The trait is labeled rather than dramatized through a tradeoff, and the adverb choice itself is non-standard ("gently thorough" instead of "gently and thoroughly"), reducing clarity. Present and thematically consistent, but ornamental in execution.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The action "steep" appears explicitly in the instruction to "steep the memory in metaphor—not to obscure, but to concentrate, like tea leaves releasing their soul into hot water." This image is striking and anchors the archivist's method, teaching the reader how she works. It recurs implicitly in the journal-writing beats and the final summary ("stitch by ink-stained stitch"). However, no major turn traces directly to steeping; the action describes process rather than enabling or blocking a decision. The tea-leaf simile is memorable and the verb integrates with the walnut-ink motif, supporting mid-band placement, but it does not redefine options at closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The method "through proximate causes" is named explicitly mid-piece ("covenants...regenerate...through proximate causes") and illustrated with examples: granddaughter learning recipes, stranger returning a glove, locket unearthed. The archivist's journaling is framed as accumulating proximate causes, and the final paragraph invokes the phrase again. The method shapes her philosophy and the story's thematic logic (small acts vs. grand declarations), but it does not alter an on-page attempt or force a tactical choice—it remains concept rather than dramatized mechanics. Present across beats and tied to closure theme, but swappable with "small gestures" or "incremental acts" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The blooming jetty at twilight is established in the opening line and returns with layered detail: salt-crusted planks, jasmine through cracks, lanterns flickering, tide sighing. It appears in the first beat, anchors the middle (description of scent and sound), and frames the ending ("jetty bloomed behind her, lanterns trembling"). The setting provides atmospheric coherence and a purposeful early–final reprise that reweights the tone (twilight blooming → night stars). However, the jetty does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome; it functions as charged backdrop rather than tactical pressure. Lyric resonance and strong presence across beats support this score.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The timeframe "when context changes" is stated in the second paragraph ("She had come when context changes") and referenced obliquely at closure (the turn from twilight to night, the implied cycle of "tomorrow, and the next twilight"). The phrase is evocative but abstract—what context changes on this particular evening is not dramatized. Time remains static within the single jetty scene; no clock or deadline tightens decisions, and the narrative present does not shift tactics based on temporal pressure. Present but vague, with no causal grip on the plot.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The motivation "to preserve the weight of small moments" is stated explicitly early ("Her motivation was simple, sacred: to preserve the weight of small moments") and dramatized through her journaling, handling the locket, and listing examples (tea steam, tremble before a kiss). It drives her choice to come to the jetty and to write, and it shapes her final commitment to return. However, the motivation is uncontested—no friction or competing desire tests it on the page. The protagonist's want aligns fully with her action; there is no visible cost or renunciation that would elevate the score. Early signal, thematic coherence, and closure linkage support mid-band placement.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The tone "haunted euphoria" is named explicitly ("a perfume of haunted euphoria—joy threaded with loss, beauty stitched with absence") and enacted through imagery: grandmother's laugh that "used to startle birds," the locket's "stubborn luminescence," the blend of salt, ink, and jasmine. The tone is coherent through reflective beats and modulates subtly as the archivist moves from memory (sorrow-tinged) to resolve (quiet joy). It charges the final image ("lanterns trembling like fireflies"). However, the tone does not shift under pressure or test the protagonist's stance—it remains a stable atmospheric layer rather than a force that complicates or intensifies. Strong presence and thematic fit, but limited dynamic range.</comment>
