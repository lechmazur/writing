<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The gardener's interior is present through embodied actions (humming, tracing threads, weeping) and her shift from soothing to stirring the dead tracks an arc. However, the transformation feels more asserted than earned—the realization about intentions as "messy, overlapping spirals" arrives without sufficient on-page contradiction or struggle. The final change (from lullabies to questions) lacks visible cost; we see no foreclosed path or sacrifice that makes the shift painful or difficult.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed: who/where/when emerges slowly across the opening, and the chess-clock timeframe is mentioned once without anchoring the reader in a clear present moment. The piece operates in Accumulative/Textural mode—density builds through the tapestry ritual—but closure relies on conceptual repricing ("intentions were not destinations, but gestures") rather than a decisive change with legible cost. The final image (whispering questions) reweights prior material, yet the cost remains abstract; no on-page action or forfeiture makes the shift undeniable. Lens holds, but the ending leans into theme-statement rather than dramatized pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The cobalt silo is vivid and purposeful: "curved walls drank the moonlight, turning the air into liquid twilight." The tapestry and sovereign case function as micro-setting objects that constrain the gardener's ritual choices. However, the cemetery above and the transition between graveyard and silo remain spatially vague—no anchoring details bridge the descent. The final image returns to the headstones, charging them as "thresholds," which elevates the setting's role in closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding intentions—is signaled early and pursued through the untangling ritual. Pressure accumulates via the threads' resistance and the gardener's emotional recognition, but escalation is textural rather than causal; no live choice tightens options or forecloses a path. The ending shift (from lullabies to questions) lacks visible cost: we see no trade-off, loss, or sacrifice that makes the transformation difficult or painful. The piece operates in Accumulative mode, yet the final tightening feels conceptual rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the tapestry's "messy, overlapping spirals" and the gardener's recognition of her own "silences she'd kept, love she'd trimmed like overgrown boxwood." The ending image (headstones as thresholds, whispering questions) offers a non-literal answer to the question of intentions. However, the penultimate beat—"intentions were not destinations, but gestures"—edges into thematic statement rather than remaining implicit. The piece resists tidy morals and invites reflection, yet the closure leans slightly toward articulation rather than resonance alone.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Voice is consistent and purposeful: "dew-damp grass," "liquid twilight," "riot of frayed threads" carry a distinct lyric texture. POV distance is stable throughout. However, register occasionally drifts into elevated diction that feels authorial rather than character-specific ("cartographer mapping sorrow," "velvet gloom"). The gardener's perceptual signature (tendency, humming, whispering) is established early and sustained, yet the prose does not modulate under peak stress—the tone remains uniformly poetic even during the climactic untangling.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Rhythm is controlled and imagery is vivid, but density issues accumulate. Several lines restate the same content: "not to repair, but to reveal" echoes "untangle...by decoding"; "centuries of stifled yearning exhaled at once" paraphrases the earlier "hollow hum beneath her ribs." Stock metaphors appear: "riot of frayed threads," "velvet gloom." The prose is clear and legible, yet multiple beats lean into ornamental description without advancing plot or character. Filter-verb clusters ("didn't fear," "didn't know," "no longer saw") dull immediacy in key moments.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The premise—cemetery gardener as tender of uncharted echoes—is fresh, and the tapestry ritual offers a concrete, grounded vehicle for the theme. However, the core emotional arc (realizing intentions are messy, half-finished) is familiar territory, and the piece does not fully transform it through unexpected causality or a non-obvious moral calculus. The sovereign case's reveal (dust and a silver needle) is evocative but feels somewhat predictable. The ending image (headstones as thresholds) is resonant yet lacks the boldness or risk that would elevate the synthesis into the high bands.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The gardener is present throughout and her choices (entering the silo, threading the needle, stitching) drive key beats. She appears in the closure (whispering questions), and her shift from soothing to stirring is legible. However, her decisions feel more ritualistic than conflicted—no moment where she must choose between competing goods or face a visible tradeoff. Her internal life is described more than dramatized under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The sovereign case appears early (in the satchel), is opened mid-story (revealing needle and dust), and grows "heavier, now humming" by the end. It participates in three beats and returns with reweighted meaning (confessions → dust → presence of the needle). However, the case does not constrain a choice or apply pressure; it functions as a thematic accent rather than a causal lever. Removing it would weaken resonance but not break the logic of the untangling ritual.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Uncharted echoes" is named in the opening ("sanctuary for uncharted echoes") and referenced at closure ("the uncharted echoes were not behind her...ahead"). However, the concept operates more as a thematic label than a stake that alters tactics. The gardener's actions (untangling threads) are not shaped by the echoes themselves; the echoes are what she discovers, not what she navigates. The concept is present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Tenderly organized" describes the headstones in the opening ("tenderly organized in rows like obedient scholars") and colors the gardener's care (tucking ivy, brushing moss). However, the attribute does not constrain an on-page choice or create a visible cost. It establishes tone but remains label-only; no moment where tenderness itself forces a tradeoff or complicates a decision.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Untangle" is the dominant action: signaled early ("This was why she'd come. To untangle"), dramatized mid-story (tracing threads, humming to release knots), and present at closure (the border loosens, threads curl like smoke). The action drives at least two beats and shapes the ending's imagery. However, the untangling itself is more ritualistic than causal—no moment where a knot's resistance forces a tactical shift or imposes a cost. Removing "untangle" would require significant edits, yet a near-synonym (decode, unweave) could substitute with minor changes.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The method is signaled early ("by decoding frayed threads in the tapestry's border, each knot a buried intention") and dramatized mid-story (tracing threads, humming to release them, threading the needle). The mechanics matter: specific threads (burnt umber, seafoam green) reveal specific stories. The method appears in two distinct beats and shapes the ritual's progression. However, the final untangling feels more lyric than mechanical—threads "curl like smoke" without clear cause-effect linkage. The method is essential to the ritual but does not impose a cost or narrow options.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The silo is introduced early ("descended into the cobalt silo under stars"), provides the space for the ritual (curved walls, steel beam, tapestry), and appears in the closure (looking up through "the silo's open crown" as a meteor streaks). The setting constrains the action: the silo's isolation and the tapestry's presence enable the untangling. The environment is causal—removing the silo would break the logic of the ritual. However, the silo does not pressure a choice or shift tactics mid-scene; it functions as a static container.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"After the chess clock ran down" is mentioned once in the opening and never referenced again. The timeframe does not tighten decisions, track elapsed time, or alter tactics. The descent into the silo and the ritual unfold without time pressure. The element is present but ornamental; removing it would not change the story's logic or momentum.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The motivation ("to discover the shape of intentions") is stated explicitly mid-story and dramatized through the untangling ritual. The gardener weeps from recognition, sees the shape of intentions ("messy, overlapping spirals"), and laughs at the realization. The desire is present in the closure (she now tends "every thread waiting to be untangled"). However, the motivation is more articulated than conflicted—no moment where the desire to discover clashes with a competing want or imposes a visible cost. The friction is internal (recognition of her own silences) but not dramatized as a choice under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Velveteen gloom" does not appear verbatim, but "velvet gloom" appears mid-story ("in the velvet gloom, between the sigh of thread and the hush of stars above"). The tone is consistent throughout: lyric, hushed, textured with dusk and twilight imagery ("dew-damp grass," "liquid twilight," "cobalt bowl of night"). The tone modulates slightly—opening is serene, middle is charged with recognition, ending is awake and forward-looking. The final image ("she whispered questions") shifts the tone from soothing to stirring, charging the closure without breaking coherence.</comment>
