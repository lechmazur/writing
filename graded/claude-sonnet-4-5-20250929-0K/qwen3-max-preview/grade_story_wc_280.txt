<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The ghost protagonist's motivation is clear but remains abstract—her drive to "lure possibility" never faces a concrete on-page dilemma that would force contradictory impulses. Interior life is heavily mediated through poetic description rather than embodied choice under pressure. The three echo-figures (woman, teenager, old man) receive only summary treatment; their transformations are told rather than dramatized with visible cost. Synesthesia functions as ornamental texture ("cerulean with flecks of brass") without constraining a single tactic or creating friction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the ghost weaves echoes and sings, the orchard responds, and the final tree-planting image reconfigures her own dissolution into ongoing possibility. Closure is present—she releases herself by rooting others—but the cost is asserted rather than felt; "her form thinned" appears suddenly without prior dramatization of what she sacrifices or forecloses. The fractured-timeline premise remains atmospheric backdrop; it does not narrow options or create a legible turn. Orientation is clear early (hedge maze, ghost, orchard), so no penalty applies.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The orchard and maze are vividly rendered with selective, purposeful detail: upward-flowing fountain, apple trees with "forgotten birthdays," silver sapling with stage-light leaves. These images charge the final moment and reflect the ghost's synesthetic perception. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; the ghost moves freely without spatial friction or resource scarcity. The setting functions as resonant backdrop rather than active pressure, capping the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early (lure possibility from despair) but remains abstract throughout. The ghost's spinning of the tarot coin and her seven-note song are presented as successful without resistance, negotiation, or visible trade-off. The three echo-figures respond immediately; no reversal or tightening tests the ghost's commitment. The ending reweights her own dissolution, which qualifies as a deepening under the Accumulative lens, but the lack of on-page friction or cost legibility keeps escalation modest.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Theme of transformation through surrender emerges clearly from image and action, avoiding direct statement. The tarot coin and sapling function as purposeful motifs that shift meaning at closure. However, the ending soft-sells its cost: the ghost "was gone" but "the orchard remembered," which cushions the trade-off and reduces emotional friction. The three vignettes (woman enrolls, teenager auditions, old man tells stories) are told rather than shown, flattening the thematic payoff into summary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited voice maintains consistent psychic distance and a lyric, elevated register that matches the ghost's operatic past and synesthetic perception. Perceptual signature is distinct: colors, scents, and sounds interweave throughout. No head-hopping or POV leakage. Diction remains coherent under pressure, though the elevated register occasionally risks distancing the reader from embodied stakes (e.g., "wove herself into echoes" is metaphorically rich but physically abstract). No dialogue present; not applicable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Prose is lyric and imagistic with strong rhythmic control: "her voice turned grief into lilac mist, joy into golden chimes that clung to skin like perfume." Some paraphrase loops appear: "fractured timelines" and "time's fraying edges" restate the same concept without added pressure; "thread" recurs without functional variation. Figurative density is high but mostly coherent; no mixed metaphors or clarity breaks. The closure beat avoids loops, preserving its charge. Template cadence in the three-echo sequence ("From one fissure… From another…") is brief and purposeful, not penalized.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The ghost-seeking-encore premise and synesthetic opera-singer backstory are familiar tropes executed competently but without fresh transformation. The fractured-timeline orchard and hand-painted tarot coin add texture but do not redefine the emotional or causal arc in non-obvious ways. The three echo-figures and their resolutions (community theater, school musical, park-bench stories) follow predictable beats without specificity or surprise. The ending's tree-planting image is resonant but not structurally daring; the piece remains within safe middle ground of lyric fantasy without bold risk.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The encore-seeking stage ghost is present throughout and her final act (spinning the coin, singing, planting the tree) shapes the closure image. However, her choices lack on-page friction or cost legibility; she moves without opposition or internal conflict. Setup clear, closure participation clear, but middle development shows her succeeding without trade-off. The element is functional but not indispensable—swapping "ghost" for "spirit" or "phantom" would not alter the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The hand-painted tarot coin appears early (setup), is spun above the fountain (middle beat), and is tossed into the fountain to sprout the sapling (closure). Three beats with clear participation. However, its mechanics are vague—spinning "doesn't land" but "hovers, trembling"—and its specific properties (painted by the stagehand, reversals and uprights) do not constrain tactics or create visible cost. It functions as a magical token without irreplaceability; a charm, talisman, or seed could serve similarly.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Fractured timeline is described early ("blossoms from spring brushed shoulders with autumn's rotting fruit, dewdrops reflected futures that never bloomed") and the orchard "bent" timelines at closure. However, the concept remains atmospheric; it does not narrow options, create a dilemma, or force the ghost to navigate conflicting temporalities. The three echoes are described as splinters from other times, but their mechanics are told, not dramatized. Present and ornamental, but replaceable with "magical" or "enchanted" orchard.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Synesthetically blessed is established in backstory ("every note she sang painted colors in the air, every silence rang with scent") and reappears when the ghost perceives the child's laugh as "cerulean with flecks of brass, smelled of wet pavement and cinnamon." Setup and closure-adjacent use are clear, but the trait does not constrain a single action or create a trade-off. It functions as descriptive flavor without mechanical consequence; the story would run unchanged if the ghost simply "heard" or "sensed" without synesthesia.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Intertwine appears explicitly when the ghost's notes "intertwined with the echoes, braiding despair into something softer," shaping the middle turn. The action is signaled early ("threading her essence through time's fraying edges") and returns in the closure sequence. However, "intertwine" is largely synonymous with "weave," "braid," or "merge"—swapping the verb would not alter the story's logic. The action is causal but not irreplaceable; mid-band functional use.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Producing echoes is signaled early ("each step producing ripples of applause, gasps, and curtain calls") and the ghost summons three echoes from the fountain in the middle beat. The method is present and shapes the middle turn, but its mechanics are vague—how does she produce echoes? The final song "braided despair" but is not explicitly tied to echo-production. The method is functional but interchangeable with "summoning," "calling," or "conjuring."</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The mystic orchard garden concealed within the hedge maze is established early and houses the climactic fountain and sapling scenes. Setup, middle (orchard responds to her presence), and closure (sapling sprouts) are all present. However, the setting does not constrain tactics or supply a resource under scarcity; the ghost moves freely. The maze's "ever-shifting corridors" are mentioned but never tested. The orchard charges the final image through its specific textures (silver bark, stage-light leaves), lifting the score into mid-6s via lyric reprise.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>After the business closes is mentioned in the opening line and recurs in the final summary ("after the business closed each night"). However, the timeframe does not create urgency or constrain the ghost's actions; she has eternity. No ticking clock, no deadline forcing decisions. The element is present at setup and closure but remains ornamental, serving primarily to establish ambiance rather than pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>To lure possibility from the brink of despair is stated early and motivates the ghost's actions: she seeks the thread, spins the coin, summons echoes, sings to them. The motivation is clear and drives the plot. However, it is never tested by conflicting wants or visible cost; the ghost succeeds without friction. The three echoes' responses (enrolling, auditioning, storytelling) are summary rather than dramatized friction. Setup and closure participation are strong, but lack of on-page conflict caps the score.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Rising nostalgia is sustained throughout: the ghost's operatic past, the burned theater, the synesthetic memories, the final image of "petals fell like confetti." Tone is coherent and modulates subtly from wistful opening to bittersweet closure. The sapling's "stage-light gold" blossoms and the ghost's smile as she dissolves charge the ending with melancholic hope. However, the tone does not sharpen under pressure or create friction; it remains gently elegiac without tonal risk or surprise.</comment>
