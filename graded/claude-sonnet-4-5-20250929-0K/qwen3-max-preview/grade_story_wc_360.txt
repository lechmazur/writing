<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The protagonist exists as a conceptual figure rather than a psychologically embodied person. Interiority consists entirely of abstract philosophical poses ("deliberate ambiguity," "transposed empathy") without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final walk into darkness reads as allegorical closure without earned causality—no prior choice sequence makes this renunciation necessary or costly on the page. Motivation remains declared ("hunger—the gnawing need to map the unmappable") but never dramatized through a micro-choice that reveals competing values under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>No clear closure unit emerges. The protagonist walks away after completing "the final type," but this act is not prepared by any on-page tightening of options or felt cost—she has been setting type and distributing pamphlets throughout, and the ending simply asserts finality without dramatizing what changed or what was lost. Orientation debt: who/where/when anchors arrive late (~150 words) and remain vague (no city, no calendar year, "topaz workshop" functions as mood-label rather than spatial anchor). The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, but no cadence shift or pattern break reweights the dominant stake at closure; the final glyph and the walk are asserted rather than earned by prior pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The topaz workshop supplies vivid mood ("amber glow," "spectral equations," "panels that refracted starlight") but never constrains a choice or alters tactics. Spatial choreography is absent—props float without fixed positions, and the press, workbench, and walls lack relational geometry. The halo fragment's glow and the vanishing stars function as symbolic décor rather than environmental pressure. Micro-setting credit: the press itself is handled once ("The press groaned as it rolled"), but this remains descriptive; the protagonist's interaction does not change based on the tool's state or resistance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake ("to map the unmappable") is signaled but never tested—no on-page scene forces a trade-off between competing methods or costs. The protagonist distributes pamphlets and tests the halo fragment on others (the skeptic clockmaker, the warlord) without facing meaningful resistance or consequence herself. The final typesetting and departure occur without escalation; earlier beats (borrowing personalities, pressing the fragment to her temple, setting type) do not narrow options or raise cost. No reversal or tightening is present; the narrative is a static catalog of prior acts summarized in past tense.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Theme (empathy as dimensional space, emotion as mathematics) is stated repeatedly in abstract language rather than emerging from concrete dramatized experience. The final glyph that means "beginning," "ending," and "bridge" is asserted symbolic rather than earned through prior image-work that reweights its meaning. The piece leans heavily on meta-commentary ("deliberate ambiguity as pedagogy, as pilgrimage, as scalpel") in place of scene pressure. One modest strength: the line "empathy without boundaries was erosion, not expansion" gestures toward cost, though this realization is told rather than shown through a choice that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The prose maintains a consistent elevated register and a distinct lyric texture (heavily Latinate, philosophical diction). However, psychic distance collapses frequently into authorial omniscience: the narrator asserts knowledge of off-page events (the warlord weeping, the clockmaker's collapse) without plausible access. The protagonist's perceptual signature is indistinct—her way of noticing does not shift when she "borrows personalities"; diction and syntax remain uniform. Free indirect style is abandoned in favor of expository summary ("She didn't know its origin, only that..."). No dialogue appears, so those bullets do not apply.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade: "grief could be graphed, joy differentiated, love integrated" immediately follows "the slope of a sigh, the integral of a sob, the asymptote of longing," restating the same conceit. Template cadence runs dominate ("She didn't distribute them; they found their recipients—left on doorsteps, tucked into library books, slipped between..."). Filter-verb stacks ("she believed," "she suspected," "she realized") dull immediacy in peak beats. Stock metaphors ("ink in water," "tongues of fire and frost," "slots between their ribs where new equations took root") cluster without fresh transformation. The final third inherits these artifacts, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8 per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The premise (emotion as mathematics, empathy-space collapsed into a halo fragment, letterpress as pedagogical weapon) offers conceptual novelty, and the topaz workshop under vanishing stars supplies distinct mood. However, execution relies on familiar lyric-essay templates: the solitary artisan, the mysterious cosmic object, the transformative pamphlets that "find their recipients." The emotional arc (losing her name in borrowed identities, walking away unnamed) lacks the specific, lived friction that would transform the premise into felt human complexity. The warlord and clockmaker vignettes read as stock transformations (hardened heart softened, skeptic converted) without non-obvious moral calculus.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>The cryptic letterpress operator is present throughout but makes no on-page choice that alters tactics or narrows options. She sets type, presses the halo fragment to foreheads (off-page for the warlord, summarized for the clockmaker), and walks away—all actions are catalogs of prior habit rather than decisions under pressure. No turn results from her agency; the ending is a posed exit rather than a choice with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The halo fragment appears in multiple beats (pressed to her temple, given to the clockmaker, placed atop the press, dimming after each use) and is described with specificity (jagged, luminous, pulsing in time with moods). However, its use is summarized rather than dramatized—the clockmaker's collapse and the warlord's weeping occur off-page. The fragment does not constrain a choice or enable a tactic the protagonist must struggle to execute; it functions as a magical prop whose mechanics are asserted rather than tested on the page.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>Transposed empathy is declared as the protagonist's method ("she borrowed personalities like coats") and labeled throughout ("transposed empathy," "collapsed empathy-space"). However, no on-page beat demonstrates how borrowing a specific personality alters her options or tactics in a scene. The widow's grief and the mad mathematician's fractured genius are claimed but do not change what she types or how she works; the text tells us she wears them without showing tactical friction or cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>The trait "habitually borrows personalities" is mentioned repeatedly but never constrains or enables an action with visible cost. The protagonist "wore the grief of a widow" and "borrowed the personality of a mathematician," yet these borrowings do not create on-page conflict, misfire, or force a trade-off. The realization that "empathy without boundaries was erosion" is told in past tense as backstory rather than dramatized through a present choice that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Disorient" appears as stated method ("she let recipients wrestle with the discomfort," "disorientation was the first step toward deeper knowing") and effect (the halo fragment "disoriented her—not with chaos, but with lucid turbulence"). However, no major turn traces to an act of disorienting on the page. The clockmaker and warlord disorientations are summarized in past tense; the protagonist herself is not shown struggling with disorientation in a way that alters her tactics or forces a choice. The action is asserted as theme rather than enacted as causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.3</grade><comment>Deliberate ambiguity is declared as her method ("This was her method: deliberate ambiguity. She never explained the pamphlets' meaning") and repeated in the final beat ("deliberate ambiguity as pedagogy, as pilgrimage, as scalpel"). However, the mechanics are told rather than shown—no scene demonstrates how she crafts ambiguity or how it shapes an attempt that then fails or succeeds. The method appears as thematic claim rather than tactical choice under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The topaz workshop is introduced early (~50 words) and described with vivid detail (amber glow, spectral equations, panels that refract starlight into glyphs). It appears in the final beat when she places the halo fragment atop the press and walks into the dark. However, the setting never constrains a choice or supplies a resource that affects outcome—the protagonist's actions would be unchanged in a different workshop. The setting functions as atmospheric backdrop rather than tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The timeframe "between vanishing stars" is signaled early ("worked beneath a vault of vanishing stars") and returns in the final paragraph ("When the last star vanished"). The text claims she "worked fastest" during this window and that "tonight" she sets the final type. However, no ticking clock tightens decisions or alters tactics—the timeframe is poetic metaphor rather than dramatized constraint. The protagonist's pace and choices do not visibly shift as the stars vanish.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The motivation "to understand the mathematics of emotion" is stated explicitly ("Her motivation was not altruism but hunger—the gnawing need to map the unmappable") and echoed in titles and imagery (equations, derivatives, integrals). However, it is never dramatized through a choice where this desire conflicts with another want or imposes a cost. The protagonist pursues this goal without friction, obstacle, or trade-off on the page; the motivation exists as thematic claim rather than enacted pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Tone "lucid turbulence" is established through diction (Latinate abstractions paired with sensory fragments: "ozone and static," "fire and frost," "heartbeats under starlight") and maintained throughout without jarring shifts. The prose sustains a consistent elevated, philosophical register that modulates slightly in the final beat ("walked into the dark, her name still unsigned"). However, the tone does not charge the final image with new pressure or reweight prior material—it remains a single static mood rather than a cadence shift that deepens stakes.</comment>
