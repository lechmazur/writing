<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The keeper's scattered-memory state is labeled throughout but rarely constrains a present choice with visible cost. Her motivation to rekindle the realm is declared, yet the hum she initiates feels passive—others join spontaneously without friction or trade-off visible on her part. The final shift from "keeper of fragments" to "loom" is asserted rather than earned through contradiction or renunciation that forecloses a prior path. Embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure remain thin; the piece leans on atmospheric description over dramatized interiority.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation (who, where, when) arrives promptly and the allegorical frame is taught early. The closure unit—mica windows releasing hoarded light as voices rise—qualifies as a Resonant Reconfiguration under an Accumulative/Textural lens. However, the cost remains conceptual and atmospheric; no on-page sentence shows the keeper or the community forfeiting a concrete option or enduring visible sacrifice. The final image reweights prior material but the lack of felt price in the ending beat caps the score mid-band.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The alchemical orchard, mica windows, and moss-starred greenhouse are vividly rendered with consistent sensory detail. The mica windows constrain the realm's access to dawn and the keeper's palm-press against the largest pane launches the climactic turn. Spatial choreography (iron staircase, citrus tree apex) remains clear. The setting charges the closure image by releasing hoarded light, satisfying the 9+ gate for Q3; minor descriptive drift and a few generic adjectives ("low and warm," "ancient, necessary truth") prevent full high-band entry.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>One dominant stake—rekindling communal song to restore woven dawns—is signaled early and sustained. The middle turn (keeper hums, others join) constitutes a single tightening under the Accumulative lens. Yet the escalation arrives through spontaneous coalition rather than protagonist agency that narrows options or imposes trade-off; the keeper invites and others answer without visible friction. No on-page refusal, resource limit, or competing obligation tests her commitment. The lack of felt cost in the ending beat holds the score mid-band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Theme—communal song as swaddling fabric—emerges from the premise but is articulated in the final paragraphs via direct statement: "to swaddle a soul is to give it space to grow, and to swaddle a people is to let them sing until their dawns are whole again." The closing mirror/reclamation image offers a resonant answer, yet the thematic echo in prompt-like language ("ancient, necessary truth," "the realm remembering itself") flattens subtext. Motifs (mica, swaddle, song) recur but do not constrain choice or accumulate pressure across distinct beats.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Single third-person POV remains stable with a lyric register that fits the allegorical frame. Perceptual signature is consistent ("light here was memory made visible," "dawn-light responding to the vibration of near-remembered music") and the prose modulates at the climax when voices join. Psychic distance widens in the final two paragraphs, declaring outcomes ("She had not fixed the world. She had reminded it how to hold itself") rather than dramatizing them. The shift from embodied perception to summarized wisdom costs momentum and caps the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and figurative density is high throughout without pattern-teaching or clear payoff ("swaddle newborns, soothe the grieving, and stitch neighbors into kin"). Mixed metaphors appear ("roots beneath a forest floor" adjacent to textile weaving; "cradle" and "shroud" used interchangeably). Paraphrase loops cluster in the final third: "She was no longer keeper of fragments. She was the loom" echoes "She had not fixed the world. She had reminded it how to hold itself." Template stems recur: "She remembered… She closed… She let… She wept… She was…" The high metaphor load in peak beats and synonym churn ("resonance… vibration… rhythm… harmony") trigger the artifact penalty pack; total deduction −1.0 in Q7, with artifacts touching closure disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The allegory of communal song restoring a fragmented realm echoes widely used templates (collective ritual healing a broken world). The mica-window mechanism and swaddle motif add texture but do not transform the emotional or moral calculus in a non-obvious direction. The ending reaffirms the premise without complication or counter-pressure. No bold risk or fresh synthesis elevates the familiar frame; the piece executes at a competent level within its template.</comment>
