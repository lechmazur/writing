<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The historian's interiority is specific and embodied—"fingertips brushing spines as if reading their whispers," "hands knew which pages trembled"—but remains largely observational. The final choice to descend and "learn to weave" arrives through discovery rather than contradiction or struggle; no competing impulse acts simultaneously. The embodiment is strong, yet the protagonist never faces a moment where two wants collide on the page with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the historian packs tools and commits to descend, crystallizing stakes ("realign the stories...so the world might remember how to stand upright") with conceptual cost legible in the final image. The accumulative lens holds—discovery stacks pressure through diary fragments, tapestry cross-reference, wall whispers—and one meaningful deepening occurs when "the displaced axis wasn't random. It was a wound." Minor orientation delay (historian's name "dissolved into footnotes" without grounding who/where until "silo library") costs −0.2, but the effect pays off thematically.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The reclaimed silo is vivid and specific: "grain silo rusted into reverence," bronze lamp pooling "like liquid metal," walls humming with memory. The tapestry fragment constrains the final insight and the silo ash becomes a tool she packs, charging the closure. Spatial choreography is clean (fireplace, worktable, corkboard, walls) and the environment pressures her interpretation. The micro-setting (tapestry, diaries, ash) drives the turn and shapes the ending image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>One dominant stake—collecting and mending stories to realign meaning—is signaled early and deepens at the tapestry cross-reference: "Match." The discovery that "someone, long ago, had tried to stitch it shut" narrows options from passive collection to active mending. The final commitment to "learn to weave" forecloses passivity with felt cost (she must descend into the underlibrary where "gravity still stutters"). One meaningful tightening under an accumulative lens with cost legible at closure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme—memory as repair, stories as structural thread—emerges through concrete images (dragons mending rifts, tapestry as blueprint, ash as testimony) rather than statement. The displaced axis operates as both metaphor and condition, integrated into world logic. The final image offers resonance: "not to restore the axis—but to realign the stories around it." However, "the walls smiled back" edges toward overt sentiment, and the phrase "When the axis slips, follow the thread that dragons guard" borders on allegorical shorthand.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature throughout: "seismograph feels tremors before the quake," "ink smudged by fire, sentences amputated mid-thought," "whispers rose: a lullaby in a dead dialect." POV remains stable third-limited with controlled distance. Diction is elevated but consistent and voice-motivated ("bronze quiet," "brittly ghosts"). Rhythm modulates well under pressure. Minor register drift: "existential: the day gravity forgot its duty" reads slightly explanatory for the established voice, but does not harm closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>High information density with layered images: "diaries, their covers charred into abstract landscapes, their spines split open like ribs after autopsy." Rhythm varies purposefully. However, mild paraphrase loops appear: "The displaced axis wasn't an event; it was a condition" restates "not celestial, not political, but existential" without added pressure (−0.2). Template cadence in the opening third ("She was," "She'd seen," "She carried") stacks filter constructions (−0.4). No artifacts touch closure, so accumulation cap applies.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of archivist quest, displaced axis as both cosmic wound and narrative condition, and medieval tapestry as repair manual is non-obvious and purposeful. The post-human frame ("after the last human dream is dreamt") and the underlibrary with "gravity still stutters" add fresh texture. Yet the core—lone scholar discovers ancient blueprint to mend metaphysical rift—echoes familiar templates. Transformation through specificity (walls as witnesses, ash as testimony) lifts it solidly but does not fully escape derivative contours.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Present from the opening and drives two beats: probing the fireplace to find the diaries, cross-referencing symbols to reach the insight that prompts her decision to descend. Her choices (pack, descend, learn to weave) shape closure. Setup, development, and payoff gates met. Causal pressure moderate; the historian reacts to discoveries rather than forcing tension through conflicting wants. Specificity high ("sensitively perceptive...like a seismograph"), cost visible (she commits to descent with unknown outcome).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Introduced early ("pinned to the corkboard"), returns with reweighted meaning when she notices "the dragons...weren't just weaving stars—they were mending rifts." Drives the cross-reference beat ("symbols from the diary with marginalia") and charges the final image ("the tapestry's dragons glowed faintly"). Three functional beats, causal pressure strong, closure linkage clear. Irreplaceable: the dragons' mending gesture is the key insight. All three gates met; felt cost tied to the element (she must now follow their blueprint).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Signaled early ("displaced axis"), shapes middle discovery ("wasn't random. It was a wound"), and anchors closure stakes ("realign the stories around it"). Drives two beats and alters tactics from passive collection to active mending. Specificity high: "tilted doorframes," "clocks that ran backward," "gravity forgot its duty" make it concrete. Cost legible: she must descend and learn a dangerous craft. All three gates met; causal pressure solid.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Label established early ("sensitively perceptive...like a seismograph") and demonstrated: "hands knew which pages trembled," wall whispers rise under her palm. Enables one key action (cross-referencing symbols others might miss) but no visible tradeoff or cost on the page. Lyric reprise at closure ("someone sensitively perceptive enough to probe the silence") reweights the trait thematically. Two gates (setup, payoff); middle development weak. Causal pressure moderate; no constraint or friction dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The action of probing drives the fireplace discovery and the wall-touch whisper beat. Two functional uses, causal pressure moderate. Present by the second paragraph, shapes middle turn (finding the diaries), and resurfaces at closure in her commitment to "probe the silence." Swappability moderate: "search" or "investigate" would function similarly with minor edits. Cost indirect: probing leads to knowledge that compels descent. All three gates met but causal necessity modest.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Half-burned diaries appear at ~20% mark, drive the cross-reference beat, and supply the phrase "follow the thread that dragons guard" that shapes her closure decision. Two beats, causal pressure solid, closure linkage clear. Specificity strong: "covers charred into abstract landscapes, spines split open like ribs." Cost visible: deciphering scorched text constrains her and the diary's final line directs her next move. Setup, development, payoff gates met; late first appearance (−0.3) offset by causal necessity.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Silo library established immediately, provides spatial anchors (fireplace, worktable, corkboard, walls), and the walls' hum delivers a key beat ("Whispers rose"). The underlibrary mentioned at closure stakes the descent but does not pressure earlier choices. Two beats (fireplace discovery, wall touch), moderate causal role. The silo's "bronze quiet" charges tone but does not alter tactics. Setup and development gates met; closure participation indirect (she will leave the silo, so it frames rather than shapes the ending).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Timeframe signaled in the second sentence ("after the last human dream is dreamt") and echoed at closure ("since the last dream faded"). Atmospheric but does not tighten decisions or create urgency. No ticking clock, no time-based pressure on tactics. Lyric reprise reweights the frame thematically (silence "grew teeth") but imposes no cost. Two gates (setup, payoff); middle development absent. Causal pressure minimal; functions as world-building rather than constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Motivation stated early ("to collect the stories walls have heard") and demonstrated through multiple actions (probing fireplace, cross-referencing, touching walls). Drives three beats and shapes closure commitment to "realign the stories." Friction appears when she realizes passive collection is insufficient—"not to restore...but to realign"—imposing the cost of descent and craft-learning. Setup, development, payoff gates met. Causal pressure solid; cost legible but arrives late, so desire is more told than conflicted until the ending.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Tone established early ("bronze quiet," "brittle ghosts," "ash still clung like regret") and sustained through elevated diction and layered images. Modulates under pressure: discovery beats quicken syntax ("Match. Then...Match again"), closure slows to lyric cadence ("In the dark, the tapestry's dragons glowed faintly"). The bronze lamp image bookends (lit, then blown out), and "bronze quiet" returns at closure to charge the final line. Coherent, purposeful, and present in the ending image with felt resonance.</comment>
