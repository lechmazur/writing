<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Veyra's interior is richly layered with embodied memory (mammoths, botanist past, reincarnation scars) and her micro-choices—pressing palms to the sundial, whispering coordinates of possible species—show contradictory impulses between mourning and midwifery. However, the interiority leans heavily on poetic summary rather than moment-by-moment contradiction acting in scene. The final shift from mourner to midwife is signaled but not earned through a dramatized on-page struggle; the botanist memory provides texture but doesn't constrain a present choice with visible cost. Atomically reflective skin remains label-only and never forces a tradeoff.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece builds density through layered memory, recurring brass instruments, and the hum motif, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration when Veyra shifts the sundial shadow "not toward extinction, but toward genesis." Closure lands as Charged Poise—she realigns the library's purpose with felt cost (her own atomic resonance channeled into brass, prior self's dissolution acknowledged). Orientation anchors (tidal library, Veyra, cloud-tides) arrive early. One meaningful deepening occurs when the cloud-tide floods and she must secure Chamber Seven, forcing her from passive witness to active realignment. Cost is conceptual and felt but would be stronger if a specific path were visibly foreclosed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The tidal library above clouds is vivid and purposeful: vapor floods constrain Veyra's movement, brass sundials guide her ritual alignment, the stone circle's hum provides tactile feedback. The sundial in Chamber Seven—gnomon bent left, shadow pointing to woodpecker coordinates—charges the final image when Veyra realigns it toward genesis. Sensory detail (salt-crusted stone, damp knees, metallic tang of ozone) is filtered through her priorities. However, the spatial choreography during the flood sequence remains somewhat abstract; we don't track her path through the galleries with enough physical specificity to elevate past strong.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: preserve the library's alignment and translate isolation into independence. The cloud-tide surge forces one meaningful tightening—Veyra must physically channel her resonance into the sundial when the stone circle falters, a direct test of her commitment. Her choice to whisper coordinates of possible species (not resurrection of past ones) narrows options and reweights her role from archivist to midwife. However, the antagonistic pressure is environmental coincidence rather than protagonist-driven escalation; the hum "falters" without prior causality linking it to her actions. Cost is felt (she expends her atomic resonance) but the trade-off remains somewhat abstract.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from Veyra's actions: coexistence means "making space for ghosts without letting them haunt," and the piece moves from mausoleum to loom without stating a moral. The brass sundial's shadow shift—from extinction's coordinates to genesis—offers a resonant, non-literal answer. The reincarnation memory (botanist with dissolving pages) provides specific loss that primes the final realignment. Subtext operates in silence and image (she does not mourn aloud, does not speak to ghosts). One minor slip: "translate isolation into independence" is articulated slightly too cleanly as a thesis, though it's earned through the whispered coordinates and the final breath sequence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Voice is lyric and confident with a distinct perceptual signature: Veyra notices mammoths as "echo," measures time by stone-circle hum, and filters sensory detail through her archivist lens. Psychic distance is stable third-limited. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register that feels authorial rather than character-particular ("sovereignty," "genesis," "midwife" as culminating metaphor all arrive with slight essay tone). Filter verbs ("she recalled," "she knew") are acceptable but cluster in reflective blocks. No dialogue to judge. Purposeful compression (no books, only echoes) is taught early and pays off, but the prose sometimes prioritizes lyric texture over immediate embodied perception under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and figurative language is dense (library as leviathan, skin as refracted memory, shadow trembling toward extinction's grave). However, overwriting pervades: nearly every sentence in the opening third carries metaphor or elevated diction without respite, flattening urgency. Paraphrase loops appear: "not vanity, but survival" / "not gift, but burden" / "not mourner, but midwife" becomes a template cadence across multiple paragraphs. The flood sequence gains clarity but then the ending returns to stacked modifiers ("ozone and possibility—the metallic tang of worlds being rewritten"). Information density is high but momentum drags under the figurative load. No major causality breaks, so artifacts remain here. Deduct −1.0 for template cadence, overwriting density in non-peak beats, and paraphrase loops; disallow 9+ globally per artifact rule.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The synthesis—tidal library as reincarnation archive, brass sundials tuned to extinct-species coordinates, archivist who channels atomic resonance to realign toward genesis—is specific and non-obvious. The piece commits fully to its lyric premise and follows through: shadow pointing to woodpecker becomes shadow pointing to hybrids. Risk-taking in structure (mosaic of memory and present action) and voice (sustained high register) heightens stakes without obscuring the closure effect. However, the "contemporary of extinct species" + "reincarnation memory" + "atomically reflective" combination reads as prompt-checklist elegant rather than organic discovery. The emotional arc (mourner to midwife) is more fresh than the fantastical furniture. Transformation is present but not radical.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Veyra (contemporary of extinct species) drives two key beats: she recalls mammoths and the botanist life, then actively secures the sundial and whispers new coordinates. Setup is immediate (first paragraph), middle choice (channeling resonance into brass) depends on her layered memory, and the ending explicitly reweights her role from mourner to midwife. However, the "contemporary" trait mostly supplies texture; the choices would work if she were simply ancient or long-lived. Cost is tied more to her reincarnation memory than to being a contemporary. Band: two beats + closure linkage + setup, minus moderate swappability = mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Brass sundial appears in setup (Chamber Seven sundial, gnomon bent left), middle beat (Veyra presses palms to its base during flood, channeling resonance), and ending (shadow shifts toward genesis, sundial gleams). It constrains her action (she runs to secure it, physically channels energy into it) and charges the final image (the realignment is visible in the shadow's new direction). Three-gate + causal pressure + closure linkage + specificity (bent gnomon, crooked shadow, coordinates) push toward high-7s. Slight swappability (another instrument could theoretically serve) and the ending cameo being more lyric than mechanical cap just below 8.5.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Brittle awakenings recur as a time marker ("each brittle awakening," "one brittle awakening," "by next brittle awakening") and frame the cloud-tide cycle. Setup is early, it returns at the flood beat, and the final paragraph references it. However, it functions primarily as atmospheric labeling rather than shaping tactics or narrowing options; Veyra's choices would proceed identically if the phrase were "each dawn." The concept evokes fragility but never constrains a decision with cost. Two gates (setup, closure mention) + modest thematic charge = lower-5s.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Atomically reflective is mentioned in paragraph three ("skin, atomically reflective, shimmered with refracted memory") and again when Veyra channels resonance into the sundial ("skin flaring gold," "skin flaring cobalt," "skin shimmering"). Setup is present, middle beat shows flaring during the save, ending mentions shimmer. However, the trait is purely descriptive; she never faces a cost or enabled action specific to being atomically reflective. It could be "luminous" or "resonant" without altering the plot. Two gates + ornamental use + high swappability = low-3s.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Coexist is the thematic spine: Veyra's goal is to "coexist… not passive harmony; it was active resistance," she makes space for ghosts without haunting, and the ending culminates in "the lightness of coexistence—not with what was gone, but with what might yet be." Setup frames it (paragraph five), the middle turn (whispering coordinates of possible species rather than resurrecting the past) enacts it, and the final image (breathing, stone humming, turning the page) embodies it. The action shapes the dominant stake and the realignment choice. Three gates + causal pressure + closure charge, minus slight abstraction (told more than shown in key beats) = mid-7s.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The hum of the ancient stone circle is signaled early (paragraph six: "hum of an ancient stone circle buried beneath the vapor-sea"), powers the sundial alignment ritual, falters during the flood (forcing Veyra's intervention), and steadies when she channels resonance. Setup, middle constraint (the hum's failure creates the problem she must solve), and closure participation (hum vibrates through her, sundial aligned by it) are all present. Mechanics matter: the hum is the library's heartbeat, and its failure/recovery drives the key turn. Three gates + causal role + specificity, minus the fact that another resonance source could swap in = upper-6s.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Tidal library above clouds anchors the piece from the first line, supplies concrete constraints (cloud-tide floods the lower galleries, forcing Veyra to run; vapor hisses against brass; the library groans), and charges the final image (library as loom, tide carrying ozone and possibility). The setting is both macro (above clouds, no earthly hour) and micro (Chamber Seven, damp stone underfoot). Three gates + spatial constraint that alters tactics (flood forces the save) + closure linkage (library "turned its next page") + high specificity = upper-7s. Just shy of indispensable because the realignment could theoretically occur in another fantastical archive.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Reincarnation memory is setup in paragraph eight ("memory that returned not as dream, but as scar tissue"), recalled in the botanist flashback, and referenced in the ending ("for the first time since her reincarnation memory returned, she felt not the weight of extinction"). It provides emotional weight and primes the theme but does not function as a timeframe that tightens decisions. The story unfolds in one continuous cloud-tide cycle; "after" is a backstory anchor, not a ticking clock. Two gates (setup, ending mention) + modest thematic charge + no tactical pressure = upper-5s.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Translate isolation into independence is articulated in paragraph nine and enacted in the ending when Veyra moves from solitary mourning to active midwifery, whispering coordinates and realigning the sundial. Setup is clear, the middle choice (channeling resonance rather than letting the alignment shatter) dramatizes self-reliance, and the ending explicitly names the shift ("the lightness of coexistence" realized through independent action). However, the motivation is told more than shown in friction; Veyra's wants and costs are poetically summarized rather than tested in contradictory impulses within a single beat. Three gates + closure linkage, minus limited dramatized friction = low-7s.</comment>
