<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to understand echoes is signaled early and her final choice—singing to the entity rather than destroying it—tracks character. However, interiority leans heavily on abstract poeticism ("weight of a question that had hollowed her") rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The shell-triggered revelation structure unfolds passively through progressive disclosure instead of active wrestling with options. The final stance feels predetermined rather than forged under pressure, and embodied emotion remains thin across peak beats.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): the entity is reduced but not destroyed, and the protagonist's throat-raw exhaustion signals cost. Orientation anchors early (canyon singer, serpentine nexus, starlight). The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural—layers of echo-lore build toward the final singing confrontation—but causality is blurred: the shell's three-layer revelation arrives via summary exposition rather than dramatized discovery, and the entity's curiosity-to-compliance shift lacks a visible turn. The closure image ("sigh curled in the roots") reweights prior material, yet the cost feels asserted more than demonstrated on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The serpentine nexus, canyon walls, and twin moons create a vivid frame, and the shell is handled across multiple beats (pressed to temple, glowing, harmonizing). Sensory detail is rich but occasionally decorative ("salt-crusted silk," "dust-devils") without constraining choice. The spatial anchor holds throughout, and the final willow-root image charges closure. Setting does not meaningfully narrow options mid-scene—wind-carved hollows and coiled arches remain atmospheric backdrops—but the shell as micro-object qualifies and the nexus as nest-site matters at closure, pushing this into mid-7s.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (stop the entity's resonance-theft) is clear by the second paragraph. Escalation under the Accumulative lens reads as layered revelation (first, second, third truths), but each layer arrives via told exposition rather than a tightening choice that narrows options. The climax—singing the entity into dormancy—lacks a visible trade-off or reversal; the entity simply shrinks in response to her lullaby without resistance or cost-forcing complication. Agency is present (she chooses to sing rather than destroy) but the path feels frictionless, and the cost (raw throat, lighter soul) is asserted in summary rather than felt through a foreclosed option.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme—stolen echoes as unfinished grief, song as restitution—emerges from image and action rather than statement. The final image (entity reduced to a sigh, shell silent) reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext operates in the lullaby choice and the entity's shift from feeding to listening. The three-layer reveal structure risks abstraction, and "reed-blown melancholy" in the motivation line edges toward authorial label, but the closing resonance (purpose fulfilled, song returned) offers a non-literal answer to "why some people echo" that avoids didacticism.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited holds cleanly with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present (echo-trained ear, marrow-frequency perception) and diction stays elevated throughout ("serpentine," "unravel the webs," "knotted themselves"). Register is poetic but consistent; no jarring colloquialisms. Purposeful compression appears in the progressive-disclosure structure, though elision of the shell's arrival backstory feels strategic rather than obscuring. Psychic distance remains stable. The prose carries distinct texture, but sentence stems occasionally repeat ("She learned," "She sang," "She would") in the final third, and the elevated idiom does not modulate under peak stress, flattening urgency slightly.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and figurative language is dense but mostly coherent. However, paraphrase loops appear: "echoes were not reflections but residues" is immediately restated via the three-layer structure. Template cadence runs in the climax ("She sang of children… of lovers… of warriors"). Stock metaphors ("veins of silver," "lean closer") recur without fresh payoff. Filter verbs ("she realized," "she knew") cluster in exposition. No major clarity breaks, but density artifacts and synonym churn ("whispers grew louder," "syllables overlapping," "harmonizing") in peak beats dull immediacy. Line-level control is adequate but not publish-ready without tightening.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The echo-as-theft premise offers a fresh angle on grief and resonance, and the choice to sing rather than fight transforms the expected confrontation trope. However, the seashell-as-oracle, mute-child-messenger, and entity-in-the-nexus setup reads familiar from fantasy templates. Emotional specificity (mother's lullaby, lovers' last words) grounds abstraction, but the three-layer revelation structure and twin-moons detail feel ornamental rather than inevitable. The piece commits to its lyric-fantasy register, yet the synthesis does not fully escape derivative framing.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The canyon echo singer is present throughout, frames the dominant stake (stop resonance-theft), and makes the final choice to sing rather than destroy. Her perceptual training enables the shell-reading beats. However, many turns arrive via shell-triggered revelation rather than her active decision-making. The lullaby choice in the climax is hers, altering the entity's state, but the path to that choice is laid by exposition rather than tactical pressure. Two beats (shell at temple, singing at climax) plus closure participation earn mid-band placement, but passivity during the progressive-disclosure structure limits causal agency.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The whispering seashell half appears early (first paragraph), is handled in at least three beats (brushing, pressing to temple, cradled against ribs, glowing during song), and its silence at closure ("the shell now silent") reweights its prior function. It delivers the three-layer echo-lore that shapes her understanding and guides her pitch in the climax. Removing it would break the revelation mechanism and the closure resonance. Its specificity (cracked spiral, salt-crusted, glowing faintly) matters on the page, though its role leans toward oracle-object convenience rather than contested resource.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Webs of intrigue" is mentioned once in paragraph eight ("unravel the webs of intrigue") and again at closure ("The webs of intrigue loosened"), but the concept remains abstract. The text describes echo-harvesting and vanished travelers as the actual conflict; "webs" functions as metaphorical description rather than a concrete stake or constraint that alters tactics. It does not shape on-page choices—she learns layers of echo-lore and sings, but "intrigue" (plotting, schemes, mystery networks) is asserted rather than dramatized. Present but ornamental, trending low-functional.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Richly perceptive" is demonstrated via her ability to feel cosmic frequencies "vibrating in their marrow" and to pitch her song into "frequencies that unraveled knots in the air." This enables the climax singing but does not visibly constrain or cost her—she succeeds without a perceptual tradeoff or sacrifice. The trait is functional (one beat: climax execution) but not irreplaceable; "trained voice" or "magical sensitivity" could substitute. No on-page friction where heightened perception forces a difficult choice or exacts a price.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Ensure" (the lost find their way back) is stated as her realization in paragraph seven and directly motivates the climax: she sings to return stolen resonance, ensuring the unfinished find listeners. This action drives the final confrontation and shapes the entity's response. However, the verb is somewhat abstract—"return," "restore," or "sing" could substitute with minor edits—and the execution (singing stories aloud) reads as one extended beat rather than multiple distinct moves. Present in setup (realization) and closure (act + result), with clear causal linkage, earning solid mid-7s.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Through progressive disclosure" governs the structure: three echo-layers revealed sequentially by the shell, each earned by "silence, stillness, surrendering her own voice for days at a time." The method is signaled early (paragraph fourteen) and shapes her learning arc, though the actual revelations arrive as summary exposition rather than dramatized discovery beats. It affects her knowledge trajectory but does not constrain climax tactics—she simply sings once she knows. The method appears in setup and indirectly in closure (knowledge applied), fitting the lyric-resonance allowance: purposeful pattern with thematic payoff, no mid-scene use pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The serpentine nexus under starlight is named in the opening line, functions as the entity's nest (paragraph eighteen), and recurs at closure ("deepest coil of the nexus"). Its spatial properties (wind-carved hollows, coiled arches, canyon walls that shiver) create atmosphere and house the entity, making it necessary to the confrontation. However, the setting does not constrain her choices—she kneels, listens, and sings without navigating obstacles or using terrain tactically. Early setup, closure presence, and entity-linkage earn upper-6s, but lack of tactical pressure or resource constraint caps it below 7.5.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"While the universe hums its secret song" is poetic framing in paragraph four, describing cosmic background rather than a ticking clock. Time passes ("by dawn") but does not tighten decisions—there is no urgency, deadline, or deteriorating condition that forces her to act faster or differently. The phrase recurs obliquely (shell "silent" at dawn suggests the hum has ended), offering thematic closure but no tactical pressure. Functional as atmospheric frame but replaceable with "at night" or "under starlight." Present in setup and implied at closure, but no middle development or time-driven escalation.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"To learn why some people echo" is stated early (paragraph two) as the question that "hollowed her for years," directly motivating her investigation. The three-layer revelation answers this question (echoes are residues of unsaid truths and harvested by the entity), and her climax choice (sing to return stolen resonance) flows from that understanding. The motivation drives setup, middle discovery, and closure action. However, the desire is told rather than shown through conflicted choices or friction between wanting to know and fearing the answer. Strong causal linkage and closure participation, with minor deduction for lack of embodied tension around the want itself.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Reed-blown melancholy" is embedded in the motivation paragraph and pervades the piece: her lullaby choice, "not rage but reed-blown melancholy," and the final image (sigh, silent shell, soul lighter) all sustain a mournful-but-resilient register. Tone modulates subtly from trembling question (opening) to raw-throated resolve (closure) without breaking coherence. The metaphor (reed bends but does not break) recurs and charges the final stance. However, tone remains somewhat static across the climax—no sharp tonal shift under peak pressure—and the elevated lyricism does not vary much with urgency. Coherent, purposeful, and closure-linked, earning mid-7s.</comment>
