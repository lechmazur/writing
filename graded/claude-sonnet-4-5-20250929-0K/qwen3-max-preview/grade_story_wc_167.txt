<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The glazier's interiority is concrete and consistent—his observation-driven method and motivation are embodied through the prism work and stone-drop ritual. However, no meaningful choice under pressure appears; he moves through a habitual morning with gentle reflection but never faces a decision that forecloses a path with visible cost. The father's backstory anchors his perceptual stance effectively, and embodied details (calloused fingers, knees protesting) ground the character. The lack of stakes-driven agency prevents higher scoring despite strong texture.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Orientation is clean (who, where, when by the opening lines). The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens—dawn ritual → stone drop → prism removal → departure—but no meaningful tightening or deepening occurs; the glazier's state at the end is indistinguishable from the beginning. Closure requires a Resonant Reconfiguration or Conceptual Repricing with cost; here the final image ("compass points") restates the premise without reweighting it or foreclosing any option. The Cost Proof Test fails: no on-page sentence shows a felt or conceptual price paid.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Pearl Bay at dawn is rendered with sharp sensory specificity (fog "like breath held too long," cormorant droplets "like scattered coins") filtered through the glazier's professional lens. The prism functions as micro-setting, constraining his craft and charging multiple beats. Spatial choreography (pier, tide pool, atrium frame, satchel) remains clear. The setting does not force a choice, but the prism's role in his work and the widow's window errand link environment to his daily purpose, reaching mid-7s for functional integration without closure constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"to illuminate value in the mundane"—is signaled early but never tested. No reversal or tightening appears; the stone-drop and prism-packing are steps in a familiar routine, not choices under pressure. The piece presents contemplation without opposition, consequence, or foreclosed paths. Under the Accumulative lens, a single deepening or cadence shift that reweights the stake with cost is required; none materializes. Agency is limited to habitual ritual.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Theme (finding the sacred in the ordinary) emerges organically from image and action—prism refraction, tide-pool rings, the widow's window repair—without overt statement until the final paragraph's "compass points" phrase. The father's shipwright lesson and the cormorant's droplets serve as grounded particulars. However, the ending ("always what you chose to see between the lines") edges toward maxim, and no thematic tension or cost is dramatized; the glazier's worldview is affirmed rather than tested or reweighted.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and sustained: elevated yet concrete diction ("noctilucent reckonings," "liminal hour"), sentence rhythm that breathes with the mist, and perceptual signature (light-bending, pattern-reading). No dialogue is present. Focalization is stable, third-close with deep access to the glazier's sensibility. The prose occasionally drifts toward poetic abstraction ("ghost-map of forces," "gallery of living stained glass") but remains legible and character-specific. Psychic distance is controlled; no head-hopping or register mismatch appears.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully (short bursts during the stone drop, longer meditative sentences elsewhere) and information density is high. However, a cluster of figurative language in the first half ("study in gradients," "breath held too long," "scattered coins," "ghost-map") verges on overwriting without clear pattern-teaching. Minor paraphrase appears ("not to escape the mundane, but to consecrate it" echoes earlier phrasing). The prism-handling and widow's window beat are propulsive, but the final paragraph's "compass points" metaphor feels decorative rather than necessary. No major loops or scaffold, but density enforcement would tighten the piece.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The combination of glazier-as-contemplative, dawn ritual, and physics-as-prayer offers a specific synthesis. The premise (craftsman finds meaning through refraction and ripple-reading) is fresh in detail but structurally familiar—the artisan-mystic at work. No bold risk or transformation; the story commits to its lyric mode but does not subvert or deepen it through conflict. The widow's window errand is a purposeful particular, and the father's shipwright backstory personalizes the theme. Mid-6s for competent specificity without narrative surprise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The glazier is present throughout and his observation skill is demonstrated (reading ripples, noting cormorant droplets, planning the widow's repair). However, he makes no choice that alters tactics or stakes; his actions are habitual ritual. Setup and development are clear; closure participation is descriptive only (he carries the reckonings as "compass points"). Two beats (stone drop, prism removal) involve him, but neither constrains or changes his options. Functional but replaceable as a contemplative observer.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The prism atrium appears early (first paragraph), is handled in the stone-drop beat (refracting dawn light), and is removed and packed for the widow's repair (closure beat). Three distinct beats with evolving use. However, the prism does not constrain a choice or carry visible cost; it is a tool for illumination, not a pressure point. The widow's window errand ties it to the theme but does not reweight prior material. Strong development and closure presence, but no causal pressure or irreplaceability—swappable with another refractive tool.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Noctilucent reckonings" is named in the text and defined as "rare, luminous moments of clarity...when the mind, the world, and the light briefly synchronize." It describes the glazier's experience but does not shape his stakes or tactics; no decision hinges on achieving or missing this state. Present as thematic echo only, not as causal force. Ornamental use without development or closure pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Reads between lines" is demonstrated early ("ripples, cloud breaks, the hesitation of a heron") and frames his observational method. Middle development: he interprets the tide-pool rings. Closure: the final line restates it ("what you chose to see between the lines"). Two beats, but no on-page cost or constraint; the trait is affirmed rather than tested. The skill enables perception but does not create friction or force a tradeoff. Functional across beats, but swappable with "observant" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Commune" appears explicitly ("to commune through the patterns in the rings") during the stone-drop beat, and the entire dawn ritual is an act of communion with physics and resonance. Setup and development are clear. However, no major turn traces to this action; it is contemplative rather than generative of conflict or choice. The action frames his method but could be replaced with "meditate" or "observe" without altering the story's arc. One key beat (stone drop) with lyric reprise at closure, but no causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The method (reading ripple patterns after dropping a stone) is demonstrated on-page: he drops the river stone, watches the concentric rings, interprets their "information" (speed, depth, tension, wind), and closes his eyes to "feel its pulse." Setup early, development in the tide-pool beat, closure reference ("the rings...had faded...but their pattern lingered"). Two beats with clear mechanics. However, the method does not shape a choice or alter tactics; it is performed and described, not tested. Functional integration without causal necessity.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Pearl Bay at dawn is anchored immediately and supplies the mist, tide pool, pier, and liminal light that the glazier uses for his ritual. Setup, development (stone drop in the tide pool), and closure (departure as mist frays) are present. The setting provides the conditions for his work (fog softens, tide pool receives the stone) and the timeframe tightens his window. However, the bay does not constrain a choice or force a trade-off; it is a stage for his ritual rather than a pressure source. Strong presence across beats and closure, but no causal cost.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Before everything shifts" is named in the opening and closing, framing the liminal dawn window. The timeframe is dramatized: fog clings, fishermen have not yet arrived, the mist begins to fray at the end. Setup and closure are strong. However, the time limit does not tighten a decision or force a sacrifice; the glazier completes his ritual and departs without urgency or cost. The window is thematic (liminality) but not causal. Two beats with clear boundaries, but no tactical pressure or foreclosed option.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The motivation (illuminate value in the mundane) is stated early and demonstrated through the prism work, stone drop, and widow's window plan. Setup and development are clear; closure restates it ("not to escape the mundane, but to consecrate it"). However, no friction between want and cost appears; the glazier's desire is fulfilled without obstacle or renunciation. The motivation frames his actions but is affirmed rather than tested. Two beats with closure reprise, but no dramatized conflict or visible price.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Tone is coherent and controlled: contemplative, elevated, lyric, with no tonal breaks. The prose modulates from the opening's hushed mist to the stone-drop's focused attention to the closing's gentle momentum. "Clear complexity" is evident in the layered imagery (prism refraction, ripple physics, father's lesson) woven without confusion. The tone charges the final image ("compass points") with quiet resonance. However, no tonal shift under pressure occurs; the mood is static rather than responsive to escalation. Strong coherence and closure linkage, but no dynamic modulation.</comment>
