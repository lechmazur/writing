<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elira's motivation is established (weighing truth against empire), but her interior contradiction is muted; she moves smoothly from dread to agency without visible ambivalence or cost in the deciding moment. Embodiment is present (barefoot on velvet, palm to floor) but emotional states lean toward performed gestures rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The Chancellor's transformation reads as spectacle rather than earned psychological alteration; his silent kneeling lacks the friction of prior arrogance colliding with new reverence. The micro-choice to lift the violin and sound it arrives without dramatized hesitation or visible trade-off.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors arrive clearly (observatory, Elira, midsummer, pre-dawn arrival). The closure unit—violin melting into seeds, Chancellor kneeling, garden sprouting—reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise: options crystallize, the empire's weight is transferred to roots). Cost is conceptual (empire's narrative perforated, Chancellor silenced by vines) but the physical price to Elira is absent; she steps back unscathed, which dilutes felt consequence. The causal lens holds through the middle (coffee-stain prophecy → plant telepathy → violin resonance → seeds) but the Chancellor's transformation lacks a because/therefore hinge; his reverence arrives as aesthetic tableau rather than motivated shift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The velvet observatory is richly textured (constellations as bruised mulberries, plush floor, wisteria tendrils) and setting constrains the final choice: the plants (moss, ferns, mycelium) become conduits for the violin's resonance, and the Chancellor's threshold arrival triggers the melt. Micro-setting qualifies—body (barefoot contact with floor) and recurring object (violin on pedestal) charge the closure image. Sensory selection is purposeful (starlight through crystal ribs, dew vibrating off ferns) and filtered through Elira's gift. The velvet itself becomes a living fabric by the end, fulfilling the constraint test for the 7+ band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: authenticate the violin or propagate truth via resonance, weighing dream against empire. One meaningful tightening occurs when the coffee-stain prophecy shows the bridge collapsing and Elira decides to sound the violin, narrowing options from passive authentication to active disruption. However, the escalation relies on magical properties (ice melts into seeds, vines grow from shadow) rather than Elira's agency under constraints; she observes the transformation more than she drives it. The Chancellor's arrival complicates but does not force a trade-off; Elira's choice to play the violin is visible but the cost (physical, relational, or renunciatory) is not legible on the page—she steps back into clover without forfeit.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme of contested legitimacy (looted relics vs. returned echoes, perforated empire narrative) emerges through the violin's transparency and the plant network as witness. The final image—garden replacing instrument, Chancellor kneeling—offers a non-literal answer to whether truth can outweigh empire, and the "mulberry ache" (sweet, bruising sorrow of endings that make room for roots) charges the closure with earned ambiguity. However, the piece leans toward overt statement ("She had to propagate the truth"; "She had weighed the dream against the empire") rather than letting image and action alone carry meaning. The phrase "before the promise loses its glow" appears in her thought, risking thematic echo, though it stops short of moralizing the resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited on Elira; no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and consistent ("velvet silence," "perforated destiny," "mycelium thrumming with dread") but occasionally drifts into abstract poeticism ("accumulated witness," "terrestrial truth") that feels more authorial than character-particular under peak stress. Psychic distance tightens appropriately when Elira kneels and communes with plants. The Chancellor's interiority remains external (we see his frozen stare, his voice tangling in vines) which is correct for single-POV. Filter verbs ("she understood," "she now understood") appear but are sparse and voice-motivated. Perceptual signature is present (Elira's plant telepathy colors her noticing) but the prose at climax tilts toward lush narration rather than urgent, character-driven perception.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout ("bruised mulberries," "perforated destiny echoing like question marks," "green wave rippling outward") and remains coherent within the lyric register, but the accumulation in peak beats (violin sounding, seeds scattering, vines threading Chancellor's coat) risks decorative overwriting without always advancing causality. Sentence openings vary and rhythm modulates between long, clause-heavy lines and short declarations. Minor loops: "The wisteria sighed. The moss yawned. The ferns leaned in" reads as patterned parallelism (acceptable if taught) but "silence—thick, velvet silence" and "propagate... propagated... propagating" recur without added pressure. Clarity remains high; no causality break. Information density is moderate; some lines (e.g., "velvet observatory hummed with the breath of midsummer") serve atmosphere more than plot. The final paragraph's repetition ("not in soil, but in silence. Not by wind, but by witness") is purposeful but borders on rhetorical flourish.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Core premise—provenance researcher with plant telepathy uses ice violin to propagate suppressed history—synthesizes elements in a non-obvious way. The transparent violin as "accumulated witness" and the melt-into-seeds transformation offer fresh inflections on relic authentication and empire critique. However, the story's moral calculus (truth vs. power, green patience vs. gilded arrogance) follows a familiar template:善 defeats 恶 through organic, decentralized witness. Elira's gift and the violin's properties combine organically, and the Chancellor's silent defeat by blooming vines is visually memorable, but the arc (lone scholar disrupts corrupt regime via mystical means) does not take an unexpected turn in hindsight. Specificity in setting and object elevates the execution without fully escaping the template's gravitational pull.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Elira (provenance researcher) is present throughout and makes two key decisions: reading the coffee dregs (prophecy) and sounding the violin (propagation). Her role as researcher frames the authentication demand but her choices stem more from her telepathic gift than from archival expertise. She shapes the middle beat (communion with plants) and the climax (playing the violin), meeting the two-beat threshold. However, her decision to play arrives without visible cost or dramatized hesitation; she lifts the violin, sounds it, and steps back unscathed. The research role is ornamental; her choices could proceed identically if she were a curator, archivist, or mystic. Early signal and closure participation are present, but swappability and lack of tied cost cap the score in mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The ice violin is introduced early (resting on pedestal), handled in the middle beat (Elira lifts it, brushes strings), and transforms at closure (melts into seeds). Its transparency is causally active: "Each crystal facet held a stolen name... perforations in the empire's grand narrative, waiting to be sounded." The resonance when played threads through plants and triggers the Chancellor's encounter. The melt is irreversible and charges the final image (garden replaces instrument). Specificity is high (ice crystal, no bow needed, tone that vibrates dew). Minor friction: the violin's mechanics (why it melts, why seeds emerge) are asserted rather than earned by prior setup. Three beats, closure linkage, and causal pressure place it in the 7+ band; lack of visible cost tied to its use (Elira suffers no consequence for sounding it) and mild swappability (another mystical instrument could serve) prevent the 8.5+ tier.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Perforated destiny" appears as metaphor (violin "echoing like a perforated destiny—full of holes where choices should have been made") and recurs in the propagation beat ("perforated destinies of a thousand silenced souls, each hole... now a conduit for truth"). It is ornamental rather than mechanical; the story does not dramatize how holes in destiny constrain Elira's choices or tactics. The concept seeds theme (empire's narrative has gaps) but does not alter on-page options. Present in setup and thematic echo at closure but never used as a decision point or obstacle. Lyric reprise without causal work caps it in the low-mid band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elira's accidental plant telepathy is established early ("ivy whispered warnings and roses sobbed when cut") and enables two on-page actions: communion with wisteria/mycelium (middle beat: "they're coming to weigh a dream") and the amplification network when she sounds the violin ("not just with the wisteria now, but with the moss... ferns... pollen"). The gift constrains her method (she must ask plants to remember and carry) and shapes the climax (resonance travels through root and stem). Cost is light: she did not ask for the gift and it causes childhood distress, but no on-page price is paid when she uses it at closure. Early signal, two beats, causal pressure, and closure linkage are present. Lack of visible trade-off (no stamina drain, social penalty, or tactical sacrifice) and mild abstraction (how the network functions is asserted) keep it below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Propagate" is the story's governing verb: Elira must "propagate the truth, not through documents or decrees, but through resonance"; she asks plants "to remember. To carry. To grow"; the violin's seeds "propagated. Not in soil, but in silence. Not by wind, but by witness." The action shapes the middle turn (communion) and defines the climax (sounding the violin to spread witness). The ending tableau (garden sprouting, future propagating) is a direct payoff. Early signal in Elira's reflection, two beats, and closure linkage are strong. Minor friction: the action is partly passive—plants and seeds propagate themselves once Elira sounds the note—so her agency is shared with the mystical network. Causal pressure and closure participation place it solidly in the 7+ band; shared agency and lack of on-page cost to Elira cap it below 8.5.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Coffee-stain prophecy is introduced early ("she brewed it to read the future in its stains, an inherited gift") and used in one beat: Elira swirls dregs, sees glyphs (bridge collapsing, violin melting, seedlings sprouting, silence after the bell). The prophecy frames her decision to propagate rather than authenticate, shaping tactics. However, the method is summary-only ("watching the sludge congeal into glyphs only she could decipher") without dramatized mechanics or cost (no ritual, no ambiguity, no price for the vision). It does not recur at closure; the violin and plant telepathy do the causal work in the climax. Early signal and one beat of causal pressure qualify it for mid-band, but summary-only use and absence from the ending cap it below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The velvet observatory is present throughout: domed ceiling with constellations, plush floor, wisteria on eastern arch, mycelium beneath velvet, ferns in ventilation shafts, skylights admitting pollen. Midsummer anchors warmth and humidity (horses snorting steam, dew on ferns). The setting supplies resources: plants are the amplification network, and the velvet floor becomes the substrate for sprouting clover and roots. Spatial choreography is clean (Elira kneeling, Chancellor at threshold, violin on pedestal). The observatory's function (cosmic observation) is thematically contrasted with terrestrial truth. Early signal, middle involvement (mycelium communion), and closure linkage (velvet fabric trembling, garden replacing instrument) meet the three-gate test. The setting constrains method (plant telepathy requires living flora) and charges the final image. Strong integration; minor cap for midsummer being more atmospheric than tactical (no time pressure tied to season).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Before the promise loses its glow" appears once in Elira's thought near the ending and once as a thematic echo in the final paragraph. The timeframe is not tracked as a live clock; the Chancellor's arrival "before dawn" sets urgency but no countdown or tactical pressure derives from the phrase. It functions as lyric mood rather than constraint. Late first appearance (final third), no middle development, and ornamental closure use yield low integration. The story's actual time pressure (Chancellor arriving before dawn) works independently of the "promise loses its glow" formulation, which could be removed without altering tactics. Present in theme only; does not shape choices.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The motivation "to weigh a dream against an empire" is stated explicitly in Elira's reflection ("They're coming to weigh a dream against an empire. The dream was hers... The empire? A gilded cage...") and enacted in the climax (she sounds the violin, propagating truth, and the dream tips the scale). The desire is clear and shapes her choice to commune with plants and play the instrument. Friction is present: she must choose propagation over authentication, risking the Chancellor's wrath. However, the weighing is more thematic assertion than dramatized dilemma; Elira does not vocalize doubt, face a counter-pressure, or pay a visible price for her choice. Early signal, one decision beat, and closure linkage are present. Lack of on-page cost or conflicted interiority (the choice feels inevitable rather than hard-won) caps it in mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Mulberry ache" is introduced in the opening (constellations "shimmered like bruised mulberries") and returns in the final paragraph ("every thread in its fabric trembling with mulberry ache—the sweet, bruising sorrow of endings that make room for roots"). The tone of bittersweet sorrow, beauty under pressure, and organic transformation is consistent throughout: Elira's dread, the violin's expectancy, the wisteria's murmur, the Chancellor's silent defeat. The tone modulates with pressure (dread → resolve → charged stillness) without flattening. The final image charges the phrase with earned specificity (roots replacing empire). Early signal, coherent modulation, and closure reprise that reweights the opening establish strong integration. Minor cap: "mulberry ache" as a descriptor risks precious lyricism; the phrase does not mechanically constrain a choice, so its work is atmospheric and thematic rather than tactical.</comment>
