<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The protagonist is presented through abstract labels ("tender shadow keeper") rather than embodied choices under pressure. Interiority consists of metaphorical assertions ("burns bridges carefully") without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The closure moment—stepping through the threshold—lacks visible cost tied to a concrete trade-off; the protagonist enacts symbolic gestures (hovering, pressing, whispering) without dramatized struggle or foreclosed paths. Therapy-speak intrudes at peak beats: "teach suffocating to breathe," "lungs remember air," "permission to fumble in the dark."</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural, but the piece does not teach a coherent pattern by the midpoint; instead it layers metaphors without a stable organizing principle. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) remain vague past 120 words: "tender shadow keeper" is a title, not a name; "ashen charcoal sanctuary" is metaphorical rather than spatial. The closure unit attempts Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), but cost is asserted through abstraction ("the lesson is complete") rather than shown through a visible forfeiture or altered option on the page. No meaningful tightening narrows options or changes knowledge under the chosen lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Sensory detail is vivid but primarily visual and metaphorical: "starlight pooled thickest," "air thickened, tasting of burnt sugar and old tears." Spatial choreography is impressionistic—threshold, sanctuary, field of lanterns—without clear distances or physical constraints. The doorknocker ring and charcoal dust anchor one beat each, but neither constrains a choice or charges the final image with visible consequence. The setting functions as lyric atmosphere rather than a pressure that alters tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"to teach suffocating to breathe"—is declared but never tested through a concrete trade-off or live consequence. No meaningful tightening occurs: the protagonist arrives, hovers, steps through; each beat reiterates symbolic intention without narrowing options or forcing sacrifice. The threshold "dissolves" rather than resisting, removing friction at the moment of climax. Agency reads as passive enactment of a predetermined ritual ("not to knock," "she did not look back") rather than a decision forged under pressure with visible cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Theme—healing through acceptance of absence—emerges from repeated metaphors (burning bridges, teaching suffocation to breathe) but is stated rather than dramatized. The final line ("suffocation ends not when air returns, but when you stop fighting the shape of your own throat") is direct thematic summary, not a non-literal image that reweights prior material. Subtext is minimal; nearly every beat explicates its symbolic intent. The piece invites reflection through lyric intensity, but the closing paragraph moralizes instead of letting particulars resonate.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Voice is consistent and elevated, with distinct rhythmic control ("not with fire, but with measured silence, each severed tie a stitch pulled from a fraying tapestry"). Perceptual signature is poetic but uniform: every detail is filtered through the same metaphorical register without degradation under stress. No dialogue. Purposeful compression and patterned syntax (anaphora, parallelism) are taught early and sustained, but focalization remains abstract—no concrete sensory anchors ground the narrator's way of noticing. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Figurative language saturates nearly every sentence without pattern-taught payoff: "breath shallow," "cold curve," "sanctuary exhaled dust," "threshold shimmered—not with magic, but with memory." Mixed metaphors appear: scars "pulse" and become threads to "weave," while breath "stirs ash" and simultaneously "coaxes wicks to remember flame." Paraphrase loops recur: "she burns bridges carefully" appears three times with slight variation. Template cadence: "She did not knock. / She did not flinch. / She does not bring light. / She does not look back." Overwriting in high-pressure beats (threshold dissolution, final step) obscures causal linkage and dulls the closure image. Register drifts into therapeutic abstraction ("curriculum of suffocation," "permission to fumble") that clashes with the lyric voice.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The core premise—returning to a site of past rejection to offer a lesson in absence—is familiar in contemporary literary fiction, particularly in trauma-recovery narratives. Metaphorical diction ("shadow keeper," "linking through scars," "teach suffocating to breathe") reads as assembled from lyric-essay templates rather than grounded in specific lived detail. The protagonist's symbolic actions (hovering, pressing, whispering) could transfer unchanged to another setting; the sanctuary, doorknocker, and lantern-field lack irreplaceable particularity. Risk-taking is tonal rather than structural: the piece commits fully to elevated lyricism, but that commitment does not heighten stakes or reveal a non-obvious moral calculus.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The "tender shadow keeper" is present throughout but makes no on-page choices that create turns. She arrives, hovers, presses, steps through—each action symbolic rather than causal. The threshold dissolves without resistance, removing the need for decision. No visible cost or trade-off is dramatized. The character is a vehicle for metaphor rather than an agent whose choices alter options. Mentioned in setup, middle, and ending, but all beats are ornamental enactment.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The doorknocker ring is handled in two beats: tracing its curve at the opening and clattering to the ground at closure. The ring's "weight heavier than iron" is asserted but does not constrain the protagonist's action—she chooses not to knock, rendering the ring inert. The final clatter ("its purpose spent—not discarded, but released") is summary rather than reweighted meaning. The ring does not enable or prevent any choice; it is present but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The "fading threshold" shapes the setting and is present in setup (shimmering outline), middle (groaning in recognition), and ending (dissolves, surrenders). It provides the spatial frame for all action. However, it does not constrain choice: the protagonist steps through without resistance or cost. The threshold's dissolution is presented as inevitable rather than earned through the protagonist's agency. The concept shapes stakes thematically but does not alter tactics on the page.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Burns bridges carefully" is stated three times as a descriptive refrain but never enacted with visible cost. The protagonist has already cut contact before the story opens; no on-page bridge-burning occurs. The attribute is label-only, used to characterize past actions rather than to constrain or enable present choice. No trade-off or tactical consequence is dramatized. Present in setup and ending as thematic echo, absent from middle development.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Encroach" is named once ("To encroach here was not trespass—it was sacrament") but the protagonist's physical crossing of the threshold is described as stepping, pressing, and dissolving rather than encroachment with friction. The action is functionally identical to "enter" or "cross"; its specific connotation (gradual intrusion) does not shape the scene's mechanics. Present in middle and ending but does not redefine options or create a turn.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>"Linking through scars" is introduced in the middle third and explained ("not metaphor, but mechanism"). The protagonist lets "the oldest scar...flare open" and pulls "thread after thread of memory...to stitch a new passage." However, the mechanics remain abstract; no causal consequence follows from this action. The threshold dissolves immediately after, but the dissolution reads as inevitable rather than enabled by the scar-linking. Signaled and explained, but does not shape outcome or constrain attempts.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The "ashen charcoal sanctuary under starlight" is present in setup, middle, and ending. Charcoal dust is handled on the page ("her breath stir the ash at her feet"). Starlight "bent toward her, pooling in the hollow of her collarbone, anointing her." The sanctuary's breath "hitched" and its walls "sigh into memory" at closure. These details provide atmosphere and a lyric reprise, but do not pressure choices: the protagonist's path is unobstructed, and no environmental constraint alters her tactics. Sensory specificity without causal role.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.7</grade><comment>"After cutting off all contact" establishes the timeframe in the opening line, signaling prior estrangement. However, elapsed time since the cutoff is never specified, and no live clock pressures the present action. The protagonist waits "until the hour when starlight pooled thickest," but this is atmospheric rather than tactical. The timeframe frames backstory but does not tighten present decisions. Present in setup only; no middle or closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The motivation "to teach suffocating to breathe" is stated explicitly in the opening third and restated at closure ("You are allowed to gasp"). However, it is never dramatized through conflicted choice or visible cost. The protagonist does not face friction between her desire to teach and any competing want or fear. The sanctuary does not resist her lesson, and no price is paid on the page. The motivation is declared and reiterated but not tested.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Loaded emptiness" coheres through diction: silence, absence, dust, ash, unlit lanterns, the hush of breath. Tone is sustained across all beats and modulates subtly—reverent stillness in the opening, charged anticipation at the threshold, quiet release at closure. The final image ("she does not look back") charges prior silence with purposeful renunciation. Coherent and legible throughout, with a measured intensification that supports the ending's restraint without obscuring pressure.</comment>
