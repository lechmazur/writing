<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The bell tuner remains a static emblem rather than a character making choices under pressure. Her seventeen seasons of silence and her craft are declared, not dramatized through contradictory impulses or escalating decisions. The child encounter offers a single micro-choice (kneeling, placing hand), but no internal conflict or visible cost shapes that moment. Motivation is asserted ("preservation—not of objects, but of perception") without on-page friction between competing desires.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural, but no meaningful tightening or reweighting occurs; the tuner's routine continues unchanged until she "simply stopped climbing," an off-page exit that denies closure. The child encounter offers a potential turn, but no before/after stakes shift is legible—wonder is awakened in the child, yet the tuner's own options remain static. Orientation is delayed: "who" is named early, but "where" (bluff above clouds) and "when" (post-language world) accumulate slowly without clear anchors by ~120 words, though the effect does not critically obscure the ending. The absence of on-page cost at closure and the lack of a decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing with felt pressure disqualify high-band entry.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The bluff, sculpture, and iceberg fragment are vividly rendered with purposeful sensory detail (cobalt glow, prismatic shadows, glacial memory). The iceberg fragment constrains the child encounter (hand-on-ice moment) and charges the final image by persisting after the tuner's departure, qualifying as micro-setting that affects outcome. However, spatial choreography remains vague—no clear distances, tool placements, or movement paths are tracked across beats, and the "world below" is abstract backdrop rather than lived environment.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("preserve the color of wonder") is signaled early but never tested by meaningful opposition or escalating cost. The child encounter offers a potential pressure point, yet the tuner simply kneels and the child gasps—no choice narrows options or forecloses a path. The sculpture continues "without her" at the end, suggesting her agency was never necessary; coincidence (wind, weather) replaces protagonist-driven turns. No visible price is paid on the page; the tuner's cessation of climbing is summarized rather than dramatized, and no tactic is altered by prior loss.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Theme (wonder as color, preservation of perception, silence as precision) emerges through concrete images—iceberg fragment, kinetic sculpture, the child's tremor—rather than abstract statement. The final image of the sculpture persisting and the "echo" figure tuning silence offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior material without moralizing. However, thematic depth is limited by the protagonist's static arc; no earned wisdom arises from on-page struggle, and the child encounter reads more as illustration than interrogation of the central question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Voice is lyric and purposefully compressed, with patterned diction ("symphonies of truth," "harmonies of soul") taught early and held through closure. POV remains stable third-person limited, though psychic distance fluctuates without clear purpose—sometimes close ("She'd smile then—not with lips, but with shoulders"), sometimes distant ("tourists no longer came"). Register drifts into elevated abstraction ("meteorology of soul," "elusive hue between dawn's blush and twilight's sigh") that feels imposed rather than character-particular, especially during peak beats where the tuner's specific perceptual signature should dominate. The child's interior ("the first honest reaction they'd ever known") briefly violates focalization, and the final "echo" figure introduces ambiguity (ghost? memory? echo?) without clear cue.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Figurative language saturates nearly every sentence without pattern-payoff at closure, creating density drag: "vibration painted meaning too fragile for syllables," "emotional gravity aligned—a meteorology of soul," "color of wonder...that elusive hue between dawn's blush and twilight's sigh." Mixed metaphors ("wind-driven pendulums" + "glacial memory" + "ballad of vanishing cold") pile without coherent vehicle. Paraphrase loops appear: "She believed wonder had a color, and that color could be sung into being" closely restates the earlier "preserve the color of wonder...each note tuned to preserve." Template cadence runs: "She moved...her fingers brushing...to coax," "She'd pause...place her palm...and wait," "She'd smile then...with shoulders, with spine, with the tilt." Information density is low; many sentences perform one job (description) without advancing character or conflict. Rhythm remains uniform despite tonal shifts, and the closure beat ("simply stopped climbing") is summary rather than image-driven propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Premise (mute artist preserving wonder via kinetic sculpture in post-language world) offers fresh synthesis of familiar elements. The iceberg fragment as instrument and the "seasonally mute" trait add specificity that distinguishes the piece from generic artist-in-isolation tales. However, emotional arc and conflict beats could transpose to any hermit-craftsperson story with minor edits; the tuner's silence and the sculpture's mechanics do not generate irreplaceable turns. The child encounter and the tuner's unexplained departure echo recognizable mentor-awakening and solitary-sage templates without transformation through non-obvious moral calculus or lived cost.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Bell tuner is present throughout and frames the piece, but her choices do not create key turns. She adjusts counterweights during storms and kneels to place the child's hand—micro-actions without visible cost or tactical alteration. The decision to stop climbing is summarized off-page, denying closure participation. Two beats (storm adjustment, child encounter) give functional presence, but observation dominates over decision-making that narrows options.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Iceberg fragment is seeded early ("suspended shards of glacial memory"), used in at least three beats (morning vigil palm-touch, storm glow, child hand-on-ice), and persists in the closure image ("still glistening on cue"). Its glow mechanic (reacts to harmonic frequencies) constrains the tuner's work and charges the child encounter with visible response (fierce refraction, child's tremor). However, the fragment's role is largely atmospheric; removing it would not break the story's logic if replaced with another reactive material. Cost is not directly tied to it—no trade-off or sacrifice is dramatized through its presence.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Symphonies of truth" is named twice but remains thematic gloss rather than a stake or tactic. The tuner composes them, yet no on-page beat shows how "truth" content is chosen, tested, or costs her. The phrase could be swapped with "harmonies of memory" or "melodies of wonder" without altering any choice or outcome. Ornamental mention trends low.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Seasonally mute" is introduced early and tied to the tuner's cycle (winter mutes utterly, spring loosens throat, etc.), but the trait does not constrain or enable a key on-page action with visible cost. No beat shows her choosing silence over speech when speech might solve a problem, nor does her muteness alter tactics during the child encounter or closure. The label enriches character texture but remains functionally inert—mentioned, not leveraged.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Glisten" recurs across multiple beats (iceberg fragment glistens in response to palm touch, glistens fiercely when child touches it, still glistening after tuner's departure) and charges the closure image by persisting as the sculpture's ongoing signal. However, the action itself is passive—the fragment glistens in reaction, not through protagonist agency—and no major turn traces causally to this specific verb. The effect is atmospheric accumulation rather than decisive moment; swapping "glisten" for "pulse" or "shimmer" would not break story logic.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Through kinetic sculpture" is seeded early (sculpture described in detail by paragraph five), its mechanics matter (wind-driven pendulums, chimes calibrated to atmospheric conditions), and it persists at closure ("continued without her, wind and weather its new conductors"). The sculpture enables the tuner's work and shapes the child encounter (hand on ice is part of the sculpture's heart). However, the sculpture could be replaced with another ambient installation (bell array, resonant chamber) without fundamental plot breaks; its kinetic specificity adds texture but does not force irreplaceable tactics or turns.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Bluff is present throughout (spiraling stone path, cliffside braille, storms rolling beneath clouds) and provides spatial anchor. However, the setting does not pressure choices or supply resources that alter outcome—the tuner could perform the same actions in any isolated high place. No tactic depends on the bluff's specific features (fissures, wind, altitude); it functions as postcard backdrop rather than micro-environment that constrains agency. Introduced early but remains ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"After words become unnecessary" is stated as backdrop ("world below had traded language for efficiency") but does not tighten decisions or tactics on the page. No beat shows the tuner navigating a world where speech is obsolete, nor does the timeframe impose a clock or deadline. The child's arrival suggests some remnant of the pre-language world, but this thread is not developed causally. Time remains vague and untracked; the tuner's seventeen seasons and seasonal muteness hint at cycles, but no live pressure derives from when in the post-language era the story occurs.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Preserve the color of wonder" is named early and frames the tuner's routine (tuning bells, adjusting sculpture, child encounter). The child encounter dramatizes the motivation—placing the child's hand on ice to awaken wonder—giving it one on-page beat with visible effect (child's tremor). However, no friction between this desire and a competing want or cost is shown; the tuner never faces a choice where preserving wonder forces her to sacrifice another value. Motivation is told and illustrated but not conflicted under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Muted vigor" coheres through the piece: controlled action ("moved with muted vigor"), purposeful silence, micro-choices without speech, and the quiet persistence of the sculpture after departure. Tone modulates subtly—calmer in morning ritual, intensified during storms ("letting thunder harmonize with chime"), tender in the child encounter. The final image of the echo figure "tuning a silence only wonder could fill" charges the tone with purposeful ambiguity, sustaining the muted-yet-active quality to the end. However, the single static mood (contemplative restraint) dominates without sharp contrast or destabilization under peak pressure.</comment>
