<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elira demonstrates clear motivation through concrete actions (redirecting steam, installing kinetic tiles) and her work methodology is consistently embodied. However, interiority remains largely functional rather than contradictory—she moves through technical problems without evident internal conflict or cost to her person. The ending choice to "recalibrate" for the next quadrant lacks the foreclosed-path pressure required for higher bands; her arc is accretive rather than transformative, and no visible renunciation or endurance appears on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes orientation by ~120 words (Elira enters the terminal with clear intent) and maintains a coherent Accumulative/Textural lens throughout: density builds through steam redirection, light manipulation, and visitor arrival, culminating in the equation "H = Σ(ΔI • R)" as a Conceptual Repricing moment. The cost, however, is oblique—the terminal "still cracked" and "still sloped" offers a visible constraint, but Elira herself pays no legible personal price at closure. The equation feels asserted rather than dramatized as a trade-off, weakening the closure's felt impact.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The abandoned terminal is vividly rendered through specific decay (peeling hazard stripes, fractured skylight, deflated balloons) and its infrastructure directly constrains Elira's choices: the ruptured geothermal line becomes the steam source, security kiosk housings supply conduit material. The sextant mounted atop the rotunda's spire charges the final image by projecting golden triangles, and the kinetic tiles convert visitor footsteps into power. Spatial choreography remains clear across all moves (Sub-Level 3 descent, central rotunda work, cargo annex threshold) and the setting actively participates in closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—resurrecting the terminal through redirected flows—is signaled early and pursued consistently. Pressure accumulates through problem-solving beats (steam redirection, light projection, kinetic tile installation), but escalation remains lateral rather than tightening: each task succeeds without forcing trade-offs or narrowing options. The ending "recalibrate for the next quadrant" implies continuation rather than a decisive turn, and no on-page reversal forces Elira to choose between competing goods or accept a visible loss.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges clearly from concrete particulars: the equation "H = Σ(ΔI • R)" synthesizes the story's exploration of hope through redirection, and the contrast between carnival's departure and "something quieter, sturdier" resonates without overt moralizing. However, the final paragraph edges toward thesis statement ("Hope wasn't a destination; it was a flow") where image alone would suffice. The sextant's shift from celestial to structural readings offers a purposeful transformation, and the story avoids false equivalence by committing fully to its premise of adaptive resurrection.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited throughout with consistent psychic distance; Elira's perceptual signature (seeing "stress fractures like poetry," treating "every rusted bolt…as a variable") is character-specific and maintained under pressure. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register that strains credibility for an intern's interiority ("stoic wonder," "intentions…whispered in graffiti"), and some figurative constructions feel imposed rather than voice-organic. No dialogue appears, so those bullets are moot. The prose modulates appropriately between technical problem-solving and reflective passages.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The prose demonstrates high information density and varied sentence rhythm in technical beats ("cannibalized conduit housings…welded them with scavenged plasma torches"), but template cadence appears in mid-story description: "She installed…She wrote…She packed" runs create mechanical rhythm. Several paraphrase loops appear ("not through brute force or sentimentality, but through redirected flows" / "Hope wasn't a destination; it was a flow—redirected, repurposed, resilient") that restate concepts without added pressure. The metaphor "maze of intentions" is invoked repeatedly but never physically constrains a choice, weakening its concreteness. Clarity remains high and no artifacts touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The premise—civil engineer using improvised tools to resurrect an abandoned spaceport through thermodynamic and kinetic redirection—offers a fresh synthesis of hard-skill problem-solving and emotional reclamation. The sextant's repurposing from celestial to structural measurement is specific and non-obvious. However, the "quirky found-object resurrection" template is recognizable, and the story follows predictable beats: discover problem, redirect resource, attract community. The equation "H = Σ(ΔI • R)" risks abstraction but is earned through prior particulars. Risk-taking in scope (many small systems rather than one climactic fix) heightens the accumulative effect.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elira's choices drive all major beats: descending to investigate thermal anomaly, deciding to redirect rather than seal the geothermal line, cannibalizing materials, installing kinetic tiles, and finally choosing to recalibrate the sextant for the cargo annex. Each decision alters the terminal's state and shapes the ending's charge. Setup is immediate (paragraph 2), development spans multiple middle beats with visible problem-solving, and closure hinges on her choice to continue rather than declare completion. The "functionally creative" trait enables every action with specific cost (scavenging, welding labor, measurement time).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The sextant appears in setup (paragraph 4, "salvaged from a collapsed observatory dome"), is mounted and used at the central rotunda to measure structural light-bending (paragraph 8), reappears mounted atop the spire projecting golden triangles (paragraph 14), and is mentioned in the final paragraph as Elira prepares to recalibrate it. The object enables her methodology (measuring "angles no one else saw") and charges the ending image with its light projection. However, its specific brass-and-tarnished physicality matters less than its function—a similar optical tool could substitute with minor edits, capping the irreplaceability score.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Maze of intentions" is introduced early (paragraph 5: "intentions…carved in steel by long-departed planners, others whispered in graffiti") and recurs thematically (paragraph 17: "The maze of intentions grew richer"). The concept shapes Elira's interpretive stance—reading multiple design layers—but does not create a navigational puzzle or decision fork on the page. It functions more as thematic frame than as a constraint that narrows tactical options. The ending alludes to it ("redirected intentions multiplied by resilience") but the maze itself does not physically complicate her moves or force a choice between competing paths.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Functionally creative" is introduced early (paragraph 6) and demonstrated throughout: she cannibalizes materials, threads steam through repurposed ducts, installs kinetic tiles, and measures phenomena others ignore. The trait enables every technical solution with visible labor cost (welding, threading, measuring). However, the attribute is never tested by a constraint—no moment where her creativity fails or where a more conventional approach would succeed faster. The trait is consistently present but lacks an on-page tradeoff that reveals its limits or forces a sacrifice.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Resurrect" is the story's central action, signaled in paragraph 3 ("she came to resurrect what others called ruin") and pursued through all major beats: steam redirection restores warmth, sextant light creates art, kinetic tiles generate power, and visitors return. The ending crystallizes partial success—"didn't magically heal" but "it pulsed"—making resurrection incomplete yet undeniable. Remove this exact action and the story becomes mere observation or documentation. The action shapes escalation (each system adds life) and charges closure (the terminal "learning how to breathe again").</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Redirected flows" is signaled early (paragraph 3: "through redirected flows: rerouting power conduits, repurposing structural skeletons") and mechanically demonstrated in the key beat: she redirects ruptured geothermal steam through repurposed ducts (paragraphs 12-13), then redirects visitor foot traffic into micro-charges via kinetic tiles (paragraph 18). The method is not merely metaphorical—its thermodynamic and kinetic specifics constrain her toolkit and shape the ending's equation "H = Σ(ΔI • R)." The story would structurally fail if she instead demolished and rebuilt or imposed external systems.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The terminal is present from the opening line and supplies all resources: peeling hazard stripes mark the descent, the ruptured geothermal line provides steam, the security kiosk yields conduit housings, the rotunda's skeletal spire mounts the sextant, the departure gates house kinetic tiles, and the cargo annex awaits in the final line. Each space constrains Elira's tactics (she must descend to Sub-Level 3, must use scavenged materials, must work within the existing skeleton) and the terminal's fractured state charges the closure image. The "abandoned spaceport passenger terminal" is irreplaceable—no other ruin type offers this exact infrastructure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"After the carnival left town" appears in the opening line, establishing post-event abandonment, but time never tightens decisions. The story unfolds across an unspecified duration ("by dusk," "one evening") with no clock pressure or deadline. Elira's work could span days or weeks without changing the narrative. The timeframe sets atmosphere (post-carnival emptiness) but does not narrow tactical windows or force choices, remaining ornamental to escalation.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The motivation "to puzzle out new equations for hope" is explicit (paragraph 7: "The equations she'd been puzzling out—new equations for hope") and demonstrated through Elira's measurement rituals and her final equation "H = Σ(ΔI • R)." The desire drives her choices to redirect rather than demolish, to measure rather than merely repair. However, the motivation is told more than tested—no moment dramatizes conflicting wants (e.g., efficiency vs. meaning, speed vs. thoroughness) that would reveal the cost of prioritizing hope over pragmatism. The motivation is present and consistent but lacks friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Stoic wonder" is established early (paragraph 6: "Elira moved with stoic wonder") and maintained through the dual register of technical precision and reflective observation. The tone coheres across pressure points: she calmly investigates the thermal flicker, efficiently redirects steam, yet pauses to note prismatic light and listen to visitor murmurs. The ending modulates appropriately—stoic in acknowledging unhealed cracks, wonder in the terminal's renewed pulse. The tone charges the final image ("learning how to breathe again") by balancing pragmatic assessment with quiet awe, avoiding sentiment or cynicism.</comment>
