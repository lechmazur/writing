<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's interior is densely rendered through sensory particulars (tapping rhythms, tweezers peeling pages) and her motivation—discovering why paths vanish—drives each micro-choice. However, the mentor remains a cardboard convenience who vanishes after providing the crucial atlas page, and the rapid pivot from grief to teaching mode in the final third lacks embodied friction or visible cost. The tapping practice reads as character-particular, but the final "metamorphoses" insight lands as a stated epiphany rather than emerging through contradictory impulses under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: fragments—coral skeletons, tidal logs, testimonies, journal, code—accrue density until the submersible descent crystallizes the reefs-as-dormant revelation. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the paths "submerged" rather than vanished) that reweights the opening stake with conceptual cost visible in Elara's shift from searching to revealing. Orientation anchors quickly (station, Elara, post-ban setting by paragraph two), and the 17-second delay discovery creates a meaningful tightening. One substantive weakness: the descent and the final teaching montage compress abruptly, summarizing rather than dramatizing the ultimate encounter and its immediate aftermath.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The station on stilts, drowned mangroves, and waterlogged generator housing are specific and purposeful; the submersible descent through "silt and gloom" to bioluminescent coral directly charges the closure image. Sensory detail is filtered through Elara's professional lens (spectral graphs, dissolved oxygen) and the setting constrains action (wading through brine, using tweezers). Spatial choreography remains clear across beats, and the micro-setting of the console and viewport recurs with functional pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—why some paths disappear—is signaled early and tightens once when Elara discovers ECHO's hidden sonar logs, narrowing options and reweighting her method (listening with hands rather than eyes). The tapping practice and CALYPSO's 17-second lag create coherent pressure under the Accumulative lens. Agency is present: Elara assembles fragments, digs through code, descends in the submersible. The resolution (teaching others to tap) is earned by the prior causality, though the shift from solitary discovery to communal teaching is summarized rather than dramatized, weakening the felt cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the tapping practice, the atlas page, and the submerged reefs: "Some losses aren't endings. They're metamorphoses." The final image of children giggling when coral answers offers a resonant, non-literal answer rooted in prior particulars (the 17-second rhythm, the mentor's torn page, the bioluminescent pulse). The piece resists easy morals and integrates the fossil fuel ban into world texture rather than sermonizing. One slip: "She stopped searching for vanished paths. She started revealing…" borders on thematic echo, but the surrounding imagery (tactile cartography, glowing gardens) mitigates the intrusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with a distinct perceptual signature: Elara notices in professional idiom (millimeters of rise, spectral graphs) and tactile particulars (salt and mildew, nerve-ending frayed edges). Free indirect style is clean, and narrative certainty matches Elara's knowledge. CALYPSO's response is filtered through her interpretation. However, the final third compresses into summarized teaching montages ("Fishermen returned with stories…") that flatten voice specificity, and the phrase "drifting moored tone of her existence" intrudes as overly poetic meta-commentary outside her lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, information density is high (coral skeletons + tidal logs + coordinates in one beat), and concrete nouns anchor each move. The opening ("creaked with each tide, its metal bones groaning") and the tapping refrain ("tap-tap-tap… pause… tap-tap… tap") create textural propulsion. Two substantive issues lower the score: synonym loops around "paths" ("vanished," "disappeared," "submerged") across adjacent paragraphs, and the final teaching montage relies on summary rather than scene, dulling momentum. The phrase "periodically eternal" is poetic but borders on purple without clear denotation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of tapping rhythms as sonar resonance with submerged coral colonies is specific and non-obvious, transforming the ecological premise through tactile cartography. The atlas page torn by the mentor and the ECHO subroutine are purposeful rather than stock. The piece commits fully to its premise—listening with hands, not eyes—without retreat. One limiter: the post-ban setting and coral bleaching witness are familiar climate-fiction territory, and the final teaching montage risks generic uplift unless read as a credible shift in communal practice.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elara's identity as coral bleaching witness shapes her motivation and frames the opening ("once a coral bleaching witness on the Great Barrier"), but her key choices—digging through code, descending in the submersible—stem from the tapping practice and the atlas page rather than from witnessing bleaching directly. The trait colors her lens (comparing frayed edges to nerve endings, interpreting bioluminescent pulses) and participates in closure (teaching others to listen), yet the bleaching itself is backstory scaffolding rather than an on-page constraint.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The atlas page is introduced early (paragraph seven), handled in at least three distinct beats (pinned above bunk, cross-referenced with journal coordinates, pinned into new handmade atlas at closure), and its annotations in "frantic red ink" constrain Elara's search. The coordinates matching ECHO's sonar logs create causal pressure, and the final reprise—pinning it into a new atlas that includes "depth, rhythm, and patience"—reweights its meaning with visible cost (the shift from solitary artifact to shared archive). The page is causally indispensable; without it, the closure fails.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Delayed revelation structures the entire arc: CALYPSO's 17-second lag is the inciting mystery, the ECHO subroutine is buried, and the reefs' dormant state is concealed until the submersible descent. The concept shapes tactics (Elara tests surfaces, digs through code, taps the submersible hull) and charges the closure (the paths "waited" rather than vanished). The 17-second interval—linking taps to coral metabolic pulses—is causally specific and irreplaceable. The concept is not merely thematic; it redefines options on the page.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Periodically eternal" is applied to the coral colonies ("alive in cycles too slow for human clocks, visible only when tides and tech aligned") and colors the thematic insight that paths "submerged" and "waited." It shapes Elara's final understanding and charges the closure image. However, the phrase itself is poetic abstraction rather than a dramatized constraint; the coral's cyclic dormancy is described rather than shown altering an on-page choice. The trait participates in closure but does not constrain tactics mid-scene, keeping it in the functional-but-replaceable band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Assemble" is signaled early ("She'd assemble fragments—not data, but impressions"), drives the middle beats (journal + atlas + code + rhythm), and culminates in the descent where Elara assembles the final pieces before submerging. The action is causally central: without assembling the fragments, she cannot cross-reference coordinates or interpret the 17-second pulse. The final paragraph ("She began teaching others to tap") extends the assembly into communal practice. The verb is irreplaceable; "collect" or "gather" would miss the tactile, constructive specificity.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Tapping rhythms on surfaces is introduced in paragraph two ("a practice she'd begun after the fossil fuel ban"), recurs in at least six beats (steel tables, coffee mug, desk, railing, glass, thigh, submersible hull), and is the causal mechanism for discovering CALYPSO's 17-second lag and resonating with the coral. The practice shapes tactics (testing surfaces, decoding ECHO, tapping the hull) and charges the closure (teaching children to count seconds, coral answering). Without tapping, the entire revelation collapses. The specificity—three taps for loss, two for hope, one for the unknown—makes it irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The sea level monitoring station is established in the opening line, recurs across beats (tidal logs, CALYPSO console, brine flooding lower sensors, generator housing, submersible launch), and its stilts above drowned mangroves constrain Elara's access and choices. The station's clinical precision contrasts with the tactile revelation, and the final image of it becoming "a temple of tactile cartography" charges the closure. The setting supplies resources (CALYPSO, submersible) and pressures choices (storm surge retrieval), but its role is functional rather than indispensable; a different isolated research platform could serve with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"After the fossil fuel ban" is mentioned twice (paragraph two: "after the fossil fuel ban, when silence became louder than sirens"; near the end: "The fossil fuel ban hadn't saved the reefs"). The timeframe colors the world (silence, drowned mangroves) and motivates the tapping practice, but it does not tighten decisions or alter tactics on the page. The ban is backstory texture rather than a live constraint. The piece would function with "after sea level rise" or "post-climate shift" with no structural loss, placing the element in the functional-but-replaceable band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The motivation to discover why paths disappear is stated early ("That mystery had become her motivation") and dramatized through Elara's micro-choices: assembling fragments, testing surfaces, digging through ECHO, descending in the submersible. Friction appears when the reefs' answer—they "submerged" and "waited"—forces her to shift from searching to revealing, a visible cost (abandoning the solitary quest). The desire drives at least three beats and shapes the closure. One limiter: the motivation is told more than shown in internal conflict; Elara's drive reads as steady rather than contradictory.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Drifting moored" appears explicitly once ("In the drifting moored tone of her existence—anchored yet adrift, grieving yet growing") and is embodied in the station on stilts, the torn atlas page, and Elara's practice of tapping rhythms (ritualized repetition amid loss). The tone modulates from clinical precision to tactile discovery to communal teaching, coherent through turns. However, the phrase itself intrudes as meta-commentary outside Elara's lexicon, and the final teaching montage risks sentimental uplift that tensions the earlier grief. The tone charges the final image but does not fully integrate across all beats without friction.</comment>
