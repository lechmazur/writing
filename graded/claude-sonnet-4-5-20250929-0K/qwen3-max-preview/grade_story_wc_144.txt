<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent—she repairs to decode failure into direction—but her competence lacks meaningful struggle. The drone repair proceeds without genuine setbacks or choices that foreclose paths; she whispers reassurances and performs her ritual without visible cost or internal friction. The botanist remains passive scenery. Blindness functions as a stated trait rather than a constraint that forces trade-offs in this specific repair.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors arrive cleanly. The piece accumulates sensory texture and the anchor-lifting frame, but no meaningful tightening occurs—the drone is broken, then fixed through uncontested steps. Closure offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (the drone's flight reweights Elara's purpose), yet the cost remains abstract; no on-page forfeiture or trade-off is legible in the final image. The transition to the music box gesture nods at continuation but does not deepen prior pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The mist-coated depot, copper basin, and prism are vivid and filtered through Elara's tactile perception. Spatial choreography is clear. The basin and prism enable the repair method, meeting the constraint test. Sensory hierarchy reflects her blindness—touch, vibration, pressure—anchoring POV filter effectively. Minor density: some phrases ("iron bones slick with dew") trend decorative without altering tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—operational drone before tide turns—is signaled early. However, escalation is absent; Elara's repair steps proceed without friction, failed attempts, or narrowing options. The botanist's research and voyage stakes remain declared but never tested on the page. No reversal or tightening forces a trade-off. The anchor-lifting frame creates atmospheric urgency but does not alter Elara's tactics or cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Theme—mending trajectories, translating failure into flight—emerges through image and action rather than statement. The hummingbird's restoration and Elara's ritual carry subtext. Yet the final paragraph's direct thematic summary ("She mended trajectories. She turned fractures into flight paths.") shifts from resonance to assertion, lowering impact. The music box transition offers thematic continuity but does not reweight prior material with new cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, filtering sensory detail through Elara's blindness. Diction is controlled and distinct. However, elevated register ("magnetic calm, the kind that pulls chaos into orbit") and poetic constructions ("salt in seawater," "mechanical grace") trend ornamental rather than voice-specific under pressure. The botanist's "gasp" and interior surprise ("not at the drone's flight, but at the orchids") breach focalization briefly.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is high in technical beats. Clarity is strong. However, figurative language saturates nearly every paragraph without pattern-teaching or payoff—"iron bones," "tide of vibration," "alchemy of repair," "kiss with mechanical grace"—creating decorative drift (−0.5). Paraphrase loop: "She didn't rush. / Calm was her compass. Magnetic calm..." restates without added pressure (−0.2). Template cadence in the final third: "She mended trajectories. She turned fractures..." (−0.4). Cumulative artifact debt across high-pressure beats: −1.1 total.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Blind artisan repairing via tactile methods and light-refraction offers a fresh synthesis. The hummingbird pollination stake is specific. Yet the premise—gifted repair specialist fixes delicate object under time pressure—is a common template. Elara's competence lacks friction; no failed attempt or misstep personalizes the arc. The "whispered reassurances" and breath-blessing ritual trend toward stock mysticism. Transformation test: swap names and setting, the emotional arc remains generic.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her repair completes the stake. However, her choices do not create turns—she performs her method without setbacks. Observation and ritual dominate; no decision alters tactics or forecloses a path. Setup and payoff present; development lacks causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The drone is cradled, diagnosed via fractured wing, sensors lowered into basin, wing patched, blessed, and released—present across setup, middle repair beats, and closure flight. It drives the dominant stake. Swappability: another delicate device (watch, music box) could substitute with minor edits, reducing irreplaceability. Cost link weak—repair succeeds without sacrifice tied to the drone itself.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The repair shop frames Elara's role and houses the workbench, basin, tools. It shapes the setting but does not constrain choices—the repair could occur elsewhere. Present in setup and middle; participates in closure only as location. Thematic echo ("mended trajectories") is asserted, not enacted through shop-specific pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Blindness is stated and filters sensory detail (touch, vibration, "unseeing eyes"). However, it does not constrain the repair—Elara's method relies on tactile and auditory cues she already possesses. No visible trade-off or cost tied to blindness on the page; it functions as character label rather than active friction.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Patching the wing with "resin spun from silk moths and lunar resin" is the physical repair act that restores the drone, directly enabling the closure flight. Present in middle and closure. Specificity ("seventeen winters" formula) adds texture. However, the patch succeeds without complication; one beat of involvement limits causal spread.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Water basin, glycerin droplets, prism, and refracted light are signaled early and used mid-scene to recalibrate the drone's sensors. Mechanics are shown: "fractured sunbeams struck the prism, scattering rainbows...she listened...as the drone's internal gyros...recalibrated." Method shapes one key beat (sensor alignment). Closure does not revisit the method; it enables rather than charges the final image.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The depot is vivid (mist, rails, canopy, Track Seven, lanterns) and the anchor-lifting frame provides temporal urgency. However, setting does not alter Elara's choices or tactics—repair occurs at her workbench regardless of location. Postcard detail dominates; no resource or spatial constraint pressures the repair. Present in setup and closure atmosphere only.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The anchor-lifting frame is signaled early ("anchor lifting for a ship's maiden voyage"), recurs mid-story ("anchor's groan grew louder"), and closes with the horn and "anchor fully raised." Time tightens the botanist's need but does not alter Elara's repair tactics on the page—she works at her own pace ("She didn't rush"). Clock present but not causally active.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The motivation—"decode feedback into direction, translate failure's murmur into a path forward"—is stated early and echoed thematically at closure. However, it remains told rather than dramatized through conflicted choices. No friction between this desire and competing costs appears. Setup and closure participation present; middle development lacks enacted conflict.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Magnetic calm is stated ("Calm was her compass. Magnetic calm...") and shown through Elara's unhurried ritual, steady narration, and the piece's meditative pacing. Tone remains coherent through repair beats and modulates slightly at closure with the drone's flight and ship's horn. However, the assertion "Magnetic calm, the kind that pulls chaos into orbit" trends decorative. Tone charges the final image through accumulation rather than shift.</comment>
