<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Silas's motivation to restore sound is clear and his listening-as-craft is specific, but his interior contradictions remain abstract. The final tears are labeled ("not from sorrow, but from recognition") rather than dramatized through conflicted micro-choices. The hedgehog functions as ornament rather than applying pressure. Embodied emotion is present in "fingers plucking invisible strings" but the peak moment relies on explanation rather than showing contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: silence → discovery → carving → resonance restoration. Closure lands on the page as Resonant Reconfiguration (the grove "held its breath differently now—alive, expectant"), with felt cost in Silas's years of isolation and the grove's months of silence. Orientation anchors early (hedgehog, dawn, Silas, grove). One meaningful deepening occurs when the insulator's stress cracks become conduits. However, the cost at closure is more conceptual than viscerally felt; the final image asserts transformation rather than showing a foreclosed path or visible price paid in the ending beat itself.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The alder grove is anchored early and returns throughout; the porcelain insulator's stress cracks constrain Silas's carving method and charge the final resonance. Sensory detail is vivid ("roots spiraled like frozen smoke," "bark shimmering silver") and filtered through Silas's sculptural attention. The insulator as micro-setting qualifies: its fractures shape the sculpture's design and enable the closure beat. Minor slip: the hedgehog's spatial position drifts without clear anchoring across beats.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore music to silence—is signaled early and tightens when Silas finds the insulator, then deepens when he carves the resonance chamber. The final act is driven by his decision to embed the porcelain and align its cracks with grain-lines. However, the escalation is primarily conceptual; no live option is foreclosed on the page, and the price (months of silence, his isolation) is told rather than shown as a trade-off in the closure beat. The hedgehog and grove awaken, but no visible cost lands in the final image itself.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme—transformation of fracture into connection—emerges from the insulator's stress cracks and Silas's carving without overt statement. The closing line "held its breath differently" offers a resonant answer to silence. However, the penultimate paragraph edges toward thematic summary ("silence was never empty; it was potential") and the "empathy in motion" paragraph is near-thesis. The final image reweights prior material but the thematic voice occasionally intrudes rather than letting particulars carry the weight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Silas; perceptual signature is consistent (grain-lines, sap-rush, wind-hush). Vocabulary is elevated and voice-motivated ("symphonically minded soul," "runes... a language of tension"). No head-hopping. Minor slips: "empathy in motion—that was the true sculpture" reads as authorial intrusion rather than Silas's thought, and "By dawn, he had transcribed" compresses a night's work without interior texture. Diction under pressure (the carving beat) remains controlled.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>High figurative density throughout without pattern-teaching: "roots cradled earth like cupped palms," "frozen smoke," "golden thread," "moth's wing against glass" in most beats. Multiple paraphrase loops: "silence swallowed" echoed in "hollow... resonance vacuumed"; "strummed the air" repeated across beats without added pressure. Template cadence in the carving sequence: "He hollowed... He embedded... When the last shaving fell." These artifacts dull momentum in non-closure beats. Clarity remains intact but density without propulsion triggers −0.8 cumulative in Q7, and the concentration in the final third disallows 9+ globally and caps high-band entries at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The premise—sculptor restores music through porcelain stress-crack analysis—is specific and fresh. The transformation test passes: removing Silas's listening method and the insulator's fractures would collapse the arc. However, the emotional template (isolated artist restores beauty through found object) is familiar, and the resolution (nature awakens, tears of recognition) follows a predictable arc. The insulator's repurposing is the strongest original move; the rest executes competently without bold risk.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Present early; chooses the alder, carves the chamber, embeds the insulator. These decisions drive the middle and closure beats. Cost is conceptual (years of silence) rather than a visible trade-off in the final image.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Introduced second paragraph as setup; analyzed mid-story (stress cracks as score); embedded and activated at closure. Its fractures enable the resonance and charge the ending. Three distinct beats with causal pressure and closure linkage. High irreplaceability: no generic object would carry stress-crack mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Stated explicitly in one paragraph ("Empathy in motion—that was the true sculpture") but not dramatized as a constraint or tactic. It functions as thematic label rather than shaping on-page choices. The transfer of feeling occurs conceptually, not through conflicted micro-decisions.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mentioned early ("symphonically minded soul heard melodies") and frames his listening method. Enables the transcription of cracks into a score. However, it reads as background trait rather than imposing a visible cost or enabling a specific turn under pressure. Functional but closer to label than dramatized constraint.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Silas strums the air pre-discovery (setup), strums before the sculpture at closure (payoff). The final strum triggers the hum that awakens the grove, directly shaping the ending. However, the middle beat (analyzing cracks) does not involve strumming; it could be replaced with "touch" or "trace" without structural loss. Two gates met; causal role at closure earns mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Signaled when Silas finds the insulator and its "stress fractures—not flaws, but runes." He maps their geometry into a score, then carves cavities to match the fractured harmonics. The method enables the sculpture's design and the closure resonance. Three beats (discovery, mapping, embedding) with causal pressure. Irreplaceable: no other method would yield the same result.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Anchored early (hedgehog uncurls, alder grove breathes). Silas returns to it for the carving; it supplies the slender alder. The grove awakens at closure (leaves tremble, siskins trill, roots drum). Present in all three phases but primarily as stage rather than applying pressure or constraining choice. The alder's grain-lines enable resonance, which elevates it slightly above postcard setting.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Opens "at dawn" after the hedgehog uncurls; the carving occurs "by dawn" the next day; closure happens in rising light. The timeframe brackets the action but does not tighten decisions or create urgency. Silas works overnight without time pressure altering his tactics. Present in setup and closure but does not constrain.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Desire stated early ("for months, the world had been silent") and dramatized through strumming attempts and the discovery-to-carving sequence. The final resonance fulfills it. However, no friction between this want and a competing cost appears on the page; the grove simply awakens. Motivation shapes the arc but lacks conflicted choice at closure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Sustained throughout: "fragile moment," "pauses held too long," "not loud, not piercing, but deep, resonant," "softer than a moth's wing." Tone modulates under pressure (the hum rises, then fades) and charges the final image ("held its breath differently"). Coherent and purposeful, with clear cadence shift at closure.</comment>
