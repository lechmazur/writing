<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elira's motivation is clear and her stance crystallizes at the end through action (the broadcast), but her interior remains abstract—labels like "variant allegiance" and "fidelity to the broken" operate as thesis rather than embodied contradiction. The choice to broadcast feels telegraphed rather than wrestled with; no moment shows competing impulses acting simultaneously. Her renunciation of Kael reads as a posed contrast rather than a lived cost, and the final act carries declarative weight without visible trade-off or foreclosed path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation is established early (observatory, Elira, storm as veil), and the accumulative lens holds: the piece gathers fragmented signals toward a broadcast climax. However, the closure unit—her song triggering a carrier wave—lands as assertion rather than decisive reconfiguration; no on-page cost or reversal makes a before/after legible. The "whispers finding her" moment mid-story functions as validation, not a turn that narrows options. Cost is conceptual (she's risking exposure) but not felt in the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The stormlit observatory is vivid and the cobalt portico returns with reweighted meaning at closure, constraining her broadcast choice through its harmonic lattice. Spatial choreography is clear (glass, radio console, storm outside), and sensory detail is selective. The "above clouds" setting isolates her, reinforcing the lonely-visionary frame, and the portico's mechanics shape the final act—genuine micro-setting work.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—broadcasting a counter-signal to Kael's unity—is signaled early and tightens once (the younger voice confirms listeners exist). However, the escalation is additive rather than compressive; no decision forecloses a live option or trades one good for another. The storm "easing" and stars appearing dilutes pressure at the climax rather than raising cost. Agency is present (she chooses to sing) but the price remains abstract.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme (shadows as roots of resilience vs. sterile dawn) emerges from imagery and contrast with Kael, not thesis. The "unfold shadows into wings" refrain recurs purposefully, and the final broadcast image offers a resonant answer. Yet the piece edges toward sermon: "Dawn wasn't meant to be clean" reads as authorial annotation rather than discovered truth, and the closing paragraph summarizes the thematic stance instead of trusting the image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with a consistent elevated register ("cobalt veins," "oracle bones tossed by a drunken god"). The perceptual signature is distinct—Elira notices in metaphor and pattern—but diction remains uniform under pressure; the broadcast climax carries the same ornate cadence as expository beats, flattening urgency. Dialogue (the radio voices) advances plot but lacks subtext. No head-hopping, and the voice is singular, yet register never modulates with stakes.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Figurative density is high and often purposeful ("frozen wave," "origami wings"), but multiple beats stack metaphors without rest: "nest of dials," "oracle bones," "chrome sunrise" in quick succession muddle rather than clarify. Template cadence appears: "She didn't hate him. She pitied him. His dawn was sterile…" loops without added pressure. The paraphrase "not as noise, but as invitation" echoes the prior "not betrayal, but evolution" without differentiation. Loops and synonym churn ("whisper," "murmur," "echo") recur across the piece. Information density is moderate; many lines describe rather than advance.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The lonely-visionary-versus-charismatic-prophet frame is familiar, but the fragmented-radio-signals method and cobalt-portico broadcast device add specific texture. The "lyrically prophetic" constraint (messages as riddles) shapes her decoding work in a non-obvious way. However, the emotional arc—defiant outsider finds validation, broadcasts truth—follows a recognizable template, and the Kael contrast remains told rather than dramatized. The piece commits to its premise but does not transform the archetype.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Elira is present throughout and her final choice (to sing and trigger the broadcast) drives the ending. She decodes signals, scribbles notes, and steps to the portico—multiple beats involve her agency. However, much of her presence is observational or declarative (her contrast with Kael is asserted, not tested), and the broadcast decision feels inevitable rather than wrestled. Setup and closure participation are strong; middle development is thinner.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The cobalt glass portico appears in paragraph three, is touched and felt mid-story ("feeling the hum"), and returns at closure as the mechanism for her broadcast (its harmonic lattice spirals the signal outward). Three distinct beats, clear causal role at the ending, and the object's specific property (cobalt light as carrier wave) matters. It is not easily swappable, but the reweighting at closure is functional rather than deeply charged.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Variant allegiance" is labeled in paragraph four ("not betrayal, but evolution") and echoed in the closing paragraph ("spreading—not as treason, but as awakening"), but it remains thematic rather than a live stake that alters tactics. The concept is not tested on the page; no choice hinges on whether her following will be seen as betrayal or evolution. Present and coherent, but ornamental to the plot.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Lyrically prophetic" is introduced in paragraph seven and shapes her decoding method: messages are "invitations, riddles wrapped in rhythm." This constrains her work (she scribbles and pins fragments) and informs the broadcast's style. However, no on-page cost or trade-off is tied to this attribute; it enables her method but does not complicate it. Functional in one beat (decoding) and echoed at closure (her song), but mid-range integration.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Unfold" appears twice as a verb phrase: "unfold slowly in the listener's soul like origami wings" and "unfold shadows into wings" at closure. The action is metaphorical and frames her broadcast as gradual awakening, but no single beat turns on this verb—she could "spread," "reveal," or "release" with minor edits. The lyric reprise reweights the stake, earning mid-band credit, but the action itself is not causally indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Fragmented radio frequencies are signaled in paragraph two (the title "Whisperer of Broken Signals"), used in paragraph six (the console crackles, she decodes), recur in paragraph seven (decoding hymns and sermons over seven winters), and are present at closure (her broadcast piggybacks on Kael's towers). The method shapes her skill set and the final tactic, appearing in setup, middle, and payoff with specific mechanics that matter.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The stormlit observatory above clouds is anchored in paragraph one and recurs throughout: frost-glazed grates, thunder beneath, cobalt portico overhead, and the storm easing at closure. The isolation "above clouds" justifies her radio work and the climax (stars prick through as the broadcast launches). The setting pressures her choice by providing both the tool (portico) and the veil (storm) that she must pierce. Strong integration across all three gates.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Across the rise of a prophet named Kael" is introduced in paragraph nine and provides context (Kael is ascending, Elira is responding), but no on-page beat is time-pressured by his rise. "Tonight was different" declares urgency, yet the narrative does not track a ticking clock or a specific event in Kael's timeline that forces her hand. The timeframe contextualizes motive but does not constrain tactics. Present but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"To shape a new dawn using ancient shadows" is stated in paragraph five and echoed at closure ("woven by lonely visionaries who knew how to unfold shadows into wings"). Her motivation is clear and drives the broadcast choice, but the friction between "ancient shadows" and "new dawn" is declared rather than dramatized—no on-page moment shows her weighing the cost of using the past versus rejecting it. Setup and closure participation are strong; internal conflict is weak.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Tone mixes elevated lyricism ("cobalt veins," "origami wings") with rougher touches ("whiskey-rough," "gritty"), but the balance tilts heavily toward ornate metaphor; the "gritty" elements feel decorative rather than integrated. The laugh in paragraph seventeen ("gritty, whiskey-rough sound") is labeled, not embodied, and the tone does not modulate under pressure—the broadcast climax carries the same lyric density as expository beats. Whimsy is absent; the piece reads earnest throughout.</comment>
