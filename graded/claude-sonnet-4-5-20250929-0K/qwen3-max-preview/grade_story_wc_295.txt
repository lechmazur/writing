<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The chronicler's motivation is established through reflection rather than micro-choices under pressure. Interior texture leans toward abstraction ("transmute sorrow into syntax") that skirts therapy-speak without fully embodying struggle. The final choice to "share" the burden and sing arrives with minimal on-page contradiction or trade-off visible before the act. The guardian's presence in the dream adds a second character, but their interaction is brief and lacks the friction that would test commitment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration via the song and the final invitation to others, but the cost remains diffuse—emotional labor implied rather than a specific path foreclosed on the page. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly in the first paragraph. The middle deepens through the telegram and the dream encounter, but the turn hinges on off-stage song mechanics rather than a dramatized choice that narrows options. The final image of pressing a fresh daylily gestures toward continuation without a decisive before/after that makes a felt price legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The observatory, star charts, and parchment are handled concretely and return with purpose. The daylily-pressed telegram constrains the choice to enter the dream, and the astral temple ruins charge the climax. Spatial choreography (hunched over charts, opening envelope, kneeling in dust) tracks cleanly. Sensory detail is vivid but occasionally drifts into ornament ("velvet night," "liquid shadow") without altering tactics. The setting presses the protagonist toward lucidity and shapes the final ritual, meeting the 9+ gate for environment constraining choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—continuing the burden-transfer chain—is signaled early and coheres. Pressure tightens when the telegram arrives and deepens in the dream encounter, but the resolution (singing to redistribute the burden) introduces a new capability without prior constraint or visible cost. The guardian's gratitude affirms success rather than complicating it. No loss or omission alters later tactics; the chronicler's song works on the first attempt. One meaningful tightening occurs (the summons), but escalation relies on告assertion rather than a dramatized trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme—burdens shared through witness and language—emerges from the star-glyph system and the chronicler's journals. The daylily's ephemeral bloom paired with preservation motif ("truths captured quickly, tenderly") reweights the premise without stating a moral. Subtext operates in the guardian's line "You didn't just record the burden. You redistributed it," which pivots the story's question. Minor slips into thematic echo ("words that would drift upward, absorbed by stars, then redistributed as meteor showers of mercy") approach prompt-like language but stay within the character's reflective register. The ending invites rather than resolves, offering a non-literal answer to the central question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature (ink-stained fingers, star charts as living veins). Psychic distance tightens during the dream sequence without head-hopping. Diction occasionally inflates under pressure ("astral dust," "syllables that shimmered like dew on petals at midnight") but remains voice-motivated. The guardian's speech is brief; no sustained dialogue to test character distinction. Filter verbs appear sparingly. Free indirect style is clean. Minor register drift into elevated poetic phrasing at the climax ("liquid shadow," "midnight solace") reads as intentional cadence shift rather than artifact, though it risks overwriting.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout ("living veins," "cryptic morse," "liquid shadow"), with mixed metaphors in the opening (stars pulse like veins, blink morse, sigh). Template cadence appears in the final third: "She would not hoard… She would weave… They would learn… They would…" (four consecutive future-tense declarations). Paraphrase loop: "to witness pain without flinching, to transmute sorrow into syntax, to let language carry what shoulders could not" restates the same content across three clauses. Overwriting in peak beats (the song, the ending) layers metaphor without added pressure. Information density is moderate; several lines do double duty, but scaffold phrases ("not for astronomy, but for translation"; "not to speak, but to sing") pad transitions. No proofreading errors.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The premise—variable stars as burden-carriers decoded by a lucid dreamer—offers a fresh synthesis of astronomy and empathy work. The daylily telegram and star-glyph receipts are specific, non-obvious details. Execution leans on familiar dream-sequence mechanics (astral plane, wise guardian, healing song) without transforming them through constraint or cost. The chronicler's success arrives without friction; no attempt fails or forces revision. Emotional arc (witness → redistribute) fits the concept but plays predictably. Proximity check: "heals with words," "shared burdens," "midnight solace" echo prompt language without full dramatization. Risk-taking is moderate; the piece commits to its lyric register but does not escalate stakes through bold structural or perspectival choices.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Chronicler drives setup (tracing charts, receiving telegram), middle choice (entering the dream), and ending (singing, writing invitations). Present in all three gates. Two beats (telegram receipt, dream encounter) constrain or enable action. Closure linkage: the final paragraph shows her writing and pressing a daylily, continuing the chain. Causal pressure moderate; the song works without visible cost or trade-off. Swappability: another empathetic role (therapist, poet) could replace chronicler with minor edits. Late signal reduces setup credit; role is named but not tested early.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Daylily-pressed telegram appears in three beats: delivery, traced with trembling fingers, and reprise at closure ("no longer a summons, but a covenant"). Setup: second paragraph. Development: motivates the dream journey. Payoff: reweighted in the final third and a fresh daylily pressed in the journal. The ephemeral bloom / preserved message duality charges the closure image. Specificity high (scent, petals, symbolism). Cost connection weak; no visible trade-off tied to receiving or using it. Swappability moderate; another keepsake could serve, though daylily's single-day bloom is purposeful.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Shared burdens shapes the premise (star-to-dreamer transfer) and the ending (redistribute to others). Setup: implicit in "temple inscriptions carved by priesthood who believed stars spoke in burdens." Development: the chronicler realizes "Each flicker, a confession. Each fade, a burden passed." Payoff: the song redistributes the guardian's weight; the final invitations extend the chain. Causal pressure moderate; the concept frames stakes but does not narrow options mid-scene. Swappability: another abstract mission (decode, heal, witness) could replace it. Cost connection weak; no specific price paid for sharing.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Heals with words" present in reflection ("to transmute sorrow into syntax, to let language carry what shoulders could not") and the climactic song. Setup: first third. Development: implied in journal-writing. Payoff: the song lifts the guardian's burden. Label-only in setup; dramatized at climax but without constraint. The song succeeds on first attempt; no visible trade-off or cost. Swappability high; another empathetic skill could serve. No specific price or limitation tied to this trait.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Witnessing appears in reflection ("spent years learning to witness pain without flinching"), the dream encounter ("Then let me share it"), and the ending (others will "learn to listen. To witness"). Setup: first third. Development: enacted when she kneels and offers to share the guardian's burden. Payoff: invitations to future witnesses. Causal pressure moderate; witnessing enables the dream resolution but does not redefine earlier options. Swappability moderate; another empathetic action (listen, hold, absorb) could replace it with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Variable stars signal early ("stars blinked their cryptic morse"), constrain the middle (aligning Zeta Cygni's dimming with glyphs), and charge the ending ("stars above pulsed brighter as the weight dispersed"). Setup: opening paragraphs. Development: the chronicler decodes the star-glyph system, realizing each flicker records a burden. Payoff: stars respond to the song, and the final journal addresses them directly. Mechanics matter: variability coded to sorrow weight. Specificity high (Zeta Cygni, erratic pulse). Irreplaceability strong; the star system is integral to world logic and closure image.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Observatory frames the opening (star charts, dome's glass eye) and the ending (dawn's blush, journal-writing). Setup: first paragraph. Development: absent; the dream takes place elsewhere. Payoff: final scene returns to the observatory, now "a sanctuary." Spatial detail clear but does not alter tactics. The observatory provides star charts but does not constrain the dream journey or the song. Swappability moderate; another research space could serve. Micro-setting note: the body and the pressed telegram do more work than the building.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Timeframe signals in "Tonight, understanding dawned… with the third erratic pulse of Zeta Cygni." Setup: second paragraph. Development: weak; time does not tighten decisions. Payoff: "dawn's first blush" brackets the night, but elapsed time does not alter tactics. The "when understanding dawns" moment is declarative rather than earned through prior friction. No live clock. Time remains abstract ("millennia ago," "years learning," "tomorrow") without pressure. Swappability high; the realization could occur at any hour.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Motivation "to decode temple inscriptions" stated early and drives the middle (aligning glyphs with star patterns). Setup: first third. Development: the chronicler realizes inscriptions are receipts, not prayers, which reframes the task. Payoff: weak; the dream encounter supersedes decoding, and the ending shifts to writing invitations rather than translating glyphs. Friction minimal; no competing desire tested on the page. The motivation pivots without cost from decode to redistribute. Swappability moderate; another scholarly quest could serve.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Tone "midnight solace" coherent across the piece: hushed observatory, velvet night, soothing song, sanctuary ending. Modulates slightly (guardian's grief, chronicler's gasp) without breaking register. Setup: atmospheric from line one. Development: tone supports the dream's tender resolution. Payoff: final image ("midnight solace—a sanctuary") names the tone explicitly, which risks over-statement but charges the closure by fulfilling the tonal promise. Static mood in the mid-range; no sharp tonal shift under pressure. Swappability moderate; another contemplative tone could fit.</comment>
