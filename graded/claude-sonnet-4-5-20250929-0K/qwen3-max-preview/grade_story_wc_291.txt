<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elira's face blindness generates a distinct perceptual mode (texture over visuals), and her methodical archival work is concrete. However, the killer's reveal depends heavily on her recognizing his "texture" through tremor and salt-stiff collar—a leap that feels more asserted than earned, since we never see her build a database of his physical markers. The final choice to collaborate lacks visible internal conflict or cost; she steps forward and offers help without dramatized hesitation or trade-off. Interiority leans toward poetic assertion ("justice was a courtroom abstraction") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors arrive promptly (quarry, Elira, ribbon fragment, cold cases). The piece reads under an Accumulative/Textural lens: sensory density and the gallery of faceless portraits build toward the confrontation and collaborative unmasking. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (collaboration replaces accusation; empathy awakens in the town), and the cost is legible—no legal resolution, only communal mourning. One weakness: the killer's emergence from behind the crane feels coincidental rather than causally motivated by Elira's actions, blunting agency at the pivot.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The quarry is sensorially vivid (mist, limestone chill, collapsed crane, damp rock) and purposefully claustrophobic. Micro-setting details—pinning sketches to wet stone, lighting candles, the ribbon on the floor—charge the climactic confrontation. The sealed glass cases behind the foreman's office are a late spatial reveal but plausible within the location. Spatial choreography remains clear across all moves, and the environment constrains the emotional frame without becoming a postcard.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake (awakening empathy via solving the disappearances) is signaled early and sustained. The middle tightens as Elira descends into the quarry and stages the portrait gallery. However, the killer's voluntary appearance and immediate confession bypass a direct test of Elira's methodology; she waits and he arrives, removing the pressure of pursuit or confrontation. The cost at closure is social (no courtroom justice) but not personal to Elira—she gains the masks and town empathy without visible sacrifice or foreclosed path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme (memory, erasure, empathy through texture rather than face) emerges organically from Elira's condition and the faceless portraits. The final image—sketching the killer faceless—offers resonant symmetry. Yet the piece flirts with stating its thesis overtly: "people vanish twice: first from sight, then from memory" and "if no one remembers your face, you never existed at all." These lines approach thematic echo, asserting the concept rather than trusting the portraits and collaboration to convey it. The ending avoids moralizing but the scaffolding is visible.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>POV remains stable in close third on Elira; perceptual signature (texture, scent, pressure cues) is distinct and sustained. Diction occasionally inflates—"furrowed hush wrapping each word like burial cloth," "mist coiling around her ankles like guilt made visible"—but stays within a poetic narrative voice. Dialogue is spare and functional. The killer's speech ("I just… couldn't let them be forgotten by strangers. So I took their faces. Kept them where only I could mourn") carries subtext but edges toward explaining his entire psychology in two lines.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Prose is rhythmically controlled and imagistic, but overwriting clusters in key beats: "the quarry breathed in mist," "sky choked with cloud and silence," "mist coiling around her ankles like guilt made visible." Mixed metaphor: "furrowed hush wrapping each word like burial cloth"—a hush cannot furrow, and wrapping words in cloth is strained. Paraphrase loop: "Not bodies. / No blood. / No faces remembered. / Only absence" then "not violence, but erasure" restates the same content. Template cadence in the opening (sentence fragments stacked without variation) and in the mask-discovery paragraph ("Each bore…Each matched"). Figurative density in the final third dilutes immediacy. Apply −0.8 for overwriting and loops touching the closure zone.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The premise—face-blind detective solving cold cases through texture—offers a fresh synthesis of condition and method. The killer as obsessive mourner rather than murderer is a non-obvious turn. However, the central device (faceless portraits staged in the quarry to summon the guilty) is more symbolic convenience than grounded investigation; the killer's appearance feels authored rather than inevitable. The resolution (community empathy replaces legal closure) is thematically apt but predictable once the portraits go up. Derivative Premise adjustment −0.3 for the "unorthodox investigator with unique perception" template that remains largely unearned in tactical specifics.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elira's face blindness shapes her investigative method (texture archives, composite sketches, scent memories) and motivates the faceless portraits. She makes two on-page decisions: descending into the quarry and offering collaboration. The condition is present in setup, middle research, and closure (sketching the killer faceless). However, her choices at the peak (waiting, then extending her hand) are reactive rather than forcing a turn; the killer's voluntary confession does the causal work. The trait constrains perception but does not visibly narrow her options or extract cost in the final beat.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The ribbon fragment appears in setup (pocket, unearthed by construction crew, silver crescent-moon-and-thorn pattern), drives middle research (textile archives, seamstress logs), and is placed at center stage in the quarry as the lure. The killer avoids stepping on it, and its presence triggers his confession. Three beats, with causal pressure in the climax. Removing it would collapse the entire investigation's anchor. Swappability test: the specific pattern is never matched to a character or mask on the page, so it functions as a generic "evidence fragment" rather than irreplaceable detail. Cap at 7.4 for strong participation but modest specificity cost.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Cold cases frame the investigation and provide the list of three disappeared women. The concept is present in setup and named repeatedly, but it does not constrain Elira's tactics on the page—she proceeds with archival research and the gallery regardless of case status. Closure reveals the cases "wouldn't close in court," but this is asserted aftermath rather than a choice Elira must navigate during the climax. Functional but replaceable with "unsolved disappearances" or "mystery."</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elira's methodical nature is labeled ("methodical, relentless, her mind a lattice of data points") and shown in the archival cross-referencing montage. However, the attribute does not constrain her during the climactic quarry confrontation; she waits and responds empathetically rather than pursuing further methodical steps. No visible trade-off where being methodical forecloses an impulsive option or vice versa. Present in setup and middle summary; absent from closure pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Lance" appears once in a metaphorical sentence: "She lanced the mystery not with accusation, but by unifying opposites." The verb is summary rather than dramatized action. The actual on-page actions are staging portraits, lighting candles, waiting, then offering collaboration—none of which read as "lancing." The term is ornamental; swapping it for "solved" or "addressed" would not alter structure. No causal turn tied to this specific action.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Unifying opposites is explicitly stated in a summary paragraph: "beauty and brutality, celebration and silence, mask and void." The method is claimed rather than shown as a tactic. The portraits unify absence and presence, and the ending pairs mourning with revelation, but the mechanics are not signaled early or tested under resistance. Present in middle thematic narration and echoed at closure, but does not shape Elira's attempts or force a choice. One-gate participation (middle theme + closure echo) with little causal work.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The quarry is present throughout: setup (location of prior collapse and disappearances), middle (Elira's descent, mist, damp rock for pinning portraits), and closure (the killer emerges from behind the collapsed crane, masks are unearthed from the foreman's office). The environment supplies the stage and the hiding place for the masks, altering the outcome. Removing the quarry would require a different container for the discovery. Spatial details (stone floor, rusted nails, candles) charge the confrontation. Strong participation across all three gates, with causal contribution to the resolution.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"After the evidence disappears" is invoked in the premise—women vanished with masks never recovered until now—but no ticking clock or temporal pressure shapes Elira's tactics. The night of the quarry descent is "tonight," but no deadline forces urgency or alters her choices. The timeframe is a backstory fact (decades-old cases, '89 collapse) rather than a live constraint. Present in setup context; absent from escalation and closure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Awakening empathy is stated as Elira's goal early: "She sought to awaken dormant empathy—in the town, in the families, in herself." The faceless portraits and final gallery achieve this outcome (the town weeps). However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized in conflicted choices. Elira never faces a friction where empathy costs her another goal (e.g., legal justice, personal safety). The desire is present in setup, guides the middle staging, and is affirmed at closure, but operates as theme rather than tested want. Two-gate functional presence without visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Furrowed hush is named and sustained: low voices, mist-muffled sound, "the quarry holding its breath," quiet weeping. Diction remains subdued and textural across pressure points. The tone modulates slightly at the confrontation (ragged breath, whispered confession) but never breaks into loud confrontation or melodrama. It charges the final image (Elira sketching the killer faceless) by maintaining solemn restraint. Coherent across all beats, with modest tonal deepening at closure. Strong execution of an atmospheric constraint.</comment>
