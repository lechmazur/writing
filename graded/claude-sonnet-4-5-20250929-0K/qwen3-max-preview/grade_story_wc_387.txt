<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The philosopher's motivation to "appreciate hidden effort" is stated but not dramatized through on-page choices that test or complicate it. Her actions—whistling, walking, holding the whisk—are observational rituals without internal conflict or visible cost. The widow anecdote is told retrospectively rather than creating present tension. Interiority leans heavily on abstract philosophizing ("hidden patterns," "unseen hands") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates through ritual gestures and lyric callbacks (whisk, whistle, fireflies), building to a Resonant Reconfiguration where "I see you" crystallizes her stance. Orientation anchors clearly (parapet, rain, firefly season) by the opening lines. However, the closure moment carries thematic weight but no visible cost—no path is foreclosed, no option narrowed. The widow's story seeds stakes but remains backstory; no present choice tests or alters her commitment.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The parapet setting is vivid and purposeful: wet stone, moss, silk banners, moonlight pooling after clouds. The bamboo whisk functions as micro-setting, handled twice and charged in the final image. Rain-washed chalk markings supply tactile history. Spatial choreography (barefoot on slick stone, eastward bend) remains clear. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through her philosopher's lens, supporting the accumulative texture without stalling momentum.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—witnessing and honoring hidden labor—is signaled early but never pressured by opposition or choice. No reversal tightens options; her climb, whistle, and descent proceed without complication. The widow's memory could create friction but remains a told anecdote. Under an Accumulative lens one deepening suffices, yet even the lyric accumulation lacks a turn that narrows her path or imposes a felt trade-off on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Theme (honoring unseen effort) emerges through particulars: net-mending, dockworkers' matcha, the widow's boat. The final "I see you" and firefly alignment offer a resonant, non-literal answer. However, the closing lines veer toward overt philosophizing ("keeper of unseen threads") that states rather than implies. Subtext operates in gesture (whisk aloft, whispered thanks) but the thematic thread is occasionally foregrounded through abstraction rather than dramatized choice.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Single POV, stable focalization, and controlled psychic distance throughout. Voice has a distinct lyric texture ("scintillatingly somber," "demure audacity humming in her veins") with purposeful elevated diction that suits the philosopher's interior. However, register occasionally drifts into abstraction ("stitched her small, scintillatingly somber song into the larger tapestry of effort") that feels more authorial than character-particular. Perceptual signature is consistent but leans poetic rather than concrete under stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and sensory detail is vivid. However, dense figurative language in nearly every sentence creates texture saturation: "curled upward, scintillatingly somber, like starlight caught in a spider's thread—luminous, yet heavy with the weight of unsung labor" stacks metaphors without clarity gain. Paraphrase loops appear: "not to escape, but to witness" / "not loudly, not proudly, but with demure audacity." Adverbial intensifiers ("not literally," "earnestly") clutter peak beats. Stock phrases ("marrow of the stones," "vanished into the alleys") dull specificity. The final third carries multiple metaphor strings without propulsion, triggering artifact penalties and disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The net-mender philosopher frame and "demure audacity" offer a fresh synthesis. Fireflies as witnesses to labor and the whisk as totem of persistence avoid cliché. However, the widow's story and harbor lanterns read as familiar "unsung hero" material without transformation through specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The lyric-accumulative structure is purposeful but the emotional arc (solitary witness affirming hidden effort) trends toward a template of quiet reverence without a surprising inflection or risk that redefines the premise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Net-mender philosopher: present from the opening, framing her dual identity. Her past act (mending the widow's net) seeds motivation but occurs off-page. On the parapet she observes, whistles, and whispers but makes no choice that alters tactics or forecloses a path. Her trade shapes backstory and worldview but does not constrain a present decision. Present in all three gates but ornamental in the middle; closure participation is thematic echo only. Late lyric reprise without causal pressure; swappable with another observer-philosopher role.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Bamboo tea whisk: introduced early (opening paragraph), handled twice (held aloft to catch moonlight, raised during whispered witness). Its grooves carved by her own hand provide specificity and tie to her labor ethic. Returns in the final third, charging the closure image as her "totem of persistence." However, it does not constrain a choice or enable a tactic under pressure—it remains symbolic rather than functional. Strong setup and closure linkage; lacks middle causal pressure. Lyric-resonance allowance applies but causal necessity is absent.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Hidden patterns: stated as her philosophical method ("tracing hidden patterns in knots and currents"), dramatized through fireflies blinking in rhythm and moon-path following. Shapes her interpretive lens and the final alignment with fireflies, reweighting the closure moment. However, the concept does not alter a tactical choice or narrow options—it remains thematic frame rather than on-page driver. Present in all three gates; middle use is descriptive (moon paths guide steps without opposition). Closure participation is metaphoric resonance, not causal necessity.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Scintillatingly somber: appears as label in two passages ("curled upward, scintillatingly somber" and the final whistle). Describes tone but does not constrain or enable action with visible cost. Her "demure audacity" appears more frequently and with slightly more embodiment (daring cosmos, claiming her place) but still reads as trait assertion rather than friction that shapes a choice. Both phrases are ornamental descriptors. Setup present; middle and closure use remain label-only without demonstrated trade-off on the page.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Whistle: seed early (tests air's willingness to carry secrets), used three times across the arc (widow's name into wind, fisherman's shanty threading fireflies, final soft note before descent). Each instance advances the accumulative texture and the final whistle charges the closure by echoing the opening act. Functionally irreplaceable—her mode of witnessing and honoring. However, whistling does not face opposition or narrow options; it remains expressive ritual rather than causal lever. Strong setup, beat involvement (three touches), and closure linkage; lacks pressure constraint. Elevated by specificity and recurring charge.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Following moon paths: signaled midway ("walked the parapet's curve by following moon paths"), explained as silver sheen where moonlight pooled. Guides her meditation on shadow and effort but does not shape a tactical choice or alter outcome. The method appears in one contiguous beat and returns implicitly at closure (fireflies "tracing moon paths of their own"). Present in setup (if we count the rain/moonlight opening cues) and closure echo, but middle use is descriptive navigation without opposition. Functional but swappable with another meditative walk method; lyric resonance without causal necessity.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Whispering parapet after rain: anchors the entire scene from the opening line, supplies tactile detail (slick stone, damp rock, mossy edges), and returns in the closure (fireflies still blinking above it). The rain-washed chalk markings provide history and her whispered thanks roots a key beat. However, the parapet does not constrain her choices—she could perform the same ritual elsewhere. Micro-setting function is atmospheric rather than pressuring. Strong setup and closure participation; lacks middle causal constraint. Elevated by lyric-resonance reprise and sensory specificity.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Firefly season: mentioned in the opening ("climbed here during firefly season") and dramatized when fireflies appear mid-scene, aligning with her whistle. The season provides context but does not create a ticking clock or tighten her decisions. Fireflies function more as responsive chorus than temporal pressure. Setup present; middle and closure use are ornamental (atmospheric participation without altering tactics). Time remains vague and untethered to urgency. Functional set-dressing but swappable with another seasonal marker; no visible cost tied to the timeframe itself.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>To appreciate hidden effort: stated explicitly as her motivation, seeded through the widow anecdote, and enacted through her witnessing ritual (whispered thanks, "I see you"). Shapes her interpretive lens and the closure gesture. However, the motivation is never conflicted or tested by on-page friction—no competing want, no cost to her vigil. Told more than dramatized through choice under pressure. Present in all three gates but the middle beats are observation without internal struggle. Closure participation is thematic echo rather than a decision that forecloses a path. Functional but lacks dramatized friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Demure audacity: stated twice ("demure audacity, as if daring the cosmos" and "demure audacity humming in her veins") and implied through her soft yet bold whistling and vigil. Tone modulates subtly (soft whistle → shanty → final note) and charges the closure by pairing restraint with assertion. However, the tone remains declarative label rather than embodied through contradictory action under stress. Setup and closure presence solid; middle use is label repetition. Coherent but not pressure-tested; ornamental tonal frame rather than constraint that shapes a pivotal choice.</comment>
