<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The dreamless guard is established with a clear engineered trait and his mission creates a dominant stake, but interiority remains abstract—his choices (pressing the chess clock, humming to charm the sphere) read as competent execution rather than contradictory impulses under pressure. The final softening of shoulders is told rather than dramatized through embodied micro-choices. No secondary character appears to test his stance, and the engineered dreamlessness functions as a label rather than a lived constraint that complicates his actions.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece opens with clear anchors (guard, dune, chess clock) and follows a single continuous mission sequence. One meaningful tightening occurs when the dimly flickering sphere is charmed into coherence, and the chess clock's trembling second hand offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) that reweights the opening stalemate image. However, the cost is conceptual rather than felt—no on-page forfeiture or visible price paid by the guard himself; the "weight lightened by a single breath" is asserted, not shown through a constrained choice or loss that alters his next move.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The glowing dune in bloom anchors the opening with vivid, particularized detail (bioluminescent petals pulsing like heartbeats, petals encoding tree sighs) and the setting evolves causally—petals glow brighter after the sphere awakens. The archive's glass corridors and the dimly flickering sphere constrain the guard's search, creating spatial pressure. Sensory selection remains purposeful and filtered through the guard's mission focus, meeting the micro-setting test by charging the final image when the dune blooms brighter in his wake.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: cultivate sparks in unlit corners by charming dormant wave functions. The guard's action (humming a single note to coax the sphere into coherence) creates one meaningful pressure point, and the sphere's awakening narrows his immediate goal—but no reversal or complication tests his commitment. The trembling second hand reweights the opening stalemate, yet the guard faces no visible trade-off or loss; his unopposed competence flattens escalation under the Accumulative lens, where pressure should deepen through pattern break or cadence shift that imposes cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Theme of potential versus entropy emerges through the dune's memory-petals, the unchosen-world spheres, and the guard's mission to enable rather than witness. The chess clock frozen at midnight → trembling second hand offers a non-literal answer to the central question of restarting time/possibility. However, the final paragraph edges toward overt thematic statement ("His purpose was not to witness, but to enable") rather than trusting the image alone, and the "child would invent a word for hope" risks abstraction where the piece otherwise anchors in concrete particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature—wave functions, neural resonance, fractured lullaby—that filters the world through the guard's engineered vigilance. Diction is purposeful and voice-motivated ("occasionally everywhere," "charm," "syncopated sigh"), and the elevated register fits the conceptual frame. However, under the peak beat (charming the sphere), the voice does not compress or modulate with urgency; the same measured, ornate cadence persists regardless of pressure, flattening the rhythm-as-pressure test and reducing the sense of stakes in real time.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout—"fractured lullaby," "entropy's tide," "sheet music" seams, "pillar of static"—yet many metaphors float as ornament rather than advancing causality. The second paragraph's triple "not X, but Y" construction ("not fire, not light, but potential"; "not cargo, but silence") reads as template cadence without payoff. Paraphrase loops appear: "occasionally everywhere" is stated three times across the piece without reweighting, and "dreamless men do not smile" tells what the prior line already showed (shoulders softening). Information density is uneven; the archive tour (oceans, gravity in minor key, children inventing time) stacks vivid images that do not constrain the guard's choice or narrow his search.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The dreamless guard, divergent archive of collapsed probabilities, and wave-function charm offer a specific synthesis that avoids stock post-apocalyptic templates. The chess clock frozen at midnight → trembling second hand is a fresh inflection earned by the sphere's awakening. However, the "village that forgot how to speak" and the catalog of alternate-world spheres read as ornamental world-building rather than pressure that tests the guard's method or costs; the guard's unopposed competence and the ease of his success reduce the piece's stakes, trending toward median execution of a fresh premise rather than bold transformation with risk.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Dreamless freight guard is present throughout and makes two key choices: pressing the chess clock to open the archive seam (beats at paragraph 11–12) and humming to charm the sphere (paragraph 20–21). His dreamlessness is established early and his mission frames the dominant stake. However, his choices are competent execution without visible trade-off or cost—he succeeds unopposed, and the "weight lightened" is asserted rather than paid. The character shapes the arc but does not face friction that would elevate the score into the 7+ band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Chess clock frozen at midnight appears in beat 1 (paragraph 3), is used causally in beat 2 (pressed to open the archive seam, paragraph 10), and returns with reweighted meaning in the final act (second hand trembles, paragraph 28). The object is handled on the page and its state change (trembling) signals the success of the mission. Strong lyric reprise and closure linkage. However, the clock does not constrain a middle choice or impose cost—it functions as a key and then a symbol, not a source of friction or trade-off, capping the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Divergent archive (core concept) is signaled early (paragraph 4–5), shapes the guard's tactics (he must modulate neural resonance to match its quantum signature, paragraph 10), and structures the entire middle sequence (glass corridors, shimmering spheres, the search for the dimmest sphere, paragraphs 13–18). The archive's "occasionally everywhere" nature creates a constraint (accessible only when wave functions align) that the guard must work around. The concept is indispensable to the plot and drives at least three beats, meeting the 7.0+ threshold.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Occasionally everywhere (attribute of the archive) is mentioned twice (paragraphs 5 and 18) but functions as description rather than a constraint that alters the guard's on-page actions. The guard does not struggle with the archive's flickering presence or pay a cost to access it—he simply presses the clock and the seam opens. The trait is conceptually consistent but remains ornamental, not causal, and does not enable or constrain a visible choice with trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Charm (action) is signaled early as the guard's method (paragraph 7 defines it as "resonance: gentle coaxing of dormant wave functions"), is dramatized on the page when the guard hums to the sphere (paragraph 20), and the sphere's awakening (paragraph 21) is the mission's success and the story's climactic turn. The action shapes the ending (petals glow brighter, clock trembles) and is irreplaceable—no other action would achieve the same effect within the established wave-function logic. Essential across beats and ending.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Through wave functions (method) is present early (paragraph 4: "lattice of branching histories stored in collapsed probabilities"; paragraph 10: "modulating his own neural resonance to match the archive's quantum signature") and is integral to the charm action (paragraph 19: "coaxing of dormant wave functions into coherence"). The method shapes the guard's approach and appears in the ending (paragraph 32: "charm the wave functions of possibility into alignment"). However, the mechanics are told rather than tested—the guard succeeds on first attempt without friction or cost tied to the method itself, capping the score in the mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Glowing dune in bloom opens the story (paragraph 1), grounds the guard's stance (boots sinking into petals), and returns with reweighted meaning in the ending (paragraphs 27 and 34: petals glow brighter after the sphere's awakening, "keeping time with a clock that had just begun to tick again"). The dune functions as a lyric anchor rather than a constraint that alters tactics, and the guard does not interact with the setting to solve a problem. Strong setup and payoff, but no middle development that shapes a choice, limiting the score to the 6.0–6.9 band per the gate model.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>After the last forest burns (timeframe) is mentioned once in the opening line (paragraph 1: "after the last forest burns") and echoed in paragraph 9 (petals encoding "the final sighs of trees that once whispered in the wind, now ash-carved into the earth's skin"). The timeframe establishes setting and tone but does not tighten decisions or create urgency—the guard faces no clock or countdown. The phrase is ornamental world-building without causal pressure, placing it in the 3.0–4.9 functional-but-replaceable band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>To cultivate the sparks in the unlit corners (motivation) is stated explicitly in paragraph 6 and drives the guard's mission: he seeks the dimmest sphere (paragraph 18) and charms it into coherence (paragraph 20–21). The motivation is dramatized through his actions (search, hum, charm) and shapes the ending (he turns toward "the next unlit corner," paragraph 31). However, the motivation is not conflicted—the guard faces no internal friction or competing want, and no cost is paid to pursue it. One dominant stake present across beats and ending, but lacking friction, caps the score just under 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Fractured lullaby (tone) is established early (paragraph 8: "moved with the rhythm of a fractured lullaby, each step a half-note, each breath a syncopated sigh") and coheres through the piece's measured, dreamlike cadence. The tone modulates subtly at the ending (shoulders soften, dune blooms brighter, clock trembles), charging the final image with quiet resolution. However, the tone remains static across the middle beats—no shift in urgency or rhythm during the archive search or the charm action—and the piece does not teach a pattern of tonal breaks that would justify "fractured." Coherent but not dynamically modulated under pressure, placing it in the mid-6s.</comment>
