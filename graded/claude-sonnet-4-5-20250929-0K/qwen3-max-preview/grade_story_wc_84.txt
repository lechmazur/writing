<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The pilot's internal state is established through concrete action (tracing glyphs, handling the chip) and her "perpetually surprised" trait appears twice but remains ornamental rather than driving contradiction. The closing shift from scanning to presence is legible but arrives through reflection rather than embodied struggle. The pilgrim functions as witness rather than applying pressure, and the protagonist's choice to stop searching feels declared more than earned through prior micro-choices that foreclosed other paths.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land cleanly in the opening lines. The closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration—she stops searching and begins listening—but the cost remains abstract: no tactical path is visibly foreclosed on the page, and the chip's work "done" arrives by assertion. The pilgrim's arrival creates a timeframe constraint that never tightens decisions. Drive lens inferred as Accumulative/Textural; the final image reweights the premise, but the pressure does not deepen through a second beat that narrows options.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The observatory is established with vivid, selective detail (cracked celestial dial, crumbling arches, velvet-lined obsidian) and the "brilliant dimness" paradox charges the atmosphere throughout. The drone's projected star trails enable the activation sequence, giving the setting tactical utility. Spatial choreography remains clear across all moves, and the twin moons in the vision anchor world-scale without catalog.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—decode the frequency of belonging—is signaled early but remains metaphorical rather than forcing a concrete trade-off. The chip's activation is a procedure, not a pressure point that narrows options; she follows star trails without risk or alternative. The closing insight that belonging is internal arrives through epiphany rather than a choice that forecloses an external path with visible cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: the frequency was never external but required inward attention. The chip functions as catalyst rather than symbol-for-hire, and the "missing pieces" reframe from lost artifacts to shed identity fragments. The pilgrim's confirmation and the twin-moon visions complicate the simple search. However, the final paragraph edges toward stating the theme ("some frequencies only play when you're still") rather than letting the image alone carry resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable and filters setting through the pilot's trained observation (micron-deviations, thermal scans). Diction is elevated and consistent, though phrases like "frequency of belonging" and "resonance between her and the universe" drift toward prompt language. The pilgrim's single line of dialogue carries subtext, and psychic distance modulates appropriately from operational precision to awe. Minor register lift during peak reflection ("layers of duty, loss, and survival") but voice coheres.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and most lines advance character or atmosphere. The opening anchors voice and stakes cleanly. Paraphrase appears once ("It was never out there" / "It was in the pull") and conceptual redundancy surfaces in the final paragraphs where "belonging wasn't a signal" and "resonance" are restated. Filter verbs ("her breath catching," "she saw") appear but remain voice-motivated. No severe loops or template cadence; clarity and momentum hold throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The inward-turn premise (the relic decodes internal rather than external signals) offers a familiar arc executed with competence. The combination of drone pilot, ancient observatory, and frequency mysticism synthesizes genre elements without transformation; the emotional beats (operator → witness of self) follow a recognizable template. The "brilliant dimness" and twin-moon vision add texture, but the core trajectory—external quest reveals internal lack—does not surprise in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The pilot's observation skills frame early detail (micron-deviations, spotting the seam) and her choice to activate the chip by aligning star trails is present in a key beat. Her final decision to stop scanning and become present closes the arc, though the shift is reflective rather than forcing a tactical forfeit. Early signal, middle action, closure participation all present; causal pressure moderate.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The chip appears in setup (archive rumors), is handled and activated in the central beat (star-trail alignment), and returns at closure (tucked into pocket as talisman). Its pulsing sync to her heartbeat and embedded celestial map give it specificity. It enables the vision sequence but does not constrain a choice or impose cost; she could walk away after tucking it in her pocket without consequence shown on the page.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Missing pieces" is seeded early (pilgrim's warning), drives the search motive, reframes in the vision beat (fragments of self she'd shed), and charges the closure realization. The concept narrows her understanding and alters her final stance from operator to witness. The reweighting from external artifacts to internal fragments shapes the ending image and carries conceptual cost (letting go of the efficient identity).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Perpetually surprised" appears twice as a label: once in exposition ("not by danger, but by beauty") and again implicitly in the closing astonishment. It does not constrain a choice or enable a tactic under pressure; the trait is ornamental and could be omitted without altering any beat. No visible cost or trade-off tied to this attribute on the page.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Pull" is invoked in the pilgrim's closing line ("the choice to follow, even when the trail led inward") and loosely ties to her drawing coordinates from the archive. It frames motive but does not structure a key turn; the action of following star trails and activating the chip could stand without emphasizing "pull." Present in setup and thematically reprised at closure; functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Star trails are signaled in setup (asterisms, celestial dial) and enacted in the activation beat: the drone projects them onto the ceiling, she aligns ancient and embedded maps. The method is specific, irreplaceable (no other mechanism shown), and enables the chip's flare and visions. It shapes the central procedure and ties setting to object. Strong middle involvement and closure linkage; mechanics matter.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The observatory provides the celestial dial seam, the inner dome for star projection, the velvet-lined plinth, and the ambient "brilliant dimness." It enables the star-trail alignment and charges the closing image (stars real and projected blur into one). The setting pressures her choice by offering the tools and atmosphere needed for the ritual. Early anchor, tactical utility, closure charge all present.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The pilgrim's prior arrival is mentioned in setup (warnings of spectral resonance) and he reappears at closure to witness and confirm. The timeframe does not create urgency or narrow her window; she operates at her own pace. His presence bookends the arc but does not tighten decisions or alter tactics. Swappable with "before the pilgrim departed" or similar without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The desire to decode belonging is stated in setup, pursued through the chip search and activation, and reframed at closure (belonging is resonance when still). Friction appears between her efficient operator identity and the longing surfaced by the visions. The cost is conceptual—she must release the sharp-eyed stance—but the trade-off is reflective rather than forcing a choice between two live tactical paths on the page.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>"Brilliant dimness" is named in the opening beat, sustained through amber rays and shadow-breath imagery, and returns in the penultimate paragraph ("settled around her like a second skin"). The paradox matches the inward/outward theme and modulates with her shift from scanning to stillness. Tone coherence across turns and a charged reprise at closure; the oxymoron reweights perception in the final image.</comment>
