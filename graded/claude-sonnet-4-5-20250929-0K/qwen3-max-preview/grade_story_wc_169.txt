<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation is declared rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses in scene. "Lucidly watchful" functions as a label; we see observation but not the cost of that detachment or moments where it wavers under pressure. Interiority relies on abstract philosophizing ("hope wasn't a feeling—it was a structure") rather than embodied emotion. The final smile is asserted serene without showing the trade-offs that earned it.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: pattern creation and trial-balloon launches build toward the obsidian disc's arrival and resonance cascade. Closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (the multiverse exhales, timelines realign) but cost remains conceptual and diffuse—adjacent-stream improvements are told, not shown to foreclose a live option for the dreamer herself. The orientation anchor (grotto, tide-polished, moonlight) lands early enough. One meaningful deepening occurs (silver balloon returns with solution, then emerald balloon triggers cascade), sufficient for this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The grotto is vividly rendered with tide-polished stone, bioluminescent anemones, hexagonal salt lattices. Sensory detail is selective and atmospheric. The obsidian disc—warm, humming—charges the final cascade, meeting the 9+ gate requirement that an object constrain choice or charge closure. However, spatial choreography of the dreamer's position and the ceiling's role in balloon transit could be tighter. The setting feels more backdrop than active constraint on her tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (revitalizing equations for hope across timelines) is signaled early. Escalation under Accumulative lens: patterns → trial balloons → silver return → emerald launch → obsidian disc → resonance cascade. One meaningful tightening exists (the gauge's needle swing) but protagonist agency is passive—balloons return or don't, the tide deposits the disc. She observes and adjusts rather than forcing trade-offs. Cost is told in adjacent streams, not dramatized as a forfeited path for her on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme (hope as solvable structure, patient multiverse repair) emerges from pattern-work and trial balloons without overt moralizing. The final image—"multiverse exhaled, lighter than before"—offers resonant reconfiguration. However, "serene upheaval humming in her marrow" and "lucidly watchful" veer into thematic echo, articulating the thesis in prompt-like language. Subtext operates in the balloons' return and the gauge's calibration, but the penultimate paragraphs state rather than imply: "Her motivation was not to fix everything, but to keep the equations breathing."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV is stable. Perceptual signature is present (hydrodynamic script, logarithmic spirals) but diction drifts into elevated abstraction ("probability of grace under temporal duress," "serene upheaval") that feels authorial rather than character-particular. Psychic distance is consistent. Purposeful compression and lyric patterning are taught early (spirals, trial balloons) and held. Filter verbs ("she'd seen," "she observed") stack but remain voice-motivated for a watchful character.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout: "hope had different densities," "despair's entropy," "timelines brushed against each other like silk scarves." Many images are vivid (bioluminescent anemones, Fibonacci kelp-strands) but the prose rarely breathes—nearly every sentence carries metaphor or abstraction. Template cadence appears: "She began again… She watched it vanish… She placed it… She simply noted." Paraphrase loops: "not to escape, but to revitalize—not herself, but the equations" and "not with longing, but with lucid curiosity." These patterns dull momentum in peak beats and disallow 9+ globally per the filter-verb and template-cadence penalties.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The premise (trial balloons as speculative hypotheses, altitude gauge measuring timeline resonance, equations for hope) is conceptually inventive. Execution, however, leans on abstractions and meta-commentary ("the architecture of hope remained soluble, malleable, alive") rather than grounded particulars. The transformation test fails: swap "equations" for "spells" and "timelines" for "realms" and the emotional arc is unchanged. The ending's multiverse improvements are told conveniences (child laughs, ceasefire holds) without causal groundwork in her prior pattern-work, reducing earned surprise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Logical dreamer is named early and her pattern-creation work is on the page across multiple beats (sea-glass mandalas, kelp Fibonacci curves). However, her choices are reactive—she arranges, launches, observes, recalibrates—without facing a live either/or decision that narrows options. The role constrains her method (logical rather than impulsive) but does not create a key turn where logic itself exacts a visible cost or forces a trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Altitude gauge appears in the opening beat (salvaged, logarithmic spirals, humming) and returns repeatedly: placed at pattern centers, needle trembling with resonance, needle spinning clockwise, needle stilled then swung wide at cascade. It evolves from measuring altitude to measuring coherence and timeline alignment, meeting the setup/development/payoff gates. Causal pressure is present (gauge calibrates the balloons' destinations, triggers resonance cascade) but the mechanism remains abstract—how the gauge constrains her choices or exacts cost is told, not shown in a pivotal beat.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Trial balloons are central: introduced early, launched in three waves (amber/cerulean/silver, then emerald), return with solutions, and trigger the cascade. They shape her method and reappear in the final paragraph. However, their function as "what if" hypotheses is declared rather than demonstrated—what specific question each carries, what trade-off their launch imposes, and how their return alters her next choice remain vague. The concept scaffolds the plot but does not constrain a live on-page decision with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Lucidly watchful" is named in paragraph four and restated in paragraph thirteen ("Her lucid watchfulness wasn't detachment—it was precision"). The trait describes her observation style but does not enable or constrain a specific action with cost. No moment shows her choosing watchfulness over intervention, or clarity over comfort. Label-only mention without friction.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Revitalize is named in paragraph three ("not to escape, but to revitalize—not herself, but the equations") and enacted through pattern-creation and balloon-launching across the story. The obsidian disc's arrival and resonance cascade deliver a revitalizing effect (timelines realign). Setup and payoff gates are met. However, the action is swappable—"heal," "recalibrate," or "renew" would fit with minor edits—and the mechanism by which her patterns revitalize equations is abstract, not dramatized as a tactical choice under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Creating patterns with decorations appears early (sea glass, abalone shards, phosphorescent lichen mandalas encoding theorems) and recurs (spirals within spirals, kelp Fibonacci curves around moonstones). The method is signaled and its mechanics matter: each pattern harmonizes with timelines, the gauge measures resonance. Setup/development/payoff gates are met. The method enables her revitalization work and participates in the cascade beat. Causal pressure is moderate—patterns shape her attempts but no specific decoration choice or arrangement error exacts visible cost or forces a trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Tide-polished grotto is anchored early and sustained: convergence point where timelines brush, bioluminescent anemones, tide depositing the obsidian disc. The setting supplies resources (trial balloons float through its arched ceiling, tide brings solutions) and the gauge's placement "at the center" charges the resonance cascade. The grotto is essential to the plot's mechanism—removing it would break the story's logic. However, it does not constrain a choice (she never faces access limits, resource scarcity, or spatial pressure that alters her tactics), keeping it just below the 8.5+ indispensability threshold.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Across parallel timelines" is named early and referenced throughout (adjacent realities, one stream vs. another, temporal surge, multiverse). The timeframe enables her work (trial balloons slip between timelines) and the ending's cascade effect. However, urgency is absent—no clock tightens her decisions, no timeline-collapse threat, no trade-off between streams. The element provides setting rather than pressure. Late introduction past 40% does not apply, but lack of middle constraint and closure participation as a decision-shaping force caps the score.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Motivation ("to puzzle out new equations for hope") is declared in paragraph eight and restated near the end ("to keep the equations breathing"). Her pattern-work and balloon-launches enact the desire across multiple beats, meeting setup and development gates. However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choice—no moment where solving equations costs her something else she wants, or where despair tempts her to stop. Friction between want and cost is absent; she works "serenely" without visible struggle, making the drive feel ornamental rather than tested.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Serene upheaval" is named explicitly ("serene upheaval humming in her marrow") and the diction sustains the pairing: calm observation (lucid, patient, noting correlations) layered with transformative events (resonance cascade, timelines realigning, gauge needle swinging). The tone is coherent through turns and charges the final image ("the multiverse exhaled, lighter than before"). However, the label is stated rather than embodied in sentence rhythm or contradictory action—her serenity never wavers on the page, flattening the upheaval into metaphor rather than felt experience. The tone modulates little under pressure, trending toward static mood.</comment>
