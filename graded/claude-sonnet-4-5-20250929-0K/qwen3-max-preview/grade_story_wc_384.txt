<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elira's motivation is clear and signaled early, but her interiority reads as summary more than embodied contradiction. The arc from "master calligrapher" to "calligraphy forger" to absolver is told rather than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. Her final choice—rewriting the scroll—is prepared but not tested by competing impulses in scene. Emotion is largely labeled ("trembling not from fear but from the weight") rather than shown through perception or gesture.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who and where promptly; the drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural, building through aurora, dripping stalactites, and the thorn's glow toward a closure image (the rose blooming). The closure unit—scroll rewritten, curse lifted, rose blooming—lands on the page as a Resonant Reconfiguration, but cost is asserted ("burden lifted") rather than shown as forfeiture or constraint. The final image charges the premise without a felt price that alters Elira's options beyond the ending.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The marble sanctuary, aurora, and stalactite drips create a vivid, purposeful setting that constrains the infiltration (vault of seamless marble, silence as guard). The key's mechanics—"responsive only to the frequency of a forger's remorse"—and the scroll's physical resistance ground the climax in object-pressure. Pearl twilight modulates from mourning to awakening, and the thorn embedding in marble supplies the closure image. Spatial choreography is clean throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—unlock the scroll to absolve the kingdom—is signaled early and pursued throughout. One meaningful tightening: the scroll resists ("ink writhed, letters bled"), forcing persistence. However, escalation is assertion-driven ("persisted, her forgery flawless") without a visible tradeoff or live risk that narrows options. The resolution is Elira's agency, but the cost is told ("soul scoured clean") rather than shown as a path foreclosed or a tactical sacrifice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme—absolution via calibrated treason, forgiveness of the unfinished—emerges from the scroll-rewriting and thorn imagery without overt moralizing. The final rose and broken drought supply a resonant, non-literal answer. However, the thematic claim "calibrated treason" and "wisely enduring" are declared in narration rather than arising solely from action and image, and the final paragraph edges toward thematic summary ("quietest, truest treason ever calibrated").</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Single POV is stable; no head-hopping. Voice carries a lyric, elevated register throughout ("veins of mother-of-pearl," "mercy suspended between day and night") that remains consistent and purposeful. However, diction occasionally drifts into label-speak ("calibrated treason in her marrow," "weight of wisely enduring") that feels prompt-aligned rather than organically rooted in Elira's perceptual signature. Compression and patterned cadence are taught early and serve the accumulative design.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Prose is rhythmically controlled and imagistically rich, but density suffers from paraphrase loops and ornamental restatements. "Calibrated treason" appears three times; "as stalactites drip" recurs as a structural marker without adding pressure each time. Mixed metaphors ("ink mixed with her own tears and the powdered petal") strain clarity. Figurative language pervades high-pressure beats without always advancing action, creating drift. The final paragraph stacks summary clauses that reiterate rather than propel.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The combination—calligraphy forger undoing a Binding Scroll with a comet-glass key and heritage rose thorn—offers specificity and lyric texture. However, the premise (lone infiltrator absolves a realm's inherited guilt) is a familiar redemption arc, and the emotional resolution (forgiveness of the unfinished) is achieved without a non-obvious moral calculus or counter-pressure. The thorn-bloom closure image is purposeful but expected within the established pattern.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Calligraphy forger: setup by paragraph one, development through scroll study/infiltration, payoff in rewriting the scroll's final clause. Her forgery skill enables the climax and her remorse activates the key. Causal pressure across three beats; closure linkage strong. Late penalties waived; specificity high.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Heritage rose thorn: setup in paragraph one (stolen, rumored to pierce veils), development in ink-mixing/covenant ("pricking her thumb"), payoff in the thorn embedding and blooming. Used in three beats with evolving function; charges the final image. Cost connection (pain willingly borne) legible. Irreplaceability strong.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Calibrated treason: setup early, named three times, frames Elira's mission. Shapes stakes (rewrite scroll to release guilt) and final reconfiguration. However, the concept is declared more than dramatized; no on-page moment where treason's calibration alters tactics or forces a tradeoff. Present in closure image ("quietest, truest treason") but as theme echo rather than causal turn.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Wisely enduring: setup paragraph one ("years of exile, scorn, solitude"), recurs at climax ("weight of wisely enduring") and resolution ("wisely released"). Label-only; no on-page beat where endurance constrains or enables a specific choice with cost. Summary of backstory rather than visible tradeoff. Swappable with "patient" or "persistent."</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Unlink: setup via mission statement ("unlink the Binding Scroll"), development through vault infiltration and scroll mechanics, payoff in the rewriting and curse unraveling. Major turn traces to this action; removing "unlink" would break the plot. Causal pressure high; irreplaceability high; closure linkage strong.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Key with no apparent lock: setup in sleeve, development when pressed to wall and marble sighs open, dissolves post-use. Mechanics matter (comet glass, forger's remorse frequency); enables vault access. Shapes two beats; closure participation (dissolves, purpose spent). Specificity and irreplaceability high; cost connection moderate.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Marble sanctuary under aurora: setup paragraph one, development through vault pressure (seamless wall, silence as guard), payoff in sanctuary settling and sealing. Environment constrains infiltration and supplies the closure frame (marble seals, hiding scroll/thorn/key). Aurora flare signals rebalance. Two beats plus closure; causal pressure moderate.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>As stalactites drip: setup paragraph one, recurs structurally ("as stalactites drip above," "accelerated rhythm," "one final time"). Functions as timeframe marker but does not tighten decisions or alter tactics; no live clock that forces tradeoffs. Present in closure beat but ornamental. Pattern taught; legibility high; pressure low.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>To forgive the unfinished: setup paragraph one (letters never sent, vows never sealed, father unreconciled), drives mission throughout, payoff in scroll rewriting and release. Shapes two beats; closure linkage strong. However, motivation is told in backstory rather than dramatized through conflicted on-page choice. No visible friction between wanting forgiveness and paying its cost in scene.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Pearl twilight: setup paragraph one ("hues of pearl twilight—soft lavenders, muted golds, the color of mercy"), recurs at resolution ("pearl twilight no longer a hue of mourning, but of gentle awakening") and exit ("walked into the pearl twilight"). Modulates with pressure; charges final image. Coherent across turns; lyric reprise reweights tone with cost.</comment>
