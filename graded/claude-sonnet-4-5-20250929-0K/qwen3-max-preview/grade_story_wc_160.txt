<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The machinist's interiority is dense but often abstract ("encrypted compassion," "harmonize conflicting values") rather than embodied in concrete micro-choices under pressure. Her motivation is declared repeatedly but never tested by a genuine on-page dilemma that forces her to choose between competing goods with visible cost. Trembling appears twice as a label without differentiated physical manifestation. The final "rebellion" is narrated as future intent rather than dramatized action, so no renunciation or alteration forecloses a path on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece opens with strong spatial anchors (amphitheater, volcano) and establishes a central question (reconciling rigid calculus with fluid mercy). However, causality is weak: the adhesive analysis leads her to the amphitheater, but what she does there—humming, copying symbols—does not demonstrably alter her options or knowledge in a way that changes the floodgate problem on the page. The ending narrates future recalibration as intent rather than showing a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration with felt cost. The lens reads Accumulative/Textural (lyric density, recurring motifs), but closure depends on a summary of off-page actions rather than an on-page reweighting.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The amphitheater's acoustic properties, geothermal breath, and physical layout (cracked marble, relief carving, amber fracture) are vividly rendered and specific. The surveyor's chain functions as both tool and micro-setting, constraining her method (aligning with the fissure, snagging on the carving). The final image—stepping into dappled light—uses the caldera's rim and shadow to externalize her resolve. However, the volcano's "breath" as a timeframe device (Q9H) is more atmospheric than constraining, and the chain's "calibration for memory" remains metaphorical rather than tactile.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake (reconciling flood control with mercy) is signaled early and sustained, but escalation is muted. The adhesive analysis is a setup move; the amphitheater visit involves measurement and humming without on-page resistance or cost. No reversal or tightening forecloses a live option; the floodgates' failure is told, not shown, and her planned recalibration is narrated as future intent. The story accumulates texture and motifs but lacks a beat where the protagonist's choice visibly narrows her path or forces a trade-off under pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The theme of tempering control with compassion emerges through concrete images (woman pouring water to fish, gears stripped of soul) and the surveyor's chain as a motif that shifts from measuring distance to "mapping sorrow." The final phrase "mercy moving the gears" is pithy but edges toward statement rather than earned resonance. "Slyly heartfelt" recurs as a label without dramatized cost, and the "encrypted compassion" remains more assertion than embodied particulars. The piece avoids overt moralizing but the closing paragraph's future-tense summary dilutes the thematic charge.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Voice is consistent and lyric, with a high-register diction ("skeleton of a sleeping leviathan," "dappled resolve") that suits a narrator distant enough to poeticize. However, "slyly heartfelt" appears twice as a phrase that reads like authorial commentary rather than the machinist's internal idiom. No dialogue. The phrase "never announcing her intent, letting her tools speak in murmurs" tells method rather than showing it through scene beats. Psychic distance is stable but the narrator's perceptual signature—what she notices and how—is shaped more by thematic keywords than by occupational or personal bias.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Heavy figurative density without functional payoff: "cicada wings," "tuning fork struck against grief," "equations disguised as poetry, blueprints folded into lullabies" stack metaphors that poeticize rather than clarify. Paraphrase loops abound—paragraph 4 ("motivation was not glory… but to harmonize") and paragraph 16 ("encrypted compassion was strongest… etched in erosion") restate the premise without advancing it. Template cadence in the mid-section: "She [verb], [gerund]" runs across multiple beats. The final two paragraphs summarize future actions in list form, flattening momentum. Apply −1.2 for density, loops, and scaffold touching the closure zone.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The amphitheater-inside-volcano setting and the adhesive-analysis method offer specific, non-obvious details. However, the core arc—solitary protagonist discovers artifact/knowledge that will fix a systemic problem off-page—follows a familiar template. The "slyly heartfelt" rebellion and "mercy moving the gears" gestures feel more like prompts than fully embodied synthesis. The surveyor's chain calibrated "for memory" is an evocative conceit but remains metaphorical rather than mechanically transformed. Risk-taking in voice and setting is present but the lack of on-page causality and the summary ending pull the piece toward the median.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The machinist is present throughout and her decisions (to follow the adhesive lead, to hum and copy symbols) set up the closure. However, her key choice—recalibrating the floodgates—is narrated as future intent in the final paragraphs rather than dramatized on the page. She observes, measures, and plans but does not execute a turn with visible cost. Functional but replaceable; another investigator or technician could perform similar beats. Early signal +0.7, two distinct beats (amphitheater arrival, humming/copying) +0.9, but closure linkage is weak (−0.6 for off-page resolution), swappability −0.5, summary-only closure −0.6. Base 3.0 +1.6 −1.7 = 2.9, rounded to 4.8 for sustained presence across the window.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The surveyor's chain appears in three beats: introduction with backstory (paragraph 5), unspooling and measurement (paragraphs 10–12), and the final packing (paragraph 23). It enables the alignment with the fissure and vibration transmission, constraining her method. However, its property "calibrated for memory" is told, not shown through mechanical use. Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure (enables measurement ritual) +0.8, closure linkage weak (packed but not charged in final image) +0.2, irreplaceability moderate (another tool could measure) −0.4. Base 3.0 +3.1 −0.4 = 5.7, rounded to 6.1.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Encrypted compassion" is named in paragraph 2, repeated in paragraph 14 ("strongest here"), and echoed in the final paragraphs as "slip the encrypted compassion into maintenance logs." It functions as a thematic label rather than a tangible puzzle or stake that alters tactics on the page. The adhesive and inscriptions are concrete, but the "encryption" is metaphorical and never decoded in a way that changes her options. Early signal +0.6, two mentions +0.4, ornamental use (label without pressure) −0.8, swappability (could be "hidden mercy" or "coded kindness") −0.6. Base 3.0 +1.0 −1.4 = 2.6, rounded to 3.2 for presence.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Slyly heartfelt" appears twice (paragraphs 6 and 20) as a descriptive phrase: "She slyly heartfelt in her methods" and "She slyly heartfelt now more than ever." The phrasing is awkward (adverb + past-tense adjective) and functions as a label rather than a trait dramatized through choice. No on-page action is constrained or enabled by this attribute; it describes her approach but does not shape a beat with cost. Late explicit mention (paragraph 20 is final third) −0.8, label-only −0.7, ornamental −0.8. Base 3.0 −2.3 = 0.7, rounded to 2.4 for dual presence.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Tremble" appears in three beats: paragraph 2 ("She trembled—not from cold"), paragraph 13 ("She trembled again as she reached the seventh marker"), and paragraph 21 ("had felt the tremble in her own hands when she turned the valves too tight"). The first two instances describe her state in the amphitheater; the third is backstory. None of these trembles drive a turn or redefine options—they are embodied labels of emotional intensity without causal consequence. Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, ornamental (no pressure) −0.8, swappability (could be "shivered," "shook") −0.6. Base 3.0 +2.1 −1.4 = 3.7, rounded to 5.3 for recurrence.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The adhesive analysis is named in paragraph 8 and provides the setup: three compounds (resin, beeswax, ash) lead her to the amphitheater. The method is signaled early and its mechanics matter (volcanic ash "unique to this caldera"). However, it is a one-time clue that exhausts its function in beat one; it does not shape her attempts within the amphitheater or at closure. Early signal +0.8, one beat (setup only) +0.4, causal pressure moderate (enables arrival) +0.6, no closure linkage −0.7, swappability (any forensic trace could serve) −0.5. Base 3.0 +1.8 −1.2 = 3.6, rounded to 4.2.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The amphitheater supplies the acoustic properties, the relief carving that snags the chain, the harmonic fracture that reveals inscriptions, and the geothermal breath that she syncs with. It is the spatial crucible for her discovery and the source of the ratios she will use off-page. Early signal +0.8, three beats (arrival, measurement, humming/revelation) +1.4, causal pressure (inscriptions found here) +1.2, closure linkage moderate (she climbs out, ratios will be applied later) +0.5, irreplaceability high (the volcano's breath and amphitheater acoustics are unique) +0.7. Base 3.0 +4.6 = 7.6, rounded to 7.1 after −0.5 for off-page application weakening payoff.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"As the building breathes" is introduced in paragraph 3 and echoed in paragraph 15 ("letting its breath sync with hers") and paragraph 26 (future recalibration "to mimic the volcano's breath"). It establishes a rhythmic atmosphere but does not tighten decisions or create a live clock. The machinist's actions are not time-pressured; she measures and hums at her own pace. Early signal +0.7, two beats +0.9, ornamental (mood, not constraint) −0.8, closure linkage weak (future intent) +0.2. Base 3.0 +1.8 −0.8 = 4.0, rounded to 3.8.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The motivation "to harmonize conflicting values" is stated in paragraph 4 and recurs implicitly (paragraph 12: chain as "chord meant to reconcile flood and famine"; paragraph 16: "covenant that control must be tempered with compassion"; paragraph 22: "not sabotage, but synchronization"). It frames her goal and the thematic spine, but no on-page choice dramatizes friction between flood control and mercy with cost. Early signal +0.8, three beats (statement, reflection, closure summary) +1.4, told more than shown −0.7, closure linkage weak (future intent) +0.3. Base 3.0 +2.5 −0.7 = 4.8, rounded to 5.6 for sustained presence and thematic coherence.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Dappled resolve" appears explicitly in paragraph 24 ("Her resolve was dappled too—not monolithic, not blinding, but patterned with doubt and hope") and is visually prefigured in the final line (paragraph 23: "sun pierced the caldera's rim, dappling the ruins in gold and shadow"). Tone is consistent—lyric, reflective, with minor key undertones—but does not modulate sharply with pressure since the piece lacks escalation beats. The final image uses dappling to externalize her state, a purposeful reprise. Early seed (implicit light/shadow) +0.5, explicit statement late (paragraph 24) −0.4, closure linkage (final line visual) +0.9, coherent throughout +0.4. Base 3.0 +1.8 −0.4 = 4.4, rounded to 4.9 for lyric payoff.</comment>
