<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and grounded in personal history, but her agency feels orchestrated rather than earned through contradictory impulses. The peak moment—transcribing the stanza and questioning the storm—reads as competent execution without genuine internal conflict or visible cost that narrows her options. The "nervously confident" attribute is labeled repeatedly but never dramatized through a micro-choice that forecloses a path. Her great-grandfather's backstory anchors her drive, yet the resolution feels inevitable rather than costly.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story anchors who/where/when early and follows a causal chain: Elara decodes the stanza, activates the resonance board, and the storm shifts. However, the closure lacks visible cost—the exile ends because she succeeded, not because success required a meaningful sacrifice on the page. The jet stream "settling into a gentler path" is a solution delivered without the felt price or foreclosed option that a Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration requires. The inferred lens is Causal, but the final image offers reward without complication.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The experimental weather station and the copper nail anchor setting through tactile, recurring detail: the nail grows warm, the station's metal bones vibrate, the resonance board whirs. The environment pressures Elara's choices—emergency lamps, alarms, the fractured coast—and the nail's warmth charges the final act. Spatial choreography is coherent throughout, and the setting evolves causally (clouds unspooling backward, rain rising). Minor: occupational detail (resonance board, dials) is gestural rather than constraining, but at this length that's acceptable.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—proving her theories to reverse exile—is signaled early and tightens when Elara finds Captain Riel's stanza. The resonance-board sequence escalates pressure (alarms blare, sky groans), but the storm's cooperation feels granted rather than won through a trade-off. Elara questions the storm and it answers; no visible price is paid, no option foreclosed. The resolution rewards her without dramatizing what she surrendered or risked losing in the act of control.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme—memory as storm, erasure as grief, maps as song—emerges organically from the coded stanzas and Elara's ancestor work. The final image ("some maps aren't drawn on paper. They're sung by storms") resonates without stating a moral, and the nail's quiet hum reconfigures its earlier warmth. The piece resists tidy binaries and invites reflection. Minor slip: "turned banishment into pilgrimage, and pilgrimage into power" edges toward thematic summary, but the specificity of the nail and stanzas keeps it grounded.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited; distance modulates purposefully (close during transcription, pulling back for the sky's response). Diction is controlled and voice-particular ("exile was reversible," "ghost's grip," "dawn itself were being rewound"). The nail's recurring warmth and Elara's perceptual filter (electric certainty, breath hitched in awe) create a consistent signature. Minor: "nervously confident" is asserted more than shown through syntax or rhythm under pressure, and a few phrases ("those nervously confident enough") feel like direct address rather than interior texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose is clear and propulsive with strong verbs ("unspooled," "wept into steam," "sighed, shifted") and purposeful imagery. Sentence rhythm varies effectively. However, patterned stems appear: "She believed," "She'd pried," "She transcribed," "She questioned," "She slipped," "She opened"—template cadence in high-density beats. The phrase "not because... but because" recurs three times, creating a scaffold loop. The final paragraph's triplet repetition ("They're sung... They're forged... They're remembered") is purposeful, but earlier loops dull momentum slightly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The premise—coded weather stanzas in drowned sailors' journals—is inventive, and the copper nail as talisman grounds the concept in tactile specificity. The synthesis of cartography, atmospheric science, and grief as storm memory feels fresh. However, the execution follows a familiar template: exiled expert discovers lost knowledge, proves theory, earns redemption. The emotional arc and plot structure work unchanged with different surface details, suggesting the freshness is more ornamental than structural.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her choices drive the plot: sorting journals, decoding the stanza, transcribing it, questioning the storm. She appears in the setup, middle transcription beat, and the closure journal-writing moment. Her idealism shapes her conviction that forgotten maps hold power. The choices alter tactics (from decoding to activation to writing), though the final act feels more like validation than a trade-off. Strong causal involvement but the cost is thin.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The copper nail appears in three distinct beats: tucked in her pocket (setup), grows warm during transcription (middle pressure), burns during the storm's answer, then returns to a quiet hum at closure. Its warmth pressures Elara's certainty and charges the resonance moment. The nail is irreplaceable—it's her great-grandfather's relic, anchoring both memory and the station's vibration. Removing it would weaken the tactile thread and the ancestral link. High integration, though the cost tied to it is emotional rather than tactical.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Reversible exile frames the stakes from the first paragraph and resurfaces at closure when Elara declares it over. The concept shapes her tactics (proving theories to earn return) and the ending image (turning banishment into pilgrimage). However, the reversal itself lacks on-page friction—success simply grants return without a visible price or foreclosed alternative. Present and functional, but the mechanics of reversal are told rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Nervously confident" is labeled three times ("nervously confident in her convictions," "not because she was unafraid, but because fear had become her compass," "those nervously confident enough") but never enacted through contradictory micro-choices or syntax that embodies the tension. The trait is asserted rather than shown in her trembling fingers or her steady voice. It does not constrain an on-page action or create a visible cost. Present as theme claim, absent as dramatized attribute.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elara questions the storm aloud ("What do you want?") and the wind answers in stanzas, shifting the interaction from control to dialogue. This action appears in the climax and reframes the storm as memory rather than chaos. However, the questioning is brief and the answer cooperative; it does not foreclose an option or create a tactical dilemma. The action matters but is not irreplaceable—she could have activated the board without the question and still achieved the shift. Functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Coded stanzas are signaled early (sailors' logs with "rhythmic verses disguised as weather notes"), developed in the middle beat (Journal #7, Captain Riel's stanza matching the jet stream's path), and directly shape the climax (Elara transcribes and hums the cadence to activate the board). The method is irreplaceable—without the stanzas, there is no code to decode, no resonance to hum. The mechanics are clear and constrain her approach. Strong integration across setup, middle, and closure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The experimental weather station is present throughout: the fractured coast, emergency lamps, resonance board, alarms, metal bones that vibrate. The station's machinery constrains Elara's method (she must use the board to hum the cadence) and the alarms mark the storm's response. The setting affects outcome—the station is the tool of control. However, the specifics of "experimental" are gestural; the station could be replaced with any weather-control facility. Functional and present, but not uniquely indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The jet stream shift is established in the opening line and frames the world's crisis. The timeframe ("three weeks prior," "before the next atmospheric inversion") sets a deadline for Elara's proof. However, the clock does not tighten her tactics on the page—she finds the journal tonight and acts immediately without visible time pressure altering her moves. The timeframe anchors the premise but does not constrain the climax. Present in setup and resolution, absent in escalation.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara's desire to honor her great-grandfather's erased bravery is dramatized through the copper nail and her choice to complete what he began. The motivation is seeded early (the nail from his sea-burial casket), developed in reflection (he sailed into the storm's heart for a refugee flotilla), and drives her final act (weaving exile into return, loss into legacy). The motivation shapes her tactics and charges the closure. However, the friction between this want and other costs is thin—honoring him aligns neatly with reversing her own exile.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Spongey dread" is not legibly present. The tone reads as wonder and vindication rather than dread: "electric certainty," "breath hitched in awe," "light, golden and slow," "quiet hum." Elara does not flinch when alarms blare; fear is reframed as compass without embodied dread. The tone is consistent but does not match the required affect. If the intended tone was awe-with-unease, the text delivers the awe clearly and the unease only in scattered phrases.</comment>
