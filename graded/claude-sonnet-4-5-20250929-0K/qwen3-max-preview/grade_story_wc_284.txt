<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elira's motivation is clear and her physical state (burns, trembling hands) is embodied throughout. The choice to plant the microfilm rather than retrieve it shows agency with visible cost. However, the interiority leans heavily on metaphor and abstraction ("unused courage," "quiet gardener of justice") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final renunciation reads as earned but the path there is more poetic assertion than dramatized internal conflict.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story establishes a coherent Accumulative/Textural lens: Elira climbs, plants evidence, and departs, with the final image reweighting her entire arc from burned spy to "quiet gardener of justice." Orientation is swift (who/where/when within opening lines). The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis meets Charged Poise): she surrenders to legacy rather than survival, foreclosing revenge with visible cost (walking away, trusting seasons she won't see). The cost is felt conceptually but could be more visceral on the page—no physical or relational price is shown in the final beat, only asserted through metaphor.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The bluff, mist, snow, and relay station are vivid and purposeful. The hatch and snowdrift become functional tools: the microfilm is hidden where spring thaw will carry it. The setting constrains her actions (testing footholds, calculating wind shifts) and the final image of mist swallowing her silhouette charges the closure. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through her urgency, though the piece leans visual; tactile and auditory cues are present but less varied.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—planting truth for reckoning—is signaled early and deepens through her physical struggle and the choice to leave the pillbox as a marker. One meaningful tightening occurs: she moves from seeking unused courage to realizing it was left behind in the act itself. The cost is conceptual (walking away, trusting an unseen future) rather than a visible forfeiture that alters immediate options. Escalation is present but more textural than causal; no reversal narrows her choices on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the act of planting rather than retrieving, and the final image of her "name no longer ash, but compost for what would grow" offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the question of redemption. The pillbox, microfilm, and seasonal metaphors recur with shifting weight. Minor slip: "quiet gardener of justice" in the final third edges toward thematic echo, though it remains anchored in the concrete act. The piece resists moralizing and embraces ambiguity—no one may ever find the cache.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The voice is distinct and lyric, with a controlled elevated register ("zephyr," "vouchsafe," "compost for what would grow") that remains consistent and voice-motivated throughout. Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping. However, the diction occasionally drifts into abstract poeticism ("silver hush," "unused courage waits") that risks ornament over immediacy. The perceptual signature is present but not sharply character-specific—Elira's way of noticing could be more idiosyncratic. No dialogue to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and the prose often does double duty (e.g., "her boots crunching through the last brittle crust of winter, each step a defiance"). However, figurative density is high throughout, especially in the final third ("silver hush," "ghost of justice," "scattered pages of an unread book"), which risks overwriting. Some paraphrase loops: "unused courage" recurs multiple times without fresh pressure, and "silver hush" appears twice in close proximity. The final image is vivid but the metaphor stack ("ash," "compost," "seeds," "bloom") borders on redundancy. Line-level clarity remains intact, but the ornamental load in peak beats lowers propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The premise—burned spy plants evidence rather than escaping—is a fresh angle on the espionage genre. The choice to trust geological time and seasonal thaw rather than human retrieval is specific and non-obvious. However, the emotional arc (betrayal → renunciation → legacy) follows a familiar template, and the "quiet gardener" metaphor in the final paragraph risks banality. The microfilm-in-snow method and the pillbox as grave marker are inventive particulars that lift the piece. Risk-taking is present in the lyric mode and the open ending, though the closure could be bolder.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The burned spy is present from the opening and drives every major choice: climbing despite injury, planting rather than retrieving, walking away. Her decisions alter tactics (prudent footholds, mist as cover) and the final renunciation forecloses revenge with visible cost. The character is indispensable to the story's logic and closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The engraved pillbox appears early (first third), is handled twice (fumbling for it, unscrewing it), and returns with reweighted meaning at the end (placed atop the hatch as a marker to rust and sink). Its coordinates "only she could decipher" and its transformation from container to grave marker charge the closure. Removing it would weaken the specificity and symbolic resonance of the final image.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Fixing what's broken is signaled early ("to fix what's broken, even if the only thing left to mend was the record") and shapes her motivation to plant truth rather than escape. It constrains her choice to leave the microfilm for reckoning. However, the concept is more thematic backdrop than active driver of on-page tactics; it doesn't narrow her options in the middle beats, only frames the final act.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Prudently daring" is explicitly named mid-story and demonstrated through her actions: calculating wind shifts, testing footholds, yet daring the climb and the act of planting. The trait enables her survival and success but doesn't constrain a choice with visible cost—her caution and boldness align rather than conflict. It's functional but somewhat replaceable with "careful" or "deliberate."</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Vouchsafe" is signaled early ("she would vouchsafe the last truth") and defines the central action: entrusting the microfilm to the earth rather than a person. The verb's archaic weight reinforces the ceremonial gravity of the act. The final turn—planting rather than retrieving—traces directly to this framing. Removing the term would not break the plot, but the specific register elevates the choice's stakes.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The method—codes in accumulated snow—is present in the middle beat ("layers of drift, each storm a cipher, each melt a decryption") and directly shapes her tactic of hiding the microfilm in the deepest fold where thaw will carry it. However, the mechanism is poetic more than functional; the reader doesn't see her use the snow's layers as code, only entrust the microfilm to them. It's specific but could be swapped for "buried cache" with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The zephyr bluff in mist is present from the title and opening line, pressures her physically (ache in ribs, trembling hands, testing footholds), supplies the hatch and snowdrift as tools, and charges the final image (mist swallowing her). The setting is indispensable: without the bluff's isolation and the mist's cover, her act of planting and departure would lack spatial logic and visual resonance.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The timeframe—tilt of the earth toward spring—is signaled early and returns in the final image (trusting seasons she'll never see). It shapes the symbolic weight of thaw and renewal but doesn't tighten on-page decisions or alter her tactics. The season is thematic backdrop rather than a live clock. Functional but replaceable with another transition season.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The motivation—to find where unused courage waits—is named early and frames her climb. The final realization (courage was left behind, not found ahead) shifts the meaning. However, the desire is more poeticized than dramatized through conflicted choices; she pursues it without friction or tradeoff on the page. The concept is present but the execution leans tell over show.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Silver hush" is named twice (mid-story and near the end) and modulates with pressure: quiet resolve during the climb, deepening stillness as she departs. The tone coheres through all turns, muting even her breath, and charges the final image of mist swallowing her. It's specific, recurring, and indispensable to the lyric register. Removing it would flatten the atmospheric control.</comment>
