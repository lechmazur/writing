<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is declared—defying hopelessness through pyrotechnic ritual—but her interiority remains opaque throughout. We receive lyric descriptions of her movements and chants, yet no contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure that reveal character hierarchy. The final laugh "from the sheer audacity of joy reclaimed" tells the emotion rather than embodying it through specific action or contradiction. The journey feels ornamental rather than earned by visible internal conflict.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes an accumulative/textural lens: Lira walks, decodes tiles, performs a sequence, and achieves a star-lighting climax. Orientation is present early (blooming fortress, dusk, wandering designer), and the mosaic cipher provides a clear goal. However, the closure—star flickers, holds, fortress seals—lands as spectacle without a visible cost that forecloses a path. The kerosene knot dissolves "into pigment, scent becoming song," but what option did Lira sacrifice or what stance crystallized? The cost remains conceptual and unanchored, weakening the Resonant Reconfiguration claim.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The blooming fortress is vividly textured—petals that "release phosphorescent dust," vines that "recoil from moonlight," mosaic tiles that sing—and these details shape Lira's path and her final ritual. The kerosene rag knot functions as a micro-object that charges the ending when laid on the central tile. Spatial choreography is clear across the hall and mosaic. The setting constrains her movement and charges the closure image, qualifying for the 7+ band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—reigniting hope by decoding and activating the mosaic—is signaled early and pursued across beats. Pressure accumulates through her chant shifts, footfall sequence, and the mosaic's resonance building. However, escalation remains textural rather than choice-driven; Lira faces no meaningful opposition or trade-off. The climax delivers sensory reward (star appears, fortress seals) but no on-page cost that narrows her later options or forces a sacrifice. One tightening is present, but the felt price is absent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The theme—hope reclaimed through ritual play in defiance of cosmic silence—emerges from image and action rather than statement. The mosaic cipher, the kerosene knot, and the star work as particulars that resonate without a thesis announcement. Yet the final image, while lyric, offers a resolved constellation (star holds, fortress seals, "a new spark takes root") that feels declarative rather than ambiguous. The piece invites reflection but the neat symmetry of hope-restored undercuts complexity. The closing "not in sky, but in soul" edges toward moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Voice is distinct—lyric, archaic-inflected diction ("tessera," "lithophone," "harmonic dissonance")—and psychic distance is stable in close third. However, register drifts into elevated abstraction ("the sheer audacity of joy reclaimed," "defiance of controlled chaos") that exceeds Lira's immediate perceptual signature under stress. The chant motif is present but not varied in texture across emotional peaks. No dialogue on the page; internal voice is consistent but lacks the compression or rhythmic modulation expected at climax.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The prose is dense with figurative language—nearly every sentence carries a simile or metaphor ("like overripe fruit," "like slow-burning fuses," "like syrup")—creating pattern fatigue rather than selective charge. In the climax paragraph, stacked metaphors ("constellation waiting to be named," "struck match in heaven's hearth") blur clarity. Template cadence appears: "She [verb]" openers recur across paragraphs without variation. Paraphrase loops: "filter everything through ambient awareness" (paragraph 7) is restated in paragraph 19. Artifice touches the closure beat, triggering the elevated deduction and disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The synthesis—pyrotechnics as prayer, a blooming post-collapse fortress, sonic mosaic cipher—feels purposeful and committed. The "serious playfulness" frame and the tactile kerosene knot offer specific anchors. However, the emotional arc (wanderer reclaims hope through ritual) follows a familiar template, and the defiance-of-despair theme is well-trodden. The piece transforms its tropes through lyric texture but does not offer a non-obvious moral calculus or turn. The risk taken is primarily stylistic.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Lira is present throughout and performs the tile sequence at climax, but her choices feel procedural rather than stake-altering. She follows a pre-designed cipher without deviation or sacrifice. The decision to lay down the kerosene knot is not earned by prior conflict—it is a ritual gesture rather than a forced trade-off. Present in closure but swappable with another pyrotechnic archivist; agency is thin.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The kerosene rag knot appears in beat one (soaked talisman, paragraph 4), beat two (twitches like a living thing, paragraph 14), and closure (laid on the central tile, absorbed, paragraph 26). Its scent and warmth anchor her past and charge the ritual. The final dissolution reweights its meaning from memory to offering. Three-beat involvement with closure linkage and lyric reprise elevate it into the 6+ band; causal pressure is moderate (it does not constrain her choices mid-sequence).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The mosaic note is the story's spine: it defines her goal (decode the cipher), structures the middle (tile sequence), and delivers the climax (mosaic erupts in sound, star appears). Removing it would collapse the plot. Present in setup (paragraph 9), developed across the tile-stepping beats, and active at closure. The concept shapes stakes and tactics on the page, not merely thematically. Causal pressure is strong; irreplaceability is high.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Chanting appears in beat one (paragraph 1), recurs at paragraph 14 ("her chant shifts key"), and closes the story (paragraph 28, "chanting anew"). It flavors her character and modulates with pressure, but does not constrain an on-page choice or impose a visible cost. The trait is consistent and present at closure, but its function remains atmospheric rather than causal. Lyric reprise qualifies for mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Filter" is named twice: paragraph 7 ("filters everything through ambient awareness") and paragraph 19 (same phrasing before the tile sequence). It describes her perceptual mode but does not dramatize a distinct action with cost. The tile-stepping itself—her primary action—is not framed as "filtering" in the moment; the verb recurs as exposition. Present and thematic, but the action is ambient rather than a decisive turn-driver. Mid-6s for thematic coherence without causal indispensability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Ambient awareness is signaled early (paragraph 7), recurs at the pre-climax beat (paragraph 19, "syncing her pulse to the fortress's hidden tempo"), and implicitly enables the tile sequence. The method shapes her approach but is not tested under opposition or made mechanically specific (what cost does ambient awareness impose?). The story gestures at the method more than dramatizing its constraints. Present across beats and linked to closure, but the mechanics remain lyric rather than tactical.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The blooming fortress is established in paragraph 2, recurs across beats (petals, vines, mosaic chamber), and closes the story (fortress seals, paragraph 28). It supplies resources (phosphorescent dust, mosaic tiles) and pressures Lira's path (stone battlements, lattice ceiling). The setting is active at closure (sealing like a fist) and irreplaceable—removing the fortress would void the stakes. Strong causal presence, closure linkage, and specificity justify the 7+ band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The timeframe is declared in paragraph 12 ("the night hopelessness gained gravity") and paragraph 29 ("a night with no stars"), framing the thematic stakes. However, it does not constrain Lira's tactics on the page—no ticking clock, no pressure from the passage of dusk into night. The timeframe is atmospheric and thematic rather than a tactical limiter. Present in closure thematically but functionally replaceable; mid-4s.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The motivation to "defy the gravity of hopelessness" is stated in paragraph 13 and echoed at closure (paragraph 24, "audacity of joy reclaimed"; paragraph 29, "a new spark takes root"). It drives her pilgrimage and ritual but is never dramatized as a conflicted choice—what does she risk or sacrifice to defy hopelessness? The desire shapes the arc thematically and appears at closure, but lacks friction or visible cost on the page. Thematic coherence without embodied struggle lands in the mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Serious playfulness is present from the opening ("choreograph light in the dark," paragraph 13) through the gritty tile-dance (paragraph 21, "not with grace but with grit") to the breathless laugh at climax (paragraph 24). Tone modulates appropriately—lyric gravity in the walk, kinetic play in the sequence, joy at resolution. It charges the final image (chanting anew, paragraph 28) and coheres across beats. The tonal signature is consistent and integral to closure, justifying the upper-6s band.</comment>
