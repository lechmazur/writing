<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The courtesan's motivation (poetry over flesh, defiance of conformity) is stated but never dramatized through a concrete on-page choice with competing impulses. Her work untangling threads proceeds without internal conflict or visible cost—no moment where restraint wars with revelation, no trade-off between solitude and connection. The final smile reads as arrival rather than earned transformation; no path is foreclosed. Interiority remains abstract ("furnace of her refusal") rather than embodied and character-particular.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: threads untangle in sequence, echoes spill out. Closure effect is a Conceptual Repricing—the prism empties, the courtesan becomes "keeper of the unraveled"—but the cost is asserted rather than legible on the page; no tactical shift or forfeited option appears in the final beats. The transition from opening courtyard to prism work is smooth, but the "harvest of echoes" remains metaphorical noise rather than stakes that narrow choice. Orientation is clear early; one meaningful deepening (thread resistance → knot dissolves) occurs but without visible price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The silver courtyard, snow, and prism are vividly rendered with sensory specificity ("snowflakes caught the vibrations, trembling midair"). The prism's facets and threads function as micro-setting that structures the central task. However, setting does not constrain a choice—threads yield to patience and breath without spatial friction, and the courtyard remains backdrop rather than pressure. The final image uses setting (snow, starlight, murmurs) to charge closure, lifting the score into mid-6s.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is unlocking the prism to release suppressed voices, signaled early. One tightening: the final thread resists, she synchronizes breath and whispers "I remember you," the knot dissolves. Agency reads as endurance (working slowly) rather than a decision that forecloses an option; no live alternative is rejected. Escalation is modest—threads snap one by one without raising cost or complication. The release of echoes lands as thematic payoff but without visible consequence that alters her stance or options post-spill.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Theme (voice versus enforced silence, defiance of conformity) emerges from the prism task and echo imagery. The final line "keeper of the defiant hum" offers a non-literal answer without overt moral, and the "harvest of echoes" metaphor recurs with shifted weight. However, the piece leans on prompt-language abstractions ("lullaby of conformity," "bodily poetic grace") that read as thematic announcement rather than discovery through particulars. Subtext operates in gesture (breath, thread-tracing) but interiority often names the theme directly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Single POV, third-person limited with elevated diction ("benedictions," "archaeology," "vista"). Perceptual signature is consistent but not character-specific—syntax and lexicon remain lush throughout without modulation under pressure. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping. The register ("alarming serenity," "bodily poetic") drifts toward lyric abstraction that clashes with the tactile thread-work, especially in peak beats ("furnace of her refusal"). Psychic distance is stable; no dialogue to test voice distinction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Figurative density is high across most sentences without pattern-teaching: "breath curling like script," "chandelier of frozen tears," "threads coiled like sleeping serpents," "furnace of her refusal," "bodily poetic grace turning labor into liturgy." Mixed metaphors appear ("bodily poetic map," "mantle" of serenity, "braided into fabric"). Template-cadence runs in the thread-sequence ("A thread snapped… Another thread yielded…"). Stock phrases: "alarming serenity was her mantle," "vista," "homecoming." Paraphrase loops: "not with force, but with patience, not with haste, but with rhythm" recycles structure. Deductions: density −0.7, mixed metaphors −0.5, template cadence −0.4, stock phrases −0.3 = baseline ~4.6; artifacts touch closure paragraph ("braided into the fabric") preventing 9+ eligibility globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The harvest-of-echoes premise and prism-sanctuary frame offer a lyric-fantasy synthesis, but the emotional arc (solitary defiance → voice unlocked) follows a familiar empowerment template without a non-obvious turn. The courtesan's chastity and poetic identity are stated traits that do not twist expectation or complicate the unlock action. Specific images (silver courtyard, thread-knots, murmurs as texture) provide texture, yet the transformation test suggests swapping names and metaphors would leave the arc unchanged. Proximity check: "bodily poetic," "alarming serenity," "liminal breath" read as coined abstractions rather than earned particulars.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Character present throughout. Early signal via backstory and courtyard stance. Development: she works the threads mid-story. Closure: she steps back, identified as "keeper of the defiant hum." Gates: all three. However, her choices are process actions (tracing, whispering) without competing options or visible cost; removing "chaste courtesan" and substituting "solitary scholar" would not alter beats. Beat involvement: three touches but no causal pressure. Guidance: setup +0.3, three beats +1.4, closure mention +0.3, swappability −0.8, ornamental chastity label −0.3 → ~4.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Object present early (paragraph 3), reappears at mid-story (threads), and at closure (prism dims, emptied). Gates: all three. Development: threads constrain the unlock method. Closure: prism flares then empties, structuring the release. Causal pressure: moderate—threads must be untangled for the harvest to occur. Specificity: prism's facets and suspended form matter. Guidance: setup +0.5, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +0.8, closure linkage +1.0, specificity +0.5 = ~6.8; rounded down. Static mention in final paragraph slightly lowers closure credit.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Concept signaled paragraph 4 ("harvest of echoes"). Development: echoes described as "residue," "spectral seed." Closure: echoes spill outward as murmurs and texture. Gates: setup, payoff; middle development is thin (echoes are goal, not complication). The concept shapes the dominant stake but does not narrow options mid-story. Cost is asserted (world tried to silence) but not felt on the page. Guidance: setup +0.4, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.8, causal pressure (light) +0.4, ornamental middle −0.5, cost indirect −0.3 → ~5.1.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Attribute mentioned three times: paragraph 2 ("bodily poetic map"), paragraph 12 ("bodily poetic grace"), implied in final third. Gates: setup, weak closure mention; no middle development action. Label-only: never constrains a choice or enables a tactic with visible cost. The phrase decorates but does not alter her thread-work. Guidance: setup +0.3, two mentions +0.4, label-only −0.8, no causal work −0.5, summary-only −0.3 → ~2.8.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Action signaled early (paragraph 4, "to unlock") and executed mid-story through final beat. Development: she works threads to unlock. Closure: prism unlocked, echoes released. Gates: all three. Causal centrality: the action is the story's spine; swapping "unlock" for "open" would require only minor edits, limiting irreplaceability. Cost: knot dissolves after she whispers, but the dissolution feels granted rather than fought. Guidance: setup +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +1.2, swappability −0.6, cost granted −0.4 → ~7.3.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Method signaled paragraph 10 ("untangle threads—not with force, but with patience"). Development: she traces knots, threads snap and yield. Closure: final knot dissolves after she whispers. Gates: setup (late, ~40%), development, payoff. Mechanics matter: patience and rhythm are the explicit means. However, the method's specifics (how breath synchronizes, why "I remember you" works) remain abstract. Guidance: late setup (40%) −0.4, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +0.7, closure linkage +0.9, mechanics opaque −0.4 → ~6.0.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Setting present paragraph 1 and returns in final paragraphs. Gates: setup, payoff; middle development minimal. Snow and courtyard anchor mood but do not pressure choice—she could perform the same task indoors. Closure: courtyard "alive with murmurs," "glowed not from starlight, but from memory" reweights the space. Guidance: setup +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, postcard description (no choice constraint) −0.7, lyric reprise +0.3 → ~5.7.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>1.9</grade><comment>Timeframe named once (paragraph 4, "between sigh and smile—the liminal breath when grief softens into resolve"). Gates: setup only; absent from middle and closure. No clock tightens decisions; the phrase remains metaphorical label. Guidance: setup +0.3, one mention +0.4, ornamental −0.6, no causal pressure −0.5, missing development cap 3.4 applied, missing closure cap 2.8 applied → lowest cap 2.8, further reduced by ornamental use → ~1.9.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Motivation stated early (paragraph 7-8, defiance of Court's conformity lullaby). Development: her refusal "stitched into every step," "armor woven from solitude." Closure: she returns echoes "to shatter the lullaby." Gates: all three. However, motivation is told rather than dramatized through a choice with competing cost; no scene shows her weighing conformity against defiance. Guidance: setup +0.5, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +0.9, told-only −0.8, no friction between wants −0.5 → ~5.5.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Tone labeled once (paragraph 15, "Alarming serenity was her mantle now"). Gates: middle mention, weak closure presence. The prose maintains elevated calm throughout without modulation—no alarm surfaces in syntax or image during peak beats. Final image ("smiled—not the smile of triumph, but of homecoming") sustains serenity but the "alarming" charge is absent. Guidance: setup missing −0.5, one mention +0.4, static mood −0.6, label-only −0.4, closure linkage weak +0.2 → ~4.7; missing setup cap 4.6 applied → 4.6, rounded to 4.7 band.</comment>
