<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elira's motivation to find "the place where explanations fail" is established early and drives her descent, but her interiority relies heavily on abstract philosophical framing rather than embodied contradiction. The choice to leave the compass and step into the passage forecloses return, providing visible cost, yet the decision feels more like confirming a pre-existing stance than wrestling with contradictory impulses in the moment. Embodied emotion appears ("gasped, pulling back as if burned, yet smiling") but is overwhelmed by label-heavy philosophical narration ("sensibly eccentric soul finally aligned"). The psychometry sequence offers concrete sensory detail, but Riel's terror and awe arrive as summary rather than lived pressure that Elira must navigate.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story establishes a clear Accumulative/Textural lens: Elira descends, performs psychometry, reads the journal, and walks deeper—each beat layering scent, silence, and mineral memory to reweight her understanding of belonging. Orientation anchors (factory, fissure, lagoon, passage) arrive promptly and the closure image ("the stone sighed around her, sealing the way behind") offers Charged Poise with undeniable cost—she cannot return. However, the cost is more conceptual than viscerally felt on the page; the final image asserts alignment rather than dramatizing the friction of surrender, and the psychometry revelation arrives as exposition ("hinged awakenings began") rather than a causal turn that narrows options mid-scene.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The subterranean lagoon, limestone cliffs, and calcite curtains ground the piece with vivid, POV-filtered sensory detail ("iron, salt, and something older, like the first sigh after creation"). Spatial choreography is clear across descent, water's edge, niche, and passage. The petrichor itself—distilled memory, breath of earth—recurs with escalating charge and directly shapes the final choice to enter the warm passage, meeting the 9+ gate for Q3. Minor deduction: some descriptions ("indifferent rock," "ozone tang of unseen waterfalls") tilt toward generic placeholders rather than character-specific perception.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding the place where explanations fail—is signaled in the opening and pursued through descent, psychometry, and journal discovery. The psychometry scene provides one meaningful tightening (Riel's compass pointed toward "moments of surrender"), and Elira's decision to leave the compass and enter the passage narrows options with visible cost. However, escalation is largely additive rather than driven by protagonist agency under pressure; obstacles do not materially resist her, and the turn from search to homecoming feels pre-ordained rather than earned through a choice that forecloses a live alternative.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: petrichor as memory, the compass pointing toward surrender, Riel's journal fused to rock, and the passage sealing behind Elira. The piece resists overt moralizing and the final image ("the stone sighed around her, sealing the way behind") offers a resonant answer without stating a thesis. The concept of "hinged awakenings" and the motif of scent/silence reweight across beats. Minor penalty: "sensibly eccentric soul finally aligned with a world that asked no questions" in the penultimate paragraph edges toward thematic summary rather than letting the image speak alone.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The prose carries a distinct, elevated register ("petrichor collector, sensibly eccentric by trade and temperament") with consistent POV distance and purposeful compression. Elira's perceptual signature favors scent, mineral texture, and silence. However, the voice occasionally drifts into abstract philosophizing ("the place where explanations fail, where logic dissolves like sugar in rain") that feels authorial rather than anchored in Elira's lived idiom under pressure. The psychometry sequence sustains clean focalization, but phrases like "hinged awakenings began" and "rewrote her sense of scale" read as meta-commentary rather than immediate perception.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and sensory detail is dense, but overwriting pervades high-pressure beats: "petrichor collector, sensibly eccentric by trade and temperament," "inverted constellations, stars that moved to the rhythm of subterranean tides," and "a silence so complete it vibrated in her molars." The opening and psychometry passages stack figurative language without pausing for clarity, triggering the density penalty. Paraphrase loops appear: "The petrichor here wasn't passive; it clung to her skin, whispered through her pores, rewrote her sense of scale" restates the same concept three ways without added pressure. Template cadence: "She dipped… tasted… understood…" across sequential lines. Combined artifacts justify −0.9 in Q7, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The premise—petrichor collector performing psychometry on a lost expedition compass in a subterranean lagoon—synthesizes disparate elements into a specific, memorable frame. The transformation of Riel's team from victims to willing fossils and the compass pointing toward surrender rather than north offer fresh angles on the descent/discovery template. However, the emotional arc (outsider finds belonging in a mysterious underworld) follows a familiar trajectory without an unexpected moral calculus or turn that challenges the reader's expectation, and the resolution (Elira joins Riel's team in stasis) confirms the premise rather than complicating it.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elira is present throughout and her choice to descend, perform psychometry, leave the compass, and enter the passage drives the sequence. She appears in setup, middle, and closure. However, her decisions confirm a pre-existing stance rather than wrestling with conflicting options under pressure; the petrichor collector role feels more label than lived constraint. Causal pressure and closure linkage are present but lean on summary ("She understood now") rather than dramatized friction. Two gates met (setup, closure), but development is observational rather than forcing a choice with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The compass is introduced in the opening, used in the psychometry ritual at the lagoon, and left as an offering on a limestone shelf near the end—three distinct beats. Its mechanics (spinning lazily, pointing toward moments of surrender rather than north) provide specific, irreplaceable detail that shapes Elira's understanding. It directly informs the thematic turn and is handled on the page. However, it does not constrain a choice with visible cost; Elira reads it and then leaves it, but the leaving does not alter her tactics or foreclose an option—she was already committed to the descent.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Hinged awakenings" is introduced at the psychometry beat ("the hinged awakenings began—not all at once, but in sequence, like doors in a long corridor") and shapes the middle revelation, but it functions more as thematic label than a mechanism that constrains choice or alters tactics. It does not recur in the closure image or demonstrably reweight the final decision. Present in setup and middle, but ornamental at closure; the concept could be replaced with "revelations" or "visions" without breaking story logic.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Sensibly eccentric" appears in the opening as a descriptor ("petrichor collector, sensibly eccentric by trade and temperament") and is echoed in the penultimate paragraph ("her sensibly eccentric soul finally aligned"), but it never constrains or enables an on-page action with cost. The trait is label-only; we do not see how being "sensibly eccentric" forces a tradeoff or shapes a choice differently than another personality would. Mentioned in setup and closure, but purely ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Delve" is central: Elira's descent through the fissure, her psychometry dive into the compass's history, and her final walk deeper into the cavern all constitute delving. It frames the entire arc and appears in setup, middle, and closure. The verb is invoked explicitly ("she had delved, she had read, she had awakened") near the end. However, "delve" as a concept is broad enough that swapping it for "descend" or "explore" would not break story logic; the specificity comes from the layered subterranean setting rather than the action verb itself.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Psychometry is signaled early (Elira withdraws brass dish, lagoon water, powdered shale, places compass atop) and executed in a sustained middle beat where she reads Riel's terror, awe, and realization. The method's mechanics matter: the ritual setup, the touch, the sequential revelations. It informs Elira's decision to continue and the understanding that Riel's team chose to stay. However, psychometry does not constrain her next move with cost—she could proceed without it—and the revelations are told rather than dramatized as friction that alters her tactics.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The subterranean lagoon beneath limestone cliffs anchors the entire middle sequence: it provides the water for the psychometry ritual, houses the fused journal, and offers the passage Elira enters at the end. The setting's specificity (black water reflecting nothing, stalactites, calcite curtains, warm exhaling passage) constrains her choices—she must descend, kneel at the water's edge, moisten the journal pages—and charges the final image when the stone seals behind her. Setup, development, and closure all hinge on the lagoon's physical and symbolic properties.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the factory shuts down at midnight" anchors the opening and establishes a nocturnal, liminal mood. However, the clock does not tighten decisions or tactics after that initial signal; time is untracked throughout the descent, psychometry, and final passage. The factory's closure provides thematic resonance (machines stilled, workers gone) in the penultimate paragraph but does not pressure the plot. Present in setup and thematic closure, but does not constrain middle action.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Elira's motivation "to find the place where explanations fail" is stated in the third paragraph, pursued through descent and psychometry, and fulfilled when she enters the passage that seals behind her. It drives the arc and is tested on the page. However, the motivation is abstract and faces little friction—no competing desire or cost that might pull her back—so the dramatization leans on confirmation rather than conflict. Setup, development, and closure all invoke the desire, but the lack of visible struggle between wanting and fearing caps the score.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Resonant hush" is established early ("silence, and sensation," "a silence so complete it vibrated in her molars") and sustained through the lagoon, psychometry, and final passage. Tone modulates subtly: the factory's dying breath gives way to mineral dampness, then the lagoon's patient drip, then the passage's warm exhalation. The final image ("the sound swallowed by the resonant hush," "the stone sighed") charges closure with the established tonal texture. Coherent across turns and integrated into the ending, but lacks a sharp tonal shift that would elevate it further.</comment>
