<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lira's dual allegiance is declared but remains conceptual; her motivation to "navigate gentrification without surrendering memory" feels thematic rather than lived through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The "orderly intuitive" trait is label-only—we're told she maps chaos into patterns, but the painting scenes show no on-page struggle or hierarchy of values with visible cost. The foundation stone chip warms and pulses, but this functions as atmospheric decoration rather than embodied emotion or a micro-choice that alters her present stance. Backstory about her prior work with developers is summarized ("she once designed zoning overlays") without anchoring in a present stimulus or tilting a present choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: murals bloom overnight, pressure builds through graffiti campaign, and the ending reconfigures the city's stance via collective action. Closure reads as Conceptual Repricing—privatization stalls, contracts unsigned, developers meet organized resistance—but the cost is diffuse and institutional rather than felt on Lira's body or choices. The before/after is legible (from pending privatization to postponement), yet the resolution arrives through collective off-page action ("hundreds gather," "their blueprints graffitied") rather than a decisive on-page choice by the protagonist that forecloses a path with visible personal price. Orientation anchors arrive late: who/where/when coalesce only after the opening paragraph's lyric catalogue.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The raft city is vivid and purposeful: "salt-stained wood and rusted railings," "trapeze platforms," "defunct carousel horse" constrain Lira's vantage and tactics. The foundation stone chip functions as micro-setting object, warming against her thigh and pulsing as she works, charging the final pocket moment. Sensory detail is selective and tied to POV priorities (cotton candy stalls aligned with wind, fortune tellers near exits). The carnival setting shapes the graffiti campaign's spatial logic and the community's hidden meeting coordinates, meeting the 9+ gate of environment constraining choice and charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—resist privatization without losing the carnival's memory—is signaled early. Pressure accumulates through the graffiti campaign (murals, color-coded warnings, redirected foot traffic), and one meaningful deepening occurs when corporate scouts arrive blind to the hidden resistance network. However, escalation is driven by Lira's off-page reorganization rather than on-page reversals that narrow options; the climax (dawn gathering, unsigned contracts) happens collectively and is summarized rather than dramatized with a visible personal cost. Agency is present but diffuse: Lira paints and plans, yet the peak choice—refusing to show at City Hall, climbing the tower to paint the final mural—feels like a confirmation of prior resolve rather than a trade-off that forecloses a competing path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete acts—graffiti as salvage, reorganization versus sabotage, joy resisting zoning—without overt statement. The foundation stone chip and recurring carnival imagery (clown holding lease, phoenix from popcorn cart, compass rose of tickets) accumulate symbolic weight. The final mural ("map of the raft city…as it remembers itself: unowned, ungoverned, unbroken") offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of how memory survives gentrification. Yet the thematic lens remains slightly abstract: "hopeful desperation" is named rather than fully embodied in contradictory on-page choices, and the climax's collective action dilutes the protagonist's internal arc inextricability from the thematic question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Voice is lyric and compressed, with purposeful patterned syntax ("one half pledged…the other to," "Not with petitions or protests, but through"). POV distance is stable omniscient-close, filtering through Lira's perceptual bias (mapping chaos, orderliness ensuring glyphs align with moon phases). However, register drifts into elevated diction at peak beats: "collective longing," "salvage," "consensus reality" phrases that feel writerly rather than character-particular. Interiority leans toward summary and label ("Her dual allegiance splits her heart," "hopeful desperation fuels her nights") instead of showing thought degrade or contradict under pressure. No dialogue is present to evaluate. Psychic distance remains controlled, but the narrator occasionally offers certainty beyond Lira's plausible knowledge (e.g., developers' "blindness," collective whispers across the city).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Prose is imagistic and rhythmically controlled in the opening third: "neon lights flickering like tired fireflies," "contracts slither through alleyways like eels." Figurative density eases in the middle beats where action dominates. However, paraphrase loops appear: the dual allegiance concept is restated across three paragraphs without added pressure, and "reorganization isn't sabotage—it's salvage" followed by a list of reorganization tactics feels like synonym churn. Template cadence emerges in the climax: "Privatization stalls. / Not defeated—postponed. / Lira smiles…" reads as rhythmic but mechanical fragments. The phoenix-from-kernels image and "THIS FLOATS TOGETHER" banner vivify the ending, yet the final two paragraphs summarize rather than propel, diluting momentum into thematic recap.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The synthesis—culture-shock-absorber protagonist using graffiti to resist gentrification on a floating carnival—is specific and purposeful. The foundation stone chip and murals as covert communication offer fresh tactical texture. However, the emotional arc (insider turned resistance artist) and the story's moral stance (community memory versus corporate development) follow a familiar activist-narrative template without a non-obvious inflection or trade-off. The ending's collective mobilization and postponed privatization feel earned in hindsight but lack the bold risk or irreversible consequence that would elevate originality into the high band. Transformation is present but moderate: the carnival setting particularizes the premise without fundamentally reweighting familiar gentrification-resistance dynamics.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Lira is named as "culture shock absorber" in the opening line, but the trait functions thematically rather than causally. She walks, observes, paints, and reorganizes, yet the "shock absorber" role—mediating between old and new, translating cultural friction—is told rather than shown in on-page choices with visible cost. The dual allegiance is setup but never forces a trade-off where she must choose carnival over developers or vice versa in a beat that alters tactics. She appears in setup, middle (painting murals), and ending (final mural, pocketing stone chip), meeting the three-gate test. However, the character attribute shapes atmosphere more than it constrains decision, capping the score in the functional-but-replaceable band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Foundation stone chip is introduced early (first third: "carries a foundation stone chip in her left pocket"), handled in the middle ("warms against her thigh as she works, pulsing faintly"), and returned at closure ("pocketing the stone chip"). The object signals the city's "stubborn will to stay unowned" and charges Lira's agency with a mystic anchor. Yet its causal role is passive: it warms and pulses as approval/warning but does not constrain a choice or enable a tactic—Lira's painting and reorganization proceed identically with or without it. The reprise at the end ("pocketing the stone chip, already planning her next mural") reweights continuity but not consequence. Three gates met, lyric resonance present, but no visible cost or decision tied to the object itself.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Dual allegiance is declared in the setup ("one half pledged to the carnival's anarchic spirit, the other to the quiet architects") and restated when Lira recalls designing zoning overlays for the firm now pricing out neighbors. It surfaces again at the carousel horse observation: "her dual allegiance aching." However, the concept remains label-only; no on-page beat shows Lira torn between competing loyalties in a way that narrows options or alters tactics. She never acts on behalf of the developers or wrestles with a choice to betray either side. The internal conflict is asserted but not dramatized, and by the ending the allegiance to carnival has won without visible friction or cost, making the dual element ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Orderly intuitive" is named in the opening ("her orderly intuitive mind mapping chaos into patterns") and illustrated with examples (cotton candy stalls aligned with wind, fortune tellers near exits, acrobats timed to eviction notices). The trait reappears when "her intuition guiding brushstrokes…her orderliness ensuring every glyph aligns with moon phases and market days." Yet these are told summaries rather than on-page actions where orderliness constrains or intuition enables with a trade-off. No beat shows her orderliness backfiring (missing a spontaneous opportunity) or her intuition clashing with a need for explicit planning. The attribute colors description but does not drive a decision with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Reorganize" is the structural spine: Lira "reorganizes" rather than shouts or strikes, redirects foot traffic, camouflages rent hikes with optical illusions, turns "For Lease" signs into collaborative murals, and the climax gathers the community to "reorganize the space block by block." Setup is early (first third), the action governs the middle graffiti campaign beats, and the ending directly names it ("hundreds gather…singing…as they reorganize"). The method is specific and shapes tactics—hidden messages, redirected attention, camouflaged prices—with visible results (unsigned contracts, counter-proposals, glitter-drowned models). Removing "reorganize" and replacing with generic "resist" or "protest" would flatten the tactical texture and thematic contrast (reorganization vs. sabotage). The action meets three gates and drives at least two beats with causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Graffiti art is signaled early ("messages encoded in graffiti art—murals that bloom overnight") and detailed in the middle with specific examples: clown holding lease, Ferris wheel morphing into logo, mermaid weeping "REMEMBER," phoenix from popcorn cart, arrows pointing to hidden kitchens, color-coded warnings. The method shapes Lira's nightly work and enables the covert communication network ("only locals can decipher"). At closure, the final mural is "visible from every pier" and developers find "their blueprints graffitied with counter-proposals." The means is irreplaceable—switching to pamphlets or speeches would remove the visual, covert, and locale-specific tactics. Three gates met, two distinct beats involved (middle campaign, final tower mural), causal pressure and specificity present, and closure linkage strong.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The raft city carnival is introduced in the opening line and textured throughout: "neon lights…over salt-stained wood and rusted railings," "trapeze platforms," "Midway Promenade," "defunct carousel horse," "tilt-a-whirl tower." The setting constrains choices—Lira climbs the highest tower for visibility, hides meetings under trapeze platforms, uses carnival imagery (clown, Ferris wheel, popcorn cart) as graffiti vocabulary. The floating, unowned nature pressures the privatization threat and fuels the "city's submerged roots" motif. At closure, the setting supplies the final mural's vantage and the communal gathering space. The carnival afloat is essential: transplanting the story to a landlocked neighborhood would lose the founding mythos (First Floaters, keel-beam), the tactile raft-pontoon fragility, and the symbolic floating-as-freedom core. Three gates, strong causal and closure linkage, high irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Before privatization" is setup context ("Before privatization, the raft city belonged to no one and everyone; now, contracts slither") and frames the dominant stake. The timeframe surfaces again when "the final contract is due" signals urgency. However, no on-page clock tightens Lira's tactics—days, weeks, or months are unspecified, and the deadline arrives as narrative fiat rather than a tracked countdown that alters moves. The "before" anchors theme (memory of unowned past versus incoming control) but does not constrain a middle choice or visibly shape the ending's timing. Setup and thematic presence qualify, yet causal pressure from the timeframe itself is minimal; the story would function nearly unchanged if privatization were imminent next year rather than this month.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Motivation is declared early: "to navigate gentrification without surrendering memory, to bend the incoming tide…so that the old magic doesn't drown." The desire fuels Lira's graffiti campaign and reorganization tactics across the middle, and the ending tests it (privatization stalls, memory preserved). However, the motivation is stated more than dramatized—no on-page beat shows Lira tempted to surrender, negotiate away a cherished element for strategic gain, or face a trade-off between memory and survival. The want is consistent and drives action, yet lacks internal friction or competing cost that would elevate it beyond functional necessity. Three gates met, beat involvement clear, but the absence of contradictory impulses or visible sacrifice caps the score.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Hopeful desperation" is named explicitly ("Hopeful desperation fuels her nights: the kind that laughs through tears, that dances while packing boxes") and woven into imagery: "tired fireflies," "creak of strained pontoons," "laughter masks," the phoenix rising from kernels, the climax's singing while reorganizing. The tone is coherent across beats and modulates appropriately—lyric and elegiac in setup, tactile and urgent in the graffiti middle, celebratory yet wary at closure ("postponed," not "defeated"). The final image (compass rose pointing "not north, but home," city breathing "salt and sugar") charges the tone with sensory and conceptual weight. However, the label appears mid-text as authorial diagnosis rather than emerging solely from scene pressure, and the tone occasionally tips toward declarative hope (community mobilization, glitter banners) that softens the desperation's edge. Strong coherence and closure charge, with minor drift into overt naming.</comment>
