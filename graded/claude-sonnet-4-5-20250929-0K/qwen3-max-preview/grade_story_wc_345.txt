<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elira lacks embodied interiority—her ghost status becomes an excuse for generic "strangely trustworthy" labels without internal contradiction or struggle. The settlers (Kael, Liora) are sketched with occupation tags but make no micro-choices under pressure; their acceptance of Elira's plan arrives pre-decided. The final moment ("her purpose fulfilled not in arrival, but in the walking together") reads as thesis statement rather than earned change with visible cost. Motivation remains abstract orchestration without on-page friction or foreclosed paths.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (Virelune, floating arches, Elira) arrive early and remain stable. The dominant stake—reaching the nebula sanctuary—is signaled but never tested; the bell-ringing succeeds immediately with no reversal, and the nebula "shimmers into view" on cue without obstacle or price. The closure unit is a Conceptual Repricing attempt (the collective effort as bridge), but cost is asserted in theme language ("hope was brambled but blooming") rather than dramatized through a forfeited option or visible sacrifice. Under a Causal lens, the lack of because/therefore linkage between chalk messages and community readiness, and the absence of escalation or tightening, keeps this functional but unearned.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The orchard planet, floating arches, and Glass Canopy are vividly rendered with specificity (petrified root-veins glowing violet, crystallized pollen dome). Spatial choreography remains clear across beats. The butterfly garden watering bell functions as micro-setting and its mechanics (summoning memory of water, coaxing dew) constrain one choice (Kael lifting and ringing it). The environment does not evolve under pressure or shape multiple tactics, capping the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake (reaching the nebula) is declared but never pressured; no on-page obstacle, failed attempt, or tightening narrows options. The bell succeeds on first use, the nebula appears as if summoned by unity alone, and no character pays a visible price or forfeits an alternative. Escalation is absent—chalk messages appear, settlers gather, bell rings, nebula responds—resulting in outline sequencing without reversal or deepening. Agency is minimal; Elira orchestrates off-page, and the settlers comply without dramatized conflict or trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The theme of collective effort and earned sanctuary emerges from events, but the final paragraph over-articulates it ("her purpose fulfilled not in arrival, but in the walking together"). The bell and butterflies accrue some resonance across beats, yet the nebula as thematic anchor is told-concept rather than embodied cost. The closing image (nebula as lullaby, "bridge" not end) gestures at complexity but lacks the non-literal reweighting required for higher scores; it reads as prompt-language echo rather than fresh synthesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited on Elira maintains stable distance with some perceptual signature ("whispers didn't echo; they rooted"). Register drifts into elevated diction ("brambled but blooming," "catalysis," "respite drifting just beyond") that clashes with the ghost's barefoot intimacy. Dialogue is minimal (Kael and Liora exchange one brief, serviceable line) but naturalistic. No head-hopping; focalization is controlled. Compression and lyricism are purposeful but occasionally obscure causality (why the bell now?), and the final paragraph's thesis-speak undermines voice consistency under peak pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Figurative language is dense throughout ("floating rock arches," "sky-eels," "brambled hope") without pattern-teaching or consistent payoff, triggering overwriting penalties. Paraphrase loops appear: "She didn't command; she reminded" followed immediately by "Of who they'd been. Of who they could be." Template cadence runs in the final paragraph ("not control, but catalysis. Not salvation delivered, but summoned"). Mixed metaphors: "hope was brambled but blooming" strains coherence. Clarity remains functional; propulsion is sluggish due to synonym churn and scaffold sentences that restate rather than advance.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The altruistic-ghost-orchestrator and sanctuary-journey premises are familiar; the story transforms them minimally through world detail (floating arches, butterfly bell) but not through character choice or non-obvious moral calculus. The chalk-message method and bell mechanics offer specificity, yet the emotional arc (strangers-to-family, hope-through-unity) follows a template without fresh inflection or risk. The nebula arrival feels inevitable by design rather than earned surprise. No bold structural or perspectival choices heighten stakes; the ending delivers expected validation rather than reweighting.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Elira (altruistic ghost) is present across all beats (setup, middle orchestration, ending) and drives the chalk-message plan. However, her choices are off-page or preparatory (cleaning the bell, writing chalk); on-page she observes and nudges without visible decision-under-pressure. The attribute "strangely trustworthy" does more causal work than Elira's ghost status. Swappable: a living organizer with charisma could fulfill the same role with minor edits. No specific cost tied to her ghostliness appears on the page.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The butterfly garden watering bell is signaled in paragraph three (buried, cleaned by Elira), used in the climax (Kael rings it, butterflies swirl, nebula appears), and its mechanics (summoning memory of water, coaxing dew) are specific. It participates in two beats: discovery/cleaning and the ringing. Causal linkage is weak—why this bell now, and could another signal suffice?—but it is present in the closure image (the final note fading as the nebula shimmers). Irreplaceability is moderate; the bell's unique properties matter but are not tested by failure or constraint.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The nebula of respite is introduced early (paragraph one), frames the dominant stake (reaching sanctuary), and appears in the closure image (pulsing, promising rest as bridge). It shapes one choice: the collective gathering to ring the bell. However, it remains abstract wish-object rather than tactical pressure; no cost or obstacle tied to the nebula itself is dramatized. The concept reweights from distant hope to proximate bridge, but that shift is asserted thematically rather than enacted through character trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Strangely trustworthy" is invoked three times (paragraphs one, four, ending) but remains label-only; no on-page moment shows Elira earning or exploiting trust under pressure, nor does the attribute constrain or enable a choice with visible cost. Kael and Liora's acceptance is pre-decided ("She's always right"). The trait could be swapped for "quietly persuasive" or "magnetically calm" without structural change. No tradeoff or friction tied to trustworthiness appears.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Reexamine" is invoked once in paragraph one ("the time had come to reexamine their survival") and again obliquely in the closing paragraph. It does not drive a major turn; the action is preparatory framing rather than on-page pivot. The settlers do not reexamine on the page—they gather and comply. Swappable: "rally," "redirect," or "reimagine" could replace it with no plot impact. No cost or constraint tied to the act of reexamining is dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Messages chalked onto deserted sidewalks appear in paragraph two, are signaled as Elira's chosen method, and recur when Kael and Liora discover them (paragraph four). The mechanics (silver chalk on petrified root-veins, looping script, cryptic content) are specific. The method enables one beat: the settlers' notice and decision to gather. However, it does not shape attempts or constrain tactics—no failed message, misread instruction, or resistance tied to the medium appears. The messages fade by noon (final paragraph) but this detail is ornamental; removal would not break closure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The orchard planet with floating rock arches is established in paragraph one, the Glass Canopy dome in paragraph three, and both recur in the climax and closing. The arches supply the seventh arch as spatial goal and "trembled...in anticipation" at the end. The orchard's thinning roots motivate departure. Setting participates in three beats: initial framing, bell location, and the final crossing. Causal pressure is moderate—arches and canopy provide access and ritual space but do not constrain choice or force adaptation. Micro-setting (the bell in the dome) matters more than planetary scale.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"After strangers had become family" is invoked in paragraph one as timeframe context and echoed in the closing line ("no longer strangers...family"). The timeframe does not tighten tactics or create live urgency—no clock, deadline, or temporal constraint pressures the bell-ringing decision. The past-to-present shift (strangers→family) functions as thematic claim rather than on-page escalation driver. Swappable: "after exile ended" or "once trust was earned" could replace it without plot impact.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Elira's desire to orchestrate collective effort is declared in paragraph one ("demanded orchestration"), enacted through chalk messages (paragraph two), and fulfilled in the gathering and bell-ringing (paragraphs five-six). The motivation drives two beats: the method choice and the climax assembly. However, no friction between orchestration and autonomy, or cost of manipulation versus trust, is dramatized. The motivation is told and demonstrated but not conflicted; Elira's purpose is singular and unchallenged. The final paragraph asserts success ("her orchestration") without visible trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Brambled hope is invoked explicitly in the closing sentence and implied through the orchard's "fraying roots" (paragraph one) and the "beautiful and terrifying" unknown (closing). Tone modulates from melancholy framing to cautious gathering to affirmed departure, coherent across beats. However, the tone is stated rather than charged through image and cost—"brambled but blooming" reads as label rather than felt texture. The final image (nebula pulsing, orchard sighing in pride) tilts toward clean uplift, undercutting the brambled friction the phrase promises.</comment>
