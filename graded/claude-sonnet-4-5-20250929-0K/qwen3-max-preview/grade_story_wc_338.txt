<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation is clear and well-anchored in childhood memory, establishing concrete emotional stakes. Interior experience shows specificity ("not gaps to be filled, but presences to be acknowledged"), though the actual choices on the page trend passive—she observes, interpolates, waits—without a moment where contradictory impulses force a visible tradeoff. The weeping at recognition and the yarrow-leaving gesture feel earned by prior causality, but the path to closure is contemplative rather than agonistic, limiting upper-band access.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece layers shadow-tracking across decades, building density until the final convergence where negative space becomes silhouette—a Resonant Reconfiguration (recognition) with felt cost (years of patient work, emotional release). Orientation anchors who/where/when clearly by paragraph three. One friction: the chapel's "reopening" via video comparison is told rather than dramatized in real-time pressure, slightly softening the escalation, but the closure image (doorway/nave/apse silhouette) reweights all prior material with undeniable pressure and cost is legible in her tears and the three-year journey.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The vault, henge, and torn map create a tactile micro-setting that constrains her method (kneeling on cold flagstone, aligning lens with map fracture) and charges the final image when dusk light reveals the shadow-chapel. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful: "arches wept condensation," "moss bloomed in impossible symmetry," "cold flagstone." The map's physical tear becomes both spatial anchor and conceptual threshold, satisfying the constraint-on-choice test for high-band entry.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: to witness and interpret the chapel's silent testimony. Pressure accumulates through the video-interpolation spiral, tightening from scattered clips to the spiraling shadow-path to the final convergence at dusk. Agency manifests as patient methodology and witness-stance rather than dramatic reversal, fitting the Accumulative lens. One cost is legible: three years spent tracing the cartographic wound, and the emotional release signals foreclosure of doubt. The escalation is deepening rather than confrontational, appropriate to the chosen lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: silence as vessel, not void; memory preserved through negative space; reverence encoded in landscape. The grandmother's villages-under-reservoirs backstory anchors the present obsession without stating a thesis. The final image—chapel breathing "invisibly, audibly, eternally"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. One friction: "whispered chapel, not gone, but folded" inches toward overt articulation, though it stays within the lyric register and doesn't collapse into sermon.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with consistent perceptual signature: she notices shadow, moss symmetry, air stirring without wind—filters appropriate to a methodical map-framer. Diction mostly holds ("cartographic wound," "occupied by silence"), though "shielded openness, heart unarmored yet guarded by awe" leans toward elevated abstraction that slightly exceeds the established register under peak emotion. Free indirect style is clean, and psychic distance modulates purposefully from close observation to lyric remove at closure. Rhythm supports the contemplative pressure without stalling.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Prose is rhythmically controlled and imagistically dense, with strong lines like "each droplet a metronome marking the slow collapse of memory into moss." One persistent pattern weakens clarity: stacked metaphoric constructions in adjacent sentences ("not void but vessel," "not brick or timber, but negative space," "not gone, but folded") create a template cadence that flattens propulsion in the final third (−0.6). Minor paraphrase loops appear ("the silence had been speaking all along" echoes earlier claims about silence as presence). Information density is high, but figurative saturation in peak beats slightly dulls immediacy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of cartography, video archaeology, and negative-space reverence feels specific and non-obvious; the spiral traced by shadow migration is a fresh inflection on lost-place narratives. Emotional calculus—witnessing rather than rebuilding, honoring silence rather than filling it—avoids the retrieval-quest template. The torn map as threshold and the henge-as-grammar conceit show ingenuity. One limiter: the lyric register and contemplative stakes might feel overly interior to some readers, but the piece commits fully to its premise and follows implications without retreat, earning solid upper-mid range.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Present throughout; her choice to align the lens, interpolate footage, and wait at dusk drives the middle and closure beats. Setup by paragraph four, development via the software interpolation, payoff when she witnesses the shadow-chapel. The choices are methodical observation rather than high-conflict decisions, but they narrow options (she "didn't need to rebuild it. She needed to witness it") and the yarrow gesture at closure is causally tied to her role. Two beats (interpolation, dusk vigil) plus closure participation, with specificity (map-framer methods) and cost (three years, emotional release) visible.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The henge appears early (paragraph five) and recurs in three beats: as sentinel aligned to the vanished chapel, as fixed point for video overlay, and at closure when dusk light strikes the central menhir to reveal the shadow-silhouette. It enables her method (alignment anchor) and charges the final image. Swappability is low—its stones' alignment to the chapel's absence is unique to this logic. Two-gate presence (setup, payoff) with purposeful middle use pushes it into mid-6s; no direct mid-scene constraint on a forced choice slightly limits upper range.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Setup by paragraph six ("whispered chapel"), developed through the shadow-choreography discovery, and paid off in the climactic silhouette: "arched doorway, narrow nave, apse curved like cupped hands." The concept shapes her stake (to witness, not rebuild) and alters her tactics (patient interpolation rather than excavation). Closure directly dramatizes the chapel's breathing presence, making it indispensable. High irreplaceability and cost connection (three-year trace, recognition tears) with strong causal pressure across all three gates.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Stated in paragraph two and visible in the video-interpolation method (systematic, patient), but never constrained by a cost—her curiosity enables discovery without a visible tradeoff or friction. No moment where methodical patience forecloses a faster, riskier option. Functional label consistent with behavior, but replaceable with "patient" or "systematic" without structural loss. One-gate (setup) with no development beat where the trait forces a choice under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The reopening action is introduced in paragraph seven and drives the middle (comparing footage, tracing shadow-path) to the closure (dusk revelation). It defines her method and stakes. Setup slightly late (~30% mark), but the action is causally active in two beats (interpolation, final witness) and irreplaceable—switching to excavation or archival research would break the negative-space logic. Cost is visible (three years) and closure ties directly to this method. Late signal (−0.3) and summary-initial presentation (−0.2) limit upper range, but strong causal work and closure linkage hold mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Introduced paragraph seven, detailed across paragraphs eight through thirteen (1953 film, 2019 drone, seventeen interpolated clips, software spiral-trace), and payoff when the method reveals the altar location and enables the dusk witness. The mechanics matter: shadow migration, alignment of stones as fixed points, spiral result. Two distinct beats (discovery, spiral-trace) plus closure setup, with high specificity (16mm vs. digital, temporal span). Late first mention (−0.3) but strong causal pressure and irreplaceability across middle and ending.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Present from the opening line, recurs as the physical location for her work (kneeling on flagstone, tripod setup, broken oculus admitting dusk light), and the vault's arches weeping condensation mirrors the theme. It supplies the conditions for the final revelation (dusk through oculus). Setup immediate, development via tactile details (cold flagstone, glistening frescoes), payoff when the vault "sighed behind her." The vault constrains her posture and frames the light-reveal, satisfying micro-setting criteria. Charges the closure image without dominating pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The map's torn edge appears early (paragraph four) as both physical object and conceptual threshold ("dividing known from unknown"). It recurs when she aligns her lens with the fracture (paragraph eighteen) and at closure as "map still torn" (final paragraph). The tear shapes her spatial method (alignment point) and charges the ending as invitation rather than boundary. Two beats with thematic reprise; no live time-clock pressure, but the spatial metaphor constrains her interpretive stance. Lyric-resonance allowance applies: early seed → final reprise reweights the stake.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Stated in paragraph two, dramatized through her patient video analysis and the choice to witness rather than rebuild (paragraphs twenty-four to twenty-six), and payoff in her weeping recognition and the studio plan to "offer: a doorway for others." The motivation avoids label-only mention by showing empathy-as-method (silence as vessel, not void) and is tested at closure when she decides not to prove but to offer. Friction between patient witnessing and the grandmother's haunted losses is visible. Three beats (setup, witness-choice, offering-plan) with cost legible in tears and three-year journey.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The phrase appears late (paragraph thirty), but the tone—guarded wonder, patient reverence—is established early and modulates through the piece: methodical curiosity → recognition awe → quiet offering. Diction choices ("wept condensation," "breath held then released," "glistening") sustain the tone through turns. The final image's hush ("invisibly, audibly, eternally") charges with the openness. Coherent through closure with purposeful modulation, though the explicit late label slightly undercuts organic emergence. Tone as container for the accumulative pressure, fitting the lens.</comment>
