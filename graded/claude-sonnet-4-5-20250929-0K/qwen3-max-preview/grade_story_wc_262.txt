<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The gazer's motivation is clear and her internal process is embodied through concrete actions (pressing film to forehead, trembling fingers). However, interiority occasionally drifts into abstraction ("she became the vessel for his grief") rather than staying grounded in contradictory impulses. The final choice to mail the letters is legible but arrives without meaningful internal resistance or cost—she decides and acts without dramatized friction. The recognition moment ("she, too, had written goodbye letters") provides parallel but doesn't complicate the present action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchors quickly (booth, rain, film strip). The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through layered discovery (film → napkin → letters) and the final image reweights "unused love" from stored to released. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the decision to mail the letters, transforming the premise from vault to motion. Cost is stated abstractly ("only carried, only set gently") rather than shown through a specific forfeiture or consequence that alters her options. The marquee message and "glitch or gift" moment borders on convenient validation rather than earned pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The projection booth is vividly rendered with specific textures (dusty velvet, ozone, rusted canister, oilcloth bundle). Spatial details constrain action: the hidden compartment under the projector's baseplate drives discovery, and the descent down the spiral staircase marks transition. The setting charges the final image through the theater's exhale ("walls lighter, shadows less burdened"). Sensory hierarchy reflects the gazer's priorities (touch dominates during psychometry, scent punctuates transitions).</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—finding where unused love is stored—is signaled early and pursued consistently. The sequence film → projectionist's napkin → letters provides accumulative deepening rather than reversal. However, escalation lacks meaningful resistance: each discovery yields to the next without friction, and the final choice (to mail the letters) encounters no obstacle or trade-off. The cost of carrying and releasing is asserted thematically but not dramatized through a specific loss or complication that narrows her options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars (film strip, letters, origami birds in a cedar box) rather than statement. The realization "unused love doesn't vanish—it incubates" is earned by the layered discoveries and anchored in the gazer's parallel grief. The final image ("lanterns on a river") offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question, reweighting storage as motion. Minor slip: "LOVE NEVER ENDS—ONLY CHANGES FORM" on the marquee edges toward overt statement, though framed as ambiguous ("glitch or gift").</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with a consistent perceptual signature: the gazer maps emotions spatially, notices sensory particulars tied to psychometry. Diction occasionally elevates beyond the immediate scene ("gathering density until someone spatially imaginative enough dares to hold it") in a way that feels narrated rather than focalized. The piece maintains clean distance and avoids head-hopping. Rhythm modulates with emotional intensity, tightening during the psychometry reading and slowing through the letter discoveries.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Figurative language is dense throughout ("loneliness pooling in corners of frames," "ache stitched into her ribs like a second skeleton," "lanterns on a river"). While often vivid, the frequency flattens momentum in non-peak beats—nearly every sentence carries metaphor or elevated diction without respite. Paraphrase appears: "unused love doesn't vanish—it incubates" is restated via "not in vaults, but in motion" two paragraphs later. Template cadence: several paragraphs open with "She [verb]" (She closed, She gasped, She saw, She read, She understood, She gathered, She rose, She descended, She smiled, She stepped). Information density is high but propulsion occasionally stalls under ornamental weight.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The premise—psychometry applied to film as emotional archive—offers a fresh angle on grief and memory. Execution is competent but the gazer's journey lacks meaningful complication: she seeks, she finds, she releases without obstacle or cost that tests her initial framing. The transformation from "storage" to "release" is conceptually satisfying but feels predetermined rather than earned through resistant particulars. The marquee message and the theater's exhale border on symbolic convenience, validating the protagonist's arc without friction.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The crystal gazer initiates psychometry, discovers the letters, and chooses to mail them. Her choices drive the accumulative structure, but the final decision (to release rather than keep) arrives without on-page resistance or trade-off. She is present across all beats and shapes the ending, but her role is more conduit than agent under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The film strip appears in the opening beat (traced, pressed to forehead during psychometry), triggers the vision of the woman and man, and returns in the penultimate beat when she replaces it in the canister with "Thank you." It seeds discovery but does not constrain later choices or reappear with reweighted meaning at closure—letters and the theater become the final image anchors.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Goodbye letters are discovered mid-story, read across multiple beats, and anchor the final decision to mail them. The concept shapes tactics (gathering, reading, deciding to release) and charges the thematic closure ("not in vaults, but in motion"). They are causally essential to the resolution and participate directly in the ending image as "rescued birds."</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Spatially imaginative" is named twice: once in exposition ("Her spatially imaginative mind let her map emotions like constellations") and once in reflection ("someone spatially imaginative enough dares to hold it"). The trait is asserted but not demonstrated through a specific on-page action where spatial thinking enables a discovery or constrains a choice. It remains label-only.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Incubate" appears three times: in the initial goal ("prepared to incubate the strip's hidden memories"), in the thematic realization ("unused love doesn't vanish—it incubates"), and implicitly in the final image of release. The concept frames the quest and the resolution, but the psychometry reading and letter discovery could function with "retrieve" or "awaken" as easily. It shapes theme more than tactics.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Psychometry reading is signaled early ("initiated the psychometry reading—not with incantation, but with breath"), drives the vision of the woman/man and the projectionist's farewell, and enables discovery of the hidden letters. The method is present across setup and middle beats and its mechanics (breath, film pressed to forehead, images flickering behind lids) matter to the unfolding. It does not constrain the final choice or charge the ending image directly.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The projection booth provides vivid atmosphere (dusty velvet couch, ozone smell, rusted canister, hidden compartment under projector's baseplate). The compartment enables the key discovery of letters, and the space's emotional residue (projectionist's grief) supplies narrative pressure. The booth does not constrain the final decision or appear in the ending image—descent and lobby mark transition away from it.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"While forgotten lyrics searched for tune" appears in one mid-story sentence as a lyric overlay and returns in the final beat ("forgotten lyrics at last found their tune in the rhythm of her boots"). The timeframe is metaphorical rather than tracked; it does not tighten decisions or create urgency. The reprise reweights the motif thematically but imposes no temporal cost.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The goal "to find where unused love is stored" is stated early, pursued through psychometry and letter discovery, and resolved when she understands storage as incubation and chooses release. The motivation drives all major beats. However, it is declared rather than dramatized through conflicting wants or friction between desire and cost—she seeks, finds, and acts without meaningful resistance.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Hushed thunder" appears three times: opening (rain "like hushed thunder"), late middle ("hushed thunder had passed"), and closing ("hushed thunder of a heart that dares to remember"). The tone is coherent—quiet intensity, reverent discovery—and modulates subtly as external storm softens while internal resonance deepens. It charges the final image but does not inflect peak pressure moments or constrain choices.</comment>
