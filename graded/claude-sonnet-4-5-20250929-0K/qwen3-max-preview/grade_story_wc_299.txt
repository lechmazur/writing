<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Jasper's interior life shows clear texture—cataloging as ritual defense, emotional calibration via the speaker cloth. The ex-girlfriend's label "confidently uncertain" and the transition to "Project Echo" demonstrate internal contradiction. However, key moments lean on therapy-speak ("hadn't let himself miss," "hadn't let himself") and the final shift feels slightly summarized rather than dramatically earned through micro-choices under immediate pressure. The progression is plausible but lacks one additional embodied micro-turn to fully anchor the cost of opening up again.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the story builds density through fragments (speaker cloth, harmonica, catalog ritual) and shifts cadence at "Project Echo," landing a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where Jasper's new stance crystallizes with felt cost—he abandons emotional insulation. Orientation is clean (quarry trailer, dusk walk). The cost is legible in the pocket placement and the final listening posture. One minor weakness: the "echo valley longing" meta-phrase risks over-articulating what the images already carry, nudging toward a stated theme rather than letting the final beat resonate alone.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The quarry setting and trailer furnishings (folding table, corkboard, grimy window) ground the scenes and reflect Jasper's isolation. The speaker cloth and harmonica function as micro-setting objects that constrain his attention and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and apt: "corrugated walls trembling," "valley's peculiar acoustics." The cloth placed in his breast pocket shifts from toolkit to heartbeat, a tactile choice that alters his stance at closure. The setting's acoustics ("wind humming through cuts in the rock") directly shape the ending's charged poise.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: discovering purpose after emotional shutdown. Pressure coheres through the accumulative lens—morning ritual, Ruiz's prodding, the cloth catching light—and tightens when Jasper types "Project Echo," a decision that forecloses his insulating habit with visible cost (vulnerability, uncertainty). The choice is protagonist-driven and narrows options. Minor limitation: the foreman's appearances feel slightly episodic rather than escalating; a second on-page complication would lift this into the 7.8+ range. Cost is legible but resides more in stance shift than immediate consequence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the speaker cloth's transformation—from relic of failure to tuning fork—and the line "What's broken still carries song" integrates without moralizing. The valley's acoustics and "echo valley longing" deepen the concept of resonance-without-source into a lived particular. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: Jasper learns to hear fragments rather than chase applause. The only friction: "confidently uncertain" and "echo valley longing" risk becoming thematic labels; they work but press close to over-articulation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV is stable, third-limited on Jasper, and perceptual bias is consistent (catalog numbers, thread count, tensile strength). Dialogue from Ruiz and Jasper is goal-driven and distinct. However, register occasionally drifts: "the shared delusion that art could outrun entropy" reads elevated for a roadie-turned-appraiser in peak reflection. The phrase "erosion—slow, inevitable, like wind scouring shale" is vivid but tonally smooth compared to his grease-stained, diesel-world. Filter-verb use is light. The final listening beat recovers voice coherence, but the mid-section reflection carries slight literary polish that distances the reader from Jasper's rougher-edged texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Information density is high and most lines serve character or atmosphere. Overwriting appears in stacked metaphors during reflection: "erosion," "wind scouring shale," "terraced scars," "sleeping giants" cluster without breathing room. The phrase "echo valley longing, he thought" is a label-loop that paraphrases what the setting already shows. Sentence openings vary and syntax supports rhythm, but the reflection block (~25% of text) leans on elevated diction ("vessel for resonance without source") that slightly flattens momentum. Clarity remains intact; no causality breaks. Minor template cadence in "He didn't... Hadn't let... Hadn't let" across adjacent lines.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The combination of roadie past, quarry appraisal work, and acoustic salvage ("Project Echo") feels specific and non-obvious. The speaker cloth as calibration tool rather than nostalgia object is a fresh angle. However, the core arc—finding purpose after public failure through reconnection to a former passion—is a familiar template. The story transforms it via the quarry acoustics and fragment-reconstruction frame, but the emotional beats (ritual defense, prodding mentor, pivotal artifact, quiet epiphany) follow recognizable contours. The execution is confident but does not take structural or perspectival risks that would push into higher originality bands.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Jasper as ex-roadie appraiser is present throughout, frames the stakes (emotional shutdown vs. reconnection), and his decision to type "Project Echo" is the story's hinge. His profession provides the lens (catalog ritual, technical appraisal) and the quarry supplies the acoustic closure. Setup early, drives two beats (cloth examination, laptop typing), and shapes the ending when he pins the cloth and listens. Causal pressure and closure linkage are strong; the choice narrows options with cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The speaker cloth appears in beat one (examination with tweezers), is reweighted when it catches light ("ghost of vibration"), moved to breast pocket (heartbeat not toolkit), and pinned to corkboard at closure with the line "What's broken still carries song." The object's acoustic transparency coefficient and mesh backing are specific, irreplaceable details. It is causally active in two beats and charges the final image. Cost is tied to Jasper's vulnerability. Strong integration; only minor gap is the harmonica's late introduction sharing closure space.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"After the applause" is signaled early (Milwaukee implosion, jeers) and shapes Jasper's defensive cataloging. It reappears in the cloth memory ("echo of chords that once shook arenas") and the final shift from "roar of crowds" to "quiet hum of connection." The concept drives the dominant stake (post-failure purpose) and alters tactics at closure (listening to fragments). However, it functions more as backstory frame than live on-page pressure; the applause itself is recounted, not dramatically tested. Solid thematic integration but middle development is summary-based.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Confidently uncertain" is introduced via the ex's label, repeated as acceptance ("That was okay"), and summarizes Jasper's method shift. It constrains his earlier cataloging (certainty via facts) and enables his final stance (embracing unknowing). The trait is label-heavy—stated three times—but the laptop scene and pocket placement embody the tradeoff: he acts without knowing the outcome. Mid-band because the cost is visible but the phrase risks thematic echo rather than dramatized friction. Lyric reprise lifts it slightly.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Wrest" appears twice: Jasper "wrested control of his emotions" mechanically, and the closing pivot is "to wrest meaning not from applause, but from absence." The verb characterizes his forceful, ungraceful method and contrasts his past (speaker stacks) with his present (meaning from fragments). It shapes the closure's conceptual repricing but does not drive a discrete on-page action—Jasper types, walks, listens; none of those verbs are "wresting" in real time. The word is more thematic motif than plot engine. Setup and payoff present; middle beat weak.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Emotional insulation via facts is signaled early (thread count, catalog ritual, "Facts insulated him") and mechanics are clear: reciting item numbers, avoiding the loupe when emotion surges, armor against camaraderie. The method is tested when the cloth catches light and Jasper holds it to his ear instead of measuring—cost is immediate, as he feels his throat tighten. The laptop scene and corkboard finale complete the arc: he abandons the insulating method. Present in three beats, drives the middle turn, and shapes closure. Strong causal pressure and specificity.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The quarry office trailer is established early (diesel smell, folding table, corrugated walls, grimy window) and supplies the isolation that enables Jasper's ritual. The valley acoustics ("wind humming through cuts in the rock") charge the final listening beat and reweight the "echo valley longing" frame. Ruiz's doorway appearances add pressure. The setting is more than backdrop—it constrains (no band, no crowds) and provides the acoustic resource Jasper needs at closure. Setup, middle use (window walk), and payoff (valley echoes) are all present. Solid integration; not indispensable but purposeful.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"After failing publicly" (Milwaukee, three years prior) frames the story and explains Jasper's defensive cataloging. The timeframe shapes his present stance (enough distance for ritual, not enough for healing) and the dusk walk marks the story's real-time pressure point—afternoon to evening. However, the three-year gap is static; no live clock tightens decisions within the scene. The temporal distance enables the story but does not escalate within it. Setup strong, middle and payoff are ambient. Lyric time-as-weight rather than ticking clock.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"To discover purpose after loss" is the story's engine: Jasper's cataloging is hollow ("didn't believe in value"), Ruiz prods ("appraising ghosts"), and the cloth triggers longing. The desire is tested when he types "Project Echo" (cost: vulnerability, uncertain outcome) and closes when he writes "What's broken still carries song" and begins listening. The motivation is dramatized in three beats, constrained by his insulating method, and the final choice forecloses his prior stance. Friction between want (connection) and fear (failure) is embodied. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Echo valley longing" is introduced as meta-phrase but grounded in the quarry acoustics, Jasper's isolation, and the speaker cloth's ghost vibrations. Tone modulates from defensive (catalog ritual) to tentative (cloth to ear) to open (final listening). The valley's "peculiar acoustics" and "wind humming" charge the final image. However, the phrase "echo valley longing, he thought" is slightly on-the-nose; the tone is mostly shown, then labeled. The final beat ("he listened") recovers resonance. Coherent and purposeful, with one thematic-label slip that nudges it below 7.5.</comment>
