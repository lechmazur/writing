<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The protagonist's "watchful dreamer" stance is established but her choices are largely internal recalibrations rather than high-stakes decisions that alter external options. The interiority leans heavily on poetic assertion—"She was becoming"—rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The viral confession backstory is referenced but never dramatized as a live wound that complicates her present sanctuary ritual. Her final decision to return with seeds is gentle but lacks a visible cost or foreclosed path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: moss-garden imagery and the thaw-pattern method accumulate density toward a reclamation stance. Orientation anchors appear by ~120 words (data center, post-confession timeframe). Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Earned Stasis with an intention to return—but the cost is implied rather than legibly dramatized; the act of placing the confession beneath moss is symbolic without a visible tactical or emotional forfeiture that changes her present options on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The moss-choked data center is vividly rendered with sensory detail (emerald moss underfoot, rusted console, broken skylights). The setting functions as a crucible for ritual but does not constrain a key choice—she moves freely, places objects, and leaves without spatial or environmental friction. The amber pendant and nectar dish are handled on the page, elevating micro-setting work. However, the environment remains a backdrop for reflection rather than a pressure that alters tactics or the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—reclaiming agency after public exposure—is signaled early. Pressure accumulates through layered imagery (moss, icicle patterns, pendant warmth) but lacks an on-page reversal or tightening that narrows options. The protagonist's choices (photographing thaw patterns, placing the confession under moss, planning to return) deepen her stance but do not foreclose a live alternative or impose a felt trade-off. The closure crystallizes intention without visible cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Theme of transformation-through-patience emerges from concrete particulars (thaw patterns, moss reclaiming circuitry, the folded confession). The amber pendant's recurrence anchors memory and resilience. However, the final lines edge toward stated thesis—"the method to her mending: not force, not speed, but the patient, quietly proactive tracing of beauty left by loss"—which over-articulates what the images already convey. The piece resists overt moralizing elsewhere but the ending leans explanatory.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Single-POV narration maintains a lyric, elevated register consistent with the protagonist's introspective stance. Perceptual signature is selective (moss texture, pendant warmth, wind-caught chime) and character-specific. Diction occasionally drifts into workshop idiom—"quietly proactive," "reclamation," "stitching from frayed threads"—that feels imposed rather than organically interior. No head-hopping; psychic distance is stable and purposeful.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Prose is rhythmically controlled with varied sentence structure and vivid imagery. However, figurative density is high throughout—"cathedral of decay," "honeyed hush," "stitching from frayed threads," "veil swallow the words"—without pattern-teaching or purposeful sparseness in peak beats, creating a steady lyric wash that flattens propulsion (−0.5). Paraphrase loops appear: "She didn't burn it. She placed it gently…" followed by "not to erase them, but to transform them" restates the same gesture (−0.2). Momentum drag accumulates across reflective blocks that do not alter present tactics.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The moss-garden-as-sanctuary and ritual-of-reclamation premise is recognizable from trauma-recovery and nature-reclamation templates. The icicle-thaw pattern as a healing metaphor is fresh in execution but does not transform the broader arc—swapping "drip patterns" for "root spirals" would leave the emotional logic intact. The protagonist's internal journey is specific and sincere but lacks a non-obvious inflection or risk that elevates the frame beyond familiar therapeutic catharsis.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The "watchful dreamer" is named early and her observation is sustained, but key choices (photographing thaw, placing the confession, planning return) are reflective rather than decisions that alter tactics under pressure. Setup and closure participation are present; middle development is weak as her stance deepens but does not pivot. Swappable with "wounded wanderer" with minor edits (−0.6). Present in two beats (study, placement) but no causal pressure narrows options (+0.4).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The amber pendant appears in three beats: opening touch, mid-scene pulsing warmth, and final sunbeam reprise. Setup, development, and closure all present (+1.0). However, it functions as a symbol of inherited resilience without constraining a choice or altering tactics; she wears it as a pact but it does not enable or foreclose action. Charged reprise at closure (+0.7) lifts it above ornamental, but swappable with any heirloom talisman (−0.5).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Honeyed hush" is named in paragraph four and echoed at closure ("honeyed glow") but functions as tonal descriptor rather than a concept that shapes stakes or tactics. It colors atmosphere without altering options. Setup and closure present but no middle development where it constrains a choice (−0.8). Lyric reprise reweights mood but not material pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Quietly proactive" is used once as a label in paragraph five and demonstrated in her ritual actions (placing nectar, folding confession). Setup present; middle development weak as the trait does not impose a visible trade-off or constraint; closure reflects ongoing stance but without cost tied to this trait. Functional but swappable with "deliberate" or "patient" (−0.6).</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Proffer" (offering nectar to spirits) appears once in the middle third without prior setup. It shapes one beat and reflects her ritual stance but is not causally linked to escalation or closure. Missing setup (−0.5). No closure participation beyond thematic echo (−0.7). Swappable with "place" or "leave" without structural loss (−0.6).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The icicle-thaw pattern is introduced in the middle third with backstory detail (photographing spirals, studying paths) and returns at closure as the articulated method of her mending. Setup weak (retrospective mention, −0.3). Development present as studied method (+0.4). Closure participation strong as it frames her healing philosophy (+1.2). However, the pattern is explained rather than enacted; she does not use it to solve a problem on the page, limiting causal pressure (−0.5).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The abandoned data center with moss overgrowth is anchored early, sustained across all beats, and provides spatial texture (toppled racks, rusted console, broken skylights). Setup, development, and closure all present (+1.0). The setting supplies resources (moss to place confession under, nectar dish placement) and charges the final image (+0.7). However, it does not impose friction or constrain her movement; she traverses freely without environmental pressure limiting options (−0.4).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"After the confession goes viral" is named in the opening but functions as backstory context rather than a live timeframe that tightens decisions. No clock pressure or urgency shapes her ritual. Setup present; middle and closure do not engage temporal stakes. Swappable with "after the breakup" or any past crisis marker (−0.7).</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The motivation to "graft new meaning onto old wounds" is stated early and demonstrated through her ritual actions (moss placement, pattern study, intention to return). Setup, development, and closure all present (+1.0). Closure linkage via her becoming stance (+0.7). However, the motivation is told more than dramatized in conflicted choice; no friction between competing wants or costs tests her commitment (−0.6).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Protected vulnerability" is coherent throughout—reverent silence, gentle actions, sanctuary language—and modulates subtly as dusk filters in at closure, charging the final image with amber warmth. Setup, development, and closure all present (+1.0). Tone elevates the ending's charge (+0.8). However, the tone remains static rather than dynamically tested by pressure; no tonal shift marks escalation or cost (−0.5).</comment>
