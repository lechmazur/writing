<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The Prophet's motivation ("turn obstacles into instruments") is stated early and shapes his actions, but his interiority remains abstract and declarative rather than embodied. Kael's wide-eyed observation and single strike provide a micro-choice, but the Prophet's euphoria at the climax is asserted rather than shown through contradictory impulses. The apprentice's fumble and catch feel mechanical rather than earned by prior characterization. No visible cost forecloses a path; the triumph is complete without sacrifice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land within the opening paragraph. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: density increases through layered musical imagery until the clouds dissolve into harmonic rain, offering a Resonant Reconfiguration. However, the cost remains conceptual and oblique—"the tide turned...inward" gestures at consequence without making a before/after choice legible. The Prophet's palm-press and Kael's mallet-strike are beats, but they do not narrow options or foreclose a path with felt price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The orchard afloat—driftwood, salt-drinking roots, gnarled trees—is vivid and purposeful, shaping the Prophet's percussion toolkit. The whalebone mallet, wave-xylophone, and fruit-as-drum provide tactile constraint. Spatial choreography (Prophet at the edge, Kael behind) remains clear. The blue-hour timeframe and blackening sea charge atmosphere, and the final translucent hum reweights the orchard's resonance, meeting the 9+ gate for setting participation at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—conducting a tide of sound to prevent/transform the fractal cloud threat—is signaled early. The sea darkening mid-performance provides one meaningful tightening, and the Prophet's pivot to the root-note hum shows agency. However, the escalation lacks a visible trade-off or cost; the orchard's fruit bursts and Kael's strike solve the problem without foreclosing an option. The clouds "stilled" and dissolved is presented as triumph without consequence, weakening closure pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme—obstacles as instruments, sound as transformative force—emerges organically from the orchard's salvaged history and the Prophet's conducting. The final image of the tide turning inward offers a non-literal answer without overt moralizing. Yet the climax lands as purely celebratory; no ambiguity or cost complicates the euphoric resolution. The piece resists false binaries but also avoids friction that would deepen thematic resonance. Subtext operates more in imagery than in character choice.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on the Prophet with brief Kael focalization clearly signaled. Voice carries a lyric, elevated register ("bled indigo," "fermata," "subsonic pulses") that is consistent and purposeful, though it risks uniformity under peak pressure. Dialogue is minimal and functional. The phrase "restless euphony" and "sketched resonance" feel more like thematic labels than POV-filtered perceptions. Filter verbs ("saw," "watched") appear but do not flatten immediacy. Perceptual signature is present but leans abstract.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout, with metaphor and synesthesia ("sound could be drawn like charcoal," "visible as a golden helix") nearly every sentence. While the pattern is taught early, peak beats layer vehicles without clarity gain: "emotional timbre," "resonant imprinting," "audible geometry" stack without grounding. Paraphrase appears: "not from wind, but from subsonic pulses" echoes "not with water, but with sound." Template stems recur: "The Prophet [verb]" across multiple beats. No loops touch closure directly, capping deduction at −0.8, but density and register drift lower the band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The premise—tide prophet conducting wave-xylophones and cloud-music on a floating orchard—offers a fresh synthesis of music, oceanic setting, and lyric resonance. The whalebone mallet, kelp-wax dub ledger, and fractal clouds are specific and committed. However, the emotional arc (confident mastery → euphoric success) follows a triumph template without subversion or moral calculus. The final transformation feels cosmically convenient rather than earned through character cost. Risk-taking in imagery does not extend to stakes or closure ambiguity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The Leeward Tide Prophet is present in every beat and his palm-press root-note hum at the darkening sea is a causal pivot. However, most action is conducting and interpreting; Kael's mallet-strike generates the climactic helix, not the Prophet's choice. The Prophet's motivation frames the piece but his final smile is passive observation of Kael's success.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The xylophone mallet appears in the opening third (gripped, raised to conduct), strikes the buoyant root to summon the wave-xylophone, and is tossed to Kael who strikes the apple to produce the golden helix that stills the clouds. Three distinct beats, causal role in escalation and closure, and irreplaceable specificity (whalebone, worn smooth) earn strong integration.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Sketched resonance is named early ("sound could be drawn like charcoal") and the golden helix that spirals skyward at closure is described as "visible" and "sketched." However, the concept remains metaphorical; no on-page choice hinges on whether sound is sketched or merely heard. It flavors the world but does not constrain tactics or alter cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The Prophet interprets cloud movements as sheet music, described in the second paragraph. He reads the fractal clouds as "urgent" and traces conducting arcs in response. However, interpretation does not visibly constrain or enable a tactical choice with cost; he acts on his reading without friction or tradeoff tied to this specific skill.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Dub" is introduced early (Kael's conch-shell ledger imprints emotional timbre), repeated when the Prophet commands "Dub again," and Kael races to dub modulations mid-performance. The action recurs across three beats and ties to the orchard's memory work, but the final turn—Kael's mallet-strike—does not depend on dubbing. Present and recurrent, but not the pivot that redefines closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Fractal generating is introduced early ("clouds churned in fractal generating spirals") and reappears at the climax when the clouds' "generating patterns accelerat[e], spiraling into mandalas." The method matters to the visual imagery and the Prophet's response, but no on-page choice hinges on fractal mechanics versus another pattern. Purposeful and recurrent, but does not shape tactics with cost.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The orchard afloat (driftwood ring, salt-drinking roots, gnarled trees) is introduced in the opening line, frames the entire scene, and provides the Prophet's instruments: buoyant root, apples that burst as percussion. The Prophet presses his palm to the driftwood to hum the root-note that shifts the tide. Setting supplies resources, constrains movement (Prophet steps to the edge), and participates in closure reconfiguration. Essential across beats.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The blue hour is named in the opening line and establishes the indigo-twilight atmosphere. However, time does not progress or tighten decisions; no clock pressure, no urgency tied to the hour ending. The timeframe is static backdrop rather than constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The motivation "to turn obstacles into instruments" is stated explicitly in paragraph four and illustrated by the orchard's salvage history. The Prophet enacts this by using the blackening sea (obstacle) as drum-skin (instrument) via fruit-burst percussion. However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized through a conflicted choice, and no cost attaches to this transformation. Present and thematic, but lacks friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Restless euphony—"the music never settled, never resolved; it pulsed, twitched, evolved"—is named at midpoint and sustained through syntax ("each note a question answered by the next"). The Prophet's euphoria and Kael's overwhelm at climax reflect emotional modulation. The final "sighed" orchard and humming translucent sea offer a tonal shift toward resolution. Tone is coherent, modulates with pressure, and charges the ending, though the label itself is somewhat externally imposed.</comment>
