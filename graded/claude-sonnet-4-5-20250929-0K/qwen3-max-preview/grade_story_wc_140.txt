<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation—seeking texture of erased histories—is established and sustained, but his choices remain observational throughout. The "filtered reality" attribute is asserted rather than embodied in contradictory impulses or micro-decisions under pressure. Interior texture relies heavily on poetic assertion ("he heard symphonies of the nameless") rather than concrete, character-particular perception. No meaningful change or renunciation with visible cost occurs; he continues collecting at the end as at the start.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: fragments layer toward a reconfigured stance on erasure. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive clearly in the first two paragraphs. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration via the final declarations ("They were layered. They were filtered. They were waiting"), but the cost remains abstract—no on-page forfeiture, tactical shift, or sacrifice is legible. The ending recapitulates the opening stance without a felt before/after or undeniable pressure that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The port labyrinth and tidal rhythm constrain movement (high tide forces upward, low tide reveals new cracks) and the poison label anchors his compass metaphorically. Sensory detail is vivid and filtered through Elias's archival lens ("salt-stung silence," "rust and rivets"). The child's shoe moment charges the micro-setting, and the final climb to the highest container uses elevation purposefully. The setting shapes choices and charges the final image, meeting the 9+ gate test.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserving texture of erased histories—is signaled early but never tested by opposition or scarcity. Elias encounters no constraint that forces a trade-off; he collects, layers, and releases fragments without visible cost or tactical shift. The tides modulate his access but do not escalate pressure toward a narrowing decision. No meaningful tightening occurs; the final paragraphs restate the premise rather than reweight options or exact a price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme of erasure vs. preservation emerges organically from the port setting, fragments, and Elias's method. The poison label and child's shoe function as recurring motifs that accumulate meaning. The final image ("They were layered. They were filtered. They were waiting") offers a resonant answer to the central question but veers close to thematic statement rather than embodied particulars. Subtext operates in silences (he doesn't move the shoe, speaks to no one) and the counter-narrative quilt image is apt, yet the ending's direct assertion ("Until the tide took him—or until the world admitted he'd never died at all") edges toward overt moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>POV distance is stable; Elias's perceptual signature—archival, accumulative, attuned to whispers—remains consistent and voice-motivated. Diction is elevated and lyric throughout ("fragments murmured," "contraband," "symphonies of the nameless") without register drift; the lexicon fits a solitary archivist of the erased. Purposeful compression and parallelism ("They were layered. They were filtered. They were waiting.") teach a pattern that pays off at closure. No dialogue is present to assess.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings and paragraph lengths create visual cadence. Information density is high in the port descriptions and fragment catalog. However, paraphrase loops appear: "he sought texture" is restated multiple times across paragraphs without added pressure. Template cadence in the final third ("They were layered. They were filtered. They were waiting.") is pattern-taught but borders on synonym churn. The phrase "not to be remembered by names, but by texture" near the end recapitulates earlier assertions. Figurative language is dense but coherent, with no mixed metaphors that obscure clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The death-certificate-error survivor seeking erased histories in a port labyrinth offers a fresh synthesis of bureaucratic erasure and archive-as-resistance. The tidal rhythm as metronome and the poison label as compass are specific, non-generic choices. However, the "ghost with pulse" and "counter-narrative" framing echo familiar trauma-archive tropes without a bold moral calculus or structural risk that transforms them. The ending reaffirms the premise rather than surprising in hindsight, and the piece does not take a perspectival or formal gamble that elevates stakes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elias is present throughout and his survivor status frames the premise, but his choices remain observational (collecting, layering, releasing) rather than altering tactics or forcing reversals. The death certificate is mentioned in the opening but does not return or constrain a later choice. Present and functional but easily replaceable with another marginalized observer.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The poison label appears in paragraph 7, is described as "his compass" in paragraph 9, stays pinned to his coat in paragraph 23, and reminds him "erasure was never clean" in paragraph 24. It seeds expectation, recurs with reweighted meaning (from found object to symbolic anchor), and is present near closure. However, it does not constrain a tactical choice or drive a beat reversal—its role is primarily symbolic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Erased histories are the story's dominant stake, signaled in paragraph 3 ("lives erased by time, bureaucracy, or indifference") and sustained through Elias's collecting, the stowaway/smuggler/mother fragments, the child's shoe vigil, and the final declaration that "the nameless were not gone." The concept shapes his methods, filters perception, and charges the closure image. Indispensable to plot logic and thematic closure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Filters reality differently" is asserted in paragraph 3 ("reality filtered differently for him—not broken, but layered") but never dramatically tested. We see the results (he hears whispers, collects fragments) but no on-page moment where this trait constrains a choice, costs him socially, or enables a tactical advantage unavailable to others. Label-only use without visible tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Layer" appears as verb and concept throughout: he layers fragments like sediment (paragraph 11), layers whispers into dioramas (paragraph 11), and the final image declares "They were layered." The action structures his method, differentiates him from other survivors, and charges the ending's reconfiguration. Removing "layer" would require reworking the closure's core metaphor. Essential across beats and ending.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Collecting fragments of overheard stories is introduced in paragraph 4, demonstrated with the Mandarin lullaby and sailor's confession (paragraph 6), enacted at the child's shoe (paragraph 20–21), and restated in the penultimate paragraph ("He would keep collecting"). The method is Elias's signature move, differentiates his approach from passive observation, and anchors the closure's stance. Drives multiple beats and the ending's commitment.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The port and container labyrinth are anchored in paragraph 2, constrain movement via tidal rhythm (paragraph 13: high tide forces upward, low tide reveals cracks), supply the poison label and child's shoe as key objects, and frame the final climb (paragraph 25). The setting pressures choices, supplies resources that affect outcome, and charges the final image. Indispensable to spatial logic and thematic resonance.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Tides are introduced as "metronome for his scavenging" (paragraph 4), dictate rhythm in paragraph 13 (high/low tide alter access), and the child's shoe vigil lasts "three tides" (paragraph 20). The timeframe modulates movement and signals duration but does not create a ticking-clock urgency that narrows decisions. Present across beats and shapes pacing; causal role is moderate but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The motivation "to discover the texture of memories" is asserted in paragraph 14 ("he sought texture") and restated in the final declarations ("not to be remembered by names, but by texture"). It explains his collecting but is never dramatized in conflict—no moment where this desire costs him safety, time, or a competing goal. The want is consistent but not tested under friction; told more than shown in choices with tradeoffs.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Nameless identity pervades: Elias is the only named character; all fragments come from "the nameless" (dockworkers, sailors, widow, stowaway, smuggler, mother, child). Tone is elegiac, archival, and hushed, coherent through all beats and modulating with the tidal rhythm and climb. The final image ("the nameless were not gone") crystallizes the tone's charge. The tone shapes perception, filters detail, and charges closure without breaking coherence.</comment>
