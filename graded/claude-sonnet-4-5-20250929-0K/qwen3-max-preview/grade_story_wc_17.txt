<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The cartographer's motivation is consistent and her perceptual method (listening through "the hollow behind her ribs") creates a specific interior texture. However, her agency remains largely observational until the final act of leaving her sketch—a gesture that feels more symbolic than consequential. The diaries' anonymous voices are evocative but their specificity (mother, scientist, lover) reads as demographic sampling rather than individuated pressure. No contradictory impulses act simultaneously in scene; the protagonist moves smoothly from discovery to witness to departure without internal friction or trade-off.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: the cartographer moves through discovery, reads fragments, sketches echoes, and departs with reweighted purpose. Orientation anchors (ivy-veiled passage, post-climate-shift world, her role) arrive early. The closure—her recognition that "legacy's burden was not meant to be carried alone"—lands as Conceptual Repricing, reweighting her mission from solitary mapping to an act of transmission. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral: she leaves her work behind, but the forfeiture feels more ritual than renunciation. One meaningful deepening occurs when the diaries reframe her task, satisfying the Accumulative requirement.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The ivy-veiled passage, collapsed antechamber, and stone fireplace are vividly rendered and spatially coherent. The film negative strip—initially carried as talisman—shifts meaning when moonlight strikes it in the hearth, charging the final image with a sense of breathing presence. This micro-object recurrence constrains her choice to leave the sketch rather than capture the glow, satisfying the 9+ gate for object-as-setting. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (ash brushed with trembling fingers, soot on knees), though the passage itself does not pressure a tactical choice beyond framing her solitary work.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—discovering what walls dream about—is signaled early and pursued consistently. Pressure accumulates through the revelation that the diaries were offered, not discarded, which deepens her understanding and shifts her from recorder to witness. The final act of leaving her sketch alongside the diaries reweights her mission, but the cost is oblique: she departs with "satchel lighter, heart heavier," a phrasing that gestures toward consequence without dramatizing a trade-off or foreclosed path. No reversal narrows options; the tightening is one of recognition rather than escalation under duress.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The theme—legacy as a burden passed lightly, not carried alone—emerges organically from the cartographer's encounter with the half-burned diaries and her decision to leave her own work in the hearth. The final image of the passage exhaling and the walls dreaming answers the central question without moralizing. Subtext operates cleanly in the film negative's glow and the ivy's rustle. However, the penultimate line "Legacy's burden was not meant to be carried alone" hovers close to explicit theme statement, though it is quickly subsumed by the sensory departure. The piece resists tidy resolution while delivering a resonant reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and the cartographer's perceptual signature—listening with "the hollow behind her ribs," noticing echoes over blueprints—is distinct and consistent. Diction is purposeful and controlled, with elevated register ("vibrates in your bones before you learn to speak," "proof that someone once tried to capture what was vanishing") that fits the contemplative mode. However, the prose occasionally drifts toward abstract lyricism ("the curve of a sob against limestone," "the way silence pooled in alcoves like rainwater") that risks decorative excess. No dialogue appears. Psychic distance remains intimate without head-hopping, and the closing shift to embodied action ("stepped back into the gloom") grounds the exit.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Line-level craft is generally strong, with varied sentence rhythm and high information density in the diary fragments. However, several beats exhibit figurative density without clear payoff: "curled at the edges like a sleeping serpent," "curled like unborn birds," and "sharp as a scalpel" in close succession create decorative texture rather than propulsion. The phrase "legacy's burden" appears three times, twice in the final third, with the penultimate use feeling thesis-like rather than dramatized. Minor scaffold appears in "She approached, knelt again" (echoing an earlier kneel) and "gently, as though cradling a wound" (explanatory simile). No loops obscure causality, but the cumulative effect slightly dulls momentum in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The core premise—a cartographer who maps emotional echoes in architecture after climate collapse—offers a fresh synthesis of speculative setting and lyric mission. The discovery of half-burned diaries as offerings rather than discards provides a non-obvious turn. However, the emotional arc (solitary seeker finds kindred grief, leaves her own work, departs renewed) follows a recognizable template of pilgrimage and transmission. The film negative, ivy, and fireplace are specific anchors, but the cartographer's internal journey from seeking to witnessing lacks a risky trade-off or complication that would elevate the premise beyond its elegant execution. No close echoes of famous work detected; the voice feels singular.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The corridor echo cartographer is present throughout and her occupation frames her perceptual method (listening through the body, sketching echoes). She makes two on-page choices: to read the diaries as witness rather than recorder, and to leave her sketch in the hearth. The second choice alters her mission from solitary mapping to an act of transmission, contributing to closure. However, both choices emerge smoothly without internal friction or visible cost; she does not sacrifice a competing goal or foreclose a path. Her role shapes tone and stakes but does not create a key reversal. Setup clear, development observational, payoff participatory but not causally indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The film negative strip appears in the opening (carried as talisman), slips from her lap in the hearth scene, and glows faintly when moonlight strikes it—a moment she chooses not to capture. This reprise reweights its meaning from artifact to breathing presence, and her decision not to pin it down charges the closure with restraint. However, the negative does not constrain an earlier choice or enable a tactic; it functions primarily as thematic accent. Setup present, development static, payoff lyric but not causally active. Three touches across beats, but swappable with another symbolic object without breaking story logic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Legacy's burden" is named explicitly three times and shapes the protagonist's dominant stake: she seeks to understand what walls remember and whether they can forgive, then discovers that others left their grief as offerings. Her final act—leaving her sketch to be found—dramatizes the concept as transmission rather than solitary weight. The concept constrains her interpretive lens (offered, not discarded) and charges the ending. However, it does not force a trade-off or narrow tactical options on the page; the burden is conceptual rather than a live pressure that alters her moves. Setup metaphoric, development clear, payoff resonant but not mechanically indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Sensitively perceptive" is described as inherited and bone-deep, enabling her method of listening through "the hollow behind her ribs." This trait allows her to hear the sigh and sob in the stone, which leads her to the diaries. However, the trait is labeled more than tested; no scene shows a cost or tradeoff (e.g., overwhelm, misreading, vulnerability) tied to her heightened perception. It enables discovery but does not constrain or complicate a choice. Setup present as backstory, development functional but label-only, payoff absent. Swappable with "intuitive" or "empathic" without mechanical loss.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Glimpse" operates as the story's primary verb: she glimpses a life through scorched diary pages (mother, scientist, lover) and later glimpses the film negative glowing in moonlight. The diary glimpses reframe her mission from mapping to witnessing, driving the middle turn. The negative's glow is a micro-turn she chooses not to capture, reinforcing restraint. However, the action is passive and could be replaced with "read" or "discover" with minor edits; the specificity of "glimpse" (partial, fleeting) adds tone but does not define the plot's hinge. Setup implicit, development central, payoff accented but not irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The half-burned diaries in the fireplace are discovered at the story's midpoint and anchor the cartographer's shift from mapper to witness. She reads them page by scorched page, and their content (lives offered to fire and walls) redefines her understanding of legacy. She then leaves her own sketch in the same hearth, completing the transmission pattern. The method shapes two beats (discovery, offering) and charges the closure by making the fireplace a site of continuity. Setup mid-story, development causal, payoff integral. Removing the fireplace mechanism would require significant restructuring; the diaries' burned state and their location are not ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The ivy-veiled passage frames the opening and closing, with ivy described as older than the passage itself, threading through cracks "like veins, pulsing with slow green life." At the end, the ivy rustles "not from wind, but from something deeper, slower: the passage exhaling." This reprise charges the cartographer's recognition that the walls are alive and participatory. However, the passage does not constrain her movement or tactics; it functions as atmospheric anchor and thematic echo. The collapsed antechamber and fireplace do more mechanical work. Setup vivid, development static, payoff lyric. Swappable with "moss-covered corridor" without breaking logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"After the climate shifts" anchors the story in a post-catastrophe world where "buildings learned to breathe again" and the protagonist maps what was lost. The timeframe justifies the flooded archive, the Great Retreat, and the elegiac tone. However, it does not tighten decisions or create urgency; the cartographer works at her own pace with no external clock. The setting could function in any post-disaster frame (war, plague, economic collapse) with minimal edits. Setup present as worldbuilding, development absent, payoff thematic but not causal. Generic post-crisis time rather than a specific constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"To discover what walls dream about—because if stone could remember, perhaps it could also forgive" is the protagonist's stated motivation, signaled early. It drives her choice to listen at the passage's bend, to read the diaries as witness, and to leave her sketch as an offering. The motivation is consistent and shapes her interpretive lens (the diaries were offered, not hidden). However, it is declared rather than tested through friction; no competing want or fear complicates her pursuit. The forgiveness element does not reappear at closure. Setup clear, development consistent, payoff participatory but not conflicted. Swappable with "understand their grief" without mechanical loss.</comment>
