<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elira's motivation to discover time's texture is established early and drives her garden work, but interior contradictions remain largely abstract—grief versus joy, anticipation versus regret are catalogued rather than shown competing in real-time choice. The moment she touches the fragment and screams, then collapses weeping, reads embodied, yet the final epiphany arrives as a delivered catalogue ("Grief was coarse. Joy, unexpectedly porous.") rather than earned through a concrete micro-choice under pressure. Retrocognition is labeled but never constrains a present action with visible cost; she moves through the garden freely without friction from the trait.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors arrive immediately (maze designer, living bridge garden, halo fragment above), and the story teaches an accumulative-textural lens by midpoint. The closure unit—Elira's final tactile cataloguing of time's texture—operates as Conceptual Repricing: the garden has consumed her photographs and she shifts from external anchors to direct sensory contact with duration itself. However, the cost remains asserted rather than dramatized in a decisive image; the photographs "disintegrate" and she weeps, but the final paragraph lists discoveries without showing what she forfeited or what path closed. Under an accumulative lens one meaningful deepening suffices, yet the closing catalogue feels like summary of findings rather than a moment that reweights prior pressure with undeniable cost on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The living bridge garden is vividly rendered with moss-slicked arches, yew tunnels, and grass that imprints chill; sensory detail is concrete and POV-filtered through Elira's textural obsession. The halo fragment and the garden's hyperbolic geometry supply spatial constraints—walk beneath one arch, age a minute; beneath another, shed a memory—that shape her exploratory moves and charge the final touch. The environment constrains her final gesture (reaching up to caress the fragment's edge) and the silver flowers sprouting from absorbed tears anchor emotional consequence in physical change, meeting the 9+ gate for setting-as-constraint and closure participation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—discovering time's texture—is signaled early and drives Elira's garden work. The middle turn occurs when she brushes the fragment and the photographs disintegrate, narrowing her access to memory and forcing reliance on direct sensory contact. Yet this reversal is externally imposed (the fragment's power) rather than driven by her choice, and the cost legibility is moderate: we see her scream and weep, but the final tactile cataloguing reads more as victory than trade-off. No live option is foreclosed with visible consequence; she achieves her goal and smiles "trembling," which undercuts the felt price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme—time's texture, memory as thread, the cost of obsession—emerges organically from garden imagery and the halo fragment's function without meta-statement. The silver flowers chiming "like forgotten bells" and the photograph ash that "spiraled, rewriting gravity" offer fresh, specific correlatives. The final image attempts a non-literal answer: time's grain is "more beautiful, more terrible" than any hedge, yet the catalogue of textures (grief coarse, joy porous) borders on thesis articulation. The piece resists tidy morals and invites reflection, though the closing "quaking reverie complete" phrase edges toward thematic self-narration.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with a distinct perceptual signature: Elira notices grain, curl, warp, texture at every scale. Diction is elevated and lyric—"duration itself, thrumming like a plucked nerve"—which fits the character's aesthetic obsession and the story's dreamy register. Under peak stress (the inversion, the scream) syntax compresses appropriately without losing voice. Purposeful compression and patterned repetition of texture vocabulary create a coherent textural lens. However, some register drift occurs: "retrocognitively trapped" and "hyperbolic geometry" read technical rather than experiential, slightly pulling the reader out of embodied perception.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and figurative language is dense but mostly coherent: "sky bruised violet," "roots became ceilings," "slick, yes, but layered, like oil on water." However, several lines loop or restate: "not haunted by the past, but woven into it" followed immediately by "each step forward dragging her senses through yesterday's breath, tomorrow's sigh" paraphrases the same concept. The closing catalogue—"Grief was coarse. Joy, unexpectedly porous. Anticipation? A lattice of needles and velvet."—reads as list rather than propulsion. Minor filter-verb stack in the final paragraphs ("felt it," "felt time's grain") slightly dulls immediacy. Overwriting is present but contained; the density serves the textural lens without fully obscuring causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of maze design, retrocognition, halo fragment, and hyperbolic geometry as time's language is specific and non-obvious. The image of photographs thinning because moments are siphoned into garden geometry offers fresh metaphysical mechanics. The final tactile catalogue of emotions (grief coarse, joy porous, anticipation lattice) transforms the abstraction of "time's texture" into embodied discovery. Risk-taking in structure (accumulative-textural, lyric closure) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, though the hyperbolic-geometry conceit leans technical and the closing catalogue borders on thesis delivery rather than lived surprise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elira (hedge maze designer) is present throughout and her choice to adjust the yew tunnel triggers the photographs' disintegration; her final decision to reach up and caress the halo fragment yields the tactile epiphany. However, most beats describe her walking, weeping, and receiving sensory input rather than making choices that narrow options. The occupation itself (maze design) is more thematic frame than active constraint—her shears and wire are mentioned once but never used on the page.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The halo fragment appears in the opening (embedded above, humming with fractured light), is touched at the inversion mid-story (triggering the photograph disintegration), and returns at closure when Elira caresses its edge to feel "duration itself, thrumming like a plucked nerve." It drives two key beats and charges the final image with reweighted meaning: not a tool but a wound, and touching it delivers the tactile catalogue that completes her quest. Its specific properties (celestial metal, collapsed chronology, frequencies that peel back time) are irreplaceable and causally active.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Fading photographs appear early as anchors in her satchel (mother pruning roses, first maze blueprint, lover dissolving), return at the inversion when they "flared white before crumbling to ash," and their absence in the final section becomes "a texture too—hollow, echoing, but honest." The concept shapes a major turn (their disintegration forces direct sensory reliance) and the final realization that she no longer needs them. However, they are never handled or sorted on the page before vanishing; their thinning is described in exposition rather than shown constraining a present choice.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Retrocognitively trapped is introduced early ("each step forward dragging her senses through yesterday's breath, tomorrow's sigh") and generates vivid description—tasting rain not yet fallen, hearing unborn laughter—but it never constrains an on-page action. Elira walks the garden freely, adjusts tunnels, and touches the fragment without friction from temporal overlay. The trait enriches atmosphere and justifies the garden's backward-feeding logic, yet it remains label-only: no moment where she must navigate conflicting temporal layers to complete a task or where the trap exacts visible cost in a choice.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Disintegrate occurs at the story's major turn: when Elira brushes the fragment, the photographs "disintegrate—through hyperbolic geometry" into ash that spirals and vanishes, rewriting causality and forcing her shift from external memory anchors to direct sensory contact. The action is irreplaceable (no synonym captures the physics-bending erasure) and redefines her options, compelling the barefoot night walk and final tactile quest. It also appears thematically in "disintegrated" to describe the method, reinforcing the concept. The verb is causally central and charges the closure's cost.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Hyperbolic geometry is introduced at the exposition beat ("the language time used to fold, stretch, and eventually disintegrate experience"), learned from the mad cartographer, and explicitly named again when the photographs disintegrate "through hyperbolic geometry." The geometry shapes the garden's archways (walk beneath one, age a minute; another, shed memory), which structures Elira's environment. However, the mechanics remain abstract; the reader never sees her calculate curvature or choose a path based on geometric constraints. It operates as thematic vocabulary more than dramatized method that alters tactics on the page.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The living bridge garden frames every beat: moss-slicked arches, yew tunnels, the halo fragment at its apex, grass that imprints chill, thorns that scratch, wood that absorbs tears and sprouts silver flowers. The garden's archways impose specific costs (age a minute, shed a memory) and the final pillar against which she collapses absorbs her tears with visible consequence. The environment is not backdrop but active participant: it feeds on her memories to grow and lets her feel time's grain. The garden constrains her movements and charges the closure image when she walks barefoot, letting terrain texture her understanding.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>N/A</grade>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>To discover the texture of time is stated explicitly ("Her goal wasn't immortality or power—it was texture") and dramatized through her work: adjusting tunnels, touching the fragment, walking barefoot to feel dew and thorns. The final catalogue of textures (grief coarse, joy porous, anticipation a lattice) delivers on the motivation. However, the motivation is told more than it is conflicted: no moment where the cost of discovery (losing the photographs, weeping) tempts her to stop or choose safety. She pursues the goal, succeeds, and smiles; friction between desire and price is asserted (weeping, trembling) but not tested in a choice that could have gone another way.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Quaking reverie is embodied in syntax and imagery throughout: violet sky, prismatic shadows, world stuttering, roots becoming ceilings, Elira trembling and collapsing. The tone remains dreamlike and sensory-dense across turns, modulating from lyric description (opening arches, pulsing leaves) through crisis (the scream bent backward, tears absorbed by wood) to the final trembling smile. The phrase "quaking reverie complete" in the closing line self-names the tone, which borders on meta-commentary, but the tone itself charges the final image: trembling discovery refracts every prior beat through the lens of embodied awe and terror.</comment>
