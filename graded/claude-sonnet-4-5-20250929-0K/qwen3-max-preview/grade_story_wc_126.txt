<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is clear—unbinding beauty in the unfinished—but her choices feel more observational than consequential; she kneels, plays, and the greenhouse responds without meaningful resistance or internal contradiction. Embodied emotion appears sporadically ("trembling fingers," the child's tears) but interiority remains abstract and label-driven ("acoustically perceptive," "not redemption, nor revolution"). The grandmother's backstory occupies substantial space yet does not pivot a present choice. No visible cost forecloses a path; the child's petal-offering feels like validation rather than a decision with stakes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land early and remain stable. The piece reads as Accumulative/Textural: Lira's playing gathers intensity through linked images (vines stir, hatch opens, child descends) toward the petal moment, which reweights prior material. However, no decisive on-page reversal narrows options or forecloses a path with felt cost—the petal floats as affirmation, not costly choice. The closure reconfigures mood but lacks the pressure or cost test required for Resonant Reconfiguration or Conceptual Repricing at this rubric's standard.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The greenhouse-and-shipwrecks setting is vivid and purposeful: rusted hulls, fogged glass, moss, and the mendicant's bowl all constrain Lira's ritual space and charge the final image. Sensory detail (salt, ash, humidity) stays selective and POV-filtered. The recurring bowl and the orchid's unfolding petals participate in the closure beat, meeting the 9+ gate requirement that setting elements constrain choice or charge the final image—though the choice itself remains thin, capping the score below 8.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—unbinding what is trapped in silence—is signaled early and sustained, but pressure does not escalate through reversals or tightening choices. Each phrase of Lira's playing summons response (petals unfurl, hatch creaks, child descends) without resistance, cost, or a turn that narrows her options. The petal-offering feels like thematic closure rather than a decision with visible forfeit. No antagonist or meaningful obstacle shapes tactics; coincidence (the child was already hiding) delivers the resolution.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme—beauty in the unfinished, silence as sacred canvas—emerges through image and action without overt moralizing. The grandmother's creed ("lives in the breath before the word") is articulated but enacted through Lira's music, avoiding pure tell. The petal that floats (does not sink) offers a resonant non-literal answer, though the emotional honesty tilts sentimental ("not from grief, but awe"). Strong thematic coherence across particulars, but the closure image restates rather than reweights the premise with undeniable pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with a distinct lyric register ("chronic hush," "glass-lit gloom," "unspooling from her bow"). Psychic distance is controlled, though elevated diction occasionally drifts from immediate perception ("coiled tight in the ribs of those who survived"). Purposeful parallelism and poetic compression are taught early and sustained. No dialogue to judge. Voice feels authorial-poetic rather than Lira-particular; the perceptual signature tilts generic-lyric rather than character-specific, and some stock phrasing ("magnificent simplicity," "fleeting, magnificent") dulls immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully and figurative language is dense but controlled in most beats. However, paraphrase loops and synonym churn appear: "She does not speak the stories aloud. She plays them" immediately restates the prior paragraph's claim; "The chronic hush does not vanish. It deepens. It becomes sacred. It becomes the canvas" cycles through restatement. Runs of identical sentence stems ("A high harmonic for… A sliding glissando for… A broken arpeggio—for…") create template cadence across three lines, triggering −0.4 to −0.6. Stock metaphors ("dust motes," "threads unspooling") and elevated register in peak beats ("aching, alive," "fleeting, magnificent") add texture without fresh embodiment, −0.3 for overwriting density. Aggregate: −0.9 in Q7, no artifacts touch closure directly but pervasiveness disallows 9+ globally and caps high-band entries at 8.8 per the artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The lyric post-apocalypse frame (rainforest burns, sunken orchard, shipwrecks) offers visual freshness, and the violinist-as-ritualist angle is less common. Yet the emotional arc—playing music to "unbind" trapped beauty—follows a familiar template: solitary artist heals/awakens dormant life through performance, validated by a child's awe. The grandmother's bonfire-storytelling backstory and the floating petal are stock gestures. The piece synthesizes existing ideas (eco-grief, music-as-magic, beauty-in-ruin) without a non-obvious moral calculus or a turn that feels inevitable in hindsight. Transformation test: swap names and setting details, the arc persists unchanged.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Lira (echo-harbor violinist) is present throughout and her action (playing) triggers all movement. Setup clear, beat involvement spans multiple moments (kneeling, drawing bow, sustaining note, lowering bow, tucking violin again). However, her choices do not create reversals—the greenhouse responds without resistance. The child's descent and petal-offering feel summoned rather than negotiated. Causal pressure and cost are absent; her role is catalyst, not agent facing trade-offs. Present in closure (she smiles, draws bow again) but ornamentally. Swappable with "musician" or "shaman" with minor edits. Score: setup +0.5, three beats +1.4, closure mention +0.3, minus swappability −0.6, minus no cost −0.6, minus ornamental resolution −0.7 ≈ 4.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mendicant's bowl is introduced early (beside Lira), described with specificity (chipped porcelain, faded cranes, rainwater from last storm before fires). Handled in at least two beats: Lira refers to it as "compass, altar, archive" and the note "finds its way to the bowl" causing ripples; child places scorched petal into it at closure, petal floats. Charged reprise reweights the bowl from vessel-of-hope to witness-of-resurrection. Setup +0.6, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, specificity +0.4, minus swappability (could be any receptacle) −0.5, minus no causal cost tied to bowl itself −0.6 ≈ 6.2. Rounding down: 6.2.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Chronic hush" is named in opening line, recurs mid-story ("The chronic hush does not vanish. It deepens"), and closes the piece ("The chronic hush holds its breath"). It frames the atmosphere and stakes (silence after destruction) and Lira's motivation depends on it (she plays to unbind what is trapped). However, the concept operates thematically rather than tactically—it does not narrow options or change choices on the page. Lyric seed-to-reprise is present and purposeful. Setup +0.7, closure reprise +0.9, specificity +0.4, minus ornamental (theme claim, no tactical constraint) −0.8, minus label-only −0.3 ≈ 5.9.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Acoustically perceptive" is introduced early with elaboration ("not just to pitch or timbre, but to the silence between notes"). It enables Lira's ritual (she hears what others cannot, guiding her "deeper into the greenhouse's gloom"). However, the trait is asserted rather than dramatized through a visible trade-off or cost. No moment shows her missing non-acoustic cues or paying a price for heightened sensitivity. Setup +0.6, one beat involvement (implicit in her playing) +0.4, minus label-only (not enacted with cost) −0.8, minus swappability (generic "sensitive musician") −0.6 ≈ 3.2.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Unbind" is named as Lira's action ("She plays to unbind") and recurs ("And unbind they do"). The word anchors the story's central move: petals unfurl, hatch opens, child descends. All turns trace to this action. Present in closure framing ("to unbind the beauty coiled in the incomplete"). However, the action itself is abstract and could be swapped with "release," "awaken," or "heal" without structural change. Setup +0.7, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.2, minus swappability −0.8, minus abstract (no specific mechanics) −0.5 ≈ 6.7.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Family tradition of storytelling around a bonfire" is introduced mid-story in a backstory block (grandmother's creed) and Lira honors it by playing stories instead of speaking them. The method shapes her approach but is narrated rather than enacted—no bonfire burns, the tradition is memory. Present implicitly in closure ("The next story waits"). Setup late (second third) −0.3, one beat (grandmother's teaching) +0.4, closure echo +0.4, minus summary-only (not dramatized) −0.6, minus swappability (any oral tradition would serve) −0.5 ≈ 5.1.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Sunken orchard greenhouse ringed by shipwrecks is detailed early and constrains the action: moss swallows Lira's boots, glass panes amplify sound, rusted hulls echo the melody, vines stir, cracked beam groans. The setting supplies resources (acoustics, spatial resonance) that affect Lira's ritual and charge the final image (child in rafters, shipwrecks remember). Setup +0.7, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.1, causal pressure +0.9, specificity +0.6, irreplaceability +0.5 ≈ 7.4. Meets 9+ gate (environment shapes tactics and final image) but execution capped by Lira's low agency and thin cost.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"After the rainforest burns" anchors backstory and the chronic hush but does not create time pressure. No live clock, no tightening window. The fires are past; the story unfolds in an untracked present without urgency. Setup early +0.6, thematic presence (frames loss) +0.3, minus no tactical constraint −0.9, minus vague (when after? hours? years?) −0.4 ≈ 4.3.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"To find beauty in the unfinished" is stated explicitly ("Her motivation is not redemption… but to find beauty in the unfinished") and enacted through her playing (half-bloomed orchid, snapped string, story cut short). The motivation drives every beat and closes the piece ("the unfinished, once more, begins to sing"). However, it is declared rather than conflicted—no friction between this want and a competing cost on the page. Setup +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.3, minus told-only (no embodied cost or friction) −0.8, minus no visible trade-off −0.6 ≈ 6.3.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Magnificent simplicity" is present in tone throughout: spare syntax, selective detail, quiet escalation without grand crescendo. The piece teaches its lyric-calm register early and sustains it across turns. Tone modulates subtly (trembling, stirring, recognition) and charges the final image (held note, floating petal). However, stock phrasing ("fleeting, magnificent simplicity") in the closure paragraph states rather than enacts the effect. Setup early +0.7, coherence across beats +1.0, closure charge +1.0, specificity +0.4, minus label-stating in final third −0.5, minus static mood (no sharp modulation under pressure) −0.3 ≈ 6.8.</comment>
