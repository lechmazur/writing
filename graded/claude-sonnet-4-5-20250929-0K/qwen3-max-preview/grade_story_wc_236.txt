<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's sensory loss is embodied through touch-mapped action and the birthing screw triggers a clear shift in her therapeutic stance. However, her interiority leans heavily on abstract metaphor ("emotional terrain," "internal map") rather than contradiction under pressure. The final gesture toward the pregnant couple and her resolution to "listen...for what trembled beneath" feel declared rather than earned through a visible cost that forecloses another path. The motivation remains consistent but the change reads more as thematic confirmation than a choice with friction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: fog-thinning, object-handling, and sound-mapping accumulate toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara accepts her sensory limitation as method rather than deficit. Closure lands on-page with the therapy-table placement and the vow to "map the emotional terrain," reweighting her prior "fraud" stance. Cost is felt—she surrenders the fantasy of restored smell—but the weight is mostly conceptual; no live option is dramatized and foreclosed in the ending beat. Orientation is clean and the lens holds, lifting the score into the 7s.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The water clock shop grounds the piece with tactile specificity: damp counter, leaking reservoir, cracked escapement wheel, and the dismantled bronze ribcage. The birthing screw and broken clock function as micro-setting objects that constrain Elara's choice to sanctify rather than repair, charging the final image. The fog modulates from "hush" to "thinning" in step with her internal shift, and the therapy table at the end reconfigures the opening shop space. No occupational depth is required here; the recursive object-world does the work.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—can Elara practice aromatherapy without smell?—is signaled early and tightens once when Ren reframes the screw as fulcrum, shifting her self-concept from "fraud" to witness. The remembered client ("tremor in her voice, clench of her jaw") deepens her understanding, but no live option is tested on the page. The pregnant couple encounter and therapy-table vow feel like confirmations rather than choices under competing pressure. One meaningful deepening is present, but agency reads passive and the cost is implied rather than visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Theme—ordinary miracles witnessed through limitation—emerges from the screw's reframing and the fog's modulation, avoiding overt thesis. However, Ren's dialogue veers into thematic summary ("miracles don't need to be fragrant...just witnessed") and the closing lines ("one quiet miracle at a time") border on a stated moral. The final therapy-table image offers a resonant answer, but the route there includes too much explicit philosophizing. The best moments—screw as fulcrum, broken clocks holding time differently—are undercut by the explain-everything tendency in dialogue and reflection.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara's perceptual signature—touch, sound, weight of silence—remains consistent and her diction stays grounded in sensory metaphor. Ren's voice is distinct: tidal calm, aphoristic brevity. Distance control is clean with no head-hopping. However, free indirect reflection sometimes drifts into workshop idiom ("humanize the brutal calculus," "sanctify it," "relic of becoming") that feels elevated beyond the POV's lived texture under pressure. Dialogue is naturalistic and advances plot, and the prose modulates well from fog-blurred opening to the crystallized final beat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high in the shop-work beats. However, patterned overwriting pervades: nearly every paragraph layers metaphor ("lungs between breaths," "moonlit water," "gravity of implication," "hymn," "monument," "offering") without teaching a motif that pays off distinctly at closure. Template cadence appears in the closing third: "She would listen...She would read...She would humanize...She would map." The final sequence also paraphrases the opening fog-and-miracle premise without added pressure. Artifacts touch the closure zone, preventing high-band entry and triggering the cross-cap.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The aromatherapist-without-smell premise is fresh and the midwife screw as fulcrum offers a non-obvious synthesis. However, the fog-lifting-as-clarity-emerges structure and the wounded-healer template are familiar, and the story does not transform them beyond thematic echoing. The pregnant couple gesture and therapy-table vow feel like template satisfaction rather than inevitable consequence. Emotional specificity (the tremor, jaw clench) elevates individual beats, but the overall arc follows a predictable redemption path without bold structural risk or a turn that redefines the premise in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her sensory loss filters all perception. She makes one causal choice—asking Ren to mount the screw in the clock—but most beats are observational or reflective. The therapy-table vow is a stance crystallization rather than a decision under competing pressure. Setup, development (screw handling), and payoff (therapy table) are present, meeting two-of-three, but beat involvement is thin and the character could be swapped for any sensory-loss professional without breaking story logic.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The birthing clamp screw appears in three distinct beats: initial presentation, Ren's fulcrum reframing, and the mounting inside the clock. It drives the key turn (from tool-of-crushing to tool-of-opening) and its presence in the final therapy-table image charges closure. Specificity is high—cold, blunt, salvaged from grandmother's attic—and removing it would collapse the story's thematic and causal spine. Cost is conceptual (Elara's self-concept shift) rather than physical, keeping the score below 8.5.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Reading between lines" is invoked explicitly by Ren ("squinting as if reading between lines etched by time") and recurs in the closing vow ("read between their lines"). It shapes Elara's method—listening for what trembles beneath—but does not constrain a choice or narrow options on the page. The concept is thematically present and functional, but swappable with "seeing hidden meaning" or similar abstractions. Setup and payoff are clear; middle development is thin.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Maps emotional terrain" is stated early and returns in the closing line. Elara's remembered client beat dramatizes the method (tremor, jaw clench, armrest grip), and the therapy-table placement anchors it spatially. However, the mapping does not constrain a choice or impose a visible cost; it functions as thematic label rather than tactical limiter. The phrase is repeated nearly verbatim at closure without reweighting, reducing irreplaceability. Setup and payoff present; middle development is label-only.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Humanize" appears twice: once in Elara's reflection ("humanize the brutal calculus of birth") and once in the closing vow ("humanize the ache"). It does not drive a turn or choice; the screw's fulcrum reframing and Ren's witness lesson are the active forces. The action is thematically invoked but functionally ornamental—swappable with "honor," "witness," or "acknowledge" without altering plot or cost. Late thematic echo without causal work.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Through occluded views" is signaled early (fog, sensory loss, shop's dim corners) and sustained through the thinning fog and the cracked clock face. The method shapes Elara's perceptual signature and the fog's modulation charges the final image. However, occlusion does not constrain a choice or narrow tactics; it functions as atmospheric frame and thematic consistency rather than mechanical necessity. Lyric resonance is strong (early seed → final reprise), qualifying for mid-6s despite thin middle involvement.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The water clock repair shop anchors the piece spatially and supplies the clock, screw, and Ren's fulcrum lesson. The setting is embodied (damp counter, leaking reservoir, drill bit) and the dismantled clock constrains the mounting choice. Fog outside and therapy table at home frame the arc. The shop drives at least two beats (screw examination, clock mounting) and its symbolic function (broken mechanisms, quiet miracles) charges closure. Setup, development, and payoff are present; causal pressure is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Hush of morning fog" establishes tone and the fog thins by the ending, marking elapsed time loosely. However, no clock tightens decisions and the timeframe does not impose urgency or cost. The morning frame is consistent but ornamental—the story would work unchanged at dusk or noon. Setup is clear; middle and closure participation are absent. Late introduction penalty does not apply, but development and closure gates are missing.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"To unveil ordinary miracles" is stated early and motivates Elara's shop visit and her final vow. The screw-as-fulcrum and broken-clock lessons are concrete discoveries that satisfy the desire. However, no friction or competing cost tests the motivation; she encounters confirmation rather than obstacle. The pregnant couple gesture dramatizes the unveiling impulse in action. Setup, development (screw/clock lessons), and payoff (therapy table) are present, but the desire faces no resistance, capping the score below 7.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Trembling calm" is embodied consistently: Ren's hands "trembling with age, yet calm as moonlit water," Elara's "breath shallow...from the gravity of implication," and the closing "quiet miracle" cadence. Tone modulates subtly as fog thins and the screw is sanctified, charging the final image without breaking coherence. The tone shapes perceptual filter and dialogue rhythm across all beats and supports closure effect. Strong integration; not indispensable (a different tone could carry the arc), keeping it in the high-7s.</comment>
