<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clearly signaled (graft new meaning onto old wounds), but her agency is largely reflective rather than tested by conflict. The interiority leans heavily on elevated diction ("lotus-hearted ache," "shrewdly innocent gaze") that tells rather than embodies contradiction under pressure. The coral and cast serve as props for witnessing rather than forcing a trade-off with visible cost. The "unknotting" action functions more as metaphor than a choice that forecloses a path, though the final gesture (pressing coral to cast, whispering affirmation) does show micro-agency with a gentle cost (acceptance of kinship over escape).</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Mira's final stance—carrying pain with grace, kinship blooming in fracture—reweights her initial goal with felt cost (she neither heals nor escapes, but witnesses and breathes). The Drive Lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the atrium mist, coral warmth, and cast scribbles layer toward a cadence shift in the final paragraph that deepens the dominant stake. Orientation is clear by paragraph three (Mira, atrium, anesthetic hum, twilight). The cost is legible in the shift from "lotus-hearted ache" as grief to kinship, and the quiet acceptance that the wound remains but is now carried differently.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The mist-clad atrium at twilight is vividly rendered (glass ceiling dripping condensation, moss-slick pillar, salt and silence) and the anesthetic hum provides a constraint on perception ("weighting her limbs, thoughts unspooling"). The coral fragment and child's cast function as micro-setting objects that charge the final image. However, the atrium itself does not pressure Mira's choices—she moves through it without spatial friction or resource scarcity. The setting supports tone and atmosphere but remains a stage rather than an active constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (graft new meaning onto old wounds) is signaled early and coheres through the Accumulative lens: coral warmth increases, scribbles shift from frantic to gentle, mist thins as Mira speaks the decrypted phrases. One meaningful deepening occurs when she presses the coral to the cast and the smudges rearrange, visibly unknotting the shared anxieties. The tightening is gentle but legible: her whispered affirmation forecloses the option of erasure or escape, accepting kinship as the cost. No overt antagonist, but the internal battlefield and ghost-pressure of memory provide coherent opposition.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme (peace is sutured, not signed; wounds that breathe rather than heal) emerges through coral, cast, and the unknotting gesture. The final image—Mira lighter because she carries pain with grace—offers a non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. However, the closing paragraph edges toward over-articulation: "lotus-hearted ache...wasn't grief—it was kinship" and "learned to carry it with grace" veer close to thematic summary. The "symbiosis" talisman and "petals unfurling only when you stop trying to fix the wound" risk spelling out what the coral-cast moment already showed.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>POV is stable (third-person limited, Mira's focalization throughout) and the diction aims for lyric elevation ("lotus-hearted," "shrewdly innocent," "shared anxieties...braid into something that could bear weight"). However, the register drifts into abstract philosophizing at peak beats: "the kind that blooms in saltwater, roots in fracture" and "start listening to what it's trying to say" read as authorial gloss rather than Mira's interior voice under anesthetic pressure. Perceptual signature is present (translator parsing ceasefire whispers, decrypting with empathy) but the voice converges toward generic lyricism in the final third, flattening Mira's specificity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Figurative language saturates most beats without pattern-teaching: "liquid gold," "hesitant ghosts," "needle through torn fabric," "petals unfurling," "braided into something that could bear weight." Template cadence appears in the closing paragraph (repeated "let" anaphora, "not...but" toggles). Paraphrase loops: "She hadn't healed the past—that was never the point. She had let it breathe" restates the same idea. Synonym churn: "unknotting," "unknotted," "knots released" across adjacent lines. The metaphor density and scaffold phrasing dull momentum at the closure beat, though individual images are vivid.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The premise (translator decrypts child's cast under anesthesia to process war trauma) combines elements in a specific way, but the emotional arc—witness accepts kinship over erasure—follows a familiar template of therapeutic acceptance. The coral and cast are well-chosen particulars, yet the unknotting gesture and "lotus-hearted ache" veer toward New Age workshop idiom. The atoll refugee detail and Pacific conflict-zone setting offer verifiable specificity, but the transformation test is weak: swap translator for therapist or social worker, cast for diary, and the arc remains largely unchanged. No close echoes of famous lines, but the resolution into grace and symbiosis lacks a sharp, non-obvious turn.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Mira's translator skills (decrypting with empathy, parsing ceasefire whispers) are invoked twice: once in backstory to establish her lens, once when she decrypts the cast. The decryption shapes the middle beat and enables the unknotting action, but her professional method does not narrow her options or impose a visible cost at closure. The character is present across all three gates and contributes to the ending, but could be swapped for another witness-archetype (therapist, aid worker) with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The coral fragment appears in five beats: opening (clutched, ghost-pressure), middle (pressing into her thigh, glowing with resonance), peak (pressed against cast, growing warmer), resolution (cool and quiet, purpose fulfilled), and final pocket placement (talisman of symbiosis). It drives the unknotting action at the peak beat and charges the final image. The coral's warmth and cooling track Mira's emotional arc. However, its mechanics are abstract (resonance, calcified hope) rather than grounded in choice-constraint, and "symbiosis" in the pocket feels like symbolic convenience rather than causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Shared anxieties (Mira's dread of translation failing; the child's fear of being forgotten) are named explicitly in paragraph 14 and surface again in the peak beat when Mira speaks the decrypted phrases aloud. The concept shapes the dominant stake (grafting meaning, unknotting fear) and the closure (kinship over grief). However, the anxieties are told rather than dramatized through conflicting options. The phrase "shared anxieties...braid into something that could bear weight" is thematic assertion, not on-page pressure. Present across all three gates but functions more as theme than tactic-shaping force.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Shrewdly innocent" appears once in paragraph 2 as a label for Mira's gaze in past ceasefire work. It does not constrain or enable any on-page action. No visible trade-off or cost tied to this trait. The attribute is told in backstory exposition and never tested under present pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Unknot" appears in five instances: decrypting the cast (paragraphs 11–13), tracing tremor in lines (14), speaking decrypted phrases (16), smudges rearranging (18), and closing reflection (21). The unknotting action drives the middle beat and the peak turn when the cast's scribbles shift from frantic to gentle. The verb is metaphorically consistent and shapes the final image ("knots released—not gone, but transformed"). However, the action itself is abstract—tracing and whispering—rather than a physical, high-stakes choice. Swappable with "decode" or "translate" with minor edits, though the specific verb charges the thematic resonance.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The method (decrypting smudged notes on a child's cast) is signaled in paragraph 9 (cast leaning against pillar) and executed in paragraphs 11–15 (Mira kneels, decrypts "not with linguistics, but with empathy," traces script, reads aloud). The mechanics matter: the cast's smudges shift in response to Mira's spoken phrases, creating the unknotting turn. The method shapes two beats (decryption and transformation) and contributes to closure. However, the empathy-decryption is told rather than shown through specific linguistic or sensory cues, and the cast could be replaced with a diary or drawing with structural similarity.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The mist-clad atrium at twilight is vividly described (glass ceiling, condensation, moss-slick pillar, mist curling at ankles) and appears in six paragraphs. The setting provides atmosphere and the mist "thins" as Mira completes the unknotting, tracking her emotional shift. However, the atrium does not constrain Mira's choices or supply resources that alter her tactics. She moves through it without spatial friction. The setting is present at setup, middle, and ending, but functions as backdrop rather than pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>The anesthetic timeframe bookends the story (opening hum, closing lullaby) and is mentioned in three beats. The drug "weights her limbs" and causes thoughts to "unspool," providing a perceptual filter. However, the anesthetic does not tighten decisions or create a live clock. Mira's actions (kneeling, decrypting, speaking, pressing coral) proceed without urgency or time-pressure. The timeframe adds atmosphere but does not alter tactics or escalate stakes.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The motivation (graft new meaning onto old wounds) is explicitly stated in paragraph 6 and governs Mira's arc: she seeks neither escape nor erasure but to "let the scar tissue breathe." The desire drives her decryption of the cast and her whispered affirmation, shaping two beats and the closure (acceptance of kinship, carrying pain with grace). However, the motivation is told in exposition rather than dramatized through conflicting wants. The friction between grafting and letting-breathe is asserted in the closing reflection ("learned to carry it with grace") but not tested through on-page choice-cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Lotus-hearted ache" appears once near the end (paragraph 24) as a descriptor for Mira's emotional state, reframed from grief to kinship. The tone throughout is elegiac, lyric, and gently mournful (salt and silence, mist, twilight, ghost-pressure) and modulates subtly as the atrium "exhales" and twilight "deepens into something softer, kinder." The tone is coherent and charges the final image of Mira walking lighter. However, "lotus-hearted" is introduced late and functions as a label rather than an on-page texture. The tone does not shift dramatically under pressure; it remains a single sustained mood.</comment>
