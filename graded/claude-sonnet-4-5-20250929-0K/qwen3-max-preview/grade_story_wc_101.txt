<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elira's motivation is clear and consistent—intergenerational support through anonymous care—and her actions align throughout. The piece struggles with internal contradiction; her motives are declared rather than shown through embodied tension, and secondary characters (Kael, Maris) appear as functions rather than pressures. The final choice to pass the bell forward is thematically apt but arrives without visible cost or foreclosed path on the page; the ending reads more as continuation than alteration.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens inferred: Accumulative/Textural—pressure accretes through repeated basket deliveries and the bell's shifting presence. Orientation anchors arrive within the first 120 words (arbor, Elira, exile community, sanctions). The closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration via the bell's ringing and the passing of baskets, but the cost remains abstract; no specific option is foreclosed, no tactic altered. The piece teaches a pattern of accretion but the final image ("passed into other hands") declares rather than demonstrates the reweighting.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The terra-cotta arbor is visually anchored early and returns at key beats (midnight runs, soup gathering, bell placement). Sensory detail is selective—frost, mist, steam from bowls—and the ridge geography constrains movement (uphill carries, eastern huts). The arbor functions as micro-setting and charges the final image when the bell is left on the stone table. Spatial choreography remains clear across time shifts.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—sustaining community cohesion under sanctions—is signaled early and remains coherent. Escalation reads as density increase (more baskets, more participants) rather than a tightening that narrows options. The note ("Why stay anonymous?") offers a micro-turn but Elira's response costs nothing on the page. The sanctions deepen, yet the narrative declares resilience without showing a trade-off or foreclosed tactic; coincidence (others joining) complicates but does not force a decision with visible price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme—anonymous solidarity as resilience—emerges organically from the basket runs and the bell's mute presence. The final image ("passed into other hands") attempts Conceptual Repricing by reweighting the individual savior into collective endurance, but the moral is stated rather than implied ("That's how we outlast them"). Subtext operates in the bell's silence and the unsigned baskets; thematic complexity is present in the tension between secrecy and invitation, though the closing declaration flattens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV stays anchored to Elira with no head-hopping. Distance is stable; perceptual signature is present in her focus on textures (worn silver, cloth-wrapped loaves, feathered frost). Diction is controlled and voice-consistent, leaning toward lyric compression without obscuring clarity. The piece uses free indirect style cleanly. Brief convergence in the community soup scene is handled through Elira's frame, maintaining focalization.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings shift across the text. Information density is high—most lines advance atmosphere, character stance, or symbolic weight. Minor loops appear: "The bell stayed silent. For now. The story hadn't ended. It had simply passed into other hands" recycles the continuation idea across adjacent lines (−0.2). Figurative language ("hunger followed like a shadow," "frost feathered the ridge") is selective and coherent. No template cadence or register drift; clarity and momentum remain strong.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The premise—anonymous aid under siege—transforms a familiar mutual-aid trope through the specific constraint of anonymity as doctrine and the bell as silent covenant. The arbor, baskets, and bell accrue particular texture, avoiding generic resistance-community templates. The final turn (bell ringing, baskets with coins) grows from prior pattern. Risk is moderate; the piece commits to quiet accumulation without overt confrontation, though the emotional arc remains somewhat predictable within its lyric frame.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elira appears early, drives the basket runs across multiple beats, and frames the soup gathering where she articulates the bell's meaning. Her decision to remain anonymous and her final walk into the dark shape tactics and closure. Present in setup, development, and payoff with causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The antique silver bell is introduced in the opening, placed after deliveries as signature, receives a note beneath it, is centered at the soup table, and is rung for the first time in the penultimate beat. It reweights meaning across beats and charges the final image. Present in all three gates with strong closure linkage and irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Anonymous donations are the engine of the midnight runs, shape the community's whispered belief ("Someone out there sees us"), and drive Elira's refusal to claim credit when the note asks. The concept constrains tactics (no names, no ledgers) and underpins the final passage about succession. Present across all gates with causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Gently persistent" is declared early ("gentle, persistent, untraceable") and echoed in the final line ("gently persistent, into the dark"). It colors Elira's rhythm (repeated uphill walks, quiet deliveries) but does not constrain a choice with visible cost; the trait is illustrative rather than a source of friction or tradeoff. Lyric reprise reweights tone but lacks developmental pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Declare" appears in the opening ("The act itself declared"), in the bell's "declaration woven into amplified quiet," and Elira's table speech ("This doesn't belong to me..."). The action is thematic but does not drive a major turn; the narrative recounts declarations without showing a moment where declaration alters options or incurs cost. Present but ornamental to escalation.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Midnight food runs are introduced early ("midnight food runs—gentle, persistent, untraceable"), shape the basket deliveries across multiple beats (children find milk, elders find figs, frozen midnight note exchange), and frame the final walk. The method's mechanics (baskets, timing, anonymity) matter to tactics and closure. Present in all gates with causal work.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The terra-cotta arbor on the ridge is anchored in the opening, serves as the staging point for basket runs, becomes "chapel, archive, anchor" for intergenerational teaching, hosts the soup gathering, and holds the bell in the final image. It constrains movement (uphill walks) and charges the ending. Present across all gates with spatial pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The sanctions period is signaled early ("when the sanctions began and hunger followed"), deepens midway ("Sanctions deepened. Imports vanished. Fuel rationed"), and frames the scarcity that drives the basket runs. Time pressure shapes tactics (rationing, seed distribution, candles) but does not tighten a live clock at closure. Present in setup and development; closure linkage is thematic rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Intergenerational support is dramatized early ("binding the young to the old"), shown through on-page teaching (teenagers mend nets, elders share root knowledge), and articulated at the soup gathering where children nestle against grandparents. The motivation drives the basket runs and the bell's passage. Present across all gates; friction is light but cost is visible in sustained effort.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Amplified quiet" governs tone throughout: the bell's silence, whispered belief, the single trembling note that "hung in the cold air like a vow," and the final image of the silent bell. Tone modulates with pressure (frost and mist at the note exchange, steam and warmth at the soup) and charges the ending. Coherent across beats and integral to the closure effect.</comment>
