<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias is consistently characterized through grief-shaped silence and ritual tending, with the sea glass anchor providing concrete embodiment. His choices to deliver letters, arrange stones, and continue humming show agency, though the internal contradictions remain somewhat static rather than acting simultaneously in scene. The final turn toward louder humming suggests earned movement, but the change feels more declared than dramatized through prior pressure. Motivation is clear and the backstory integration serves the present stance, yet the peak moments lack the visceral embodied conflict that would elevate to high band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes a situational lens: Elias maintains ritual connection against isolation, the lamp's extinction tests his commitment, and the closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) when he rows away humming louder, his ache transformed to "luminescent" beacon. Orientation anchors quickly (skipper, coast, lighthouse). The cost—continuing despite the hollowing, the ache reframed but not erased—is felt rather than decisive action. One meaningful deepening occurs when the lamp flickers out and he responds with the glass and stone ritual, tightening his commitment. The closure effect is legible but relies heavily on lyric assertion ("luminescent, glowing softly") rather than a concrete image that makes the reconfiguration undeniable on its own.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The haunted lighthouse, sea glass, and stone cairns create vivid micro-setting that constrains choices: the lamp's extinction forces Elias to his ritual objects, the western window hosts the cairn. Sensory detail is strong ("velvet dark," "cobalt blue," "river-smooth stones") and filtered through his grief-trained perception. The setting charges the final image when the lamp flickers back on behind him. However, occupational detail (supply runs, oil drums, wicks) remains mostly atmospheric rather than constraining a choice at the closure beat, keeping this just below the 9+ gate despite otherwise strong execution.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—sustaining fragile connection rituals against loneliness and loss—is signaled early and coheres throughout. The lamp's extinction creates one meaningful pressure point that narrows options: Elias must rely solely on his personal anchors (glass, stones) rather than the spectral light. His choice to complete the cairn and descend without looking back demonstrates agency with felt cost (the "hollowing" that shifts to luminescence). The escalation is situational: pressure deepens rather than reversing through causal turns. The cost is more emotional reframing than a foreclosed path, trending toward the lower end of the 7-band despite clean coherence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of connection through anonymous ritual emerges organically from the letter chain, cairns, and lamp-tending without overt statement. The sea glass and stones accumulate meaning across beats, and the final image—humming louder "for anyone—or no one—who might need to hear it"—offers a resonant answer to isolation without moralizing. Subtext operates well in the ghost-light metaphor and the choice not to turn around. The "luminescent ache" construction borders on articulating the thesis but stays grounded in the sea glass's glow and his embodied action, avoiding full thematic echo penalty. Strong thematic coherence with minor lyric over-reach prevents entry to 8+.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited with tight focalization; perceptual signature is distinct (grief-trained silence, attention to small tangibles). Diction remains consistent and voice-motivated throughout ("feathered tax collectors," "bottled feeling," "luminescent ache"). Free indirect style is clean, psychic distance stable. The prose reflects Elias's mind—concrete objects over abstraction, ritual over speech—and modulates appropriately when the lamp goes out. No head-hopping, no dialogue to evaluate. The "luminescent ache" phrase at the end slightly elevates register but remains tethered to the sea glass image, avoiding full drift. Strong control with one hairline tonal lift at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies well; sentence openings and lengths create natural cadence. Information density is high in the opening (skipper role, cargo, letters, grief all compressed efficiently). The stone-stacking sequence is concrete and propulsive. However, the final paragraph stacks abstract emotional summarizing ("warmth he carried," "ache...wasn't sharp anymore—it was luminescent," "quiet beacon he himself had lit") where a concrete final image would land harder. Minor filter-verb use ("felt it," "knew someone would") in peak beats slightly dulls immediacy. The "feathered tax collectors" and "velvet dark" show strong figurative control elsewhere, but the closure beat leans toward telling the transformation rather than showing it through action or perception, applying the −0.6 to −0.8 range for summary in the final third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The combination of lighthouse setting, anonymous letter chain, and stone-message cairns creates a specific synthesis, and the grief-to-tending arc feels grounded. The "haunted by echoes" rather than specters is a fresh inflection. However, the core premise—solitary keeper finding meaning through ritual connection after spousal loss—follows a familiar template without a non-obvious moral calculus or lived detail that fully transforms it. The ghost-light convenience (flickers out to create pressure, flickers back to affirm) feels slightly arranged. Emotional truth is present but the arc's inevitability in hindsight is moderate rather than striking, placing this in mid-6 range per the Derivative Premise Guardrail.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elias is established immediately and drives all on-page action: choosing to climb, performing the oil work, placing the sea glass, arranging the cairn, and descending without looking back. His reticence shapes his solitary method and the humming detail. He appears in all three gates (setup, middle cairn choice, closure humming) and his decisions directly create the story's tightening and final resonant image. The role is irreplaceable (supply runs enable the letter chain and lighthouse access). Coastal setting and solitary profession make the character's traits and stakes organic. Minor deduction for the grief-to-luminescence transformation being more asserted than dramatically tested on the page, but overall integration is strong across beats and closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The sea glass appears in three beats: the backstory anchor (found after the storm), placed on the sill when the lamp goes out, and pulsing "like a second heart" in the final paragraph. It is irreplaceable (exact shade of wife's scarf, ocean's apology) and its role as physical embodiment of "bottled safety" directly supports the motivation element. However, the glass is handled once on-page (placed on sill) and then only referenced as sensation in the pocket at closure—no second active use. The final "pulsed against his ribs" is told rather than shown through gesture or choice. Strong setup and thematic charge, but lacking the second distinct on-page handling or tactical constraint that would push into 8+ range. Scores in lower 7-band for clear causal presence with moderate closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The anonymous letter chain is described in the opening paragraph as backstory context for Elias's role ("anonymous, unsigned, part of a fragile chain meant to stitch loneliness into something shared"). It frames his motivation and explains the supply runs but does not constrain any on-page choice or return at closure. The cairn ritual and humming function as parallel connection gestures but are distinct actions, not direct manifestations of the letter mechanism. Setup gate is met (present in first third), but development and payoff gates fail—the concept does not shape tactics in the tower or appear in the final image. Functional background element that motivates character role but remains swappable with any similar connection ritual without altering plot structure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Warmly observant" is demonstrated through Elias noticing the cairns, selecting "river-smooth stones with ritual care," and the detail-rich perception of the tower (cobwebs, rusted gears, refracted moonlight). His observant nature enables the stone arrangement and charges the final choice to hum "for anyone—or no one—who might need to hear it." However, there is no on-page cost or tradeoff tied specifically to this trait—no moment where observation creates vulnerability or slows action under pressure. The warmth is more asserted in the final summary ("warmth he carried") than shown through a discrete gesture. Present in setup and middle, touches closure via the observant humming choice, but lacks the visible constraint or price that would elevate above mid-band. Functional enabler without dramatized friction.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Protect" drives multiple beats: protecting the letter ritual (described as his role in opening), protecting the lamp by hauling supplies and beginning oil work, and protecting the cairn tradition by arranging stones. When the lamp fails, his response is to protect meaning through personal ritual (glass, stones). The final image—humming louder—extends protection to "anyone—or no one," converting inward grief to outward signal. The action shapes the dominant stake, appears in all three gates, and the closure image ("protect what fragile light remained") explicitly names it. Removing "protect" would require replacing the entire premise and climax structure. Strong integration across beats and indispensable to the closure's resonance. Minor deduction for the protect-warmth overlap being somewhat abstract at the end rather than concretely tested, but otherwise exemplary.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The stone-stacking method is introduced mid-story ("generations of keepers had left cairns...A way of stacking stones as messages: three flat for 'I'm here,' one tall for 'I miss you,' two leaning for 'Stay strong'") and Elias performs the ritual with specific detail ("three flat, then one tall, then two leaning inward like arms offering shelter"). It constrains his middle choice (he must select and arrange stones rather than write or speak) and embodies the protect/connection theme. Setup gate narrowly met (appears just past the first third); development gate clear (the arranging is the key middle action); payoff gate marginal (stones are mentioned once more in the final abstraction but not charged in the closing image). The mechanics matter in the moment but do not return transformed. Lyric reprise is weak. Scores in lower 6-band for functional middle integration without strong closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The haunted lantern room is established early with vivid detail (spiral stairs, cobwebbed, "humming with strange warmth," ghost-light) and directly creates the story's central pressure: the lamp flickers out, forcing Elias to his personal rituals. The vertical space (climbing to reach the room, descending after) structures the action. The room's prior use by "generations of keepers" enables the cairn tradition. The lamp's return flicker at closure affirms but does not resolve Elias's choice. The setting is irreplaceable—no other location would allow the lamp-extinction test or cairn access. Present in all three gates, creates the key constraint, and participates in closure when the lamp returns. Strong integration with visible pressure and causal linkage. Minor deduction for the ghost-light mechanism feeling slightly convenient (flickers out/on for symbolic timing) rather than fully organic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the lamp flickers out" marks the midpoint turn when darkness forces Elias to his rituals. Before the flicker, he is performing routine supply work; after, he must rely on memory and touch. The time constraint is present (he completes the cairn, descends, and rows home within the story window) but not tightly pressured—no clock or urgency shapes his choices. The flicker is a clean gate that structures the two halves, yet the "after" period could be extended or compressed without altering tactics. Setup and development gates met (flicker signals and enables the key choice), but the time element does not return charged at closure. Functional structural marker with moderate causal weight, lacking the live ticking pressure that would push into 7+ range.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The motivation "to bottle the feeling of safety" is made concrete through the sea glass ("his anchor, his bottled feeling of safety") and dramatized when Elias places it on the sill in the dark—choosing to externalize his private talisman as part of the ritual. The desire is conflicted: he carries safety yet still feels "a hollowing, a draft where safety used to sit," and the ache persists even as it transforms to luminescence. Friction is present but somewhat muted—no on-page moment where the desire to preserve safety costs him another value (e.g., true solitude, letting go). The motivation shapes middle and closure beats and is irreplaceable, but the told quality of the final emotional shift ("wasn't sharp anymore—it was luminescent") reduces the felt cost. Solid integration across gates with moderate dramatized friction, scoring in lower 6-band for visible but not high-cost tension.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Tone is consistent: elegiac diction ("reticent," "grief had trained him," "velvet dark"), lyric cadence, and the recurring "luminescent ache" motif create a coherent atmosphere from opening to close. Modulation occurs when the lamp flickers out (tone darkens: "hollowing, a draft where safety used to sit") and again at closure (brightening: "luminescent, glowing softly," "louder this time"). The final image—humming beneath stars—directly enacts the tone rather than merely describing it. The "luminescent ache" phrase in the final paragraph risks over-articulation but is anchored to the sea glass's glow and the physical act of humming, keeping it grounded. Tone charges the closure image and is indispensable to the story's emotional texture. Strong integration with purposeful modulation and clear closure linkage, reaching lower 8-band despite minor lyric assertion at the end.</comment>
