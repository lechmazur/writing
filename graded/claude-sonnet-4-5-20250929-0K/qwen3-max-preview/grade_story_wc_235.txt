<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The protagonist's interiority is concrete and character-particular ("feral nostalgia—not sweet longing, but rabid, snarling recollections"), with embodied emotion in key moments (the guitar chord "vibrates in my molars"). Internal conflict is shown through contradictory impulses—jealousy of past selves versus the drive to document chaos. However, the parade of past-self visitations feels more like a catalog than dramatized pressure that forces micro-choices; the younger selves appear, are observed, then vanish without the protagonist making decisions that alter present options until the scroll-writing itself becomes the resolution.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates images and past-self encounters toward a closure moment where the protagonist "braids the threads" and the scroll "has a shape"—a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where options crystallize. Cost is legible in the line "The grave is still there, waiting, but it's smaller now, less a verdict and more a footnote," and the renunciation of "clean endings." The orientation is present (cabin, after seeing grave, chronicler trade), but the string of past-self encounters lacks a clear tightening mechanism under the accumulative lens until the final third; the middle reads more as repetition than intensification, weakening the escalation that should reweight the dominant stake.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The cabin is anchored early with vivid, selective detail ("pine resin and damp wool," "old timber sighs," "wind outside scrapes branches like quills against parchment") that reflects the chronicler's professional lens. The birch bark scroll functions as micro-setting and constrains a choice—its fibers "repel my pen, as if memory itself resists being tamed"—before the protagonist writes through the jealousy and it "darkens with script, absorbing my rage." The mountain setting charges the final image ("valleys I'll never hike sober again") and the scroll "hums against my thigh, warm as living skin," integrating environment and object into the closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—distilling chaos into legible narrative—is signaled early and drives the action. However, the escalation under the Accumulative lens is weak: the protagonist encounters past selves, writes about jealousy, then "chases versions of myself through collapsing libraries and burning playgrounds," but these encounters don't meaningfully narrow options or raise cost until the scroll is full. The tightening arrives late ("By dawn, the scroll is full"), and the agency moment (writing through jealousy) lacks visible tradeoffs; the scroll simply "cooperates" once the protagonist commits, making the resolution feel easier than earned.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: feral nostalgia as "rabid, snarling recollections," jealousy sharpening focus "like a blade on stone," and the insight that "Endings are just seams where one story stitches into the next, ragged but resilient." The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer—"I soar. Not away. Not toward. Just… through. The chaos isn't gone. But now, it has a shape. And a name. Mine"—that reweights the premise without stating a moral. Minor intrusion: "I get jealous of past selves because they still believed in clean endings" leans slightly explicit, but the line is brief and the thematic work is otherwise earned through image and action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and controlled: "lucid dream chronicler by trade, by curse, by compulsion" establishes idiom, and the perceptual signature is specific ("frosting blue as glacier ice," "snarling recollections that bite"). Psychic distance is stable, and the syntax modulates effectively under pressure ("I want to scream at him…Instead, I reach for the scroll"). Minor register drift: "cartography of collapse" and "alchemy of turning feral nostalgia into something legible" edge toward elevated diction, but remain plausibly character-particular given the chronicler profession. No dialogue is present; interiority is free of filter-verb stacks.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally with strong imagistic density ("the wind outside scrapes branches like quills against parchment," "each ink-stroke a landmark in the wilderness of what-was"). Information density is high; most lines advance character or atmosphere. However, patterned artifacts appear: paraphrase loops in the past-self encounters ("He doesn't speak, just strums…I want to scream at him" / "He stares at me like I'm the ghost, then vanishes") and repetitive sentence stems in the middle third ("I write about," "I chase," "I roll it tight"). The figurative density remains high without muddling, but the loops and template cadence in the second third penalize Q7 cumulatively by −0.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of lucid-dream chronicler profession, feral nostalgia as "rabid" rather than sweet, and the birch bark scroll as a cartographic tool is specific and non-obvious. The jealousy-of-past-selves angle transforms a familiar regret motif through professional lens and embodied detail. However, the "artist struggles to create, then breaks through" template is visible, and the parade of past-self visitations leans on a well-worn structure. Risk-taking in the lyric voice and the scroll-as-living-skin final image elevate the piece within the band; no proximity echoes detected.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Lucid dream chronicler shapes the protagonist's perception ("paid to wander others' subconscious labyrinths"), motivates the retreat to the cabin, and colors the scroll-writing action. The trait is present in all three gates (setup, middle reflection, closure: "I'm the one braiding the threads"). However, the chronicler's professional tools or training do not visibly constrain a choice under pressure; the role functions more as backstory credential than on-page lever. Two-gate presence with thematic resonance places it mid-band; lack of causal constraint keeps it below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The birch bark scroll is handled across multiple beats: protagonist unfurls it in opening, it "repels my pen" mid-story (constraining action), then "the ink flows" when the protagonist writes through jealousy, and it "darkens with script" before the protagonist rolls it tight and carries it ("hums against my thigh, warm as living skin") at closure. All three gates met; causal pressure clear (constrains writing, then enables breakthrough); closure linkage strong (transforms from resistant to living). Slight swappability (any writing surface could work with edits) and the fact that the scroll doesn't force a tradeoff keep it shy of 8.5+.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Feral nostalgia is defined early ("not sweet longing, but rabid, snarling recollections that bite") and shapes the emotional texture of the memories. The concept is invoked at closure ("turning feral nostalgia into something legible") and the scroll absorbs "my rage, my awe, my jaded wonder." However, the concept doesn't constrain tactics on the page—the protagonist doesn't make a choice *because* the nostalgia is feral rather than sweet. It colors stakes but doesn't alter options; primarily thematic rather than causal. Two gates (setup, closure) with thematic work earn mid-band; lack of middle constraint caps further rise.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Chronologically confused is demonstrated in action: "I'll reach for my thermos and find my college thesis instead, or mistake today's sunrise for the one after my first heartbreak." The trait is signaled early and acknowledged at closure ("Chronologically confused? Maybe. But I'm no longer lost inside the tangle"). However, the confusion doesn't constrain a choice with cost—the protagonist navigates it without visible tradeoff, and it doesn't block or enable the scroll-writing breakthrough. Label is embodied but doesn't shape tactics; two gates, no causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Soar appears early in dreams ("I soar over childhood rooftops…not with joy, but with the weight of knowing I'll never land where I began"), recurs in the hunting dream ("I'm not fleeing—I'm hunting"), and anchors the closure image ("without wings, without wind, without even trying, I soar. Not away. Not toward. Just… through"). All three gates met; the final image recharges prior mentions and shifts meaning. However, the action itself doesn't force a causal turn—the protagonist could resolve the conflict without soaring; it's primarily a metaphor that charges resonance rather than altering tactics. Strong lyric reprise earns upper-mid band but lack of causal necessity caps below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Getting jealous of past selves is signaled early ("I'm getting jealous of past selves again"), demonstrated in two encounters (twenty-two-year-old with guitar, thirty-five-year-old with resignation letter), and drives the breakthrough: "I write about the jealousy, raw and unvarnished, how it sharpens my focus like a blade on stone." The method enables the scroll to accept ink and shapes the final stance ("I get jealous of past selves because they still believed in clean endings. I know better now"). All three gates; causal pressure clear (jealousy becomes fuel); closure linkage present. Slight reduction for the explicit thematic statement in penultimate paragraph, but strong integration overall.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Mountain ranger cabin anchors setting early and provides isolation that enables reflection. The cabin's "walls breathe with old timber sighs" and at closure "its windows like half-lidded eyes, watching" offer atmospheric bookends. However, the cabin doesn't constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome—the scroll-writing could occur in any isolated location. Present in setup and closure (two gates) with atmospheric contribution, but no causal pressure; swappable with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>After seeing your own grave is invoked in the opening ("After seeing your own grave…I'd fled to these peaks") and returns at closure ("The grave is still there, waiting, but it's smaller now"). However, the timeframe is vague—no urgency or ticking clock; the grave sighting is backstory anchor rather than present pressure. Setup and closure gates met, but no middle development and no visible time constraint that alters tactics. Primarily atmospheric frame; replaceable with another inciting crisis.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>To distill chaos into narrative is the explicit motivation, signaled in opening ("I'm here to distill chaos into narrative, to leash the feral with ink") and fulfilled at closure ("the alchemy of turning feral nostalgia into something legible"). The desire drives the scroll-writing action and the protagonist's conflict with the resistant birch bark. However, the motivation is more stated than dramatized in conflicted choices—there's no moment where the protagonist weighs abandoning the distillation versus another want. All three gates present; causal role clear but friction between wants and costs is thin.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Jaded wonder is established early ("my jaded wonder at how brightly we burn before we gutter out") and sustained throughout: clinical observations ("like a fossilized confession") layered with lyric imagery ("frosting blue as glacier ice," "warm as living skin"). The tone modulates under pressure—sharper during jealousy ("I want to scream at him"), expansive at closure ("I soar…through")—and charges the final image's paradox of control and mystery. Coherent through turns; distinct perceptual signature. Minor penalty for slight tonal drift toward elevated register in a few lines, but overall strong execution.</comment>
