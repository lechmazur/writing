<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elira's interior world is concretely established through her professional lens and shift to dust-pattern observation. Her motivation ("to strip needless drama") is told but then dramatized through precise micro-choices in the greenhouse—sleeping beside the slide, stopping glove use, inviting schoolchildren. The weeping moment and final realization earn the arc, though the internal contradictions remain largely conceptual rather than enacted under immediate pressure. Backstory is extensive (~25%) but anchored to present perception and primes the closure cleanly.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates density through dust-pattern observations that reweight Elira's understanding from neutron-star scale to terrestrial decay. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (the "I found them here, in the dust" realization) with conceptual cost—she has abandoned her field and repurposed her career. Orientation is clear by paragraph two (who, where, post-flood). One tightening: the logarithmic spiral discovery that mirrors her neutron models, narrowing her interpretive stance. Cost is conceptual and felt in the career pivot, legible in the final exchange.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The storm-damaged greenhouse is established early and functions as both setting and laboratory—broken panes, leaning beams, patched skylight all constrain Elira's movements and shape her interferometer setup. Micro-setting details (dew on dust-coated leaves, wind eddies, humidity gradients) drive observations and reweight the space from "damaged" to "evolving." The dust slide anchored on the east wall charges the final image with morning light. Sensory hierarchy reflects her scientist's attention (ozone, rot, pressure shifts) without catalog excess.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: validation of her decay-as-accumulation model, signaled in the greenhouse return and sustained through pattern tracking. One meaningful deepening: the logarithmic spiral discovery mirrors her neutron simulations, crystallizing her thesis and prompting the career pivot. The weeping moment and subsequent publication shift demonstrate agency with visible cost (professional credibility, peer dismissal). No external antagonist, but the implicit pressure of colleagues calling it "a breakdown" and reviewers dismissing her as "poetic" adds friction. The escalation is conceptual and accumulative rather than causal confrontation, fitting the inferred lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the dust-to-cosmos synthesis: "decay as iterative refinement" enacted through Elira's shift from neutron stars to butterfly scales. The piece resists moralizing—reviewers dismiss her, she smiles, no thesis is declared. The final exchange ("I found them here, in the dust") reweights prior material without stating a lesson. Subtext operates in her choice to stop wearing gloves, inviting children, and renaming damage as evolution. The kindled-humility weeping is earned by prior observation, not asserted. Minor slip: "Poetry, after all, was just physics with fewer equations and more awe" edges toward stated theme but remains character-filtered.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited with stable distance; Elira's perceptual signature (neutron-star models, fractal spirals, micro-vibrations) is distinct and scientist-specific. Diction is controlled and purpose-driven ("preprocesses reality," "temporal lens") without unmotivated register drift. No dialogue on the page; the final quoted exchange is brief and voice-consistent. Occasional filter verbs ("she believed," "she theorized," "she realized") are voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy. One register slip: "kindled humility" in narration reads slightly elevated for the moment, though it may be intentional tonal modulation at the turn.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines advance observation or reweighting. Rhythm varies purposefully (short declaratives at turns: "She wept then," "It was evolving"). Minor loop: "not from sorrow, but [X]" appears twice ("not from sentiment, but for structure" / "not from sorrow, but kindled humility"), creating template echo. Paraphrase slip: paragraphs on dust self-organization restate "not coincidence" / "self-organized" without added pressure. No major clarity loss, but these artifacts touch the closure third, preventing 9+ eligibility globally per Q7 artifact rules. Figurative language (fractal spirals, living aurora) is coherent and motivated by POV.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The neutron-star-to-butterfly-dust synthesis is specific and non-obvious; the piece commits fully to the conceit and follows its implications through career pivot and pedagogical shift. Transformation test: the emotional arc depends on this exact pairing of cosmic scale and micro-particulars. Risk: sustained metaphorical equivalence without ironic distance could feel precious, but the piece grounds it in concrete interferometer work and dust geometries. Proximity check: no close echoes detected. The "I found them here" closure line risks sentiment but is earned by prior pattern work. Freshness is conceptual rather than plot-based, fitting the accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elira's professional identity frames the piece from paragraph one and her choice to return "not for the ruined orchids... but for the silence—and the dust" drives the observation sequence. Her decision to stop wearing gloves, sleep beside the slide, and pivot to phenomenology reviews are key turns. The character is essential across beats and shapes closure, though some passages lean observational rather than decisional.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Butterfly-wing dust is introduced early ("Morpho imperialis, final flight"), handled concretely in the interferometer setup (layer-by-layer application), drives the spiral discovery beat, and charges the final image on the east wall. It constrains her method (diffracting light, fractal scales) and participates in closure ("I found them here, in the dust"). Specificity is high; generic particulate would not carry the same fractal-cosmic resonance.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Gradual change is thematized early ("cataclysms were merely punctuation, not plot") and enacted through dust sedimentation, dew accumulation, and self-organizing geometries. It shapes her observational stakes and informs the career pivot from "breakdown" to "recalibration." The concept could be more causally linked to immediate choices; much work is conceptual framing rather than tactical constraint. Still, it reweights the closure image and informs her pedagogy shift.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Preprocesses reality" is introduced mid-piece as theory ("not by altering physics, but by filtering perception") and illustrated through dust patterns altering interference fringes and perception of ruin versus calibration. It enables her interpretive shift but remains largely conceptual rather than constraining a concrete choice with visible cost. Label-only in some passages; would benefit from a moment where preprocessing forces a tactical trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Decay is present early (neutron decay timelines, Earth decays faster) and the piece tracks decay-as-accumulation through dust settling, vine growth, and mushroom colonization. The spiral discovery and career pivot trace to this action. However, "decay" is somewhat swappable with "change" or "sedimentation" without major edits; the concept does more thematic than causal work. It shapes stakes but not irreplaceably.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Accumulated dust patterns are signaled early (sifting particulate, layer-by-layer application) and their mechanics matter: interference fringes shift rhythmically, geometries form (hexagons, spirals), and the logarithmic spiral discovery mirrors accretion models. The method shapes her observation protocol and drives the "self-organized" realization. It appears in closure (slide on east wall, "found them here, in the dust") and is irreplaceable—random settling would not yield the cosmic symmetry.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Storm-damaged greenhouse is established in the opening beat and pressures every observation: broken panes admit draft, patched skylight frames the slide, leaning beams create micro-vibrations that affect dust settling. It supplies the interferometer corner, humidity source, and spatial anchors (east wall, drafty door). The setting evolves causally (vines, mushrooms) and Elira's renaming it from "damaged" to "evolving" charges closure. Essential and irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>"After the flood" anchors the opening and "years passed" marks the final section, but the timeframe does not tighten decisions within the piece. The flood is a prior event; its aftermath enables the dust work but does not impose a live clock. Weeks of observation are tracked ("over weeks") but do not alter tactics. The element frames context more than it constrains; functional but not urgent.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"To strip needless drama from existence" is stated early and dramatized through her rejection of "breakdown" framing, choice to sleep beside the slide, and refusal to call the greenhouse "damaged." It informs her pedagogy (teaching breath-mapping to children) and underlies the career pivot. The motivation shapes stance and closure, though it is primarily conceptual rather than forcing a choice with immediate cost. Friction with peer dismissal adds weight.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Kindled humility emerges at the weeping beat ("not from sorrow, but kindled humility") and modulates the final exchanges—she smiles at reviewer dismissal, touches the glass when asked, and frames neutron stars as "here, in the dust." Tone is coherent across beats (post-flood calm, patient observation, quiet pedagogy) and charges the final image without becoming static. The phrase "kindled humility" appears once in narration; the tone itself is sustained through diction and rhythm.</comment>
