<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The tutor's interiority is concrete and his motivation—seeking beauty in difficulty—is embodied through the worry stone's tactile presence and his meditation on silence. Internal contradiction surfaces in his oscillation between palace memories and present exile, though the peak choice to "translate silence into strategy" and walk toward the treeline remains more declarative than dramatized under visible cost. The phrase "hopeful melancholy" skirts diagnostic label-speak but remains just within voice; however, the final decision lacks a lived tradeoff on the page—no pupils wait, no concrete forfeiture anchors the turn.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (exiled tutor, magnetic nexus, twilight before eclipse) arrive early. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: density builds through memory, magnetic hum, and auroral imagery toward a final reconfiguration where he rises "spirit lighter" and commits to teaching others. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): he chooses to carry the nexus's resonance forward rather than flee. Cost is felt ("bittersweet ache," "some truths arrive too late to save kingdoms") but remains abstract; no on-page forfeiture or visible consequence alters his immediate options. The tightening—"correlate the silence" becomes "translate silence into strategy"—is conceptual rather than tactical, limiting escalation legibility.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The magnetic nexus is vividly rendered: "cold, humming stone," auroras stitching the horizon, and the field's oscillations felt as "pull and repel." The worry stone functions as micro-setting, its dent pressing into his thumb to anchor memory and meditation. Sensory detail is selective and mood-driven, and the nexus does constrain his choice—he must act "before the next phase" when the field peaks. Spatial choreography is clean (seated on stone, rising, walking to treeline), and the twilight palette (bruised violets, fading golds) charges the final image without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—discovering beauty in difficulty via translating silence—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful deepening occurs: from anxious tracing of the worry stone to a resolved decision to teach others "correlation." The nexus's magnetic surge at closure adds atmospheric pressure, yet the protagonist's agency remains meditative rather than tactical; no live option is foreclosed on the page, and the cost ("too late to save kingdoms, but just in time to save souls") is asserted rather than dramatized through a visible tradeoff. Under the Accumulative lens, the tightening is present but the felt price at the ending beat is oblique.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme—finding beauty and meaning in exile, loss, and difficulty—emerges from the tutor's meditation, the stone's evolution from anxiety totem to compass, and the eclipsed covenant metaphor. The final image (walking toward the treeline, stone warm in pocket, not looking back) offers a resonant answer without moralizing: transformation through endurance. Subtext operates in the "structured quiet between heartbeats" and the magnetic field as metaphor for hidden equilibria. The phrase "beauty blooms brightest in the soil of difficulty" skirts platitude but is anchored by prior particulars (pupils' tears, geometry of sacrifice). No overt thesisStatement mars the closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization is stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present: the tutor notices silence as "vectors, pressures, hidden equilibria" and translates magnetic oscillations as moves on an infinite board. Diction is elevated and voice-consistent, though some constructions ("the bittersweet ache of knowing some truths arrive too late") approach stock phrasing. Psychic distance remains controlled; the stone's tactile presence and his embodied reactions (knees stiff, bones tugged) ground the lyric register. Minor filter-verb stacks ("feeling the pull," "whispered a possibility") cluster in the meditation sequence but do not flatten immediacy significantly at this length.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully, with longer lyric sentences during meditation and shorter beats at closure ("He didn't look back. He didn't need to."). Information density is high; most lines layer memory, sensation, and metaphor. However, paraphrase loops appear: "translate silence" restated across multiple lines without added pressure, and "not…but" constructions recur (five instances). Template cadence: "He'd been…He'd stumbled…He would find" stems cluster. Stock metaphors: "fractures let in light," "compass calibrated to inner north." These artifacts accumulate to −0.8 in Q7 and disallow 9+ globally; none touch the closure beat directly but they dull propulsion in the middle third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The synthesis—exiled chess tutor as magnetic-field mystic seeking beauty in difficulty—is specific and earnest. The worry stone's evolution from relic to compass and the "translate silence" premise offer fresh angles. Yet the core emotional arc (exile → meditative acceptance → renewed purpose teaching others) follows a familiar template without sharp transformation. The "eclipsed covenant" and magnetic nexus provide vivid texture but remain largely atmospheric; the ending choice is contemplative rather than a bold, irreversible stake. Proximity check: "fractures let in light" echoes Leonard Cohen; "beauty blooms brightest in the soil of difficulty" reads as crafted wisdom rather than lived discovery.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The exiled chess tutor is present throughout, but his key decision—to rise, walk away, and teach others—is declarative rather than forced by an on-page reversal. He observes, meditates, and resolves; the nexus does not test him with a dilemma that his choice alters. Setup and closure gates met; middle development is contemplative. Swappable with "exiled philosopher" or "banished scholar" without major structural change.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The polished basalt worry stone with its dent appears in at least three beats: initial anxious tracing, tactile anchor during meditation ("dent pressed into his thumb"), and final transformation ("warm now…compass calibrated to inner north"). Early signal, beat involvement across beginning/middle/end, and charged reprise at closure. The dent's specificity and the stone's reweighting from anxiety relic to compass elevate integration. However, the stone does not constrain a middle choice or narrow options; it accumulates symbolic weight without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The "eclipsed covenant" is introduced mid-story as historical backstory (scholars' oaths binding knowledge to cosmic rhythm) and returns at closure ("the eclipsed covenant pulsed alive again"). Setup is delayed; it does not constrain the tutor's meditation or force a trade-off. It functions as thematic echo rather than shaping stakes or tactics on the page. Lyric reprise present but causal work absent.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Thoughtfully precise" is shown early ("dissecting royal strategies with clinical clarity") and returns at closure ("each step measured, thoughtfully precise…out of…reverence"). The trait enables his meditation method (translating silence as vectors/pressures) and caused his banishment. Setup, middle echo, closure reprise all met. However, no visible tradeoff: the trait does not cost him an on-page option or force a choice between precision and another value. Lyric integration without demonstrated constraint.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Correlate" is signaled early ("he had to correlate the silence"), recurs in the meditation sequence ("He correlated—not to predict, but to perceive"), and anchors his final teaching mission ("teach them…correlation"). Setup, development, and payoff gates met. Yet the action itself is abstract; the mechanics of correlation do not alter a middle choice or narrow options. Swappable with "translate," "synthesize," or "harmonize" without major edits. Thematic presence without causal work.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>"By translating silence" is introduced via the smuggled scroll's phrase ("Truth correlates when silence is translated") and becomes his meditation method. He "translated: the eclipse wasn't an end, but a reset." Setup (scroll) and payoff (final insight) present; middle mechanics are described but do not force a choice. The method shapes his perspective but is not tested under pressure. Functional but replaceable with "interpreting," "reading," or "parsing."</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The magnetic nexus at twilight is vividly present from the opening line and anchors all action. The setting's properties—humming stone, magnetic field oscillations, impending eclipse—create atmospheric pressure and a live timeframe. The tutor must act "before the next phase" when the field peaks. Twilight's colors charge the final image. Setup, middle presence, and closure linkage all strong. However, the nexus does not block an option or supply a resource that alters his tactics; it pressures through mood and metaphor rather than mechanical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Before the next phase" (the moon's total occlusion and magnetic field peak) is stated early and returns at closure ("Before the next phase fully claimed the sky, he turned from the nexus"). The timeframe bookends the piece but does not tighten a middle choice or force a visible tradeoff. The tutor completes his meditation and rises without racing the clock. Setup and closure mention present; middle urgency absent. Clock exists but does not alter moves.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"To discover beauty in the difficult" is stated early ("he sought not redemption, but beauty in the difficult—not as escape, but as revelation") and revisited at closure ("beauty blooms brightest in the soil of difficulty"). The motivation drives his meditation and final teaching resolve. Friction surfaces between past palace service and present exile, between saving kingdoms and saving souls. However, the cost—"bittersweet ache," truths arriving "too late"—is asserted rather than dramatized through an on-page forfeiture. Setup, middle presence, closure payoff; want/cost tension present but abstract.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Hopeful melancholy" is coherent throughout: "bruised violets and fading golds," "bittersweet ache," "quiet determination," and the final smile "not with joy, but with hopeful melancholy." Tone modulates with the magnetic surge and auroral imagery, supporting the accumulative lens. The ending image (walking toward the treeline without looking back) is charged by this dual affect. Setup, middle consistency, and closure charge all present. Minor slip: the phrase "hopeful melancholy" is stated rather than purely embodied, slightly reducing subtextual control.</comment>
