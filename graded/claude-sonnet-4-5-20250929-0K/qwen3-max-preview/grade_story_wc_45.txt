<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The protagonist exhibits consistent traits—shrewdly innocent, forgiving—but her interior life often reads as poetic meditation rather than embodied conflict under pressure. The choice to leave the tooth and walk away carries symbolic weight but minimal visible cost; her calm certainty throughout flattens tension. The arc moves from understanding to teaching without dramatized resistance or contradiction within the character. Backstory ("learned from grandmother") anchors present action but no micro-choice tests her method against doubt on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors are present early (kneeling skeptic, secret garden, changeling's tooth). The piece accumulates motifs—tooth, garden, bone-setting metaphor—and closes with the tooth pulsing and the protagonist teaching others, a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant: she commits to her method). However, cost is more asserted than felt; no choice forecloses a live path with visible friction. The hinge from solitary work to communal teaching is told ("Later, townsfolk would find…") rather than dramatized, softening closure impact.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The secret garden is vividly detailed (roses beside thistles, backward clocks, cinnamon and ozone) and anchors every beat. The hedge maze functions as a spatial constraint and invitation at closure. The tooth—handled twice, glowing with memory—charges the final image. Sensory specificity (damp soil, lilac scent, moss) is consistent and filtered through the protagonist's restorative focus, meeting the micro-setting test.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—recomposing fractured pasts into meaning—is signaled early and held. However, no on-page reversal or tightening forces a trade-off; the protagonist encounters no resistance, and her method succeeds without visible friction. The substitute body's discovery is backstory; the garden work unfolds as smooth progression. One meaningful deepening occurs (tooth pulsing, future teaching implied), but the cost remains conceptual rather than felt in her choices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme—redemption through tending mistakes, transforming grief into sacred meaning—emerges from image and action (bone-setting, tooth as altar marker). The final image (tooth pulsing "not for what was lost, but for what might still be born") reweights prior material without overt statement. However, the ending paragraph edges toward abstraction ("mistakes into constellations") and the townsfolk's future arrival is asserted, not dramatized, softening the thematic charge.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with a distinct poetic register ("shrewdly innocent," "quiet architecture of redemption"). Diction remains elevated throughout, consistent with the protagonist's contemplative stance. However, figurative density is high across most sentences without variation under pressure, and some phrases edge toward abstraction ("jagged edges of error…arranged into patterns"). No dialogue to assess. The prose exhibits textural control but occasional register drift into faux-profundity ("cleft in certainty…living threshold") without grounding in bodily experience.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Rhythm is controlled and varies purposefully; information density is high. However, figurative language appears in nearly every sentence without taught pattern or payoff, creating cumulative overwriting (−0.5). Phrases like "shrewdly innocent," "nostalgic innovation," and "quiet architecture of redemption" feel ornamental rather than propulsive. Some paraphrase loops exist ("not to undo the past, but to recompose it" / "not as a monument, but as a marker"). No major scaffold or template cadence, but the cumulative density in peak beats (tooth placement, final walk) slows momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The changeling mythos is familiar, but the protagonist's role as metaphorical bone-setter and the garden as sanctuary for communal grief offer fresh synthesis. The substitute body discovery and the tooth-as-marker reprise are purposeful. However, the core arc—solitary healer enables communal healing—follows a recognizable template without a non-obvious turn. Emotional specificity elevates execution, but the piece does not take bold structural or moral risks.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Forgiving skeptic is present throughout; her choices (kneeling, placing tooth, whispering names, leaving) shape beats. However, these are contemplative gestures rather than decisions that narrow options or alter tactics under resistance. She begins forgiving and ends forgiving with no on-page test of her stance.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Tooth appears in beat one (held in palm), beat mid (placed on stone, glows with memory), and final beat (pulsing in earth). Its meaning shifts from artifact to altar marker to living seed. It drives two distinct beats and charges the closure image, meeting high integration thresholds.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Cleft in certainty is named mid-story ("thin, trembling space between what was believed and what was true") and tied to the substitute's discovery. It frames the town's shattered myth but does not constrain the protagonist's choices on the page; she operates with calm certainty. Setup and thematic echo present; no middle development or closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Shrewdly innocent appears as descriptor in paragraph one and shapes the protagonist's approach (pity not horror, teaching not accusation). However, no on-page moment dramatizes the trait under pressure or forces a trade-off. Label-only integration.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Yearn is the protagonist's motor ("yearned…for the quiet architecture of redemption") and recurs ("she yearned to stitch"). It shapes her actions (bone-setting ritual, leaving tooth) but is compatible with many other verbs (hope, seek, intend). Present across beats and tied to closure but swappable with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Bone setting is introduced early, explained via grandmother's lineage, and enacted on-page (pressing thumbs, murmuring syllables, setting "bones of betrayal"). The method's mechanics (realigning fractured pasts) matter to the ritual and closure. It drives two beats and shapes the protagonist's tactics, though the method succeeds without friction.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Secret garden hidden behind hedge maze is the sole setting, anchors every beat, and supplies resources (moss, stone, vines). The maze rustles at closure, inviting return. The garden's paradoxes (roses/thistles, backward clocks) charge atmosphere and the final image (hedges learning to forgive). It constrains access and shapes the protagonist's ritual work.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>After substitute body is found frames the story and motivates the protagonist's garden work. The timeframe is setup-only; no live clock or deadline tightens decisions. The "later" townsfolk arrival is future-looking and asserted, not on-page. Functional but does not alter tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>To turn mistakes into constellations is stated early and dramatized through bone-setting ritual (placing tooth, teaching future visitors). The desire drives her actions across beats and is realized in the closure image (tooth pulsing, garden as wild altar). However, no friction tests the motivation; she succeeds without obstacle or cost that challenges her commitment.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Nostalgic innovation is embodied in garden details (cinnamon/ozone, backward clocks, old grammar of repair meets new myth-making). Tone is consistent and modulates gently from solitary ritual to communal invitation. It charges the final image (hedges learning to forgive, tooth as living seed) but remains stable rather than shifting under pressure.</comment>
