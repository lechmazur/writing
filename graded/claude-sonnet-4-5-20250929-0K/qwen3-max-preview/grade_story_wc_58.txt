<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The traveler's motivation is consistently rendered through concrete acts—tracing the thread, writing, folding the crane—with embodied choices like "brushing moss from their knees" anchoring interiority. Internal contradiction appears in the tension between grief and orientation ("not to mourn death, but to map"), though the choice to write and leave the parchment reads more as ritual than high-stakes agency under pressure. Elira's portrait is vividly particular, yet she remains absent; the traveler's solitary frame limits relational crucible. The final renunciation of prayer and hope in favor of mapping qualifies as Earned Stasis with visible cost, but the protagonist's emotional arc flattens into a single sustained mode rather than evolving under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who (traveler), where (shadowed garden), and when (autumn twilight, "after the last ship sails") within the opening lines. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers memories, sensory detail, and the act of writing to deepen the traveler's cartographic grief without a causal turn. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis)—the traveler stands, renounces prayer, and commits to mapping—with conceptual cost legible in the line "They mapped. And in mapping absence, they made the gone gloriously, vividly, intimately present." The single meaningful deepening occurs when the traveler finishes Elira's obituary and folds it into a crane, reweighting the act from solitary ritual to potential transmission. No causality breaks, and the lens holds through the ending, though the piece skirts illustrative summary in the middle third.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The garden is vividly rendered with selective, POV-filtered detail: "marble nymphs wept lichen tears," "ivy choked forgotten arches," "damp stone," and "withered rosebush" all anchor the traveler's solitary ritual in a decayed, autumnal space. Sensory hierarchy reflects the protagonist's priorities—touch (thread, parchment, moss), sight (crimson glow, moonlight, frost-like shimmer), and sound (leaves whispering, harbor bells silent)—without tourist catalog. The rosebush functions as micro-setting, receiving the folded crane and thus constraining the traveler's final gesture. Spatial choreography is clean: seated on stone, then standing to brush knees. The thread on the wrist recurs across beats, its warmth charging the closure image with memory and resonance, meeting the 9+ gate for Q3.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding the geography of healing by mapping absence—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates through sensory and reflective density rather than causal turns, consistent with the Accumulative lens. One meaningful deepening occurs when the traveler completes Elira's obituary and folds it into a crane, an act that moves from private ritual to potential transmission ("Perhaps they'd carry it to the cliffs"). The traveler's agency is visible in the choice to write, fold, and leave the parchment, foreclosing direct contact or hope. Cost is conceptual—renouncing prayer and hope—but the price feels more stated than embodied in a tactile trade-off or visible loss that alters later options within this single scene.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the traveler's acts: mapping absence as orientation rather than closure, projecting presence through descriptive obituaries, and finding lonesome splendor in decay. The core concept—"explained absences"—integrates through Elira's "voluntary exile" and the coup-salvaged thread. The final image—"They mapped. And in mapping absence, they made the gone gloriously, vividly, intimately present"—offers a resonant answer without moralizing, reweighting the traveler's solitary ritual as generative rather than merely elegiac. Subtext operates in the contrast between the traveler's public explanations and private knowledge ("The traveler knew better"). One weakness: the penultimate paragraph edges toward thematic statement ("not for the world, but for the quiet, lonesome splendor of those who still listened") where image alone would suffice.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited, filtered through the traveler's perceptual signature: selecting textures (damp stone, brittle leaves, lichen tears), memories (nursemaid's whisper, Elira's tremor), and renunciations ("They did not pray. They did not hope. They mapped."). Diction is elevated and consistent, with phrases like "intimate cartography" and "lonesome splendor" voice-motivated by the traveler's meditative, literary stance. Psychic distance remains controlled, and no head-hopping occurs. Two minor frictions: "Not magic. Memory, yes—but also resonance" and the repeated "Not magic" micro-paragraph feel like prose tics rather than character-specific rhythms. Under peak emotional beats (final paragraph), the rhythm compresses effectively without losing coherence, though the repeated negations ("did not pray," "did not hope") risk template cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, with lyric compression in fragments like "Not magic. Memory, yes—but also resonance" and "Tomorrow, someone else would find it." Figurative language is dense—"valleys of absence," "ocean still trapped inside," "horizon forgets to end"—but mostly coherent and voice-motivated. Two distinct issues: (a) paraphrase loops appear in adjacent lines ("not to mourn death, but to map the spaces where presence once bloomed" restated as "obituaries were an act of intimate cartography, stitching grief into grammar"), and (b) the stock metaphor "ink bleeding like old wounds" in a high-pressure beat feels generic. Filter-verb usage is light and acceptable. Information density is high in the opening and closing thirds, though the middle paragraph summarizing the traveler's method dips into expository summary. Proofreading is clean, and the final line propels closure without scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The premise—a traveler writing obituaries for the living as "intimate cartography"—offers a fresh angle on grief and absence, transforming the familiar trope of "writing to process loss" through the specific frame of mapping and the salvaged palace thread as talisman. The garden setting and autumn tone are rendered with particular, non-generic detail (lichen tears, ivy-choked arches, frost-like shimmer). One risk: the lyric-reflective mode sustains a single emotional register without sharp tonal shifts or stakes escalation, and the method of "projecting presence" is more thematic claim than dramatized mechanics. The story commits fully to its contemplative premise and follows its implications to the Earned Stasis closure, though the transformation test suggests the emotional arc could persist with different names and places, signaling mid-band freshness rather than indispensable synthesis.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The traveler is present throughout, and their choices—writing Elira's obituary, folding the crane, leaving it beneath the rosebush—create the story's only visible turns. Setup is immediate (opening line), development occurs in the middle third (completing the obituary), and payoff lands in the final beats (standing, renouncing prayer, committing to mapping). Two beats: writing and folding/leaving. Causal pressure is moderate; the traveler's decision to fold and leave the parchment shifts the act from private to transmissible, but the stakes remain internal and contemplative rather than forcing a costly trade-off. Cost is conceptual (renouncing hope) but not a visible forfeiture that alters later options within this single scene. Swappability is low; removing the traveler collapses the frame.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The weft thread appears in three beats: opening (tied around wrist, described), middle (pulsing faintly as the traveler writes), and closing (catching moonlight as the traveler stands). Setup is immediate, development includes its pulse during writing, and payoff charges the final image. The thread is handled on the page ("fingers tracing") and its meaning reweights from salvaged memento to active resonance ("Not magic. Memory, yes—but also resonance"). Causal pressure is modest; the thread's presence does not constrain a choice but enriches the thematic texture. Cost connection is conceptual—it "remembers where feet once stood"—linking the traveler's project to the coup and Elira's departure. Specificity is high (crimson, from a royal carpet, torn during coup), making it difficult to swap. Closure linkage is present but passive; the thread glows warmer but does not drive the final decision.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Explained absences—the frame of justified departures ("lover gone to sea, a sibling vanished into monastic vows, a friend swallowed by bureaucratic exile") and Elira's "voluntary exile for artistic inspiration"—is signaled early and shapes the traveler's stake (mapping these absences). Development occurs when the traveler writes Elira's obituary, knowing the official explanation is false. Payoff appears in the final paragraph's thematic restatement ("mapping absence, they made the gone gloriously, vividly, intimately present"). Two beats: setup and writing. Causal pressure is low; the concept frames motive but does not force a costly choice or narrow options on the page. The traveler's knowledge that Elira's departure was involuntary adds dramatic irony but does not alter tactics. Swappability is moderate; the concept could be replaced with "unacknowledged grief" or "hidden exiles" with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Vividly descriptive" is enacted through the traveler's writing of Elira's obituary—"not just of Elira's face or voice, but of the geography of healing she sought: cliffs where salt wind scoured regret, coves where tide pools mirrored fractured selves"—but this attribute is more narrative method than a constraining trait. Setup is implicit in the opening's lyric density, development occurs during the writing beat, and payoff lands in the line "every step stitches sky to sea." One beat: the writing. The attribute enables the traveler's project but does not impose a visible cost or trade-off; there is no moment where excessive description hinders action or where brevity would solve a problem. Swappability is high; "empathetically precise" or "obsessively detailed" could replace it with minor edits. The trait is label-consistent but does not constrain a choice.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Intimate" is enacted through the traveler's close, particular rendering of Elira ("the curve of their smile, the scent of their hair after rain, the way they hummed off-key while mending socks") and the phrase "intimate cartography." Setup is immediate (paragraph three), development occurs in the writing beat, and payoff lands in the final thematic statement ("intimately present"). Two beats: framing the method and executing it. Causal pressure is modest; intimacy shapes the traveler's approach but does not force a costly choice or narrow options. The traveler's decision to fold and leave the crane reads as transmissive rather than intimate in execution. Swappability is moderate; "detailed," "empathetic," or "personal" could replace it with adjustments. Cost connection is weak; intimacy enriches texture but does not impose a visible trade-off on the page.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Projecting presence" is signaled in paragraph seven ("by writing as if the departed still breathed beside them") and enacted during the writing of Elira's obituary. Setup is delayed (second third), development occurs in the same beat (writing), and payoff appears in the thematic closure ("made the gone gloriously, vividly, intimately present"). One beat: the writing. The method is more thematic claim than dramatized mechanics; the reader does not see how writing "as if" differs from ordinary description or how it shapes the traveler's choices. Causal pressure is low; the method enables the project but does not constrain tactics or impose a cost. Swappability is moderate; "vividly imagining" or "empathetically rendering" could replace it. Late first appearance (past 40%) caps at 4.6, but the method's thematic integration and closure linkage lift it slightly within that band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The shadowed garden in autumn is present throughout: "damp stone," "bruised twilight," "brittle and gold-rimmed" leaves, "marble nymphs wept lichen tears," "ivy choked forgotten arches," "withered rosebush," and the final "moss" the traveler brushes from their knees. Setup is immediate, development includes the rosebush that receives the folded crane, and payoff charges the final image with "shadows deepening, autumn asserting its lonesome splendor." Three beats: opening, middle (rosebush), and closing. The setting supplies a resource (the rosebush as repository) that alters the traveler's final act from retention to transmission. Causal pressure is moderate; the garden does not force a choice but enables the crane's placement. Specificity is high (lichen, ivy, brittle leaves, damp stone), and the autumn tone coheres with the traveler's melancholy orientation. Cost connection is weak; the setting enriches atmosphere but does not impose a visible trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"After the last ship sails" is signaled early ("After the last ship sails, the harbor bells fall silent, and the world forgets to wait. That was the traveler's cue.") and frames the traveler's stake: lingering in the wake to collect stories. Setup is immediate, development occurs when the traveler writes Elira's obituary (the final vessel to the southern isles has departed), and payoff appears in the thematic closure ("While others chased horizons, they lingered in the wake"). Two beats: framing and writing. The timeframe establishes motive but does not tighten decisions or impose a live clock; the traveler's ritual is solitary and unthreatened by external pressure. Causal pressure is low; the timeframe could shift to "after the last letter" or "after the last visitor" with minor edits. Specificity is moderate (ships, harbor bells), and closure linkage is thematic rather than tactical.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"To understand the geography of healing" is articulated explicitly ("The traveler's motivation was never closure—it was orientation. To understand the geography of healing meant charting not just where the broken went, but how the land received them") and enacted through the writing of Elira's obituary, mapping "cliffs where salt wind scoured regret, coves where tide pools mirrored fractured selves, forests where roots whispered forgiveness." Setup is delayed (paragraph nine), development occurs in the writing beat, and payoff lands in the final thematic statement ("They mapped"). Two beats: articulation and execution. The motivation shapes the traveler's project but is more thematic claim than dramatized desire under pressure; there is no moment where the traveler's need to understand conflicts with a cost or alternative want. Friction between wants and costs is weak; the traveler's renunciation of prayer and hope reads as philosophical stance rather than painful trade-off. Swappability is moderate; "to chart where the grieving go" could replace it with adjustments.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Lonesome splendor" is sustained throughout: the opening's "bruised twilight," "brittle and gold-rimmed" leaves, "marble nymphs wept lichen tears," the traveler's solitary ritual, and the closing image "lonesome splendor of those who still listened" with "beauty carved from decay, majesty worn thin by time, solitude that didn't ache so much as shimmer, like frost on a widow's window." Setup is immediate, development deepens the melancholy-majesty blend, and payoff charges the final paragraph with the exact phrase. Three beats: opening, middle (explicit articulation), and closing. The tone coheres without modulation; the piece sustains a single lyric register rather than shifting under pressure. This consistency is purposeful and fits the Accumulative lens, though the lack of tonal turn or sharpening under stress keeps it from the highest band. Specificity is high (frost, lichen, shimmer), and the tone is indispensable to the story's texture and closure.</comment>
