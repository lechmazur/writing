<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation is clear (find echoes' birthplace, preserve vanished species), and her pendant-borrowing actions are concrete, but interiority remains largely declarative rather than embodied under pressure. The "overborrowing" moment ("Panic threatened, but she sculpted time itself") tells emotion rather than showing contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final choice to close the sketchbook and release echoes reads more as an endpoint than a decision forged through competing desires with visible internal cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (rooftop canals, giant's nap, illustrator) arrive early. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through sensory layering and the pattern of time-borrowing until the chamber scene reweights the stakes. However, the closure—releasing echoes and closing the sketchbook—feels like a forecast fulfilled rather than a reversal or deepening that narrows options. The cost (pendant heat fading, borrowed time anchored by illustrations) is asserted but not dramatized in a single legible image, weakening the final reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The rooftop canals, moss-slicked stone, singing marble, and chamber pulsing with unborn sound are vivid and purposeful. The pendant's temperature shift (cold → searing) functions as micro-setting that tracks cost. However, spatial choreography blurs during the spiral aqueduct climb and chamber discovery; the relationship between the canal system and the chamber's location is unclear, and the giant's proximity/distance remains abstract throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding the echo birthplace before the giant wakes—is signaled early. The "overborrowed" chime provides a tightening moment, but the protagonist cushions it with time-sculpting in the same beat, deflating the consequence immediately. The chamber discovery and echo-release feel like arrival rather than a pressure-driven reversal; no live option is foreclosed, and the cost (pendant heat, fatigue) is mentioned rather than forcing a visible trade-off that alters tactics.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The theme of time as malleable, echoes as memory anchors, and creation-as-preservation emerges through image and action rather than statement. The final image—city waking to rediscovered voices—resonates but leans toward wish-fulfillment; the story promises complexity (temporal erosion, borrowed time thinning) yet resolves into straightforward success without ambiguity or conceptual cost that reweights the premise.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization is stable. Diction is ornate and sustained ("amniotic silence," "midwife memory") with a consistent perceptual signature (illustrator's eye for iridescent throats, glass-winged serpents). However, register drifts into elevated abstraction during peak beats ("to midwife memory," "invitations," "borrowed time from snapping back") that reads more authorial than character-particular, and the protagonist's lexicon feels uniformly poetic without modulation under stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout ("echoes pooled like mercury," "vibrations curled like embryos," "petals from frozen blossoms"), but coherence wobbles: echoes are simultaneously born, unborn, and pooled; time is borrowed, sculpted, siphoned, and cushioned without clear physical rules. Template cadence appears in the middle third ("She moved quickly," "She pressed on," "She climbed," "She'd press"). Paraphrase loops: "not echoes yet—potential echoes" and "Raw vibrations curled" restate the same idea across adjacent lines. The final paragraph lists outcomes (birdsong, laughter, voices) without propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of time-borrowing, echo archaeology, and natural-history illustration offers a fresh angle, and the rooftop canal resonance system is vividly particular. However, the emotional arc—find place, draw creatures, release echoes, city wakes—follows a predictable fulfillment template without a non-obvious turn. The giant remains a backdrop constraint rather than an integrated pressure, and the ending's success (echoes "carry themselves," museums anchor time) resolves tension without irony or cost that forces hindsight reappraisal.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Present throughout; her sketching in the chamber and decision to close the book shape the ending. However, her choices feel reactive to discovery rather than forcing reversals under competing pressures; "illustrator" as identity colors perception but does not constrain tactics with visible cost tied to that occupation.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The pendant appears in three beats (intro cold touch, mid-scene siphoning warmth, chamber searing heat) and its temperature change tracks cost. It enables time-borrowing and is causally active at closure ("borrowing from the giant's dream-murmurs"). Specificity (infinity symbol, mentor relic) distinguishes it, but the mechanics remain abstract; swapping for another time-device would require only minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Interrupted cadence" is named twice (opening methodical rhythm broken by the bird's cry, panic when overborrowing) and thematically threads the piece. It shapes one mid-scene choice (cushioning the chime) but does not redefine options at closure; the ending restores rhythm rather than deepening the rupture, limiting causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Time-sculpting is described (bending flow, cushioning ripples, borrowing seconds) and enables key actions, but the mechanics are ornamental: no on-page moment shows a visible trade-off where sculpting's cost forces her to abandon a tactic or choose between incompatible uses. The trait is asserted capability rather than a constraint.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Uncaging moments" appears early (peeling instants from frozen blossoms) and again in the chamber (uncaging newborn echoes). It drives the ending action (releasing echoes into the canal) and defines her method, but the act itself is underspecified—how does one uncage an echo?—and could be replaced with "releasing" or "freeing" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Time-borrowing is introduced early (siphon from clocks, eaves, pulse), demonstrated mid-scene (overborrowing triggers the chime), and escalates at closure (borrowing from the giant's dream). It shapes two beats and carries accumulating cost (fatigue, clarity loss, pendant heat), but the method's limits are not tested; she always succeeds, reducing felt constraint.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The canals are vividly rendered (moss-slicked stone, resonance channels, spiral aqueduct) and present in all three sections. They supply micro-resources (amplified whispers, stored sound) and the canal current carries echoes at closure. However, the setting enables rather than constrains; no choice is foreclosed by the rooftop layout, and spatial logic remains impressionistic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The giant's nap governs the city's suspended hours and creates urgency ("if she didn't act before the giant stirred"). The chime moment ("The giant's breathing hitched") tests the clock mid-scene, and the ending notes the giant stirring in curiosity. However, elapsed time is untracked, and the threat of waking is diffused rather than tightened, weakening the timeframe's grip on tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Her desire to find the echo birthplace is stated early, drives her movement through the canals, and is fulfilled in the chamber discovery. The motivation ties to her work (illustrating vanished species) and carries thematic weight (echoes hold truth). However, no friction or competing desire tests her commitment; she seeks, finds, and succeeds without a mid-scene moment where the motivation conflicts with cost or safety.</comment>
