<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's interiority is concrete and specific—grief-driven, testing her skepticism through action rather than declaration. Internal contradiction is present: she's "religiously skeptical" yet driven by caller testimonies, and this tension propels her tunnel descent. The final shift from seeking external validation to accepting personal weight is earned through the radio discovery, but the protagonist remains somewhat reactive; she uncovers rather than decides under genuine duress. Embodied emotion is strong ("drowsy alertness," "fingers brushing cold metal"), though the epiphany about guilt machinery edges toward articulated insight rather than purely dramatized cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors quickly (explorer, tunnel, post-confession timeframe). The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration: she recognizes the "ghost shift" as her own grief machinery, reweights the valve wheel from haunted object to personal prop, and accepts the burden ("not lighter, but steadier"). Cost is visible—she must carry her father's truth forward without phantom alibi—and the lens is Causal-Hybrid with accumulative texture. One meaningful tightening occurs when the radio plays her own voice back, collapsing external haunt into internal recursion. The piece slightly over-explains the thematic mechanism ("guilt rewinds time") where image alone could suffice, edging toward tell at a pivotal beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The tunnel is vividly rendered with selective, purposeful detail: "mildew and rust," "damp gravel," "collapsed ceiling tiles." The valve wheel—brass, beaded rim, worn numerals—functions as micro-setting that charges the closure image when she twists it and "dust falling...like silent applause" seals her acceptance. Spatial choreography is clean throughout (car → tunnel mouth → alcove → wheel). Sensory hierarchy reflects her investigative focus (touch of cold metal, auditory focus on the radio crackle). The mill's spectral backstory enriches atmosphere without consuming present action, and the tunnel's physicality constrains her search, guiding discovery.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding weight/validation for her father's deathbed confession—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure tightens when she discovers the radio playing her own drunk call, collapsing the external ghost into recursive grief. This reversal narrows options: no phantom absolution exists, only self-reckoning. Agency at closure is modest but present: she twists the wheel, pockets the radio, and walks home steadier. The cost is emotional/relational (accepting the burden as hers alone) rather than a high-stakes external forfeit. Escalation is more accumulative than causal-agonistic; she uncovers rather than fights, and coincidence (the corroded radio still whispering) aids discovery without her forcing the turn.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—guilt as recursive machinery, truth that must be carried rather than exorcised—emerges organically from the valve wheel, the ghost-shift testimonies, and the radio loop. The piece resists overt moralizing until "The wheel turns backward because guilt rewinds time," which edges toward articulation but remains tied to image. The final lines ("didn't believe in ghosts. But she believed in echoes...truths that, once swallowed, must be regurgitated, examined, carried forward") offer a resonant, non-literal answer without reducing complexity. Subtext operates in gesture (twisting the wheel, pocketing the radio) and the shift from spectral to psychological labor. The closure reweights prior material—ghost shift becomes her shift—with quiet, earned resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and tightly filtered through her skeptical, investigative lens. Diction is elevated but consistent ("drowsy alertness," "chattering teeth," "regurgitated, examined"), matching an educated narrator processing trauma through analytical distance. Perceptual signature is strong: she notices "texture, tremor," "beaded valve wheel," "numerals 3 and 7," reflecting her appraisal habit. Psychic distance modulates purposefully, tightening at the radio discovery and opening slightly for thematic reflection at the end. The prose occasionally edges into meta-commentary ("calibration...If ghosts were impossible, then the weight...should feel lighter") that hovers between interiority and authorial summary. No dialogue appears, so voice cohesion rests on narrative control, which is largely clean.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully, with longer syntactic builds ("She'd mapped their testimonies, cross-referenced timestamps...") and terse beats ("Not ghostly. Not glowing. Just brass"). Information density is high; most lines advance discovery or interiority. Minor scaffold appears: "She'd come not for thrills, not for photos, but for the weight" and "Not ghostly. Not glowing. Just brass" employ template negation that, while voice-consistent, repeats cadence. The phrase "drowsy alertness" recurs three times, twice early and once late, creating slight synonym churn. Figurative language is purposeful (valve wheel as guilt machinery, "dust falling...like silent applause") but the closure paragraph slightly over-explains theme ("mind's machinery grinding backward") where image could carry more weight. No severe loops or artifacts, but minor density slips prevent higher scores.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The premise—ghost-hunter discovers the haunt is her own recorded confession—offers a fresh psychological twist on haunted-mill tropes. The valve wheel and talk-radio psychic framing are specific, grounded choices that avoid generic occult furniture. Emotional honesty (grief over paternal complicity in deaths) anchors the arc in human complexity rather than surface novelty. However, the core move—external mystery revealed as internal recursion—echoes familiar "the call is coming from inside the house" and therapeutic self-haunting templates. Transformation is present (the valve wheel as both prop and metaphor, the factory as mind), but the synthesis feels competent rather than singular. The ending's thematic articulation slightly softens the ingenuity of the image work.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The "reckless abandoned-mill explorer" is present throughout and her choice to enter the tunnel after the confession (setup), handle the valve wheel (development), and twist it while accepting the burden (closure) all trace to this role. Her exploration creates the discovery beat and frames the ghost-shift investigation. However, the specific "reckless" and "abandoned-mill" framing feels somewhat generic—"grief-stricken seeker" or "investigator" would work nearly as well. The role enables action but is not irreplaceable in specificity; the grief motive and skepticism do more causal work than the explorer label itself.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The beaded valve wheel appears in setup (callers describe it), development (she finds it in the alcove, touches it, recognizes numerals 3 and 7), and payoff (she twists it at closure, triggering dust and symbolic release). It recurs with reweighted meaning: first a haunted object, then a personal prop she unconsciously placed. The wheel's brass, beaded rim, and worn numerals are specific and irreplaceable; no generic ghost-prop could substitute. It constrains her search (she mapped testimonies to find it) and charges the final image (twisting it becomes acceptance). Cost is tied to the wheel's symbolic function (guilt machinery), though the twist itself is gesture rather than high-stakes forfeit.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The "factory ghost shift" frames the investigation (setup via caller testimonies), shapes her tunnel search (she's testing the 3:17 a.m. spectral labor claim), and reweights at closure when she realizes the shift is her own recursive grief ("The factory ghost shift was over. Hers had just begun"). The concept changes her options by collapsing external haunt into internal reckoning. However, the ghost shift itself is slightly ornamental—the mill's spectral workers are backdrop; the radio loop and valve wheel do more causal work. The concept is more thematic resonance than tactical pressure, landing it in mid-range.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Religiously skeptical" is signaled early (setup: "horoscopes were nonsense, ghosts were trauma metaphors") and enables her investigative frame—she appraises calls for texture, not truth. At closure, her skepticism persists ("She didn't believe in ghosts. But she believed in echoes"), constraining how she interprets the discovery. However, the trait is more stance than on-page friction; it colors perception but does not force a costly tradeoff. The attribute is consistent and relevant but not irreplaceable—"skeptical investigator" or "empirical thinker" would function nearly identically. It shapes but does not decisively narrow choices under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Appraise" is seeded early ("appraising—not for their truth, but for their texture"), drives her method (mapping testimonies, cross-referencing timestamps), and returns at closure when the radio host says "Appraise it by what you're willing to face." The action shapes her investigative approach and the verb itself reappears with reweighted stakes at the pivot. However, the on-page work is more "investigate" and "discover" than literal appraisal of value; the term is thematic gloss rather than sustained mechanical pressure. Swapping "assess" or "interpret" would require only minor edits, limiting irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The method—interpreting frantic calls to talk-radio psychics—is present in setup (she maps caller testimonies about the valve wheel and 3:17 a.m. shift) and payoff (the radio plays her own call back). It enables the discovery beat (the corroded transistor leaking her voice) and charges the recursion ("You're not alone"). However, the method is more backstory than on-page mechanics; we do not see her listening, coding, or deciding based on call patterns. The radio is more prop than active interpretive tool. Setup and closure participation are clear, but middle development (her using the method to alter tactics) is thin, capping the score near mid-range.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The abandoned train tunnel provides spatial constraint (she must walk into darkness, round a bend, kneel in the alcove) and sensory texture (mildew, rust, damp gravel, collapsing ceiling tiles) that pressure her search. The rusted maintenance alcove houses the valve wheel, making setting essential to discovery. At closure, the tunnel's "dust falling...like silent applause" charges the final image. However, the tunnel is primarily a container for the search rather than an active pressure; it does not force hard choices or alter tactics beyond "walk deeper." It functions as atmospheric stage more than dynamic constraint, landing it in the competent but not indispensable range.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The timeframe—"during the hush that follows a sudden confession"—is signaled in the opening (she confessed in her car an hour prior, then marched to the tunnel). The "hush" and post-confession urgency frame her emotional state and motivate the tunnel descent. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions on the page; there is no live clock, no racing dawn until the very end (off-stage), and no moment where elapsed time alters her choices. The hush is more emotional backdrop than temporal pressure. Setup is clear, but development and payoff involvement are weak, and the element is highly swappable with "after a crisis" or "in grief's wake."</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The motivation—"to find the weight of a swallowed truth"—is seeded early (she seeks the weight of her confession, her father's guilt) and sustained through the tunnel search. At closure, she finds the weight has "shifted. Settled. Become hers to carry," fulfilling the desire with cost (no phantom absolution, only personal burden). The motivation is specific and drives the arc. However, it is articulated more than dramatized in friction; she does not face a moment where finding the truth costs her something else on the page. The want is clear and constant, but the on-page conflict is discovery-driven rather than agonistic choice between competing goods, capping the score below high range.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Drowsy alertness" is signaled in the opening ("not from fear but from the drowsy alertness that clung to her like static after sleep"), recurs at mid-point inflection, and resolves at closure ("The drowsy alertness lifted, replaced by something quieter, sturdier"). The tone modulates with pressure—fuzzy urgency early, sharpening at the radio discovery, settling into steadier clarity at the end. It charges the final image by marking the emotional shift from liminal confusion to grounded acceptance. However, the phrase is somewhat abstract and the texture it names (post-sleep fog, grief haze) is more told than embodied in sentence rhythm or sensory distortion. The tone is coherent and purposeful but not irreplaceable in specificity.</comment>
