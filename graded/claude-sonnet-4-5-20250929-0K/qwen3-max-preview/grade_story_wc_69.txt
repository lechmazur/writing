<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and her trait of "expectant resignation" is embodied through waiting and teaching, but her internal contradiction never acts simultaneously in scene—she waits, then acts. The moment a student appears, she pivots cleanly to teaching without visible cost or foreclosed option; the renunciation of bitterness is told in exposition rather than tested by on-page choice. Backstory dominates the middle third, and while it anchors in the rosette and library setting, it flattens present pressure rather than sharpening a micro-choice. The girl's arrival feels like a convenience reward rather than a choice Elara makes under competing impulses.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural (stillness as accrual, awaiting a deepening moment). Closure reads as Charged Poise: the girl's question crystallizes Elara's stance and the cost of decades spent showing up is undeniable in "traveled stillness" and the weathered calm. Orientation is clean by line 2 (who, where, autumn). One escalation beat: the creak from the stacks tightens anticipation into the girl's entrance. However, the final exchange feels emotionally convenient—no friction tests Elara's claim that she still teaches, and the cost remains implicit rather than visible in a concrete forfeiture or trade-off on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The velvet library is vividly rendered (drapes, amber light, dust motes) and recurs with purpose: it absorbs noise, mirrors Elara's subtractive method, and anchors the girl's entrance. The rosette functions as micro-setting—handled twice, reweighted in the ending as a "blueprint for rebuilding." The autumn window and clinging leaf charge the final turn. Spatial choreography is clear (table, stacks, window). The setting constrains choice subtly (the quiet invites waiting, the creak signals presence) and charges the closure image, meeting the 9+ gate, but the velvet/merlot description leans decorative in the middle beats without altering tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake: will anyone return to learn harmony? The creak and girl's entrance provide one meaningful tightening. But escalation is muted—Elara hums, waits, and the girl simply appears; no on-page choice narrows Elara's options or forces a trade-off. The final "Good. That means you haven't learned how to get it wrong yet" avoids testing whether Elara can still teach or what she must sacrifice to do so. Cost is told ("decades of showing up") rather than paid in this scene. Under the Accumulative lens, one deepening is sufficient, but the lack of visible friction or forfeiture caps the score.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—harmony as consensual subtraction, vanishing arts, hatred unlearned—emerges from the rosette, the hum, and the method of removing noise. The ending ("We begin by subtracting noise") answers the central question without stating a moral. Backstory on teaching and unlearning hatred is extensive but integrated with the rosette and velvet setting. However, "Hatred, she discovered, thrived in cacophony; harmony required subtraction" edges toward thesis statement, and the final exchange risks tidy sentiment ("harmony was never lost. Only waiting"). The thematic answer is resonant but borders on aphorism rather than irreducible image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Single POV, third limited, with stable distance and a distinct perceptual signature (rosette grooves as "memories of vanished luthiers," leaves as "burnt parchment"). Diction is elevated and character-particular. Dialogue appears only at the end; the girl's hesitant "Do you still… teach?" and Elara's "Good. That means you haven't learned how to get it wrong yet" feel natural and goal-driven. However, elevated register ("expectantly resigned," "traveled stillness") occasionally drifts into abstract lexicon not fully grounded in Elara's immediate embodied perception. Free indirect style is clean, but the final lines risk sounding like the author's thematic summary rather than Elara's lived voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high in early paragraphs (rosette, velvet, autumn) but sags in the middle third with synonym loops ("not bitter, not hopeful, but present"; "not to perfect pitch, but to feel the vibration") and paraphrase across adjacent lines. Stock phrases appear: "the kind of quiet that denoted presence, not absence," "a single breathing instrument," "harmony was never lost. Only waiting." Filter verbs ("she remembered," "she discovered") stack in reflective passages without voice necessity. The final image is clear and propulsive, but template cadence ("not X, not Y, but Z") recurs four times, triggering a −0.6 deduction and disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of vanishing arts, choir teaching, and subtractive method is specific and non-generic. The rosette as silent portal and the velvet library as sound-absorbing space are fresh details. However, the premise—dedicated teacher awaiting a student's return—follows a familiar template, and the arrival of the girl who "doesn't know how to sing" at the exact moment of Elara's readiness feels convenient rather than inevitable. Transformation is present in the subtractive method and the charged rosette, but the emotional arc (patient waiting rewarded) does not surprise. The story avoids cliché through texture but does not take bold structural or moral risks.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Present throughout; frames the waiting and teaches the girl. Elara's choices (humming, turning to the girl, gesturing to the table) shape two beats: the hum and the final exchange. However, her role is reactive—she waits, the girl arrives, Elara responds. No middle-beat decision alters her tactics or forecloses a path. The choice to continue teaching is affirmed rather than tested. Two-beat involvement and early signal support mid-band; lack of causal pressure or visible cost caps the score.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Rosette appears in three beats: line 1 (traced, introduced), paragraph 3 (memory of luthiers), paragraph 16 (denotes purpose as portal/symbol), and paragraph 26 (gestured to at closure). It anchors Elara's reflection on vanishing arts and is gestured to in the ending, reweighting as a "blueprint for rebuilding." However, it is never handled again after the first touch; middle mentions are descriptive rather than causal. The rosette does not constrain a choice or alter tactics. Lyric reprise reweights meaning but lacks mid-scene pressure. Three-beat presence and closure linkage support mid-band; ornamental middle use and no causal pressure cap the score.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Vanishing arts frame the premise (luthiers, unplayed zithers, students who forgot) and return at closure ("vanished arts whispered through the grain"). The concept shapes Elara's stake—whether anyone will return to learn. However, it does not alter her tactics on the page; she waits, hums, and teaches regardless of whether the arts are vanishing or not. The concept is thematic rather than causal. Early signal, closure linkage, and stake-framing support mid-band; lack of on-page tactical constraint caps the score.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Expectant resignation is embodied in the waiting, the hum without audience, and the "traveled stillness" response. It constrains Elara's action: she does not seek students or despair; she waits. The trait enables her calm response to the girl. Two beats shaped (waiting, response), early signal, and closure linkage. The trait is visible in gesture and choice, not label-only. However, no on-page cost or trade-off is tied to the resignation itself—she waits and is rewarded. Two-beat causal work and specificity support the score; lack of visible cost in the trait's exercise caps higher range.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Denote appears explicitly three times: leaves "denotation of time's passage," rosette "denoted purpose," "quiet that denoted presence." These are descriptive uses, not actions. The verb does not drive a turn or choice; it labels meaning rather than creating pressure. The action is swappable with "signified" or "marked" without structural change. Present across beats but ornamental; no causal pressure. Caps at mid-band for functional presence without plot necessity.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Subtracting noise is signaled early ("quiet that denoted presence, not absence"), developed in paragraph 4 (braiding voices by subtracting noise from the soul), paragraph 6 (library absorbs noise), and enacted at closure ("We begin by subtracting noise"). The method shapes Elara's tactics (she hums one tone, offers silence first). Three beats, early signal, and closure linkage. However, the method is more thematic than mechanically tested—Elara does not face a choice where adding or subtracting noise alters the outcome. Specificity and closure linkage support the score; lack of on-page constraint in a contested beat caps higher range.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Velvet library in autumn is established in line 1 and recurs in six beats: velvet drapes absorb sound, autumn presses at windows, leaves cling, maple leaf trembles, library deepens at closure. Setting constrains choice: the quiet invites waiting, the velvet absorbs Elara's hum, the creak signals presence, autumn mirrors time's passage. The library's sound-absorbing quality directly enables the subtractive method and charges the final image. Early signal, multi-beat involvement, causal pressure (absorption shapes the hum, creak enables the turn), and closure linkage. Strong integration; the exact setting is necessary to the method and mood.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Timeframe across unlearning hatred is referenced in paragraph 4 (decades braiding voices), paragraph 9 (children now adults, most unlearned harmony), paragraph 14 (watched hatred unlearned in rehearsal rooms). Time is backstory, not a present clock. The span shapes Elara's weariness and resignation but does not tighten present decisions—she waits in autumn, a student arrives, end. No live ticking clock or deadline alters tactics. Present as thematic context and motivation anchor; absent as pressure mechanism. Caps at low-mid band for setup only, no development or closure constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Braiding diverse voices into harmony is Elara's stated motivation (paragraph 4, paragraph 15) and drives her waiting for a student to return. It shapes two beats: her reflection on past teaching and her decision to teach the girl at closure. However, the desire is not dramatized in conflict—no friction tests whether she can still braid voices or what she must sacrifice to do so. The girl's arrival fulfills the motivation without cost. Early signal, closure linkage, and stake-framing support mid-band; lack of on-page friction between want and obstacle caps the score.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Traveled stillness is established by paragraph 5 (expectant resignation), paragraph 19 (she turned with traveled stillness), and recurs in the velvet absorption, the hum, and the final breath-sit instruction. Tone is coherent, modulates from waiting to the charged Poise at closure, and charges the ending image. The tone is active in choice—stillness enables the wait and the calm teaching response. However, the tone is more atmospheric than a forcing constraint; it colors rather than alters options. Coherence across beats, closure linkage, and specificity support the score; lack of tactical constraint caps higher range.</comment>
