<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation—wavelength alignment with purpose—is embodied through her lot-casting ritual and her physical relationship with the coins, creating a consistent character-specific logic. Internal contradiction emerges when she stops drawing lots and chooses independently, marking genuine change. However, the epiphany about "futures she'd lived and forgotten" arrives without sufficient on-page causality; the shift from surrender to agency feels asserted rather than earned through prior micro-choices that visibly narrow her options.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The piece establishes an Accumulative/Textural lens with its layered imagery and static-burst pattern, holding coherent pressure through the coin-handling ritual. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): she steps forward without drawing lots, crystallizing a stance that forecloses her prior surrender-to-chance path. Cost is visible—she abandons the method that has governed every choice since the collapse—but the mechanics of how the backwards prophecies work and why *this* vision triggers the shift lack on-page grounding, weakening causal motivation at the turn.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The ambered observatory deck functions as a micro-setting that constrains and charges action: the honeyed light, cracked glass panels, and residual heat anchor sensory perception throughout, and the deck's edge becomes the spatial stage for her final choice. The coins themselves act as tactile anchors with distinct provenance (drachma/tides, yuan/breaths, doubloon/expansion) that filter her attention and shape her ritual. The only slip: "stellar doubt" as a bodily sensation ("pulsed behind her ribs like a dying pulsar") borders on abstract metaphor rather than concrete embodiment.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding meaning/purpose in the contracted universe—is signaled early and tightens when the unbidden static vision offers a new understanding. One meaningful deepening occurs: her realization that the prophecies are "echoes of what had already been chosen" reconfigures her relationship to chance and agency. However, the escalation lacks a visible trade-off or external pressure test; the shift from passivity to action happens internally without a prior scene beat that forces her to choose between competing costs, leaving the turn under-dramatized.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the coin ritual and static bursts: surrender versus agency, meaning distilled from entropy, resonance outlasting collapse. The final image—"We're the distillate. The essence. The echo that outlasts the song"—offers a non-literal answer to the premise without moralizing, and the drachma toss celebrates rather than decides. The piece resists neat resolution; stellar doubt "softens" but doesn't vanish. Minor slip: "quietly enthusiastic, fiercely alive" in the penultimate paragraph edges toward summary assertion of the thematic shift rather than letting the action alone convey it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited throughout with a distinct perceptual signature: technical diction ("wavelength align," "distillate," "neutron star's spin") mixed with sensory specificity ("tremor in her molars," "itch behind her eyes"). The prose modulates effectively from reflective passages to the pressured moment of vision. Dialogue at the end pursues a goal (rallying the survivors) and carries thematic weight without exposition. One friction: free indirect style occasionally blurs into narrator commentary ("That was the point. Truth had contracted too") where the register feels more authorial than character-bound under crisis pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Figurative language is dense and mostly coherent ("honeyed light," "sugar in hot tea," "fallen stars"), but several metaphors stack without clear connective logic: "stellar doubt that pulsed behind her ribs like a dying pulsar" mixes astronomical scale with bodily sensation in a way that strains clarity. Template cadence appears in the vision sequence: "Then, a voice… Then she stood… Then she stepped…" creates a mechanical rhythm. Paraphrase loop: "She didn't draw lots. She didn't consult the static" followed immediately by "She raised the drachma… and smiled" restates the same decision without added pressure. Information density is high in the opening third but sags mid-piece during the extended vision description.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of lot-casting ritual, backwards prophecy, and post-contraction cosmology creates a specific premise that avoids template dystopia. The decision to make prophecy *recollection from futures already chosen* offers a fresh angle on determinism versus agency. The final move—celebrating choice rather than deciding by lot—transforms the opening frame with earned particularity. Risk is present in the dense technical-metaphysical idiom and the choice to delay clear spatial anchors until the survivors appear. However, the core emotional arc (passive surrender → active embrace of purpose) follows a familiar recovery trajectory, and the vision-as-catalyst mechanism is not developed with enough specificity to feel structurally indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The cast-lots decision maker drives the opening ritual, the middle vision (where a future self instructs her), and the closure turn when she stops drawing lots and chooses independently—three distinct beats. Her method constrains early action (she's "drawn straws for every major choice since the collapse") and the final choice to abandon that method forecloses her prior path with visible cost. Causal pressure is strong: removing this exact character trait would collapse the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The foreign coins appear in the opening (tracing grooves, each a relic), the middle (scattered after the vision, pressed to forehead to trigger static), and the ending (drachma raised and tossed as celebration). Each coin carries specific provenance (drachma/tides, yuan/breaths, doubloon/expansion) that charges their symbolic weight. The drachma's final toss reweights its earlier use as a lot-drawing tool into a gesture of celebration, participating directly in closure. High irreplaceability: the coins' tactile presence and layered backstory make them indispensable to the ritual and the turn.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Backwards prophecy is established early ("recollection from a future that no longer existed") and shapes the protagonist's method: she spins coins to trigger static bursts that show past visions of herself. The unbidden vision in the middle provides the conceptual insight that drives her closure choice ("echoes of what had already been chosen"). However, the mechanics are under-dramatized—why this vision arrives unbidden, how it differs from prior static, and what specific cost or constraint it imposes remain vague. The concept participates in closure but doesn't narrow options through clear cause-effect.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Quietly enthusiastic" is mentioned twice: "quiet enthusiasm of someone who still dares to hope" early and "quietly enthusiastic, fiercely alive" near the end. Both are label-only; no on-page action shows how quiet enthusiasm constrains a choice or enables a tactic under pressure. The trait functions as thematic assertion rather than embodied characteristic that alters behavior or cost. Swappable with "persistent hope" or similar without structural impact.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Distill" appears in the protagonist's realization ("You're not waiting for meaning. You're distilling it") and her closing speech ("We're the distillate"). The metaphor reframes her lot-casting as a process of extraction rather than passive reception, supporting the thematic turn from surrender to agency. However, the action itself is metaphorical rather than physical; no on-page scene shows her performing distillation as a literal or embodied act that constrains choice. The word's recurrence charges the closure image but doesn't drive beats causally. Lyric reprise lifts it into the 5–6 range.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Understanding static bursts is the protagonist's established method, introduced early ("feeling the tremor in her molars, the itch behind her eyes") and demonstrated in the vision sequence where she interprets unbidden static. The method shapes her tactics: she presses the drachma to her forehead to engage with the surge, and the clarity she gains drives her final choice. Two beats (early explanation, climactic vision) plus closure linkage (the static teaches her about prior choices) make the method essential. The mechanics lack granular on-page specification—what triggers static, how she controls it—which prevents full indispensability.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The ambered observatory deck is present throughout: honeyed light, cracked glass panels, residual heat, and the edge where she addresses survivors. The deck's transparency to "the hollow sky" and its vertical positioning above the survivors create spatial pressure that stages her final choice to step forward. The setting's post-contraction atmosphere (amber star, frozen light) reinforces tone and timeframe. However, the deck's physical properties don't constrain a middle choice or alter her tactics; it functions more as atmospheric anchor than active pressure. Two-gate participation (setup, closure staging) earns mid-band placement.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The contracted universe is established early ("civilizations swallowed by the contraction," "galaxies folded inward") and contextualizes stakes (last three survivors, final amber star). The timeframe adds urgency to her search for meaning in a dying cosmos and motivates the backwards-prophecy mechanic as a way to access lost futures. However, no on-page clock tightens decisions; the passage of "cycles" is vague, and the contraction itself doesn't narrow options within the scene. The element frames context but doesn't drive escalation. Lyric setup plus thematic closure presence place it in the 5–6 range.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Wavelength alignment with purpose is stated early as her motivation and dramatized through the lot-casting ritual (her method of seeking alignment). The vision's instruction ("You're distilling it") reframes her understanding, and her final speech ("purpose humming in her bones—a frequency tuned... by every choice") confirms the motivation's evolution. However, the desire faces no on-page friction or competing cost; she doesn't choose alignment over another want. The motivation is present across beats and charges the ending idiom, but lacks the visible trade-off needed for higher scoring.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Stellar doubt is introduced early ("pulsed behind her ribs like a dying pulsar"), modulates at the vision ("The stellar doubt didn't vanish. It softened. It became a companion, not a cage"), and persists into the ending where she steps forward despite uncertainty. The tone's transformation from paralyzing to generative mirrors the protagonist's arc and charges the final image of choosing without certainty. Coherent modulation under pressure and direct closure participation earn solid integration. The metaphor occasionally strains (mixing astronomical and bodily scales), preventing full indispensability.</comment>
