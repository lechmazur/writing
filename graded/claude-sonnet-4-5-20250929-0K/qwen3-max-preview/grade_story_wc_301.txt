<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation for self-forgiveness is clear and her methodical mapping provides consistent internal logic. Embodied emotion appears in moments like weeping at the wall and cradling the accordion, but much of the interiority relies on poetic abstraction ("contour lines of shame, elevation markers of remorse") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The sister-abandonment backstory anchors the guilt, yet the final choice to "leave no note, no mark" reads more as symbolic gesture than a decision that forecloses a path with visible cost. The emotional progression is earnest but lacks the messy irrationality that would elevate it beyond a single-track journey.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed: who, where, and when coalesce only after several paragraphs of lyric description, triggering a −0.4 penalty and capping Q3 at 7.0. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through graffiti discoveries and accordion play—but the closure unit (playing louder, rearranging ivy, leaving) lands as atmosphere rather than decisive change or resonant reconfiguration with legible cost. The piece teaches a pattern of ekphrastic mapping and does pay it off with the final note-less departure, yet the cost remains oblique: we don't see what path was foreclosed or what she can now do that she couldn't before. Linkage is present but the closure doesn't crystallize a before/after with felt consequence on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The disused railway station is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (ivy as archive, rusted faucet, shattered skylight, porcelain sink) and the accordion as micro-setting constrains her ritual of measurement and music. The orientation penalty in Q2 caps this category at 7.0 per the rule. Spatial choreography is mostly clear, though the station's layout remains somewhat impressionistic. The ivy and Track 3 sign charge the final image, and the setting subtly mirrors her emotional topography, lifting the score within the allowed band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—self-forgiveness via methodical mapping—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates through graffiti discoveries and accordion sessions, but escalation under the Accumulative lens requires a meaningful tightening or deepening that narrows options; here the protagonist encounters progressively resonant graffiti yet her tactics (mapping, playing, weeping) don't meaningfully shift in response. The final departure ("played until her fingers cramped") suggests endurance but not a trade-off or foreclosed path with on-page cost. Agency is present but the cost clarity needed for higher bands is absent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the river-chronicler conceit and the graffiti wisdom: forgiveness as flow, maps drawn bleeding, paths that persist. The final image—ivy rearranged, accordion resonant, no note left—offers a non-literal answer to the self-forgiveness question without moralizing. However, some phrasings veer toward prompt-echo ("path to self-forgiveness…a terrain more treacherous") and the "Maps lie unless you draw them bleeding" graffito feels planted to harvest thematic points. The piece resists tidy resolution and invites reflection, but the thematic articulation occasionally substitutes poetic assertion for dramatized discovery.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The narrative voice is lyric and controlled, with a consistent register of poetic compression ("accordion bellows patched with tape…wheezed like regret"). Psychic distance is stable and the perceptual signature—attention to textures, counts, echoes—is character-specific. Some constructions feel self-consciously literary ("daringly methodical was her creed") and border on telling the reader the voice rather than inhabiting it. Free indirect style is clean, and the single-POV interiority is coherent throughout. A few filter verbs ("She'd learned to read its tendrils") are present but voice-motivated and don't dull immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Information density is high and the prose is mostly clean, but several text-artifact patterns appear: template cadence ("She alluded to it…She alluded to the graffiti…She alluded to Track 3"), paraphrase loops (the "maps of emotional topography" concept is restated twice in adjacent paragraphs), and stock metaphors ("river deltas where tears had pooled"). The final third's phrasing ("still patched, still imperfect, but resonant") feels like a checklist summary. These artifacts don't obscure causality but they do dull momentum and prevent the line-level precision needed for higher bands. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent; "accordion…wheezed like regret" works, though "bellows…exhaled truth in wheezing gasps" borders on mixed vehicle.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The river-chronicler-as-emotional-cartographer premise is fresh and the graffiti-as-compass device offers a specific angle on self-forgiveness narratives. The accordion as inherited burden and the disused station as archive show purposeful synthesis. However, the emotional arc—guilt over abandoning sister, methodical penance, solitary healing—follows a recognizable template of solitary-artist-finds-redemption-through-ritualized-creation. The piece commits fully to its premise and avoids the safety middle, but the turns (each graffito discovery, each accordion session) feel preordained rather than earned through friction. The synthesis is competent but not yet indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The truth-seeking river chronicler is established early (setup ✓) and her choice to stop medication, map graffiti, and play accordion shapes middle beats (development ✓). The final departure and louder accordion song participate in closure (payoff ✓). However, her "choices" are mostly observational and ritualistic; the decision to leave without a note doesn't alter tactics or foreclose a path with visible cost. She's present in all three gates but her agency is passive: she receives wisdom rather than making trade-offs. Eligible for mid-band but not higher without a choice that narrows options.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The accordion bellows appear in multiple beats: introduced in paragraph two (setup ✓), played at the sink (development), and played "louder, less broken" at the end (payoff ✓). The patched-bellows motif recurs and the final "resonant" note reweights earlier "wheezing regret." However, the accordion is mostly symbolic atmosphere; it doesn't constrain a choice or alter tactics. The reprise is purposeful but the object's use is descriptive rather than causal. Solid integration but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Map references shape the protagonist's methodology from early on (setup ✓): she documents graffiti as coordinates, marks "Point Zero," inks new routes (development ✓), and the final map-making closes the piece (payoff ✓). The core concept of cartography as emotional healing drives her tactics and appears in the closure beat. However, the maps themselves are told rather than shown—we never see a physical map or its specific content altering a choice. The concept is thematically present but doesn't constrain options with on-page cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Daringly methodical" is labeled twice but never dramatized as a trade-off. We see methodical actions (measuring cracks, counting tags, timing echoes) but no moment where daring and method conflict or enable a choice with visible cost. The trait is asserted rather than embodied in decision. Present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Allude" appears three times as the protagonist references graffiti in her journal and maps (setup and development ✓). The action of allusion shapes her cartographic method and appears at closure when she "alluded to Track 3 in her notes" (payoff ✓). However, the action is interchangeable with "noted" or "recorded"—it doesn't transform prior material or create a turn. The repetition is purposeful but the action itself is swappable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Bathroom graffiti wisdom is signaled early (men's room graffito in paragraph five: setup ✓), recurs with new graffiti in subsequent beats (development ✓), and the protagonist's method of seeking graffiti-as-compass is present at closure when she references Track 3 in her notes (payoff ✓). The method shapes her search and each graffito discovery reweights her understanding. However, the graffiti deliver wisdom rather than complicate choices—they're oracular rather than tactical. Solid integration but the method doesn't impose cost.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The disused railway station is established in the opening line (setup ✓), provides the graffiti locations and the shattered skylight scene (development ✓), and the Track 3 sign and rearranged ivy close the piece (payoff ✓). The setting supplies resources (graffiti, echo chamber for accordion, ivy-as-archive) that shape the protagonist's method and charge the final image. Spatial details (men's room, farthest stall, ticket booth) track cleanly. The station is causally active across all three gates and its specificity (railway, ivy, Track 3) is irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The timeframe "after stopping the medication" is mentioned in paragraph three (setup ✓) and sets the context ("three weeks prior") but doesn't tighten decisions or create urgency in subsequent beats. No clock pressures tactics and the story's present-tense window is vague. The medication detail primes her clarity but doesn't constrain later choices. Functional context but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The motivation to find a path to self-forgiveness is signaled early (paragraph four) via the sister-abandonment backstory (setup ✓), drives her mapping and graffiti-seeking throughout (development ✓), and the final "path…through the heart of her own neglect" and louder accordion affirm the quest (payoff ✓). The desire is dramatized through ritual actions and the graffiti offer friction ("Forgiveness isn't earned, it's unfolded"). However, the friction is more thematic than tactical—no moment where the cost of seeking forgiveness conflicts with another want. The motivation is present and coherent but not tested by competing stakes.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Tone of "raw solace" is established early with "accordion…wheezed like regret" and "breathing air thick with moss and memory" (setup ✓), modulates through weeping "with the raw solace of someone finally touching the wound" (development ✓), and charges the final image where the accordion is "still patched, still imperfect, but resonant" and she leaves "only the echo and the ivy" (payoff ✓). The tone coheres through turns—melancholy yet purposeful—and the final "raw solace" phrasing makes the tonal intent explicit. The tone is consistent and elevates the closure, though the direct labeling in the text ("raw solace") slightly undercuts the resonance.</comment>
