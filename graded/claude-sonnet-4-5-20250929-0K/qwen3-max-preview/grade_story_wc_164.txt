<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The recollectionist's emotional interiority is present throughout ("delight," "recognition," "giddy sorrow") but her choices feel more like discovery steps than pressure-driven decisions with visible stakes. The epiphany at the crater glass ("The missing pieces weren't lost. They were given away") arrives as declared insight rather than earned through contradictory impulses acting in scene. Her final decision to "carry it" and "wear the missing pieces as adornments" reads as emotional summary without a prior path foreclosed or visible cost that alters her tactics.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens inferred: Accumulative/Textural. The piece establishes a quest structure (discover why paths disappear via seeds), then shifts to a thematic reconfiguration at the crater glass. The closure unit is a Conceptual Repricing: paths weren't lost but "given away…as gift," reweighting the premise. However, cost is oblique—no on-page action or option is foreclosed by this realization; she simply "carries" the insight and scatters conjectures. The cadence shift and lyric reprise of "before memory fades" charge the ending, but the felt price remains abstract.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The geode cave is vividly rendered with prismatic halos, phosphorescent moss, and violet quartz clusters that provide concrete spatial anchors. The crater glass functions as a micro-setting focal point, constraining her final choice to press palms and receive visions. However, the cave's sensory richness is more atmospheric than tactical—it does not block or enable specific moves under pressure, remaining closer to vivid backdrop than environment-as-constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake: discover why paths disappear. The piece offers one meaningful deepening—the shift from "lost" to "given away"—that reframes the mystery but does not narrow live options or force a trade-off with visible cost. The recollectionist's agency is observational (pressing seeds, touching crater glass) rather than decisional; no on-page reversal tests commitment or alters tactics. The ending gesture (scattering conjectures) feels like thematic closure rather than escalation under pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: loss as gift, vanishing as resonance, "cheerful gloom" as shadow of joy. The crater glass and seed imagery recur with purpose, and the final line reprise ("before memory fades") reweights the opening. However, the penultimate paragraphs edge toward thematic statement ("Some paths disappear…so new ones can be sung into being") where scene pressure could carry the insight more obliquely. The emotional honesty and paradox register, but the ending leans instructional.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with consistent perceptual signature: lyric compression, associative leaps, metaphor-dense diction ("salt-crusted skin," "moon-kelp," "liquid honey"). Psychic distance is close throughout. However, elevated register persists uniformly across high and low pressure beats—"transliterates," "conjecture," "bittersweet wind"—without rhythmic modulation or compression under stress. The voice is textured but reads as a single lyric layer rather than a mind responding dynamically to urgency.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Figurative language is dense and often vivid ("laughter echoing like bubbles popping against stalactites") but appears in nearly every sentence, occasionally muddling clarity: "cheerful gloom, the paradox she wore like a second skin" stacks abstractions without concrete anchor. Paraphrase loops appear: "The missing pieces weren't lost. They were given away. Given willingly, joyfully…" restates across three beats. Template cadence is present in repetitive "She [verb]" openers. Artifact penalties apply for density and loop presence, capping high-band entry.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The premise—recollectionist gathering emotional seeds from a vanished bird in a geode cave—is imaginative but reads as ornamental world-building atop a familiar "loss reframed as gift" arc. The emotional transliteration mechanic and crater glass are specific inventions, yet the core turn (missing → given) is a well-trod thematic move. No element feels structurally irreplaceable; swap "seeds" for "echoes" or "cave" for "ruin" and the arc holds. Freshness is present in texture but not in underlying synthesis.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The sea-foam recollectionist is the focalizer throughout and performs all on-page actions (pressing seeds, touching crater glass, gathering more seeds). However, her choices are discovery steps rather than decision points that alter tactics or foreclose paths. The epiphany at the crater glass is experienced rather than chosen with cost. Present in all three gates (setup, middle, ending) and drives action, but agency is observational. Mid-band due to presence without decisive pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Crater glass appears at the cave's heart (midpoint), is handled (palms pressed, visions received), and returns as a pendant in the final sequence, reweighted from object to talisman ("cool, humming, alive with borrowed memories"). Two distinct beats: discovery and ending charge. The visions it provides ("child running…bridge dissolving…songbird mid-flight") trigger the thematic shift. Strong closure linkage and irreplaceability, but no visible cost tied directly to its use caps the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Missing pieces" is the core mystery, signaled early ("why some paths disappear"), drives the seed-gathering quest, is redefined at the crater glass ("weren't lost…were given away"), and shapes the ending gesture ("wear the missing pieces as adornments, not wounds"). The concept constrains her method (following emotional residue) and reweights at closure. Present in setup, middle choice (pressing seeds), and ending. High causal pressure and closure linkage push into the 7+ band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Transliterates emotions" is demonstrated on-page: she presses seed to temple, feels "giddy sorrow, a bittersweet wind," and murmurs "Laughter…then silence…then wings folding inward" onto kelp-paper. The trait enables her method (emotional archaeology) and is used in two beats (seed, crater glass visions). However, no visible cost or constraint is tied to the transliteration itself—it succeeds without friction. Functional and specific but lacks tradeoff, capping mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Conjecture" is named explicitly ("Each transliteration was a conjecture, a guess stitched from emotional residue") and recurs in the ending ("scattering conjectures like confetti"). It frames her epistemology but does not drive a major turn—she conjectures throughout without a moment where conjecture versus certainty alters her choice. Thematic accent rather than causal lever. Present in middle and ending but swappable with "interpretation" or "inference." Mid-band for presence without irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The migrating bird's scattered seeds are the mechanical heart: signaled early ("seeds dropped by a migrating bird that vanished decades ago"), used in two beats (pressing to temple, gathering three more near crater glass), and explained at the shift ("the bird…had scattered itself…as gift"). The method shapes her quest tactics (follow seeds, not maps). However, the mechanics are told more than tested—no beat where seed location or scarcity constrains her. Strong early signal and closure participation, but passive use trends mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The iridescent geode cave is established in the opening line, provides vivid sensory anchors (auroras, phosphorescent moss, amethyst, crystal dust), and houses the crater glass at its heart—the spatial climax. The cave's narrow exit frames the ending ("dawn's first light seeped through fissures like liquid honey"). Environment structures the quest spatially and charges the final move. Strong setup, middle constraint (she must go deeper), and closure linkage. Edges into 7+ for consistent spatial pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Before memory fades" bookends the piece (opening task, final line reprise) and implies urgency, but no on-page clock tightens her choices—she hums, crouches, laughs, gathers seeds without time pressure altering tactics or forcing trade-offs. The phrase functions as thematic motif rather than tactical constraint. Present in setup and ending (lyric reprise reweights meaning slightly) but absent from middle pressure. Ornamental use caps low-mid band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The motivation "to discover why some paths disappear" is her stated task, drives the seed quest, and is answered at the crater glass ("given away…as gift"). However, the desire is pursued without friction—no conflicting want (e.g., fear of the answer, resource cost, competing obligation) tests her commitment. The discovery is experienced rather than earned through choice under pressure. Present across all gates and causally linked to closure, but lacks internal conflict, capping upper-6s.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Cheerful gloom" is named explicitly mid-story and demonstrated throughout: she "laughed…loud and bright" while processing loss, "delight" coexists with "giddy sorrow," and the final image is "barefoot and grinning" while scattering remnants of vanishing. Tone is coherent and modulates the closure (joy charged by loss). However, the overt self-definition ("cheerful gloom, the paradox she wore like a second skin") tells rather than trusts the reader. Present in setup, middle, and ending; charges final image but lacks subtlety.</comment>
