<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The peacekeeper's motivation is established through extended reflection rather than on-page contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. Her transformation from library-hiding girl to witness is told retrospectively; the mirror scene offers a single crystallizing moment but no visible trade-off or foreclosed path. Interiority relies on abstract constructions ("courage that had shattered inside her") and therapeutic framing ("reconstitute," "map empathy onto action") that flatten embodied stakes. The crystal fragment warms and hums, but no cost or competing impulse complicates the final whisper.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes a clear Accumulative/Textural lens: the peacekeeper moves through the orchard, pressing the crystal to mirrors, accumulating glimpses of strangers' merciful choices, and arrives at her own reflection for a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is delayed—who, where, and when cohere only after ~150 words—triggering the −0.3 penalty and Q3 cap at 7.0. The closure offers Charged Poise (the whispered question reframes her mission) but the cost remains atmospheric rather than legible in a concrete action or forfeiture. The ice "groaning open" to reveal new paths reads metaphorical, not a dramatized consequence of her choice.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The lighthouse orchard above shifting ice floes is vividly rendered with sensory anchors (brittle frost, ancient-beast groans, salt-clouded glass). Spatial choreography is coherent across her ascent to the highest mirror. However, the setting functions primarily as backdrop; no environmental constraint forces a tactical choice or alters her approach. The mirrors and crystal are handled on the page but their physical properties (weight, fragility, placement logistics) remain abstract. Orientation delay caps this category at 7.0 per the cross-rule.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—reconstituting courage by mapping empathy—is signaled early and shapes the protagonist's iterative mirror work. Pressure accumulates through the ascent and the encounter with her own reflection, delivering one meaningful deepening when she sees the girl she was. Yet no live option is foreclosed; the crystal "warms" and she tucks it away with resolve, but no visible price is paid on the page. The ice shift at the end suggests possibility rather than consequence. Under the Accumulative lens one tightening suffices, but the cost remains implied rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the contrast between "absence of violence" and "presence of choice," grounded in the glimpses of strangers choosing mercy. The mirrors and crystal anchor the meditation on fractured courage. However, the final paragraph explicitly articulates the theme ("not as a peacekeeper enforcing silence, but as a witness offering reflection") rather than trusting image and action. The whispered question "What if we choose differently?" borders on a thesis statement. The piece resists tidy closure but leans on abstract vocabulary ("courageous anomaly," "weighted breath") that dilutes particularity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Voice is consistent and lyric, with controlled diction ("shadow-laced," "scar-map of lost futures") and rhythmic phrasing. Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping. However, elevated register persists uniformly across high and low pressure beats, missing modulation opportunities. Figurative density is high throughout without pattern-teaching or payoff variation. The peacekeeper's perceptual signature—calmly intuitive, attuned to wind and ice—remains asserted more than dramatized through micro-choices. Free indirect style is clean but the prose occasionally drifts into workshop abstraction ("the weighted breath before reply" recurs as a motif-label rather than a lived moment).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Figurative language appears in nearly every sentence of high-pressure beats without variation or relief: "shadow-laced," "scar-map," "weighted breath," "courageous anomaly," "trembling on the edge of decision." This density triggers −0.5 for overwriting. Several paraphrase loops appear: "not magical, not prophetic" / "not guiding ships anymore" / "not to fix it. Not to erase the cracks." Template stems recur: "She sought... She pressed... She lifted... She tucked... She walked." Cumulative artifact penalty: −0.9. Information density is moderate; many lines do double duty but scaffolding phrases ("It was slow work. The ice shifted. The lighthouse beam swept.") pad transitions. Clarity remains intact but momentum sags under metaphor weight.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The premise—post-war peacekeeper using salvaged mirrors to witness moments of mercy—offers a fresh angle on reconciliation narratives. The vintage-mirror mechanic and the "weighted breath before reply" timeframe are specific. However, the execution leans on familiar workshop patterns: the symbolic object (crystal), the protagonist's library-girl backstory, the climactic self-confrontation in the highest mirror. The ice floes opening to "reveal hidden channels" at closure reads convenient rather than earned by prior constraint. Emotional terrain is sincere but the prose relies on elevated abstractions ("courageous anomaly," "reconstitute") that dilute lived texture.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The shadow-laced peacekeeper is present throughout and her choices structure the narrative: she hangs mirrors, presses the crystal to each, ascends to the highest mirror, and whispers the final question. However, her actions follow a predetermined ritual with no visible cost or adaptation under pressure. The decision to reconstitute courage is established in exposition rather than tested on the page. She is present in setup, middle, and closure, earning two gates, but her agency is observational and iterative rather than causally pivotal.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The broken crystal ball fragment appears in setup (glinting in her palm), development (pressed to each mirror for "resonance"), and closure (warming, humming, tucked into her coat). Its jagged edge as "scar-map of lost futures" and shift from cold to warm light track its symbolic evolution. However, its mechanics remain abstract—"resonance" and "pulsing" are asserted rather than dramatized through observable effect. The fragment enables her ritual but does not constrain a choice or foreclose a path. Present in all three gates and charged at closure but functionally interchangeable with any talismanic object.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The "courageous anomaly" appears as a label in exposition and the glimpsed mirror-moments (soldier lowering rifle, trembling hand across counter). It is named explicitly multiple times but does not constrain options or create friction. The concept underwrites the theme but remains a thematic claim rather than a dramatized stake that shapes tactics. Present in setup and thematically at closure but ornamental in function.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The "calmly intuitive" trait is asserted in exposition ("She moved calmly intuitive, never rushing, never hesitating") and attributed to wind and ice guidance. However, no on-page action demonstrates this trait under pressure with visible cost or tradeoff. The peacekeeper's choices are deliberate but uncontested. Label-only mention without functional constraint or dramatized consequence.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The action "reconstitute" is named in the opening ("not to enforce, but to reconstitute") and returns at the climactic mirror ("to reconstitute its purpose"). It structures her mission and the iterative mirror work. However, the mechanics of reconstitution—pressing the crystal, absorbing weight—are abstract. The action is present in setup, middle (each mirror touch), and closure, earning all three gates, but its effect is metaphorical rather than causally pivotal. Removing "reconstitute" and substituting "restore" or "reclaim" would require only minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The vintage store mirrors are introduced in setup, used across the middle beats (each mirror holding a different glimpse), and the oval silver-backed mirror at the highest point anchors closure. The mirrors' salvaged origin and varied frames (gilt tarnished, glass fogged, cracked) add texture. However, the "via glimpses" mechanic is passive observation rather than a method that constrains her choices or creates friction. The mirrors enable the ritual but do not impose cost or failure risk. Present in all three gates and essential to the structure but functionally a static prop.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The lighthouse orchard perched above shifting ice floes is vividly described and anchors the spatial progression (edge → ascent → highest point). The ice groans and shifts, the beam sweeps, frost crunches underfoot. At closure the ice "groaned open, not to swallow, but to reveal hidden channels," suggesting environmental response. However, the setting does not constrain her choices or supply a resource that alters tactics; the ascent is unobstructed and the environment's transformation is metaphorical. Present in setup, intermittently in middle, and charged at closure, earning all three gates, but its causal role is atmospheric.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The "weighted breath before reply" is introduced in the first third as the suspended moment when "hearts decide whether to wound or to heal," recurs in the mirror glimpses, and returns at closure ("in the weighted breath before reply... she whispered"). It is named as the story's temporal frame and thematic fulcrum. However, it functions as a repeated phrase and conceptual motif rather than a ticking clock that tightens decisions. No dramatized urgency or countdown pressure; the peacekeeper's moves are unhurried. Present in setup and closure but ornamental in middle development.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The motivation "to map empathy onto action" is stated in exposition and drives the peacekeeper's mirror ritual. Her goal is reiterated at closure when she tucks the crystal away to carry into "the next village, the next mirror." However, the desire is told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants or costs. No friction between empathy-mapping and another need; no moment where the mission demands a sacrifice. Present in setup, structuring middle beats, and affirmed at closure, but the stakes remain abstract.</comment>
