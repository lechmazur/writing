<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's interiority relies heavily on abstract labels ("grief and resolve folded into glances") rather than embodied contradiction. Her emotions are performed through poetic description rather than dramatized through simultaneous conflicting impulses. The methodical execution of her heat-mapping lacks genuine struggle or mistake; competence overshadows vulnerability. No moment shows her wanting two incompatible things at once with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates emotional thermals and tuning-fork activations toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (the protagonist realizes she can "hear" through skin and bone). However, the closure moment lacks a visible cost or foreclosed path—she simply gains capability without trade-off. The thermal-mapping method is recounted in past tense ("she'd spent months developing") rather than tested under present pressure, weakening causality at the key turn.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The conservatory is vividly rendered with frost-limned glass, frozen fountain, and suspended ferns. The ice's crystalline structure constrains the tuning-fork method and the skylight guides her final gesture, charging the ending image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through her mission rather than catalog. Spatial choreography remains clear across rooms.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake (translating silence into music) is signaled early but never genuinely tested. No reversal or tightening forecloses an option; each tuning-fork strike succeeds without friction. The protagonist faces no meaningful obstacle, error, or trade-off. The accumulative design deepens understanding but does not escalate pressure or narrow choices, leaving the ending without felt cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The theme—presence beneath silence—emerges through concrete thermals and vibrations rather than assertion. The unshaken-marvels concept is explored through ice's harmonic response and the protagonist's sensory adaptation. However, the final paragraph edges into thematic summary ("not the absence of noise, but the presence of everything...") where image alone would have been stronger. The emotional honesty of her marvel avoids sentimentality.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited with consistent psychic distance. The prose has a distinct lyric texture with controlled rhythm and selective vocabulary ("winterglass," "thermal bloom"). However, elevated diction in peak beats ("rectify the misconception," "syncing with the thermal bloom") drifts from embodied perception into essay register. Filter verbs ("she felt it") dull immediacy where direct sensation would sharpen the moment.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Multiple paraphrase loops: "not broken, not exactly—just silently expressive" restates the same content; "not to mourn, but to rectify—not the disaster, nor the silence, but the assumption" cycles through near-synonyms without adding pressure. Template cadence in the climax section: "She smiled... She didn't need... Her skin... Her bones... Her heart..." The final third lists abstractions ("Love. Loss. Longing. Laughter") in place of concrete image, and "unshaken marvels" appears as a thematic echo rather than earned particular.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The heat-mapping-emotions method is a fresh synthesis of thermal imaging and musical translation. The silently-expressive protagonist pursuing music through vibration rather than sound offers a non-obvious angle. However, the core arc—lone scientist proves new method works—follows a familiar template. The lack of friction or failure limits the transformation; removing the conservatory and substituting another frozen space would leave the emotional logic largely intact.</comment>
