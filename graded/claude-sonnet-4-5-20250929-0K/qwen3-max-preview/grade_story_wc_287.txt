<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The gardener's motivations are grounded in grief and garden-keeping transformed into light-reflection, with the shift from brother's death to prism-placing creating a coherent arc. Interiority is often concrete ("Her own heart had been such a door once"), but the piece leans heavily on reflection without enough micro-choices under present pressure—most action is mechanical placement rather than conflicted decision. The locksmith's tooth measures pressure metaphorically but doesn't constrain a choice in real time. Embodied emotion ("knees aching, palms smudged") appears, yet peak moments slide toward abstraction ("protected vulnerability") rather than contradiction in action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece anchors who/where/when adequately by the harbor and fire escape setting, though "seventeen springs" arrives late as backstory. Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the prism placements layer toward a tonal shift from "quivering hush" to "reverence," supported by the child's laughter and the gardener's smile—a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where options crystallize without a decisive external act. Cost is felt (grief acknowledged, mission completed, departure signaled), but the final image "leaving the prisms to their work" is more quiet exit than reweighted pressure. One meaningful deepening present; no causality breaks, but the RR effect is softer than undeniable.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The harbor by moonlight, rusted fire escape, and prisms are vivid and purposeful; spatial choreography (northeast corner, alley below) tracks clearly. The prisms constrain her circuit and charge the ending image by casting light into streets, satisfying the micro-setting test for high-band entry. Sensory detail is selective (mercury shimmer, sapphire/amber light) and filtered through her focus. No occupation-depth penalty at this length; the setting integrates into action rather than stalling.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—transforming neighborhood despair into wonder via reflected light—is signaled early and tightens once through the circuit of prism placements, culminating in the child's laughter and the gardener's certainty. Agency is present (she chooses each angle, each corner) but the escalation is gentle accumulation rather than a forced choice with visible trade-off. The final cost (departure, mission complete, grief transformed) is felt but not urgent. One meaningful tightening under the Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves, and pressure coheres.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of resilience, light-into-darkness, and measured hope emerges organically from prisms, the locksmith's note, and grief backstory without overt moralizing. The final image ("city exhaled into dawn") and the lockmaster's tooth ("measuring depths") reweight prior material with quiet resonance. Subtext operates in gesture (not looking down, brushing soil from knees) and the charged hush that shifts to reverence. The ending avoids a stated moral and offers a non-literal answer to whether beauty can still be found, satisfying the 9+ quick test. One slip: "protected vulnerability" in paragraph 20 reads slightly labeled rather than purely emergent, though the tone supports it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV is stable; distance remains close to the gardener's perceptions ("She knew what they'd see" tracks inference cleanly). Perceptual signature is character-specific (garden metaphors, locksmith's tooth as tool and symbol). Diction is controlled and purposeful ("wistfully pragmatic," "quivering hush") with one brief register drift ("instill—a quiet transformation") that reads slightly elevated but voice-motivated. No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks in high-pressure beats. Rhythm modulates effectively (short beats at prism placements, longer reflective passages). The phrase "protected vulnerability" in the ending beats risks abstraction but remains anchored to her posture and mission.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose is rhythmically controlled and mostly clear, with vivid figurative language ("spilled mercury," "crimson sigh"). However, density of metaphor and elevated diction approaches overwriting in several beats: "quivering hush," "wistfully pragmatic," "protected vulnerability," and "seeding of resilience where fragility had taken root" stack near each other without sufficient plain-action breathing room. Paraphrase loop appears in paragraphs 19–20 (protected vulnerability restated twice). No template cadence or filter-verb stacks; syntax varies purposefully. Closure image is clear, but mid-story figurative density and one loop trigger cumulative deduction.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The fire-escape gardener using salvaged prisms to reflect moonlight into alleys is a specific, non-obvious synthesis that avoids template grief-to-healing arcs. The lockmaster's tooth as measuring tool (not lock-pick) and the oar-rhythm metaphor add fresh angles. Emotional truth (grief, quiet certainty) grounds the concept. One friction: the prism-placement mission, while具体, edges toward symbolic convenience—introduced elements (prisms, locksmith's note) serve the ending cleanly but feel slightly assembled rather than inevitable. Risk-taking is present (lyric pacing, quiet RR ending) and heightens meaning without obscuring clarity, earning small within-band bonus.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The fire escape gardener is present throughout and makes the choice to place prisms (middle development) and to leave them working (closure participation). Setup is clear in the opening paragraph. However, most beats are observation and mechanical placement rather than conflicted decision—she never hesitates, reconsiders, or faces a trade-off tied to her action. The choices are enacted but not tested under pressure. Two gates met (setup, closure); middle involvement is functional but low-friction. Causal pressure is mild; cost is retrospective (grief acknowledged) rather than a present sacrifice tied to prism placement.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The lockmaster's bitting gauge tooth appears in setup (paragraph 5), is handled and pressed against the railing (paragraph 9, reweighted as "not for picking locks"), returns in thought during the circuit (paragraph 24), and is tucked back into her pocket warmed by her skin (paragraph 28) before closure. Three beats with evolving meaning: relic → metaphor for measuring pressure → talisman of earned hope. It does not constrain a choice or enable a tactic under stress; its role is symbolic anchor rather than causal tool. Early signal, lyric reprise, and beat involvement lift it into mid-band; lack of causal pressure and swappability (any small keepsake could serve) prevent higher score.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Quivering hush" is introduced early (paragraph 4) as atmospheric setup, recurs in the ending (paragraph 27: "The quivering hush remained, but it no longer felt like suspense—it felt like reverence"), and frames the tonal shift that is the story's RR effect. It does not constrain a choice or change her tactics on the page; it is primarily a thematic/tonal marker. Two gates met (setup, closure participation); middle development is absent as a causal element. The reprise reweights meaning (suspense → reverence) and supports closure, lifting it above ornamental, but it remains concept-as-tone rather than concept-as-stake.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Wistfully pragmatic" is applied to her hands in paragraph 3 ("her wistfully pragmatic hands never mistaking sentiment for sustenance") but never returns or constrains an on-page choice. The trait is asserted rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses. Setup gate met; middle and closure gates absent. Label-only use and no visible trade-off or cost tied to this attribute. Swappable with "practical" or "unsentimental" without structural change.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Instill" is announced explicitly in paragraph 10 ("Her mission tonight wasn't to grow or prune, but to instill—a quiet transformation, a seeding of resilience") and enacted through the prism placements (middle beats) that drive the entire second half toward the ending's tonal shift. Setup, development, and closure all present. The action is specific to the mission and irreplaceable—removing "instill" (the deliberate seeding of wonder) would collapse the arc. Causal pressure is moderate (she acts, neighborhood responds), and the final image (children laughing, city exhaling) is the payoff. Cost is felt (departure, grief acknowledged). Strong integration across all three gates.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"With the rhythm of oars in water" appears in paragraph 11 ("She moved with the rhythm of oars in water: steady, patient, inevitable") and is reinforced in paragraph 12 ("Each step across the fire escape echoed that motion—left foot, then right, like a rower pulling through calm midnight currents"). Setup and development gates met; the metaphor shapes her pacing and stance during the prism circuit. However, it does not return at closure or constrain a choice under stress—it is descriptive method rather than causal mechanics. The oar rhythm is purposeful but swappable with any "steady, deliberate" phrasing. Lyric reprise absent; middle involvement is atmospheric rather than tactical.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The "luminous harbor by moonlight" is introduced in paragraph 2 and frames the entire scene, providing the moonlight that the prisms refract. It appears in the final paragraph ("The harbor gleamed behind her, moonlit and merciful") as closure participation. Setup and closure gates met; middle development is implicit (the harbor supplies the light resource she uses throughout). The moonlight enables her mission, but the harbor itself is backdrop rather than constraint—any night-lit setting with a light source would serve. Early signal, closure reprise, and resource enablement lift it into mid-band; lack of unique constraint or tactical pressure caps it.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the final petal drops from the old rosebush" is established in the opening line and marks the inciting threshold: the gardening era ends, the light-reflection mission begins. Setup and development gates met (the dropped petal signals her shift from growing to instilling); closure participation is present as the night mission completes and dawn arrives. The timeframe tightens the sense of transition and charges the "end of an era" tone. However, it does not create urgency or alter tactics under pressure—she works at her own pace without a ticking clock. The petal drop is a threshold marker rather than a live constraint, and the night-to-dawn span is atmosphere rather than countdown. Early signal, symbolic weight, and closure linkage earn mid-band; lack of tactical pressure prevents higher score.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"To reflect light into dark corners" is stated explicitly in the locksmith's note (paragraph 6) and enacted throughout the prism-placement beats. Setup, development, and closure all present: the note frames her mission, the placements dramatize it, and the final image (children chasing emerald light, city exhaling) delivers the payoff. The motivation is tied to grief (brother's death, her own sealed heart) and drives every major beat. One friction: the motivation is told in the note and reflected upon rather than conflicted in real-time choice—she never doubts, hesitates, or weighs competing desires. Cost is acknowledged (departure, mission complete) but not foregrounded as friction between wants. Strong setup and closure linkage with moderate causal pressure earn solid mid-high band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Protected vulnerability" is named explicitly in paragraph 20 ("Protected vulnerability—that was the tone of this hour, this harbor, this fragile act of defiance") and embodied throughout: her grief and pragmatism, the prisms' fragility casting light, the neighborhood's tentative wonder. The tone is coherent across turns (grief → action → quiet certainty) and modulates with pressure (quivering hush → reverence). It charges the final image (kneeling, brushing soil, leaving prisms to work, city exhaling). Setup is implicit in opening beats (grief, fire, silence), middle beats dramatize the fragile-yet-determined mission, and closure crystallizes the tone shift. One slip: the phrase "protected vulnerability" is stated rather than left implicit, risking label-over-embodiment. Strong tonal control and closure charge with one small label-speak friction.</comment>
