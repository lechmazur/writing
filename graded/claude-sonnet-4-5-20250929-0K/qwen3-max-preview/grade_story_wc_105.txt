<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's internal drive is clear and embodied—she listens with bone and marrow, tracks her own mitosis—but her interior contradictions remain muted. The work at the forge shows purposeful micro-choices, yet the emotional progression feels more asserted than dramatized: tears blur her vision at the crack of trust breaking, but we don't see competing impulses act simultaneously in that peak beat. The final smile and departure read as Earned Stasis with visible cost (leaving the forge, body thinned by hunger), but the interiority leans declarative rather than contradictory under pressure. One additional diagnostic note: the sister's voice hollow is told rather than demonstrated through a choice that reveals hierarchy of values.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors arrive early (greenhouse, aurora, shipwrecks by line 2) and the drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: density builds through layered imagery—forge fed by absences, color-sounds, cellular countdown—culminating in the crack of trust breaking and the forged memory-catcher. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): she leaves with the device, her work done because she's "harvested the silence and turned it into a compass," foreclosing return with visible cost (body thin, spirit scarred). Cost is legible in the final image. One meaningful tightening occurs when she hears the crack and pulls the device free, narrowing her task to completion. The lens holds without contradiction, though the "cells divide" motif and marrow-scope feel ornamental rather than causally integral to the turn.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The greenhouse with cracked glass ceiling, skeletal shipwrecks, and phosphorescent algae supplies vivid anchors and the forge constrains her method (burns absences, not fuel). The environment charges the final image: she climbs through the shattered skylight onto a moss-slick galleon deck, reinforcing her departure. Sensory hierarchy reflects her neural grafts (violet as hum, crimson as cello), filtering perception through her augmented hearing. Spatial choreography is mostly clear, though the transition from kneeling among petals to operating the forge under the ceiling feels compressed. The setting meets the 9+ gate test: the forge, greenhouse, and wrecks all constrain choices and charge closure, lifting the score despite minor compression.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—find the sound of trust breaking—is signaled in paragraph two and drives each beat: building the forge, feeding it absences, listening through bone. One meaningful tightening occurs when she hears the crack and recognizes it as the warning frequency, then forges the memory-catcher. Agency is clear: her decision to feed the forge her sister's voice hollow and her choice to leave the greenhouse foreclose paths with visible cost (scarred spirit, thinned body, no return). Pressure accumulates under the Accumulative lens through density and cadence shift. The cellular countdown ("while cells divide") is mentioned but does not materially narrow her options or alter tactics on the page, weakening the escalation slightly.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—grief as raw material for guidance, absence as signal—emerges from the forge's mechanics (burning hollows, imprinting voids) and the memory-catcher's function (lets others hear the warning). The final image offers a non-literal answer: she's harvested silence into a compass, not healed but equipped to guide. No thematic echo or moralizing mars the ending. Subtext operates in gesture (tears, smile, climbing out) and the recurring absences (sister's voice, vanished laughter) accumulate pressure without overt statement. The aurora and shipwrecks resonate as witnesses rather than symbols. One small slip: "alchemy of grief turned into guidance" borders on articulating the thesis, though it's embedded in her weary satisfaction rather than announced as moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Single-POV third-person limited with tight focalization: all perception filters through her neural grafts (hears colors, feels aurora in molars). Perceptual signature is distinct and consistent: "she listened—not with ears, but with bone, with breath, with the marrow-deep instinct." Diction remains within her register (forge, imprint, molten alloys) without jarring leaps, and psychic distance stays stable. No head-hopping. Narrative confidence matches her expertise (she knows what she's building), and elision is purposeful (we don't see every hammer strike, only the echo and result). Syntax and rhythm modulate with pressure: short fragments at the crack ("Not loud. / Not dramatic.") contrast with longer, layered sentences during forge work. Filter verbs are sparse and voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and sentence openings shift across paragraphs; information density is high in forge and closure beats. However, patterned artifacts cluster in the middle: "She closed her eyes and listened," "She froze," "She reached," "She smiled," "She packed," "She climbed"—a run of identical "She [verb]" stems across six beats. This template cadence dulls immediacy during the turn and departure, triggering a −0.6 deduction in Q7. Additionally, "the sound of trust breaking" and "the frequency of fracture" loop as near-synonyms without added pressure. Figurative density is high (aurora as heartbeat, forge burning absences, ash curling into hands) but remains mostly coherent. No major clarity breaks, and the final image propels cleanly. The artifacts do not obscure closure but prevent entry to the 8+ band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The premise—forge that burns absences to create a memory-catcher tuned to trust breaking—is specific and non-obvious, synthesizing synaesthesia (hearing colors), speculative neurology (grafts), and symbolic smithing into a fresh angle. The greenhouse-and-wrecks setting and cellular countdown are vivid but not essential to the core logic (remove them, the arc holds). Emotional truth (grief as raw material, sister's voice as hollow) anchors the speculative elements. The turn feels earned in hindsight: she's been listening and forging all along, so pulling the device free is inevitable. Proximity check: no close echoes of famous lines. One small hedge: the "battered but marveling" close leans toward a safety middle, tempering boldness. Risk-taking is present (accumulative lyric structure, abstract forge mechanics) but does not obscure clarity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The hearing aid designer identity frames her neural grafts and listening expertise (setup), drives her forge work and listening method (development), and her departure with the memory-catcher shows her professional purpose fulfilled (payoff). All three gates met. Her choices—feeding the forge, pulling the device, pressing it to her temple—create key turns. Causal pressure is visible: her augmented hearing enables the detection, and her designer role motivates the device's creation. However, the "hearing aid designer" label could swap for "sound researcher" or "audio engineer" with minor edits; the craft specificity (tuning frequencies, imprinting alloys) matters more than the occupational title itself. Two beats of involvement (forge work, device forging) plus closure linkage place it in mid-5s; swappability and slight abstraction prevent higher.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The ashen forge appears in setup (paragraph 5), is used across multiple beats (burning absences, flaring when fed the sister's voice, cooling at the end), and its ashes are declared "sacred" at closure, reweighting its meaning from tool to ritual site. All three gates met. The forge's mechanics (burns absences, not fuel) constrain her method and enable the imprint action. Specificity is high: "ashen," "embers glowing beneath soot and memory-dust," "no ordinary kiln." Its role is causal—without it, she cannot forge the device. It charges the final image: she leaves it to cool, work done. Two strong beats (feeding, forging device) plus closure participation and irreplaceability justify high-7s. Not indispensable in the strictest sense (a different ritual tool could substitute), preventing 8.5+.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Memories shape stakes on the page: the sister's voice hollow is fed to the forge, the memory-catcher stores the fracture frequency, and the closing line promises "someone would need to hear the sound before it was too late." Setup and payoff are present; development shows the forge burning memory-absences. The concept changes options: without collecting and imprinting memories, the device cannot exist. However, "memories" broadly construed could include "sounds," "losses," or "experiences" with minimal rewrites—modest swappability. The piece demonstrates impact through specific action (feeding the hollow, pulling the device), preventing pure ornamental scoring. Two beats of involvement and closure linkage place it solidly in the 6s, but the concept's generality and partial replaceability prevent higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The "hears colors faintly" trait appears in setup (paragraph 3: violet as hum, crimson as cello), constrains her perceptual method (listening through bone, hearing aurora as frozen bells, shipwrecks as harmonic dissonance), and charges her detection of the trust-breaking crack (color-sounds shift before the snap). All three gates met. The trait enables on-page action with visible mechanics: her neural grafts tune the spectrum, letting her hear what others miss. Cost is oblique but present—she's isolated in a sensory world others don't share, and her augmented perception is tied to her scarred pursuit. Two beats (color-sound listening, aurora chiming) plus closure participation and specificity lift it into mid-6s. However, "synaesthesia" or "augmented hearing" could replace "hears colors" with minor edits, and the trait is more enabler than constraint (no moment where it costs her), capping the score below 7.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The "imprint" action is signaled in setup ("She imprinted these voids into molten alloys, hammering silence into shape"), drives the middle beats (each forge strike imprints absences), and produces the memory-catcher at closure ("pulled free a small, curved device"). All three gates met. Major turns trace to imprinting: without it, the device doesn't exist and her quest fails. The method is specific and irreplaceable—imprinting voids into alloy is the story's unique mechanic. Causal pressure is high: the imprint makes the warning audible to others, redefining her grief as guidance. Two distinct beats (hammering, pulling the device) plus closure linkage and high specificity place it near 8. Not quite indispensable (a different recording/encoding method might work), preventing 8.5+, but close.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The method "by collecting absences" is signaled in setup (paragraph 6: the forge "burned not wood or coal, but absences"), shapes her middle attempts (feeding hollows of vanished laughter, promises, her sister's voice), and produces the result at closure (the memory-catcher tuned to fracture). All three gates met. The mechanics matter causally: absences are the raw material for imprinting, and without collecting them the device cannot exist. Specificity is high: "negative space where promises once lived," "the hollow where her sister's voice used to live." Two beats of involvement (feeding forge, final device) plus closure participation justify low-7s. Swappability is modest—"collecting losses" or "harvesting grief" could substitute with rewrites—and the method is more conceptual than tactile, preventing higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The "sunken orchard greenhouse ringed by shipwrecks" is anchored in setup (paragraph 1), the greenhouse's cracked ceiling and rusted wrecks supply resources (vibrating hulls, phosphorescent algae chorus), and the final image shows her climbing through the shattered skylight onto a galleon deck—setting as exit. All three gates met. The setting constrains and enables: the greenhouse houses the forge, the wrecks resonate with her strikes, and the orchard's frostbitten petals frame her quest. Spatial choreography is mostly clear, and the setting charges closure by forcing her physical departure. Three beats of involvement (kneeling, forge work, climbing out) plus high specificity and irreplaceability (remove the greenhouse-and-wrecks, the resonance and final image collapse) justify high-7s. Not quite indispensable—a different ruin could work—but very strong integration.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The timeframe "while cells divide" is mentioned in setup (paragraph 9: "She worked while cells divide—not metaphorically, but literally—monitoring her own marrow under a portable scope, tracking mitosis like a ticking clock"). It reappears conceptually ("every division a narrowing window, every new blood cell a whispered countdown"), but it does not tighten a specific on-page decision or alter her tactics. Setup is present; closure linkage is absent (the ending does not reference the cellular clock). The time frame adds atmospheric urgency and bodily stakes, but it's replaceable with "while the aurora fades" or "before dawn" without structural loss. One beat of involvement (marrow monitoring) without middle or closure participation places it in low-5s. Functional but not essential.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The motivation "to find the sound of trust breaking" is stated in setup (paragraph 2: "to find the sound of trust breaking, a frequency she believed only this place... could echo"), drives every middle beat (building forge, listening, feeding absences), and is fulfilled at closure when she hears the crack and forges the memory-catcher. All three gates met. Desire is dramatized through action: she kneels, listens, hammers, freezes at the crack. Friction exists between want and cost: her body is thin from hunger, her spirit scarred, and the sound she sought is "not a scream, but a whisper"—devastating rather than triumphant. Three beats of involvement (listening, feeding forge, hearing crack) plus closure participation and high causal pressure place it in high-7s. The motivation is stated rather than fully embodied in contradictory impulses, preventing 8.5+.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The tone "battered marvel" is coherent throughout: "her body thin from hunger, her spirit scarred by echoes—but still marveling at the alchemy of grief turned into guidance" (paragraph 31). Setup shows her scarred and driven, middle beats layer weariness with wonder (forge flares, aurora chimes, she smiles), and closure lands on "weary but unbroken." Tone modulates with pressure: quiet intensity during listening, sharper focus at the crack, satisfied exhaustion at departure. The final image charges the tone—she's battered (body thin, spirit scarred) yet marvels (alchemy, compass). The tone is slightly declared ("battered... but still marveling") rather than fully emergent from image alone, but the execution is strong and consistent. High-7s for coherence and closure linkage; direct articulation prevents 8+.</comment>
