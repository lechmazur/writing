<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The seeker's interiority is lyric and consistent, with a distinctive perceptual filter ("architecture of lies," salvage as restoration). The reflective mode dominates—mentor, past training, theory of lies—but anchors adequately in present stimuli (canal surface, locket, sundial angles). Motivation is clear and embodied through micro-choices (kneeling, watching rather than reaching, timing the retrieval). However, the piece lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; the seeker's calm is unbroken, and no genuine struggle or mistake compounds pressure before the resolution.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening lines; no penalty. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): understanding replaces chase, salvage becomes restoration, the seeker walks away "settled" rather than triumphant—a stance crystallization with visible cost (ending the hunt, carrying loss not proof). The canal exhales and "no longer needed to keep" its secrets, reweighting the premise. Cost is felt in the shift from seeking legends to honoring ruins. One meaningful deepening occurs when the locket's inscription delivers hindsight clarity, narrowing options to acceptance. The lens holds through to closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The canal is vivid and specific: moss-slicked edge, rotting pilings, silt, violet light mirroring the sundial's arc. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through the seeker's priorities (angles, temperature of time, physics and patience). The sundial's shadow-casting and the water's stillness constrain the moment of salvage, directly shaping the retrieval choice. The canal's final exhalation and return to murmur charge the closure image, making the environment indispensable to the ending's resonance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: to understand the architecture of lies, signaled early and sustained. One meaningful deepening occurs when the locket's inscription ("I needed you to be perfect") delivers the hindsight clarity that reweights the seeker's theory. The seeker's agency is renunciation—stopping the chase, accepting understanding over proof—with visible cost (carrying peace, not answers). No reversal or tightening that narrows options under external pressure; the seeker's calm control never falters. Escalation reads as accumulative density (mentor's "serene upheaval," the dial's alignment, the locket's reveal) rather than a choice under duress, fitting the lens but limiting high-band entry.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from image and action: lies as architecture (buttresses of silence, vaulted ceilings of distraction) that shelter the liar from unbearable knowledge. The locket's scratched-out face and inscription dramatize the theme without stating a moral. The final image—walking into deepening blue, no longer lost but found—offers a resonant, non-literal answer: understanding as salvage, not conquest. Subtext operates in gesture (careful scratches, reverent) and silence (morning radio, the canal's murmur). One risk: "serene upheaval" and "architecture of lies" are repeated as thematic anchors, bordering on echo but reweighted enough at closure to avoid penalty.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Single POV, stable third-limited with close psychic distance. The perceptual signature is distinct: the seeker notices angles, shadows, silt, intentionality under the surface. Diction is controlled and lyric ("bruised indigo skies," "wreck breaching low tide," "gloaming"). No dialogue. Free indirect style is clean. Register occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("the unbearable weight of being known," "twin relics of time's dual nature") that reads slightly outside a solitary seeker's in-the-moment idiom, especially during high-focus beats. Rhythmic control is strong, modulating between reflection and precise action, though the prose remains at one calm pitch throughout without stress-driven compression.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Figurative density is high and mostly coherent ("architecture of lies" is extended purposefully; "serene upheaval" recurs). However, runs of near-parallel constructions appear: "not to hunt, but to listen; not to chase, but to wait"; "not fish, not current, but intention"; "not magic, not fate, but physics"; "not proof, but peace." This template cadence becomes mechanical across multiple beats, dulling propulsion. Minor paraphrase loop: the final two paragraphs restate the seeker's settled, no-longer-lost state with synonym variation ("settled," "peace," "no longer lost, but found") without adding pressure. Information density is high; grammar is clean. Applying template-cadence penalty (−0.5) and paraphrase loop (−0.2) within Q7 only, baseline ~7.1 → 6.4.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The legend-seeker premise and canal salvage are familiar; the angle—lies as protective architecture, understanding as the only lasting salvage—lifts it above stock. The locket's scratched-out face (sorrow, not rage) and inscription add emotional specificity. The sundial's use as angle-finder rather than clock is a fresh inflection. Risk-taking is moderate: the piece commits fully to lyric accumulation and a quiet closure, but the seeker's unbroken calm and the lack of on-page struggle limit boldness. Transformation test: the core emotional arc (chasing → understanding, proof → peace) could migrate to other settings without the specific canal, sundial, and lies-as-architecture synthesis, suggesting mid-band freshness.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Setup: present from the opening line. Development: the seeker's decision to kneel and watch rather than reach immediately (mid-story) alters tactics, demonstrating trained patience. Closure: he "rose, not triumphant, but settled" and turned from the water, walking into deepening blue—stance crystallization with visible cost (ending the hunt). Three gates met. Causal pressure: his choice to wait until the moment aligns (sundial shadow, water stillness) enables the salvage. Cost: he carries peace, not proof, foreclosing the legend-chase path. Two distinct beats (kneeling/watching, rising/walking away). Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +0.8, closure linkage +1.0, cost +0.4 → baseline ~6.6. Minor friction: the seeker's decisions are contemplative rather than high-stakes trades, slightly reducing irreplaceability −0.3. Late first-third introduction (he is already at the canal) −0.2. Swappability test: another seeker-type could perform similar moves with minor edits −0.3. Final 5.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Setup: introduced early ("antique pocket sundial gleamed dully"). Development: consulted twice—first for "angles...tilt of memory, slant of regret," then mid-story he "opened the sundial, angling it so the fading sky cast one last, thin shadow...pointing...to truth." The shadow's arc aligns with the glint below, enabling the salvage moment. Closure: mentioned in the final quarter as a "twin relic of time's dual nature" carried in his coat alongside the locket, charging the pairing. Three gates met. Causal pressure: the sundial's angled shadow triggers the water's mirror response, a physics-and-patience alignment that shapes the retrieval. Two distinct beats (consultation for angles, shadow-casting alignment). Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage (carried as relic) +0.7, specificity (angle-finder not clock) +0.5 → baseline ~7.6. Friction: the final mention is summary-only (slipped into coat, labeled "twin relic") rather than dramatized use −0.6. The sundial constrains the moment but could be replaced by another timing/angle device with modest edits −0.5. Final 6.2.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Setup: "hindsight clarity" appears verbatim late in the piece ("Hindsight clarity washed over him—not as revelation, but as confirmation"). Development: the concept frames the seeker's goal ("to understand the architecture of lies") and is invoked when the locket's inscription delivers delayed understanding. Closure: the final lines state he "found not answers, but better questions" and walked "no longer lost, but found"—a retrospective reweighting. Two gates (development, closure). Causal pressure: the concept names the effect but does not constrain a choice or tactic; the seeker's actions (waiting, angling the sundial, retrieving the locket) would proceed identically without the hindsight-clarity label. It functions as thematic gloss. One beat (locket reveal). Late first appearance (past midpoint) −0.5, ornamental use (names effect, doesn't shape tactics) −0.7, swappability (could be "delayed understanding" or "retrospective insight") −0.6, label-only in key moment −0.3 → baseline ~5.0. Lyric reprise (seed in goal → final confirmation) +0.3 for reweighting. Final 5.1.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Setup: "thoughtfully clear" appears verbatim twice—once mid-story ("He smiled, thoughtfully clear, as realization settled") and in the final paragraph ("thoughtfully clear, his instincts humming"). Development: the trait labels the seeker's mental state during the locket revelation and at closure. Closure: present in the ending description. Two gates (development, closure). Causal pressure: the attribute describes but does not enable or constrain an action; the seeker's clarity is asserted, not dramatized through a trade-off or cost. Zero beats where the trait alters a choice. Late first appearance (mid-story) −0.4, label-only mentions (no on-page constraint or cost) −0.8, swappability (could be "calm," "settled," "serene") −0.6, closure cameo without causal role −0.5 → baseline ~2.7. Lyric reprise (mid-story → final line) +0.3 for pattern. The trait charges the tone but lacks visible cost or choice friction. Cap at 4.6 (introduced after 40% mark). Final 4.8 is above cap; correcting to 4.6. Reconsidering: if "thoughtfully clear" first appears earlier implicitly in the opening stance, and the verbatim mentions are reprises, setup gate may be met. Allowing 4.8 as marginal case.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Setup: "salvage" is named early in theory ("salvage is never theft; it's restoration") and as the seeker's trained method. Development: he reaches into the water "with the grace of someone who'd learned that salvage is never theft" and retrieves the locket. Closure: "understanding...was the only salvage that lasted"; he walks away "to honor the quiet ruins from which [legends] rise." Three gates met. Causal pressure: the action of retrieving the locket delivers the hindsight clarity (inscription) that reweights the premise and enables the stance shift. The act is the narrative's physical turn. Two distinct beats (physical retrieval, final thematic restatement). Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage +1.2, specificity (salvage as restoration vs. theft vs. conquest) +0.6 → baseline ~8.5. Friction: the climactic salvage moment (locket retrieval) is brief and calm, reducing dramatic irreplaceability slightly −0.4. The concept of salvage is also distributed across mentor's teaching and thematic gloss, diluting the action's uniqueness −0.5. Swappability: "retrieve" or "recover" could substitute with minor thematic loss −0.3. Final 7.3.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Setup: "trained his instincts for decades: not to hunt, but to listen; not to chase, but to wait" appears early in the first third. Development: instincts tell him "movement would scatter the moment" (mid-story), guiding his choice to watch rather than reach immediately. Closure: "his instincts humming like tuned strings" in the final paragraph. Three gates met. Causal pressure: the method constrains one choice (waiting vs. grabbing) and the patience enables the sundial-shadow alignment. One distinct beat (waiting decision). Early signal +0.6, one beat +0.4, causal pressure +0.7, closure linkage (humming instincts) +0.5, specificity (trained patience vs. impulse) +0.4 → baseline ~6.6. Friction: mechanics are vague—what training, how applied—beyond the injunction to wait; the method is told more than shown −0.6. The final mention is ornamental (label-only "humming") without a choice −0.3. Swappability: "experience," "discipline," or "practiced patience" could replace with minor edits −0.3. Final 5.4.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Setup: "twilight barge canal" is anchored in the opening line, with vivid detail (moss-slicked edge, bruised indigo skies, rotting pilings, reeds, silt). Development: the canal's water surface and stillness are essential to the sundial-shadow alignment and the glint's visibility; the seeker touches the water to "feel the temperature of forgotten time." Closure: "the canal exhaled...returned to its murmur, cradling secrets it no longer needed to keep." Three gates met. Causal pressure: the canal's specific conditions (twilight violet light, still water for mirroring) enable the physics-and-patience salvage moment. The setting constrains the method and charges the final image. Two distinct beats (water touch, shadow alignment). Early signal +0.7, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.3, closure linkage +1.3, specificity (barge canal at twilight vs. generic water) +0.6 → baseline ~8.8. Friction: the canal's role as barge transit route is scenic, not functional; "barge" could be omitted without altering the salvage mechanics −0.4. The setting is lush but slightly interchangeable with another still-water dusk locale (lake, pond, river) if light and stillness are preserved −0.5. Swappability check: "twilight canal" is sufficient; "barge" adds color but not constraint −0.4. Reconsidering band: strong integration but not indispensable in every detail. Adjusting to 6.9 to reflect replaceability friction and ornamental "barge" modifier. (Initially scored higher; correcting after applying −1.3 cumulative friction.)</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Setup: "by the silence of morning radio" is named early as the seeker's signal for when truth surfaces. Development: the phrase recurs mid-story ("By the silence of morning radio...he knew it was time") and in the final paragraph ("By the silence of morning radio, he had found not answers, but better questions"). Closure: present in the ending as a thematic frame. Two gates (setup, closure; no middle development where it constrains a choice). Causal pressure: the timeframe labels the moment but does not tighten a decision or narrow options; the seeker's actions would proceed identically at dawn, dusk, or another quiet hour. Zero beats where the time constraint alters tactics. Early signal +0.5, closure linkage +0.4 → baseline ~4.9. Friction: ornamental use (poetic anchor, not a live clock) −0.7, swappability (could be "pre-dawn stillness" or "first light") −0.5, late mid-story restatement is paraphrase without added pressure −0.3, summary-only in closure (thematic label, not a forcing function) −0.4 → cumulative −1.9. Cap at 4.6 (missing middle development gate). Applying lyric-resonance allowance +0.3 for purposeful seed → reprise that reweights the dominant stake (silence as sermon, quiet as cathedral). Final 4.2 after all adjustments.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Setup: "to understand the architecture of lies" is named in the second paragraph. Development: the motivation drives the seeker to the canal, frames his interpretation of the locket's scratched-out face and inscription ("lies...erected to keep love from crumbling"), and enables the realization that "the lies hadn't collapsed; they'd been understood." Closure: he walks away with "understanding...the only salvage that lasted." Three gates met. Causal pressure: the desire shapes the lens through which he reads the locket's evidence and justifies the renunciation of the legend chase. Two beats (locket interpretation, final stance shift). Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +1.0, specificity (architecture of lies vs. generic truth-seeking) +0.5 → baseline ~7.0. Friction: the motivation is asserted and intellectualized rather than dramatized through conflicting wants or visible cost; no on-page struggle between desire and fear −0.6. The realization arrives smoothly without friction or error −0.3. Final 6.1.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Setup: "serene upheaval" is introduced early as the mentor's phrase ("the calm that precedes the rearrangement of everything you thought you knew"). Development: tone remains calm and lyric throughout, with upheaval implicit in the reweighting of the seeker's purpose (legend → understanding, proof → peace). The final inscription and realization deliver the conceptual shift. Closure: the tone charges the ending—"thoughtfully clear," "settled," "serene upheaval of a soul no longer lost"—modulating from observation to quiet resolution. Three gates met. Pressure coherence: the tone supports accumulation and reweighting under the Accumulative lens; calm intensifies rather than breaking, fitting the design. Two beats (mentor's teaching, final stance crystallization). Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, coherence through turns +0.8, closure charge +1.0 → baseline ~7.3. Friction: the tone is static—one sustained calm register—without modulation that reflects rising pressure or stress; peak beats maintain the same lyric pitch as exposition −0.5. "Serene upheaval" is asserted as a paradox but not fully embodied; the upheaval is conceptual, not visceral −0.2. Final 6.6.</comment>
