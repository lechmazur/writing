<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elira's motivation to "exchange certainty for curiosity" is declared rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses in scene. Her actions flow smoothly without visible internal conflict—the methodically playful trait is asserted ("grinned," "laughed, breathless") but never costs her anything or forces a difficult choice. The climax dissolves into passive reception ("let the stories move through her") rather than an earned alteration rooted in prior struggle. The final stance shift reads as granted epiphany rather than hard-won renunciation with on-page cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchors WHO and WHERE by the opening lines; WHEN emerges via the framing phrase "pause between question and reply" but remains metaphoric rather than situational. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through sensory layering and the nickel's escalating involvement until the mural "awakens" and migrates into Elira. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the final image reweights her stance from restoration to curiosity—but cost is conceptual and oblique; no visible forfeiture or tactical constraint is dramatized on the page, weakening the felt price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The sound wave garden is vivid and purposeful: brass petals, stone benches, and archways supply the ricochet mechanic that unlocks the mural. Sensory detail is selective and tied to action (the nickel's warmth, the chorus from petals). The garden constrains Elira's method—direct touch fails, reflected sound succeeds—and charges the final image as it "rearranges itself" in a living cycle. Micro-setting (the nickel, her heartbeat in D-minor) extends the constraint into embodied consequence, meeting the 9+ gate criterion.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>One dominant stake is signaled: Elira seeks to awaken the Nested Awakenings mural. Pressure tightens when direct contact fails, then deepens when the reflected-sound method succeeds and layers of memory cascade. However, the tightening is achieved by discovery rather than protagonist agency under duress—she grins, flicks the nickel, and the mural responds without resistance or tradeoff. No live option is foreclosed; the resolution grants transformation without visible sacrifice, leaving escalation and cost legibility below the 8.0 threshold.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: exchange of certainty for curiosity, the nested structure of self-knowledge, and the value of surrender over control. The final image—warm river stone replacing the nickel, garden rearranging itself—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. However, the protagonist's articulation "to trade the certainty of her craft…for the wild, trembling curiosity" in the motivation paragraph echoes prompt language and flirts with thematic summary. The piece resists tidy closure and invites reflection through the cyclical framing, elevating thematic integration despite the mid-story echo.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and tightly filtered through Elira's perceptual signature: sonic metaphors, sensory hierarchy weighted toward sound and vibration. Diction remains consistent ("methodically playful," "ricochet," "nested") and voice-motivated throughout. Free indirect style is clean. The one slip: elevated phrasing like "the wild, trembling curiosity of not knowing what the next layer would reveal" momentarily floats above embodied perception during a reflective passage. No head-hopping; psychic distance modulates purposefully with emotional intensity. Perceptual specificity and rhythmic control under pressure meet the 9+ quick test but the slight register drift in one reflective beat holds the score in the high 7s.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Figurative language is dense and often layered within single sentences: "sound became shape. Shape became scent—wet stone, burnt sugar, ozone. Scent became story." This patterned repetition teaches a lyric mode and pays off at closure, so no overwriting penalty applies. However, paraphrase loops appear: "She hadn't come to fix anything. She'd come to be un-fixed" immediately follows "Her motivation had never been preservation, but exchange," restating the same idea without added pressure (−0.2). Template cadence runs in the opening: "not X, but Y" appears five times in quick succession without variation, dulling propulsion (−0.4). Cumulative artifact penalty: −0.6 in Q7. Information density is high when the piece advances; rhythm varies purposefully in the closure sequence. No filter-verb stacks or clarity breaks at closure, so high-band eligibility remains open but the loops and template stems prevent entry above mid-7s.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of sonic-art restoration, nested awakenings as experiential layers, and reflected-sound as method is specific and non-obvious. The nickel's transformation into a river stone offers a fresh, cyclical image that resists genre cliché. However, the "artisan discovers transformative mystery in their craft" frame is widely template-used; the piece personalizes it through sound-garden specificity and the ricochet mechanic, achieving transformation but not radical departure. Risk-taking in the accumulative-textural design and dense metaphoric texture heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, warranting +0.3 within band. The piece reads as a strong, particular execution of a familiar premise rather than a wholly original invention.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elira is present throughout and her choices drive key turns: she chooses to press her palm, to draw out the nickel, to flick it against a tuning fork, and to press it to the mural's center. These decisions enable the middle beats and the climactic awakening. However, her choices are discovery-driven rather than constrained by competing costs or flaws—no renunciation or visible tradeoff appears. She grins, laughs, and smiles through each step without friction. Setup and development gates are met; closure participation is present (she opens her eyes, touches her chest). Two distinct beats (initial failure, nickel use) and causal pressure (narrows method from direct to reflected) raise the score into mid-band, but lack of on-page cost and the ease of her arc prevent higher placement.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The hobo nickel is seeded early ("tucked in her left pocket—not currency, but charm") and used in three distinct beats: (1) it trembles and throws sound, (2) she flicks it against a tuning fork to create the reflected chime, (3) she presses it to the mural where it dissolves and is later replaced by a river stone. The object's unique grooves and generational history tie to the nested-awakenings theme. It enables the reflected-sound method and charges the closure image through its transformation. Setup, development, and payoff gates are all met. Causal pressure (+0.9), closure linkage (+1.0), and specificity (+0.5) elevate the score. However, the nickel does not impose a felt cost—its use is frictionless and its loss at the end is portrayed as gift rather than sacrifice, capping the score below 8.5.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The "nested awakenings" concept is introduced explicitly in paragraph 7 ("a layered sonic revelation meant to stir dormant perception") and dramatized when Elira experiences cascading layers: body memory (mother's lullaby), sensory memory (rain at age six), and existential realization (no fixed identity). The concept shapes stakes—her goal is to awaken the mural—and the mechanics of reflection mirror the nested structure. Setup and payoff gates are met; the concept constrains her method (she must use ricochet, not direct contact). However, the nested structure is more thematic resonance than tactical pressure: it does not force a difficult choice or visible cost on the page. One strong beat (the cascade sequence) and closure linkage (the mural migrates into her) place the score in mid-band, but the concept's primarily metaphoric role prevents higher placement.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Methodically playful" is declared in paragraph 6 and illustrated with examples: "measuring decibel decay with a grin, humming counter-melodies to test pigment adhesion." The trait is reprised twice ("She grinned," "She smiled, methodically playful once more"). However, it never constrains or enables an on-page action with cost—Elira's grinning and laughing are emotional coloring, not choices that foreclose paths or create friction. The attribute is label-only at key moments and swappable with "curious" or "experimental" without structural impact. Setup gate is met but development and payoff gates are weak; no causal pressure or closure linkage beyond ornamental reprise. Late arrival of the reprise and lack of cost cap the score below 5.0.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Bewitch" is not named on the page. Inferring it as the act of awakening the mural: Elira's use of the nickel to activate the mural through reflected sound does create the story's major turn. The mural "blooms," frequencies migrate into her, and the garden responds. This action is central to the climax and not easily swappable—removing it would collapse the arc. However, "bewitch" as a specific verb or thematic frame is absent; if the element is meant to be the general act of enchantment or transformation, it is present but implicit. Setup (rumor of the mural), development (the nickel's activation), and payoff (the awakening) gates are met. The inferred action drives two beats and shapes closure, but the lack of explicit "bewitch" language and the ease of the transformation (no resistance, no cost) limit the score to mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Through reflected sound" is seeded early ("archways that bent echoes into lullabies") and becomes the explicit method in paragraph 12: "it wasn't direct contact that woke the mural, but ricochet, echo, the bending of intention around corners." Elira flicks the nickel against a tuning fork; the chime spirals inward and strikes the mural "not as noise, but as question." The method shapes her attempts (direct touch fails, reflection succeeds) and is mechanically integral to the climax. Setup, development, and payoff gates are all met. The method constrains choice (+0.9), enables the key turn (+0.9), and charges the closure image (the garden's architecture, her heartbeat echoing). Irreplaceability is high; swapping for "direct touch" or another method would break the arc. The method does not impose a felt cost—it works smoothly once discovered—preventing a score above 8.5.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The sound wave garden is established in the opening lines and functions as both macro-setting and active constraint. Its architecture (brass petals, stone benches, archways) supplies the resources for reflected sound and pressures Elira's method: direct contact fails because the garden's design requires ricochet. The garden participates in the climax ("The garden laughed with her, petals trembling") and the closure ("the garden rearranged itself"). Setup, development, and payoff gates are all met. The setting constrains two key beats (+0.9), enables tactics under pressure (+1.2), and charges the final image (+1.0). Specificity is high—this exact garden's tuned resonances are irreplaceable. A felt cost tied to the setting is absent (the garden grants rather than demands), capping the score below 8.5, but integration is strong across all beats.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The timeframe "in the pause between question and reply" is the framing phrase in the opening and closing lines, creating a lyric bracket. However, it does not function as a live ticking clock or tactical constraint on the page. Elira's actions unfold in an untracked present; the "pause" is metaphoric rather than situational. No decisions are hurried or altered by time pressure. The phrase reprises at closure ("in the pause between question and reply, where all true change lives") to reweight meaning, but this is thematic resonance, not causal pressure. Setup and payoff gates are met via the lyric reprise, but development is absent—no middle choice is shaped by time. Lyric-resonance allowance permits a score in the 5.5–6.3 range, but the phrase's purely metaphoric role and lack of on-page constraint lower placement to low-mid band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The motivation "to exchange certainty for curiosity" is declared explicitly in paragraph 18: "Her motivation had never been preservation, but exchange: to trade the certainty of her craft…for the wild, trembling curiosity of not knowing what the next layer would reveal." It is reprised in the final lines: "Curiosity, not certainty, now guided her steps." This framing shapes the arc's thematic spine and is dramatized when Elira surrenders to the mural's cascade ("She didn't watch. She let the stories move through her"). Setup and payoff gates are met. However, the motivation is more told than shown through conflicted choice: no on-page moment forces her to weigh certainty against curiosity with visible cost. The trait enables the ending stance but does not constrain a middle decision or create friction. One beat involvement (the surrender), closure linkage (+0.7), but weak causal pressure and label-heavy articulation cap the score in mid-band.</comment>
