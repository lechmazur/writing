<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation ("to find the beginning in every ending") is told rather than dramatized through concrete micro-choices under pressure. Her actions—unrolling the coil, placing the fragment, tuning—read as competent execution without visible struggle or internal contradiction. The moment of understanding ("It was a mirror") arrives as assertion rather than earned realization tied to prior on-page costs. Embodied emotion is largely absent; labels like "serenely electric" and declarative insights ("she understood then") replace contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes who and where by the opening paragraph (interpreter, tower, gorge), satisfying the Orientation Test. Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density builds through image layering (fragment, moon, towers) toward a final reconfiguration where the city awakens. However, the closure effect—towers singing, city broadcasting—lacks visible cost; the protagonist simply "packed her coil" and descended with no path foreclosed or trade-off legible. The accumulative pattern is present but the Resonant Reconfiguration does not land with felt consequence on the page, capping this below 7.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Setting anchors early and vividly: rusted gantry, frost-glazed metal, skeletal towers, mist-choked gorge. The suspended radio tower city supplies atmosphere and spatial coherence throughout. The towers function as instruments at closure, charging the final image when "antennae straightened" and "capacitors glowed," meeting the 9+ gate requirement that setting constrain choice or charge the final image. Sensory selection remains purposeful (moon "honey-gold," fragment "oxidized chrome") without postcard enumeration.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—tuning to find "the beginning in every ending"—is signaled early and coheres across the piece. Pressure accumulates through image and ritual (fragment placed, moon crests, wind stills, pulse arrives) but does not tighten through protagonist agency or a trade-off that narrows options. The final "tuning" succeeds without visible cost, obstacle, or failed attempt; the towers respond smoothly and she descends satisfied. One meaningful deepening occurs (fragment dissolves, city awakens) but lacks the felt price or foreclosed path required for higher bands under any lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme—endings contain beginnings, failure crystallizes truth—emerges from particulars (Hollywood fragment, broadcast city, archivist's death) without overt moralizing. The mirror insight and "fantasy practicality" frame offer conceptual texture. However, the final image of the city "broadcasting the sound of genesis" edges toward abstraction rather than earned particularity, and the protagonist's arc lacks the friction or micro-choice that would root thematic resonance in lived cost. Subtext operates in the fragment's history and the city's metaphor but does not deepen through contradiction or ambiguity at closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited; no head-hopping. Voice carries a consistent elevated register ("serenely electric," "liquid silver," "negative space") that fits the interpreter's perspective. Perceptual signature is present (she notices cosmic frequencies, fragments, tower lattices) but diction sometimes drifts into generic lyricism ("wound between moments," "shape of a beginning") that could describe any mystical quest. Psychic distance stays controlled. Purposeful compression and fragment-like syntax ("Not sound. / Not light.") teach a pattern paid off at closure, though the register remains uniform under pressure rather than modulating with emotional intensity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and individual images are vivid ("oxidized chrome," "frost-glazed metal"). However, several paraphrase loops appear: "serenely electric" repeats three times, "suspended" twice in close proximity, and the phrase "not [X] but [Y]" recurs mechanically ("not for ghosts, but for silence"; "not sound. / Not light."; "not magic divorced from mechanism, but wonder rooted in function"). Template cadence in the closure sequence—"Antennae straightened. / Capacitors glowed. / Static became symphony."—flattens propulsion. Minor filter-verb stacks ("she felt," "she knew," "she understood") dull immediacy in peak beats. Applying paraphrase-loop (−0.2), template-cadence (−0.4), and filter-verb cluster (−0.3) penalties totals −0.9, lowering from a ~7.1 baseline.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The core synthesis—celestial interpreter, Hollywood star fragment, abandoned broadcast city—offers surface novelty but leans on familiar tropes: lone mystic, sacred relic, ruin-as-instrument. The "endings contain beginnings" premise is archetypal without a specific, lived-in transformation that makes it feel inevitable in hindsight. The final turn (towers awaken, city broadcasts) reads as competent execution of the setup rather than a non-obvious inflection earned by prior particulars. Emotional specificity is thin; the protagonist's arc could transfer to another quest with minor edits, signaling insufficient transformation per the test.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The celestial signal interpreter is present throughout and her choices (unrolling coil, placing fragment, tuning, discarding assumptions) drive each beat. She appears in the setup, enables the middle pulse, and conducts the towers at closure, meeting all three gates. However, her decisions lack visible cost or trade-off; the tuning succeeds smoothly without failed attempts or sacrificed options. The arc is observation → execution → satisfaction rather than contested agency. Causal pressure is present but not strong; irreplaceability is moderate (another seeker could fill the role with minor edits).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The Hollywood star fragment is introduced early (paragraph 5), handled in two distinct beats (placed in coil array, dissolves into motes at closure), and causally enables the pulse and city awakening. Its serrated edges, oxidized chrome, and vibration with cosmic frequencies supply specificity. It shapes the middle turn (releases "shard of hush") and participates in closure (dissolves, motes spiral to moon). Cost linkage is weak—no sacrifice tied to its use—but its irreplaceability is high: the story's logic hinges on this exact object's manufactured-yet-cosmic resonance. Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +1.2, specificity +0.6, minus swappability friction −0.5 for generic "fragment" function.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"A shard of hush" is the sought object, named in paragraph 2 and realized in the middle beat when the fragment releases "negative space—a shard of hush so pure it carved silence into the air." It shapes stakes (she chases silence, not noise) and reappears in closure (motes carry "a shard of hush to the waiting moon"). The concept constrains her method (tune by discarding assumptions, not amplifying signals) and charges the final image. Setup gate met (paragraph 2), development gate met (fragment pulse), closure gate met (motes carry hush). Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage +1.4, specificity +0.5, minus mild ornamental use friction −0.3 for poetic repetition without evolving function between middle and end.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Serenely electric" appears three times as a label (gloves hum, aura makes teeth tingle, current surges at closure) but does not constrain or enable a choice with visible cost. It colors atmosphere and signals the tuning process but remains ornamental; the protagonist could tune without this specific quality. Setup gate met (paragraph 3), closure gate weakly met (current surges), but development gate missed—no middle choice hinges on this trait. Label-only trait deduction −0.6, ornamental use −0.5, swappability −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Tuning is the protagonist's central action, present in setup ("her tuning coil"), middle (she "tuned deeper, discarding the assumption"), and closure ("she had" tuned, towers "sang on"). It enables the pulse, city awakening, and final broadcast. The method is specific (not by dials but by discarding assumptions) and irreplaceable—removing "tune" would break the story's logic. However, the action lacks visible friction or failed attempts; she tunes once and succeeds. Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.3, closure linkage +1.5, specificity +0.7, minus lack of visible cost friction −0.5 for smooth execution without trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"By discarding assumptions" is named in the middle beat ("by discarding assumptions") and enacted on the page: she lets go of "the belief that signals must be loud," "that meaning must be linear," "that endings were terminal," then tunes deeper discarding "the assumption that time flowed forward only." The method shapes her approach and differentiates her tuning from mechanical adjustment. Setup gate missed (not signaled early), development gate met (she discards beliefs mid-scene), closure gate met (towers respond to her tuned state). Two beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +1.0, specificity +0.6, minus late first appearance (second third) −0.4, summary-only friction −0.3 for told execution ("she let go") rather than dramatized struggle.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The abandoned radio tower city suspended over a gorge anchors every paragraph: gantry, skeletal towers, mist-choked gorge, rusted lattice. It supplies resources (capacitors, transmitters, antennae) that respond to her tuning and become instruments at closure. The setting constrains her location and enables the final broadcast. Setup gate met (paragraph 1), development gate met (towers lean, whisper static), closure gate strongly met (antennae straighten, capacitors glow, city broadcasts). Early signal +0.8, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.4, closure linkage +1.6, specificity +0.8, irreplaceability +0.7, minus no friction.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Lunar perigee is named in paragraph 2 ("during lunar perigee") and arrives on the page in paragraph 11 ("Lunar perigee had arrived"), triggering the tuning window. It tightens the timeframe and enables the pulse. However, the element does not impose a ticking cost or alter tactics beyond arrival; once present, time pressure dissolves. Setup gate met (paragraph 2), development gate met (moon crests, enables pulse), closure gate missed (no time constraint at ending). Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +0.8, closure linkage +0.0, minus missing closure gate cap at 4.6 waived by strong middle function, swappability friction −0.4 for generic cosmic timer.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"To find the beginning in every ending" is stated explicitly in the final third ("Her motivation had never been glory or revelation… to find the beginning in every ending") and echoed throughout (Hollywood's "ending contains the seed of its own genesis," the pulse as "the shape of a beginning curled inside the echo of an ending"). The motivation shapes her quest and is satisfied at closure (she finds genesis in the city's awakening). However, it is told rather than dramatized through conflicted micro-choices; no visible friction between this want and a competing desire or cost. Setup gate weakly met (implied by her role), development gate met (she seeks the pulse), closure gate met (motivation satisfied). Two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.2, minus told-only friction −0.8, late explicit naming −0.3.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Fantasy practicality" coheres throughout: salvaged relic, copper-threaded gloves, buried capacitors, rusted lattice, "not magic divorced from mechanism, but wonder rooted in function." The tone balances mystical imagery (moon, stardust, cosmic frequencies) with mechanical detail (transmitters, coil array, lead-lined box) and remains stable across beats. It modulates subtly at closure when practical detail (antennae straighten, capacitors glow) fuses with lyric charge (city "shimmered," "broadcasting the sound of genesis"). Setup gate met (paragraph 3 onward), development gate met (fragment mechanics), closure gate met (towers as instruments). Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +1.4, coherence and modulation +0.8, specificity +0.6, minus no friction.</comment>
