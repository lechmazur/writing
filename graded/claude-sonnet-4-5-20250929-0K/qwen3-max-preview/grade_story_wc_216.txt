<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Vey's motivation—understanding time's texture—is established early and shapes their curation activity, but the transformation from bureaucrat to curator lacks embodied struggle; the heartbeat-by-emotion premise is evocative yet remains label-only without constraining a pivotal choice. Lira appears functional but could be any sympathetic stranger; her grief is asserted more than dramatized. The final shift to "curating echoes" feels thematically declared rather than earned through on-page cost that forecloses a prior path. Internal contradiction and embodied emotion are present in fragments but do not act simultaneously under peak pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece accrues sensory imprints and symbolic fragments toward a final reconfiguration where Vey's heart beats steadily and their role shifts from measuring to curating. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (the fused urn, the steady heartbeat, the new listings) with conceptual cost visible in the renunciation of counting seconds. Orientation anchors (emerald silo, Vey, salt flats) arrive within the first 120 words. One meaningful deepening occurs when the urn fragments fuse and the translucent moments appear, reweighting the capsule's function and Vey's understanding. Causality is loose—Lira's arrival and the letter's instructions feel coincidental rather than motivated—but under the Accumulative lens this is permissible as complication, not resolution.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The emerald silo is vivid and recurs throughout, framing the space and charging the final image when its walls ripple and hum in harmony with the urn. Sensory detail is dense and purposeful: "refracted light," "glaze still warm," "scent of rain and old paper," "translucent figures." The salt flats and silo's curved walls create a contained, lived-in micro-setting. The urn fragment and capsule function as tactile anchors that constrain Vey's investigation and enable the climactic fusion. Spatial choreography is clean; the workbench, threshold, and core remain legible across moves.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding time's new texture—is signaled early and reweighted at closure when Vey shifts from measuring to curating. One meaningful deepening occurs when the urn fragments fuse, releasing the translucent moments and restoring Vey's heartbeat. Agency is present in the decision to post garage-sale listings and to meet Lira, but the capsule's opening and the fragments' fusion feel more discovered than fought for; coincidence (the tremor, Lira's reply, the letter's instructions) complicates without clear protagonist cost. The final listings demonstrate a stance crystallization, yet the price paid—renouncing the old role—is conceptual rather than viscerally tested on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—time as accumulation rather than passage—emerges organically from the fused urn, the translucent moments, and the grandmother's letter without direct statement. The final garage-sale listings offer a resonant, non-literal answer: objects become vessels for suspended emotion, and curation replaces measurement. Subtext operates in the urn's warmth, the silo's hum, and the choice to "summon" rather than sell. The piece resists tidy morals; the refusal to count seconds is both liberation and renunciation. One weakness: "Time, Vey now knew, wasn't to be measured" in the penultimate line edges toward thematic summary, though it stops short of moralizing and the final listings anchor the insight in specific objects.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited on Vey with clear psychic distance; Lira's brief dialogue and action do not constitute head-hopping. Voice carries a lyric, contemplative texture suited to the Accumulative mode: "whispered textures," "breath by breath," "dust. Like love. Like unread letters." Diction is elevated but consistent, filtered through Vey's poetic sensibility. The garage-sale descriptions demonstrate voice-as-character. One slip: "They curated echoes" in the penultimate section reads slightly over-articulated for peak pressure, though it serves thematic closure. Dialogue is minimal but purposeful; Lira's two lines advance plot and carry subtext about grief and legacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout—"time's fabric unraveling," "ribs expand," "dust. Like love"—and while most images land cleanly, the accumulation risks slight overwriting in non-peak beats (e.g., "borrowed-time timekeeper" as epithet, "Hollow Net" as brand). Template cadence appears in the final garage-sale listings: three consecutive items with parallel structure ("still steams," "remembers mud," "feel the season"), which reads purposeful but edges toward predictable patterning. Information density is strong; most lines do double work. No paraphrase loops or register drift. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, though the lyric register is sustained without tonal modulation under pressure. Minor clarity issue: "Great Recalibration" and "Hollow Net" are introduced without anchoring detail, creating momentary disorientation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The premise—numbers as textures, timeless heartbeat, messages in garage-sale listings—is imaginative and tightly braided. The urn-as-echo-vessel and capsule-as-adaptive-storage transform familiar time-travel tropes into something fresher. The final listings demonstrate specificity: "handle warms when held by someone who misses their mother" is concrete and voice-particular. Risk-taking in the lyric-accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. One limitation: the convergence of Lira, the letter, and the matching urn fragment feels slightly convenience-plotted; the capsule's "adaptive" function is revealed rather than discovered through prior struggle, reducing earned inevitability. Emotional truth in Vey's shift from bureaucrat to curator resonates, grounding the fantastical elements.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Vey is present throughout as focalizer and actor. Setup: established in paragraph one. Development: decides to post garage-sale listings (middle), meets Lira, helps open the capsule. Payoff: feels their heart beat steadily, begins writing new listings to summon. Choices shape two beats (meeting Lira, opening the capsule) and the ending. Causal pressure is moderate; the heartbeat restoration and role shift feel more granted than fought for. Cost is conceptual (renouncing measurement) rather than embodied in a hard trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The urn fragment is handled in three distinct beats: on Vey's workbench (early), placed near the silo's core to test its pulse (middle), and pressed together with the second fragment to fuse and emit the chime (ending). The object's warmth and mother-of-pearl flecks are specific. It enables the climactic fusion and directly shapes the closure image (translucent moments, restored heartbeat). Irreplaceability is high; no generic relic could replace its echo-storage function. Cost linkage: the fusion reweights Vey's understanding and role, though the price is conceptual rather than a hard forfeiture.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The damaged time capsule frames the central investigation from paragraph two and reappears in six beats: Vey tracing symbols, the capsule's glyphs rearranging under Lira's touch, the inner chamber opening, the letter's revelation that it's "adaptive," and the final understanding that it stores fractures as sensory imprints. It shapes tactics (meeting Lira, interpreting coordinates) and the ending realization. The twist—damage as design—is earned by prior setup and directly charges the closure. Specificity and irreplaceability are strong.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Suddenly timeless" is established early (Vey's heartbeat "only when emotion surged") and mentioned twice more (the heartbeat stutters, then beats steady at closure). It constrains Vey's existence—"every gasp, every sigh, a deliberate act of will"—and the restoration of rhythm at the ending carries emotional weight. However, the trait does not visibly narrow a choice or impose a tactical cost in a key beat; it functions more as thematic backdrop than active constraint. Cost is present but oblique.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Rediscover" is enacted when the capsule is unearthed by the tremor and again when Vey and Lira open its inner chamber to find the letter and second urn fragment. The action enables the middle turn (letter's revelation) and the ending (fusion, translucent moments). However, the rediscovery is reactive (the tremor happens; Lira arrives with knowledge) rather than driven by Vey's struggle. Swappability is moderate; a different mechanism (deliberate excavation, a map) could substitute with edits. Present in closure, but causal pressure is shared with coincidence.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The garage-sale listings are introduced in paragraph seven as Vey's coping method and demonstrated with two examples ("still hums with the ghost of breakfasts unmade"). They return in the middle (the method lures Lira) and dominate the ending, where three new listings ("Cobalt teapot," "mismatched boots") embody Vey's transformed role. The method is specific, voice-particular, and irreplaceable; it directly links Vey's isolation to connection and closure. Causal pressure: the listings enable the meeting with Lira (middle beat) and articulate the final stance. Cost: conceptual (shift from measurement to summoning).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The emerald silo is established in the opening line and recurs in nine beats: humming walls, Vey's workbench inside, the foundation where the capsule was found, the threshold where Vey meets Lira, the core where the urn pulses, the walls rippling at closure. It supplies spatial coherence and charges the final image when the silo harmonizes with the urn's tone. The setting constrains access (the capsule beneath the foundation) and provides the ambient glow that illuminates the urn's mother-of-pearl. Irreplaceability is high; a generic warehouse could not supply the same resonance.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"After numbers change meaning" is established in paragraph two ("after the Great Recalibration") and colors the entire premise: numbers whisper textures, Vey's ledger becomes obsolete, time is no longer countable. The timeframe shapes Vey's motivation and the world's logic. However, it does not tighten a specific decision or create a live clock; it functions as static backdrop rather than escalating pressure. Present in setup and thematically in closure (the renunciation of counting), but it does not narrow options in the middle beats.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Vey's desire "to understand the texture of time passing" is stated in paragraph three and dramatized through the investigation of the capsule, the garage-sale listings, and the meeting with Lira. The motivation conflicts with the old role (bureaucrat of seconds) and drives the shift to curator. Payoff: the grandmother's letter articulates the insight ("time accumulates"), and Vey's new listings enact it. Friction is present (the heartbeat irregularity, the obsolete ledger) but mostly conceptual. The motivation shapes three beats (posting listings, opening capsule, writing new listings) and charges the ending.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Tone is lyric, contemplative, and gently mysterious throughout: "humming faintly as if remembering a song," "whispered textures," "suspended moments." It modulates subtly under pressure (the capsule groans, the urn vibrates, the silo ripples) without breaking coherence. The tone charges the final image (translucent figures, new listings) and supports the Accumulative lens. One minor slip: the tone remains consistently elevated without breathing during high-information beats (Lira's arrival, the letter's reading), which slightly flattens urgency. Overall, the tone is purposeful and unified.</comment>
