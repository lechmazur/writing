<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation—finding beauty in imperfection—is consistently embodied through his actions (arranging plants, listening to the reed tongue). His perceptual signature (textures and resonances rather than hues) shapes every choice and grounds his interiority in specifics. However, the final change feels more like recognition in Marta than earned transformation in Elias; he remains essentially static, teaching rather than changing. The body of the story shows micro-choices (choosing plants by stem stiffness, wedging the reed "just so"), but the ending lacks a visible cost or foreclosed path for the protagonist.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchors clearly by the first paragraph (glassblower's courtyard, Elias, post-phoenix setting). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through plant arrangements and the courtyard's gradual awakening, culminating in Marta's mirrored action with the sunflowers. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—Marta's recognition and the pact to "wake the kiln" crystallize shared stakes with undeniable pressure. The cost is conceptual and relational (Marta shifting from merchant to student, both committing to root-and-rust methods), legible in the final exchange and the courtyard's hum of agreement.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The courtyard is vividly anchored (cobblestones, cracked birdbath, ash-patterns, overgrown flora) and directly constrains Elias's choices—he arranges plants by "stem stiffness, leaf serration, root depth" and wedges the reed beneath a slate tile "angled just so." The micro-setting (soil, specific plants, the kiln mentioned at closure) charges the final image when Marta rearranges charred sunflowers and green shoots push through. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Elias's textural perception (moss as "damp velvet," maple as "brittle crackle").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake—awakening the courtyard's spirit—is signaled early and tightens through Elias's arrangements, the reed tongue's vibration, and the courtyard's responses (rosemary twitches, ivy uncurls, birdbath fills with dew). The tightening is driven by protagonist agency: Elias chooses each plant placement as "a plea, each spacing a question." Marta's mirrored action (rearranging charred sunflowers) brings a micro-reversal that deepens the stake—her shift from observer to participant—and the green shoots' emergence provides visible proof of the awakening. Cost is felt in the commitment ("tomorrow, we wake the kiln") and the implicit foreclosure of returning to purely commercial glass work.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—finding beauty in brokenness, salvage over spectacle—emerges through concrete actions: Elias sifting scrap heaps, choosing the dulled reed tongue, arranging plants not for bloom but for structural resonance. The "bartered awakenings" concept (soul-stuff exchange) integrates naturally via honey/lullaby trade and the plant-courtyard dialogue. The final image (green shoots through ash, the pact to wake the kiln with "root and rust") reweights the opening phoenix motif without stating a moral: the embers and cracks matter more than the fire. One minor slip: "innocently cunning" is stated twice as a label rather than fully embodied in contradictory action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, anchored in Elias's perceptual signature (textures, resonances, weights). Voice is distinct and controlled: "green wasn't green to him, but the damp velvet of moss after rain." Dialogue is minimal but functional, carrying subtext (Marta's "What did you do?" / "Listened" / "And then?" / "Bartered"). One weakness: the phrase "innocently cunning" appears identically for both Elias and Marta, flattening voice distinction at a charged moment. Psychic distance is consistent; no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks that dull immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear and rhythmically varied, with strong specificity ("concertina reed tongue," "mugwort behind them in staggered rows"). However, two sentence-stems repeat in the plant-arrangement passage ("He was communicating… He wedged it… He showed her…"), creating template cadence. The phrase "innocently cunning" recurs identically without transformation. Final-third artifacts: "not with paint or flame, but with root and rust, with arrangement and resonance, with bartered awakenings traded not for perfection, but for…" stacks parallelism to near-opacity. These issues collectively trigger −0.6 for patterned artifacts and disallow 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The synthesis—colorblind painter using plant arrangements as courtyard-language after a phoenix's rise—is specific and non-obvious. The reed tongue as resonator/translator transforms a generic "magic object" into a tool with mechanical purpose. The piece commits fully to its premise (salvage over spectacle, communication through botanical structure) and avoids hedging. Risk is present in the unconventional method and quiet, accumulative closure. One friction: "bartered awakenings" as a phrase edges toward prompt-label territory, but the story grounds it in concrete exchanges (honey, lullaby, plant placements).</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elias (colorblind painter) is established early and his perceptual mode drives every choice: selecting plants by texture and resonance, interpreting the reed tongue's hum, arranging flora into spirals and zigzags. He appears in all major beats (scrap-heap salvage, plant arrangement, teaching Marta) and his perspective shapes the closure commitment. However, he does not undergo visible transformation himself—he teaches rather than changes—so causal pressure tied to his arc is moderate. Setup, development, and payoff gates are met; beat involvement is high; specificity is strong. Swappability is low (his colorblindness is integral to his method). Costs are conceptual (commitment to root-and-rust methods) but not visibly painful for him on the page.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The concertina reed tongue is introduced early (second paragraph), handled in two distinct beats (Elias tucking it into his satchel, wedging it beneath the slate tile), and returns with reweighted meaning at closure (Marta receiving it as teaching tool, then using it implicitly in her own arrangement). Its unique property—resonating to translate "between root and air, between silence and song"—directly enables the courtyard's awakening (the low tone, the rosemary's twitch). Setup, development, and payoff gates are met. Causal pressure is strong: without the reed tongue, the awakening mechanism fails. Specificity is high (a generic tool would not resonate). Cost is tied to its discovery in discarded scrap and its function as bridge between broken things and new life.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Bartered awakenings" is named explicitly by Marta in the first third ("not currency, but exchange of soul-stuff") and enacted twice on the page: Elias trades honey and a lullaby for scrap-heap access, then later "barters" with the courtyard through plant arrangements. The concept shapes the closure pact ("tomorrow, we wake the kiln" as a new exchange). Setup and payoff gates are met; middle development is present but less causally sharp. It constrains tactics (Elias cannot simply take; he must offer) and charges the final image (waking the kiln "with root and rust" as soul-stuff trade). However, the phrase itself risks label-only thematic claim—its mechanics are clearer in the honey/lullaby beat than in the abstract "bartered" courtyard dialogue. Swappability is moderate (a simpler "trade" or "exchange" concept could substitute with edits).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Innocently cunning" is stated twice—once for Elias ("innocently cunning persistence") and once for Marta ("that same innocently cunning spark")—but not dramatized through contradictory on-page action with visible cost. The trait is labeled rather than embodied: we are told Elias is persistent and that Marta mirrors his quality, but no scene shows the tension between innocence and cunning (e.g., a choice that appears naïve but conceals calculation, or a risk that backfires due to underestimating complexity). Setup gate is met (first third mention). Development and payoff gates are weak: the trait does not constrain a middle choice or visibly shape the ending. Swappability is high (remove the label and the plot holds unchanged).</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Awaken" structures the entire narrative: Elias awakens the courtyard's spirit through plant arrangements and the reed tongue's resonance; Marta awakens to the method and mirrors it with charred sunflowers; the closure pact is to "wake the kiln." The action is signaled early (courtyard "slumbering spirit"), developed through multiple beats (rosemary twitch, ivy uncurl, birdbath filling, green shoots emerging), and defines the final image. Setup, development, and payoff gates are met. Causal pressure is high: the story's dominant stake is this awakening. Specificity is strong (not merely "revive" or "restore" but "awaken" with the implication of listening and response). Irreplaceability: the story's logic would fail without this exact action. Costs are conceptual (commitment to non-commercial methods, renunciation of spectacle for salvage) and relational (Marta's shift from master to student).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Plant arrangements as communication method are introduced early (first third: "arranging the courtyard's overgrown flora into spirals, zigzags, concentric rings") and their mechanics are shown on the page: Elias chooses plants by stem stiffness, leaf serration, root depth; places sage beside stonecrop "to steady restless earth," lavender through nettle "to soothe scorched memory," yarrow "fanned outward like ribs to catch whispers from the ash." The method enables the courtyard's awakening (rosemary twitches, ivy uncurls) and is mirrored by Marta at closure (rearranging charred sunflowers into "jagged, reaching lines" that summon green shoots). Setup, development, and payoff gates are met. Causal pressure is strong: without this method, the awakening mechanism fails. Specificity is high (the story teaches the grammar: placement as plea, spacing as question, leaf as syllable). Irreplaceability: swapping to verbal incantation or tool-use would break the premise.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The glassblower's courtyard is anchored early (first sentence: "cobblestones still warm from the night's furnace glow") and provides resources that shape action: the cracked birdbath, the overgrown flora (rosemary, ivy, sage, stonecrop, lavender, nettle, yarrow, mugwort, thyme, morning glories, ferns), the slate tile, the ash-patterns, the kiln mentioned at closure. The courtyard is not passive backdrop—it responds to Elias's arrangements (plants twitch, uncurl; birdbath fills with dew; green shoots emerge). Setup, development, and payoff gates are met. Causal pressure is moderate to strong: the courtyard's features enable the method (plant diversity, slate tile for wedging the reed) and its responses escalate the stake. Specificity is high (a generic garden or workshop would not carry the glassblower/phoenix/salvage resonance). Cost connection: the courtyard's awakening is the climax, and the pact to wake the kiln ties it to future action.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"After the phoenix rises" is established in the first sentence and frames the premise (salvage follows spectacle, Elias comes for embers not fire). However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions or tactics on the page—there is no live clock, no urgency tied to the phoenix's departure or the courtyard's window of responsiveness. The story unfolds at a reflective pace (Elias "sat cross-legged," "began arranging," "waited" until dusk) without time pressure altering moves. Setup gate is met; development and payoff gates are weak (the timeframe provides thematic context but does not constrain choices or shape the ending's urgency). Swappability is moderate (a different post-event frame—after a storm, after a harvest—could substitute with minor edits). The phoenix motif recurs at closure (Marta works "where the phoenix's shadow still clung"), but as image rather than temporal constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The motivation "to find beauty in imperfection" is dramatized early ("Beauty, he believed, lived not in flawless symmetry but in the stumble, the warp, the off-note") and enacted through Elias's choices: selecting the dulled, imperfect reed tongue; arranging plants not for bloom but for structural resonance; coming to the courtyard "not for spectacle, but for salvage." The motivation drives multiple beats (scrap-heap trade, plant arrangements, teaching Marta) and shapes the closure pact to wake the kiln "not with paint or flame, but with root and rust… with bartered awakenings traded not for perfection, but for the courage to find beauty in what others called ruined." Setup, development, and payoff gates are met. Friction between want and cost is present but subtle: Elias sacrifices commercial spectacle (phoenix) for quiet salvage (embers), and the final commitment implies renouncing easier, market-friendly glass work. Specificity is strong (the motivation defines his perceptual mode and method).</comment>
