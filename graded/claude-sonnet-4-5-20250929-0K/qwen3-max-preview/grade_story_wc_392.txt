<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The investigator's interiority is handled through concrete sensory filtering (the lantern's "cold iron biting her palm") and her stance is consistent—watchfully calm, empirical—but motivation remains abstract. "To break free from the lie that progress requires amnesia" is told rather than dramatized through on-page micro-choices with visible cost. The worker's death and her decision to leave the lantern feel like plot mechanics rather than choices that reveal contradictory impulses under pressure. Internal conflict is asserted ("throat tight," "shoulders aching") but not enacted through competing desires that force a visible tradeoff.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural (memory layers build toward a final reweighting). Orientation anchors arrive cleanly (who, where, when by ~80 words). The closure—leaving the lantern as anchor, the air growing still—reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise: stakes crystallize, reverberations soften but persist). Cost is felt (her body aches, names etched on her forearm, report will be dismissed) but the decisive tightening that narrows options is diffuse; the investigator's choice to leave the lantern doesn't foreclose a legible alternative path on the page. The accumulative design builds density, but the final beat reconfigures atmosphere more than agency.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The tunnel is vivid and purposeful: "grit and discarded bolts," "diesel residue," moisture beading "in unnatural patterns." Sensory detail is filtered through the investigator's professional lens (measuring echo decay, charting temperature drops). The lantern—inherited object—constrains her action (she kneels, places it on the rail) and charges the final image (its glow pulses "like a heartbeat syncing with hers"). Spatial choreography is clear throughout. The subway setting shapes her method and the closure moment, meeting the 9+ gate for environment constraining choice and charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake: determine if the death was preventable and honor suppressed memory. The investigator's realization—"rupture in the tunnel's memory-field"—is a deepening that reweights her understanding, and leaving the lantern is a renunciation (her report will be dismissed, but the tunnel remembers). However, escalation is primarily cognitive revelation rather than choice under rising pressure. No live alternative is tested on the page; she moves from investigation to acknowledgment without a visible tradeoff that forecloses another path. Cost is legible (forearm tattoos, dismissed report, physical exhaustion) but pressure doesn't tighten through antagonistic resistance or a forced choice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—memory as causality, the cost of civic amnesia—emerges through concrete particulars: the worker's death traced to an 1852 echo, the lantern as anchor, names tattooed as stitches in fabric. The final image (lantern pulsing like a heartbeat) offers a resonant non-literal answer: witness as counter-force to institutional erasure. Subtext operates in "some doors stay shut for a reason" and her mother's warning. Minor slip: "Ignorance is armor—until it becomes a cage" edges toward stated moral in the penultimate beat, though the action (walking home steadier, requesting Tunnel 12) grounds it. The ending resists tidy closure while reweighting prior material with conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable; distance modulates purposefully (close during lantern visions, slightly pulled back during street-level return). Perceptual signature is strong—empirical yet haunted ("data wrapped in sorrow, physics steeped in trauma")—and diction matches the investigator's dual lens (technical + ancestral witness). Syntax compresses under pressure ("Show me," she murmurs) and opens during reflection. Minor register drift: "entangled memories" and "memory-field" read slightly prompt-like rather than character-coined terms, though the investigator's voice elsewhere (e.g., "routine dissolved") is distinct. No dialogue to evaluate beyond the brief murmured line and the boy's plea, both purposeful.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Strong imagery ("shadows stretch like reaching fingers," "rain greets her at street level, clean and cold") and varied syntax. Information density is high in the investigator's empirical catalog (echo decay, thermal anomalies, shoeprint alignment). However, minor scaffold persists: "she kneels," "she stands," "she walks" template cadence in the tunnel sequence; "not from indifference, but because" and "not with flame, but with silver light" repeat the not-X-but-Y structure within close proximity. Figurative language is vivid but occasionally stacked ("memories entangle," "knot into accidents," "silent screams in steel corridors") without breathing room. No loops that obscure causality, but cumulative drift lowers propulsion slightly in mid-beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Premise—preventable-death investigator using an Underground Railroad lantern to decode trauma-physics—is specific and non-obvious. The synthesis of empirical method + ancestral witness feels earned through her grandmother's lineage and her own forearm tattoos. Execution transforms the ghost-story trope into causality (spectral resonance frequencies, 1852 shoeprint in clay). Risk: leaving the lantern as anchor rather than taking it as evidence. Minor tonal hedging: "she knows this" (report will be dismissed) and "she doesn't blame them" soften the investigator's stance, and the final line's heartbeat sync borders on symbolic convenience. The concept is distinctive, but a few beats retreat toward safety rather than following implications fully.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The investigator drives the investigation beats (descends, measures, kneels, places lantern, documents, requests Tunnel 12). Her choice to leave the lantern as anchor rather than evidence is the key turn, and it forecloses the bureaucratic path. However, decisions are more reactive acknowledgment than high-cost choice under competing pressures. Present across setup, middle empirical work, and closure; constrains the ending but doesn't transform prior tactics.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Lantern is introduced early (inherited, rusted, cracked glass, wick cold), handled physically ("cold iron biting her palm"), placed on the rail as anchor, and returns in the final line pulsing like a heartbeat. It shapes multiple beats: orientation, revelation cascade, closure gesture, and street-level reprise. The object's evolving use—from tool to witness-anchor—reweights its meaning and charges the ending. High integration; slightly shy of indispensable because its mechanics (why it summons memories) remain asserted rather than tested against resistance.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Entangled memories" governs the premise: the worker's death traced to an 1852 panic-echo, the lantern summoning layered visions. The concept shapes her realization and method (spectral resonance, thermal anomalies at historical dates). Present in setup (whispers in brickwork), middle revelation, and implicit in the closure (reverberations soften when acknowledged). However, it operates more as explanatory frame than live constraint that alters her tactical options on the page. Causal but not pressure-tested.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Watchfully calm" is stated early ("she is watchfully calm, not from indifference, but because panic unravels truth") and demonstrated in her empirical response to the boy's plea and her steady documentation. The trait enables her to proceed without flinching and to measure rather than flee. However, no on-page moment shows the cost of maintaining that calm—e.g., suppressed impulse to run, visible physical toll of control. The attribute colors her stance but doesn't constrain a choice with visible tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Reverberate" is woven throughout: walls reverberate with fractured whispers (setup), the lantern's cascade of images (middle), reverberations soften at closure ("the air grows still"). The action structures the investigator's method (measuring echo decay) and the tunnel's remembered trauma. It drives her realization (memory-field rupture) and the closure effect (acknowledgment quiets reverberations). Essential to the texture and stakes, though the mechanism—why acknowledging the past stills echoes—is lyric rather than tested under resistance.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Through empirical observation" is signaled early (she carries no clipboard/recorder but measures echo decay, charts temperature drops, notes moisture patterns) and shapes her method throughout. Her documentation of spectral resonance frequencies and thermal anomalies tied to historical dates provides the evidence base. The method enables her credibility and contrasts with the city's refusal to remember. Present in setup, middle investigation, and referenced at closure (her report). Functional and thematically apt, but the empirical lens doesn't force a visible tactical choice—she never chooses between competing methodologies under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The subway maintenance tunnel is richly embodied (grit, diesel residue, dripping runoff, brickwork, rail) and pressures every choice. It supplies the lantern's placement site, the moisture patterns she charts, the worker's footprint alignment. Spatial choreography is clear (descent, Tunnel 7 depths, service ladder, street level). The tunnel's memory-field is the antagonist and the site of closure (air grows still where the lantern rests). Micro-setting (the rail where she places the lantern) charges the final image. The setting is indispensable to logic and emotional resonance.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"After the drought ends" anchors the opening ("the city sweats relief into its concrete bones; runoff drips from ceiling pipes") and explains the moisture she observes. However, the timeframe doesn't tighten decisions or create urgency; the investigation proceeds at her pace with no clock or seasonal pressure. The drought-end is atmospheric setup but doesn't constrain her choices or alter tactics. Present but ornamental to the escalation.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Motivation to "break free from a controlling influence" (the city's refusal to remember, her mother's warning to keep the lantern buried) is stated explicitly and dramatized through her choice to use the lantern and leave it as anchor despite knowing her report will be dismissed. Her forearm tattoos and request for Tunnel 12 access show ongoing commitment. However, the controlling influence is largely abstract institutional force rather than an on-page antagonist who adapts. Desire is clear but friction between wants and costs is more narrated than enacted in a high-pressure choice.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>"Fortified vulnerability" is sustained: she's "watchfully calm" yet her "throat tight," "shoulders aching," and she carries names on her forearm as open wounds. The tone modulates from clinical observation (empirical measurement) to visceral connection (kneeling, murmuring "show me") to steady resolve (walking home "steadier"). The final image—lantern pulsing like a heartbeat—coheres the tone: strength drawn from acknowledging fragility. The tone charges the ending and remains consistent under pressure, though it skews slightly more toward fortification than vulnerability in peak beats.</comment>
