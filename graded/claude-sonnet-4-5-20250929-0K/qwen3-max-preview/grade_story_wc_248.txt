<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The protagonist exists as a collection of poetic labels—"analytically intuitive," "lending library arsonist"—without embodied contradiction or genuine struggle. Her weeping "not from grief, but recognition" exemplifies diagnostic self-awareness that no one has mid-crisis. The final choice to "step into the light" carries no visible cost or foreclosed path; she simply accepts a role pre-written by ancestors, with no competing impulse dramatized on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation is severely delayed: who she is, where precisely she stands, and what concrete obstacle she faces remain vague past the 25% mark. The "forgotten promise" functions as abstract MacGuffin with no causal setup—she seeks it because the text declares it, not because prior scenes established its stakes. The closure—stepping into light while voices sing—offers no decisive change, renunciation with cost, or conceptual repricing; she simply receives validation without altering options or paying a price. Orientation Test penalty (−0.4) applied; also cap Q3 at 7.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The archive supplies vivid images—"petrified ink and salt," "obsidian and silence"—but remains a museum backdrop rather than a constraint shaping tactics. The tapestry fragment is handled in one beat, described in another, then solved without the environment resisting or enabling her moves. Micro-setting option (her body, tools) is underdeveloped; no object meaningfully narrows her choices or charges the final image beyond decoration.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"rescue a forgotten promise"—is declared but never tested by on-page opposition or trade-off. She moves from corridor to antechamber to vault without a single tightening that forecloses an option or forces a price. The archive "responds" with tremors and glowing glyphs, cooperating rather than escalating pressure. No reversal or deepening alters her tactics; the pedestal awaits with "no guards, no traps," and she succeeds by touching the portrait. Cost is absent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Theme is asserted in capital letters—"never let the fire of memory die"—rather than emerging from specific beats. The final inscription "We promised you would remember. Now break the silence" is thematic echo in its purest form, restating the premise instead of reweighting it through image. The "vandalized self-portrait" and "volcanic tenderness" recur as decorative phrases without constraining a choice or shifting meaning at closure. No counter-reading is available; the text instructs rather than invites.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The prose carries a uniform lyric register—"fractured spiral," "throat of the earth," "curator of the scorched and sacred"—that never modulates under pressure. No perceptual signature distinguishes this narrator's noticing; elevated diction ("strata of collapse," "covenant between her and the civilization") clashes with moment-to-moment urgency. The single-POV frame holds, but the voice reads as committee consensus rather than a character-specific lens, especially during the final beatific acceptance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Dense figurative language appears in nearly every sentence without teaching a pattern or paying off at closure: "volcanic tenderness," "curator of the unspoken," "throat of the earth," "lullaby of ash and resilience." Paraphrase loops abound—"not by training, but by survival" / "not for chaos, but for revelation" / "not from grief, but recognition"—creating template cadence across the text. The final third stacks metaphors ("embers," "fissure," "mercy flowed," "sang louder") that blur rather than sharpen the closure image. Artifacts touch the ending; disallow 9+ globally and apply −1.4 in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The core premise—chosen-one archivist discovers ancestral mission in ancient ruins—follows a widely used template without transformation through lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The "lending library arsonist" backstory is mentioned once and never revisited to complicate her reverent mission. Every element (tapestry, spiral, voices, light) arrives on cue to validate rather than challenge her, offering no fresh synthesis or risk-taking that heightens stakes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>The "lending library arsonist" attribute is introduced in paragraph four as backstory exposition, mentioned once, and never shapes an on-page choice or tactic. It does not return at closure. Swappable with "former librarian" or "historian" without affecting the plot.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The tapestry fragment appears in the collapsed antechamber (setup), is examined and wept over (development), and its spiral pattern informs her subsequent creations. It does not directly shape the vault discovery or the final pedestal moment, but its motif recurs. Two-gate participation with modest causal pressure; lyric reprise without middle constraint caps at mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The vandalized self-portrait frames the mystery (setup), drives her artistic trail (development), and is completed on the pedestal at closure (payoff). It meets all three gates. However, it never constrains a choice or imposes a cost—she simply recognizes it and touches it. Presence across beats without genuine pressure or tradeoff limits score to low-6s.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Analytically intuitive" is a label applied in paragraph three with no on-page demonstration of the trait constraining or enabling an action. She never faces a choice where intuition trades off against analysis, or vice versa. Summary-only mention without scene pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Portray" governs the middle section: she paints, carves, and weaves echoes of the tapestry's spiral. This action shapes one extended beat (her artistic trail) and is referenced at closure when the creations "pulsed like embers." However, the portraying does not narrow her options or force a trade-off; it simply leads her forward. One-gate strong development, minimal cost; mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The trail of artistic creations is executed in the middle third and mentioned again at closure ("pulsed like embers"). Setup is implicit (her plan), development is on-page (the making), and closure gives a nod. The trail does not resist or reshape her tactics—no creation fails, no pursuit catches her. Two gates with functional but replaceable mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The lost civilization archive anchors every scene, supplies the tapestry and vault, and "responds" with tremors and glowing glyphs. It meets all three gates and is indispensable to the plot. However, it never constrains a choice—doors open, no traps bar her way—so it functions as cooperative stage rather than pressuring environment. Presence without resistance: mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"After going off the grid" establishes the timeframe in the opening line but exerts no pressure. No clock tightens her decisions; the "seventh day" marker is cosmetic, and no consequence accrues from duration. Late mention without causal force; ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"To rescue a forgotten promise" is declared in paragraph two and governs her entire quest, meeting setup and development. At closure, the promise is named: "never let the fire of memory die." However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants or visible cost. She never hesitates, doubts, or sacrifices an alternative path. Two gates, told-only friction; cap ~4.6.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Volcanic tenderness" appears as a phrase in paragraph six ("destruction that preserved, heat that hardened") and recurs near the end ("volcanic tenderness of her soul"). The oxymoron is poetic but does not modulate with scene pressure—tone remains uniformly reverent and lyric from start to finish. Static mood with label-only integration; mid-4s.</comment>
