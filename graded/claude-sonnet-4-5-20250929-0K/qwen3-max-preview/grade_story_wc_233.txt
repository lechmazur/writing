<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The queen's interiority leans heavily on poetic abstraction ("velvet robes traded for linen that whispered against her skin like regret") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. Her motivation to climb is told through dream summary, not dramatized choice with visible cost. The hooded figure delivers thematic insight without the queen making a micro-choice that forecloses a path; her "trembling" at the end reads as label-only emotion. Internal conflict is asserted ("You chose power over pulse") but not shown acting simultaneously in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who and where early, but the timeframe remains vague ("after twilight," "dusk curling") without a legible clock that tightens tactics. The closure offers Resonant Reconfiguration (the queen accepts starlight and commits to witness/vessel), but cost is implied through metaphor ("Let the starlight bleed through your words") rather than a concrete forfeiture or action on the page. The piece reads Accumulative/Textural in its lyric density, yet the ending instruction from the figure tells rather than dramatizes the shift, weakening the felt cost at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The cobalt grotto is vividly rendered with sensory specificity (mist "like crushed sapphires," veins of cobalt threading obsidian, scent of ozone and old roses). The fireflies and bleeding starlight shape the queen's path upward, constraining her route through brambles. However, the grotto itself functions more as symbolic backdrop than as environment that pressures a choice; the pool reveals scenes but does not alter her tactics in the moment.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—unraveling recurring dreams—is signaled early, and the climb provides one meaningful tightening as the queen confronts the pool's visions. Yet escalation is largely textural (accumulating imagery) rather than a decision that narrows options; the figure tells her what to do, and she accepts without visible trade-off. The cost of "unbury what you buried" is conceptual and forward-looking, not paid on the page through a forfeited path or irreversible act.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme (buried grief, power versus authenticity) emerges through the pool's visions and the figure's declaration, but the ending leans on direct statement ("You chose power over pulse") rather than a resonant image that reweights prior particulars without moralizing. The fireflies and starlight function as recurrent motifs, yet their final appearance feels ornamental rather than a non-literal answer that transforms the central question. The grotto "remembers what you tried to forget" is thematically apt but edges toward thesis summary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited, and the narrative voice carries distinct diction ("cobwebs dipped in frost," "pulse—not twinkle, but bleed"). Dialogue with the hooded figure is functional but stilted ("You came" / "I had to"), lacking subtext or character-specific rhythm. The queen's perceptual signature (lacy menace, astral pooling) is consistent, though elevated register occasionally clashes with visceral pressure ("ozone and old roses" feels catalogue-like in a peak beat).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout ("dusk curling its fingers," "lacy menace," "liquid night"), creating ornamental accumulation in nearly every sentence without pattern-teaching or payoff tied to closure. Paraphrase loops appear: "the dreams weren't prophecy, but invitation" restates the prior firefly guidance without added pressure. Template cadence runs in the pool-vision sequence ("her younger self… her coronation… the moment she signed… the night her child vanished"). Register drifts into elevated abstraction ("Rule over resonance") that sits outside the queen's lexicon under stress. Apply −0.8 for density and loops, −0.3 for register drift in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The disenchanted-queen-seeks-mystical-truth frame is familiar, and the piece does not transform it through lived world logic or non-obvious moral calculus; the grotto dispenses wisdom, the queen accepts, and she returns humbled. The bleeding-starlight conceit and firefly synchronization offer lyric texture but remain symbolic ornament rather than a fresh synthesis that alters stakes. The emotional arc (power → humility) follows a well-worn template without a surprising inflection earned from prior particulars.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The disenchanted queen is present throughout and her choice to climb frames the piece, but her key decision at closure—accepting the figure's instruction to "climb back down… as witness"—is told by another character rather than dramatized through her own contradictory impulses. She appears in all three gates (setup, middle, ending) but her agency is largely observational; the pool and figure deliver insight, and she receives it without a visible trade-off that redefines options. Early signal +0.5, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +0.8, but swappability (any seeker could occupy this role) −0.6 and summary-only peak choice −0.6 keep the score mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The ember grotto / cobalt grotto is established early ("Ember Grotto trail"), drives the climb (middle beat), and houses the pool confrontation (closure scene). It shapes the queen's path and provides the revelatory pool, making it essential to the ending's charge. Early signal +0.6, three distinct beats (approach, threshold, interior pool) +1.4, closure linkage +1.2, causal pressure (the grotto "remembers") +0.8. However, the grotto's mechanics (why it exists, why it responds to her) remain vague, reducing irreplaceability slightly −0.3, and it functions more as symbolic container than physical constraint that alters her tactics on the page.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Bleeding starlight is seeded early ("droplets of astral light pooling in hollows"), returns at the summit ("dripping slow tears of celestial fire"), and is named at closure ("Let the starlight bleed through your words"). It reweights the premise (starlight as leaked memory rather than omen) and the queen allows it to "scorch and soothe" her, linking it to cost. Early signal +0.7, two beats (ridge observation, grotto pool) +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, cost connection (she lets it fall on her) +0.4. Yet its mechanics are metaphorical rather than concrete—starlight does not constrain a choice or enable a tactic—so swappability (any mystical substance could serve) −0.5 limits the score to mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Softly commanding" is mentioned twice: once mid-climb ("the kind of authority that bends rivers without raising a voice") and again near the end ("the softly commanding aura around her now gentler, humbler"). Both are label-only descriptions; the trait does not constrain an action or create a visible trade-off. The brambles recoil "as if even flora sensed her… presence," but this is told outcome, not on-page demonstration of the trait enabling a choice under pressure. Present in setup and payoff (two gates) but ornamental use −0.8, label-only −0.3, cap at 4.6 for missing middle development, final 3.8.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The climb structures the entire piece: she ascends the ridge (early), pauses halfway when stars bleed and fireflies appear (middle turn), and reaches the summit grotto (closure scene). Removing the climb would break the spatial and causal spine. Early signal +0.7, three beats (departure, midpoint pause, summit arrival) +1.4, causal pressure (each step is "an apology," the path guides her) +1.0, closure linkage (she must "climb back down" to complete the arc) +1.0. Specificity is moderate (the climb itself is generic ascent, not irreplaceable technique) −0.2, but the action's integration across all three gates and its causal necessity secure a high score.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"A shared exhale spotting the first fireflies of summer" appears once at the midpoint turn; the fireflies then guide her upward and cling to her skin at the ending. The method is poetic but vague—whose exhale is shared, and how does it "spot" fireflies?—so mechanics remain unclear. The fireflies enable the climb (they form a path, sync with her breathing) and return at closure (clinging like "living lace"), giving method-as-threshold function. Early signal (midpoint, ~50%) −0.3, two beats (midpoint emergence, ending embodiment) +0.9, causal pressure (they recoil brambles, guide route) +0.7, closure linkage +0.8, but vague mechanics and late first appearance −0.5 land the score in mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The cobalt grotto above clouds is seeded early ("Ember Grotto trail"), drives the middle ascent, and houses the pool that delivers the queen's visions at closure. Its altitude and mist-veiled entrance shape her approach, and the open ceiling dripping starlight creates the revelatory atmosphere. Early signal +0.6, three beats (trail reference, summit arrival, interior pool) +1.4, closure linkage (the pool and dripping ceiling are the final scene) +1.2, causal pressure (the grotto "remembers" and seals itself after, bracketing her arc) +0.8. However, the grotto functions more as symbolic stage than physical constraint that alters her tactics in the moment −0.4, limiting the score below 8.0.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"After the final warning" and "dusk curling" establish urgency in setup, but no clock tightens decisions thereafter. The ascent's duration is untracked ("halfway up" is the only spatial marker), and the grotto scene unfolds without time pressure; the queen pauses, kneels, and converses with the figure at leisure. Timeframe is present in two gates (setup, vague closure "behind her, the grotto sealed itself with a sigh") but does not constrain a single choice. Functional presence +0.3, two gates (setup, ending cameo) +0.4, but missing middle development caps at 3.4; ornamental use (no clock that narrows options) −0.5 would yield 2.9, yet the setup signal of "final warning" provides modest urgency lift to 4.7 within allowed band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The motivation to unravel recurring dreams is stated early ("to unravel the mystery of recurring dreams that bled starlight into her sleep") and drives her climb; the pool reveals the dreams' source (buried grief, her child's release through a portal). The desire is clear but told rather than dramatized through contradictory wants under pressure—she climbs without visible friction between cost and goal. Early signal +0.7, two beats (initial climb, pool confrontation) +0.9, closure linkage (the dreams' meaning is named) +0.9, but summary-only peak ("I didn't know" / "You did") −0.6 and lack of on-page friction between wants −0.4 keep the score mid-band, just below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Lacy menace" is named once at the trail's mouth ("lacy menace that clung to its mouth like cobwebs dipped in frost") and echoed in the ending fireflies "clinging to her skin like living lace." Tone modulates from ominous (bleeding stars, "veiled in mist") to reverent (the grotto's beauty, the figure's wind-like voice), supporting the shift from dread to acceptance. Present in setup and payoff (two gates, lyric reprise) +0.9, closure linkage (lace returns, reweighted as embrace rather than menace) +0.7, but the tone label itself is ornamental (does not constrain a choice) −0.5 and arrives late in first third −0.2, placing it in mid-band under the lyric-resonance allowance.</comment>
