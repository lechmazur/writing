<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's interiority is richly embodied through sensory attention to gears and crystal, and his self-imposed silence holds contradictory impulses. The backstory block about abandoned symphonies exceeds 20% but tilts present stance via the tuning fork choice. The final act—humming—feels earned by the crystal's sensory cue, though the cost remains implicit rather than dramatized as a trade-off with visible friction. Motivation is coherent but the climactic choice lacks on-page resistance or consequence beyond mood.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: density and cadence shift reweight the dominant stake. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the vaulted chamber paragraph. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Elias accepts the dream's transformation rather than resurrecting it, humming instead of composing grand works. Cost is conceptual—the foreclosure of cathedral ambitions—but the final image dilutes pressure with abstract phrasing ("peace," "wonder," "petrichor nostalgia") rather than a concrete, charged moment. No causality break, but the ending tells transformation rather than showing a decisive visible price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The sanctuary is vivid and recurring (chronometers, pendulums, stool, high windows); the crystal's moss-cradled arrival and its surface tremor provide micro-setting constraint that charges the ending. Sensory detail is purposeful: mercury-pooled time, velvet silence, liquid-sun brass. The crystal's placement atop the chronometer and the filtered moonlight create spatial logic that narrows Elias's final act. Meets the 9+ gate (object constrains choice and charges final image) but idiom occasionally drifts into elevated register ("glacial hush," "petrichor nostalgia") that feels imposed rather than Elias-filtered.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—making peace with the abandoned dream—is signaled early and tightens once when the crystal's droplet reveals "the notes weren't dead." The tuning fork and hum constitute a meaningful deepening under the Accumulative lens. Agency is present but the cost of humming (versus not humming) remains abstract; no live option is visibly foreclosed on the page. The piece delivers one tightening but lacks a tangible trade-off or price that alters tactics or future stance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme—reconciliation with a transformed dream—emerges through the crystal's sensory particulars and the tuning fork's seven-year gap. The final image offers a resonant answer: Elias returns "not as its master, but as its witness." Subtext operates in the crystal's vibration and the clocks' softened chimes. The last paragraph, however, lapses into thematic echo ("not lost, but transformed—like rain into crystal, like silence into song") that states rather than dramatizes the thesis, costing ~0.5 in this category.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with a distinct, lyric-textured voice. Perceptual signature is character-specific: Elias notices gears as "sleeping children," springs as "held breath." No head-hopping. Diction occasionally exceeds Elias's working-class clock-scribe lexicon ("glacial hush," "petrichor nostalgia," "excruciatingly gentle") without clear voice motivation; these feel authorial rather than character-filtered. Psychic distance is consistent and the prose reflects Elias's contemplative rhythm, but the elevated register at closure undercuts full integration.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Information density is high; sentences layer image, character thought, and atmosphere. Rhythm varies and propels without sluggishness. However, figurative density approaches overwriting in peak beats: "silence wasn't absence, but presence thick as velvet," "time pooled like mercury," "notes…ghosts that stirred when the wind sighed." Three adjacent metaphor vehicles (mercury, velvet, liquid sun) in the opening risks coherence drift. Stock phrases appear: "hin of a hidden sunrise," "petrichor nostalgia." Paraphrase loop between "He bore no grudge against the silence" and "It didn't judge his silence" costs ~0.3. No major scaffold, but density and stock phrasing prevent higher bands.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The synthesis—clock scribe reconciling with musical dream via rain-charged crystal—is specific and non-obvious. Sensory grounding (tuning fork note, droplet on score) avoids template abstraction. The crystal's role and the sanctuary's acoustics feel organic. Risk: lyric density and slow-burn structure without sharp external conflict. However, the core emotional arc (artist accepting transformation) follows a familiar creative-renewal template; the piece individualizes through craft but does not fundamentally transform the archetype. The "witness not master" realization, while earned, echoes common craft-essay wisdom without a fresh inflection.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias climbs stairs (beat 1), kneels and handles the crystal (beat 2), places it on the chronometer (beat 3), fetches and strikes the tuning fork (beat 4), hums (beat 5). Each is a micro-decision that advances pressure under the Accumulative lens. His introversion shapes the glacial hush and soundless sanctuary framing. The final hum is character-driven agency. However, the choices are sequential observations and ritual moves rather than high-stakes decisions with visible trade-offs; swapping another contemplative protagonist would require only minor tonal edits. Beats involved: five distinct. Causal pressure moderate. Closure linkage strong. Cost implicit.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Setup: introduced ~30% in, after the rain paragraph. Development: handled in beat 2 (kneeling), placed in beat 3 (chronometer), and its droplet triggers revelation in beat 4 (score). Payoff: glows and hums in the final sequence, charging Elias's hum. Three gates met. Beats involved: four distinct touches. Causal pressure: the droplet's "revelation" and the crystal's vibration enable the tuning fork choice. Closure linkage: active in the ending's sensory layer. Specificity: "lens-shaped," "pulsing droplets," "trembled like unborn stars." Cost: the crystal's arrival and handling impose no visible friction or trade-off; it functions as catalyst without resistance. Late arrival (~30%) and ornamental beauty lower the band slightly.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Setup: "glacial hush" appears early in the climb paragraph and recurs. Development: the hush "wasn't cold—it was patient" and "didn't judge his silence" shape Elias's acceptance of silence as companion. Payoff: the crystal "caught the vibration" within the glacial hush, and the sanctuary's slowed clocks extend the concept. Three gates met. Beats involved: three distinct. The concept frames tone and provides thematic texture but does not constrain a tactical choice or narrow options; Elias's moves (climb, place crystal, strike fork) would remain unchanged if "glacial hush" were replaced with "deep quiet." Lyric resonance is strong but mechanical stakes are absent.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Setup: "excruciatingly gentle precision" appears early (paragraph 4). Development: the trait governs Elias's handling of gears ("each gear were a sleeping child") and recurs when he lifts the crystal ("excruciatingly gentle motion"). Payoff: absent from the ending sequence. Two gates (setup, middle). Beats involved: two. The trait colors action but does not create visible cost or enable a unique choice; any careful character would handle fragile objects gently. No trade-off between gentleness and speed, force, or risk. Swappable with "careful" or "delicate." Ornamental rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Setup: "bore no grudge" early; "bore that sound into his chest" mid-story; "bore the crystal inside" and "He bore no more weight" at closure. Development: the verb "bear" governs three key moves—carrying the crystal, internalizing the harmony, releasing weight. Payoff: "bore no more weight. / Only wonder" reweights the opening "bore no grudge." Three gates met. Beats involved: four distinct. The action is present across the arc and the final reprise charges the ending. However, "bear" could be replaced with "carry," "hold," "accept" with minor edits and no structural loss; the verb's particularity does not create irreplaceable mechanics. Strong lyric recurrence but moderate causal necessity.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>N/A</grade>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Setup: "soundless sanctuary—a vaulted chamber beneath the old observatory" anchored early. Development: the sanctuary houses the chronometers, the oak stool, the high stained glass, and becomes the acoustic space where the crystal's vibration and clocks' softened ticks enable the tuning fork experiment. Payoff: "in the sanctuary, beneath the whispering crystal and the slowing clocks, Elias began to hum." Three gates met. Beats involved: sanctuary appears in six distinct moments. The setting's acoustic properties and isolation constrain Elias's final choice (he hums here, not in a public space). Specificity: vaulted, beneath observatory, stained glass, mercury-pooled time. The sanctuary is irreplaceable; the story's logic depends on this exact enclosed, resonant space.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Setup: "in the hush of a hidden sunrise" appears as a transition marker. Development: "before the world remembered its noise" frames Elias's morning ritual, and "the sanctuary's first true light spilled through" closes the piece. Payoff: present in final paragraph. Three gates met. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions or create urgency; Elias's moves (climb, place crystal, hum) are leisurely and could occur at any hour. The sunrise functions as atmospheric mood rather than a live clock that alters tactics. Swappable with "dawn," "early morning," "first light" without mechanical loss.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Setup: "abandoned his dream of composing symphonies" and "fossilized in a drawer—yellowed scores" establish the stake early. Development: the crystal's droplet reveals "the notes weren't dead. / They were waiting," and Elias fetches the unused tuning fork. Payoff: "make peace with their silence" and "returned to it—not as its master, but as its witness" close the arc. Three gates met. Beats involved: four distinct. The motivation drives all major choices (climb, crystal handling, fork strike, hum). Friction: Elias's fear of resurrecting the dream vs. his longing is implicit rather than dramatized in contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Cost is conceptual (foreclosing "cathedral" ambitions) but not felt as on-page trade-off. Strong causal role but lacks visible price.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Setup: "petrichor nostalgia" appears in the final paragraph only. Development: absent from middle beats. Payoff: labels the ending mood. One gate (payoff). The tone of quiet, rain-washed longing pervades (rain paragraph, crystal's "memory of rain," "rinsed and trembling world"), and the piece modulates from silence-as-companion to sound-as-peace. However, "petrichor nostalgia" is a late thematic label rather than a pressure-shaping force. The story teaches melancholy and gentle reconciliation; the exact phrase is ornamental. Swappable with "wistful acceptance" or "quiet longing." Coherent but not indispensable.</comment>
