<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The fractal weaver's core motivation—to collect burdens—is established and embodied through the weaving action, but her internal contradiction remains ornamental rather than dramatized. The man's grief is shown through the clutched letter and trembling, though his choice to enter feels less pressured than inevitable. The weaver's final act of calcifying her own burden provides a meaningful choice, but the impulse arrives without prior internal friction. Interiority leans toward poetic summary ("boundary-lessly trapped… not imprisoned") rather than contradictory wants acting simultaneously in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening lines. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: the lamp ritual accumulates sensory and conceptual weight until the weaver's final turn to her own locket shifts the pattern from service to self-care. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis)—she chooses endurance over escape, aligning with her calling at visible cost (continuing the cycle). The final image reweights "boundary-lessly trapped" from burden to purpose. One meaningful deepening is present; the cost is legible on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The bronze grotto is vividly anchored with oxidized walls, copper halos, starlight fissures, and the kerosene lamp's pulsing glow. Spatial choreography is clean: lamp placement, letter beside it, shelves carved into walls. The lamp's alignment with the grotto's magnetic seam and the starlight fissure provides a constraint that shapes the ritual and charges the final image. The recurring detail of snowmelt dripping as a metronome ties time, atmosphere, and the story's rhythm together.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—holding unbearable weight until it becomes bearable—is signaled early and sustained. The man's arrival provides one tightening: his loss becomes calcified with visible consequence (he leaves lighter, the letter hardened). The weaver's choice to calcify her own burden at the end narrows options (continuing the cycle rather than seeking release) with felt cost. Under the Accumulative lens, this single meaningful deepening is sufficient, though the man's agency is minimal and the weaver's final turn feels more resigned than pressured.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the weaving ritual and the calcification metaphor: survival through transformation of grief into something bearable. The final image—"Not to be free. But to endure."—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question without moralizing. The locket's silence and the weaver's self-application of the ritual reweight prior material. Minor slip: "boundary-lessly trapped, yes, but not imprisoned" edges toward thematic summary rather than letting the image speak.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on the weaver with a lyric, elevated register that matches the mythic framing. Perceptual signature is consistent: damp bronze, old smoke, oxidized walls. Dialogue is sparse and functional ("Dead?" / "Lost"). The prose carries a distinct texture, but under peak pressure the diction remains uniformly elevated rather than tightening or fragmenting. Filter verbs ("she heard," "she closed her eyes") are present but voice-motivated. No head-hopping; distance is controlled.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout: "drowned fireflies," "whale ribs arching over empty seas," "seashell whorls," "leviathan heartbeat." In the climactic lamp-lighting sequence, metaphors stack without clear pattern-teaching or payoff, reducing propulsion. Paraphrase loop: "The pattern spiraled outward, recursive and infinite, folding sorrow into symmetry until the burden began to calcify—not vanish, but settle, compact, become something manageable" restates the same content three times. Register is consistently elevated but occasionally drifts into abstraction ("tessellating lattices," "magnetic seam") without POV anchoring. No major artifacts touch closure, but density throughout flattens momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The premise—grief as calcifiable material worked by a fractal weaver—offers a fresh synthesis of abstract emotion and craft metaphor. The specific mechanics (lamp alignment with magnetic seam, starlight through fissure, letter turning opalescent) provide concrete detail. However, the "wounded healer" arc and the recursive ritual structure are familiar templates; the weaver's final choice to calcify her own burden is predictable. The lyric register and mythic framing elevate execution but do not fully transform the template.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The fractal weaver drives two key beats: activating the lamp ritual for the man and choosing to weave her own burden at the end. Her final decision narrows options (continuing the cycle) with visible cost, making the closure participatory. Early setup in the opening paragraph; middle beat (lamp ritual) and closure beat (self-application) both hinge on her agency.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The kerosene lamp burner appears in four beats: described warm and unlit at the start, activated for the man's ritual (alignment with magnetic seam and starlight fissure), extinguished after, and relit for the weaver's own use. Its mechanics (alignment, pulsing glow, calcification trigger) constrain the ritual and charge the final image. The lamp's warmth and resonance recur with reweighted meaning at closure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Shingled hush" appears once during the man's ritual as "a layered silence, like roof tiles overlapping to keep out rain." It describes the atmosphere created by the lamp's warmth but does not constrain a choice or alter tactics. It recurs at the weaver's final beat ("as the shingled hush settled over her"), creating a lyric reprise that reweights the ritual's effect. Present in setup and closure, absent from middle development; functions more as tone marker than causal force.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Boundary-lessly trapped" is introduced early ("not by walls or chains, but by the very nature of her calling") and returns at the end ("boundary-lessly trapped, yes, but not imprisoned. Her prison was her purpose"). The attribute shapes the weaver's worldview and final stance, but it does not visibly constrain an on-page action with immediate cost. The concept is thematically central yet functions more as label than enacted friction.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Calcification drives the entire narrative: the weaver's purpose is to calcify burdens, the man's letter calcifies into opalescent ridges, and the weaver calcifies her own locket at the end. The action is signaled early ("the old ones used—not destroy, not erase, but to crystallize grief"), enacted in the middle ritual, and forms the closure image. The mechanics (warmth, orientation, weaving, hardening) are irreplaceable; swapping "calcify" for "heal" or "transform" would break the story's logic and tone.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"By orienting properly" is signaled in the opening third ("burdens calcify only by orienting properly—like a compass needle trembling toward true north") and enacted twice: aligning the lamp's wick with the grotto's magnetic seam and angling the chimney to catch starlight for the man, then repeating "heart aligned with duty, breath synced with bronze, soul open to starlight" for the weaver's final act. The method constrains the ritual's success and shapes both major beats; the specific mechanics matter to the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The bronze grotto is present in all three phases: opening description with oxidized walls and copper halos, middle ritual where the lamp's alignment with the grotto's magnetic seam and starlight fissure enables calcification, and closure where the weaver remains in the grotto to work her own burden. The setting's physical properties (magnetic seam, fissure, shelves carved into bronze) constrain the ritual and supply the resources that enable the outcome.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"After the first snowmelt" is mentioned twice: in the opening line ("the chill that lingered after the first snowmelt") and near the end ("the last of the snowmelt dripped from stalactites"). The timeframe establishes atmosphere and seasonal context but does not tighten decisions or alter tactics. No live clock pressures the weaver or the man; the dripping snowmelt functions as rhythmic detail rather than deadline.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The motivation "to collect the weights of different burdens" is dramatized in the opening paragraph and embodied through the weaver's ritual with the man. Friction emerges at closure when the weaver must apply the burden-bearing to herself, trading continued service for momentary relief ("Not to be free. But to endure."). The want (to ease others) conflicts with the cost (perpetual self-sacrifice); the final choice affirms the calling at visible price.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Whalebone reverie" is echoed once explicitly ("loneliness curved like whale ribs arching over empty seas—a whalebone reverie, soft and hollow and heavy all at once") and implicitly in the lyric, elegiac register throughout. The tone is coherent and modulates subtly from descriptive opening to ritual intensity to quiet closure. It charges the final image through sustained mood, though the metaphor itself does not recur or reweight at the end.</comment>
