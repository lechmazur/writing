<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The narrator's "quietly analytic" stance is embodied through concrete observation (patterns in the snow globe, spectral analyses) and the relationship with death as "first-name basis acquaintance" shapes micro-choices throughout. The sister's absence drives the emotional arc credibly, and the final release—opening palms, stepping back—earns the shift through accumulated pressure. Minor slip: the Amelia interiority ("You're trying to solve grief like a theorem") reads slightly over-articulated for a hallucination, though it remains character-consistent. The choice to let go forecloses possession with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (library, Earhart's plane, lab, cliffside) land clearly. The accumulative lens holds: each discovery (snow globe's properties, lunar perigee correlation, temperature drop at sister's name) tightens understanding until the realization that "letting go isn't collapse" reconfigures the premise. Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration—the globe vanishes, "Its energy, its purpose...transferred"—with felt cost (hollow and humming). The causality from discovery to understanding to release is motivated and legible, with one meaningful deepening that narrows options.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The sunken library, trench "where ocean currents whispered like librarians," lab with sterile gloves, and cliffside all ground the narrator's journey with sensory specificity. The snow globe itself functions as micro-setting: its internal physics (flakes falling upward, temperature shifts) constrains the protagonist's investigation and charges the final image when it floats and vanishes. The lighthouse beam "stretched into a helix, then a spiral, then a single thread" anchors the closure moment concretely. Minor gap: the lab's spatial layout during the seventy-three nights remains abstract.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding the physics of letting go—is signaled early and coheres throughout. Pressure escalates through the accumulative lens: each observation (lunar perigee, temperature drop, emotional resonance) narrows options until the realization that the globe is "a receiver" for consciousness releasing attachment. The cliffside choice (opening palms, stepping back) is driven by protagonist agency and forecloses possession with visible cost: the globe vanishes, the narrator is "hollow and humming." The trade-off between solving and surrendering is legible and earned.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: the globe's physics mirror emotional surrender, Earhart's laughter-transmission versus coordinates, the narrator's shift from equations to verbs. The final image—globe floating, vanishing, energy transferred—offers a resonant answer to "the physics of letting go" without moralizing. The story resists tidy resolution: death smiles "from the treeline," the narrator waves back, "It was enough." One slip: "letting go isn't a variable. It's a verb. An action. A choice" inches toward thesis statement, though it's filtered through hallucinated Amelia and remains embodied in the subsequent palm-opening.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct and controlled: "I noted anomalies without flinching, dissected grief like equations" establishes analytic distance that modulates under pressure. Perceptual signature is consistent—technical observation bleeding into metaphor ("mass converting to light," "love persisting as pattern"). The Amelia interiority is clearly marked as imagined ("she'd say in my head") and serves pressure. Minor slip: "Its energy, its purpose, its quiet, analytic magic—transferred" stacks abstract nouns in the closure beat where concrete image would sharpen. Psychic distance remains stable; no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Line-level clarity and propulsion are strong. Rhythm varies purposefully: long lyric sentences ("wind whipping my coat like impatient hands") alternate with terse turns ("I waved back. It was enough."). Minor artifacts: "the snow globe humming beside me" and "swirling with miniature blizzards" in early beats lean slightly ornamental before causal work begins. The final sequence is clean and charged. Information density is high; no paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. The opening anchors voice and stakes; the ending recharges the death-acquaintance motif.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis—Earhart's disappearance as willing ascent, the snow globe as emotional receiver, the sunken library as transcendence ritual—feels fresh and earned in hindsight. The frame (deep-sea discovery + grief) transforms familiar material through specific physics (counterclockwise vortex, lunar perigee, 0.3°C drop) and the conflation of exploration with interior release. Risk: the metaphysical leap (Earhart "unknotted herself from gravity") could read convenient, but the story commits fully and grounds it in prior observation. The ending avoids safety; the globe's vanishing is bold and legible.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The "first-name basis with death" frames expectation early, recurs in reflection ("Death, for me, was a first-name basis acquaintance"), and reappears transformed at closure ("Death...nodded from the treeline...wearing a smile"). This character trait constrains the narrator's approach (analytic detachment) and enables the final wave—acknowledgment without fear. The trait drives the middle investigation (seventy-three sleepless nights) and charges the ending. Cost is visible: the narrator becomes "hollow and humming."</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The snow globe appears in beat one (discovery), drives the lab investigation (≥3 distinct beats: thermodynamic defiance, emotional resonance tests, pulse synchronization), and is causally active at closure (floats, vanishes, transfers energy). Its specific properties (upward flakes, temperature shifts, lighthouse beam) are irreplaceable and constrain the protagonist's methods. Removal would collapse the investigation and the final release. The object's transformation from relic to receiver to catalyst is legible and charged.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Last transmission" is seeded early (Earhart's "final transmission crackled not with coordinates but with laughter"), reweighted at midpoint ("the last transmission I received wasn't auditory"), and shapes the closure choice (the thread snaps, the globe vanishes). The concept shifts from literal radio to emotional resonance, altering the protagonist's options: instead of solving, the narrator must surrender. The transmission's content (laughter, pressure on palms, coldness) drives tactics and the final letting-go.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Quietly analytic" is labeled in paragraph four, demonstrated through spectral analyses and pattern-noting, and tested at closure when the narrator must abandon analysis to act ("opened my palms and stepped back"). The trait constrains the investigation (seventy-three nights, cross-referencing) and enables the realization but costs connection until the final release. One visible trade-off: stopping eating and sleeping in pursuit of understanding. The trait could be slightly more embodied in micro-gestures under peak stress.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Note" is the method throughout: "I noted anomalies," "I began to note patterns," cross-referencing tidal charts and journals. The action drives the middle investigation (lunar perigee, temperature correlation) and enables the realization that the globe is a receiver. The final turn—letting go rather than noting—inverts the method with visible cost. The action is signaled early and shapes multiple attempts. Swapping "note" for "observe" would require only light edits, limiting irreplaceability slightly.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Untangling threads" is named at midpoint ("By untangling threads—cross-referencing tidal charts, spectral analyses...I realized") and shapes the investigation's mechanics. The method enables the realization that the globe is a receiver, which redefines options. It appears in one key beat rather than recurring across the arc, and the metaphor (threads) is not developed physically. The method is functional but could be swappable with "decoding patterns" or similar.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The "forgotten sunken ship library" is discovered early and provides the snow globe, but after the opening beat it recedes into backstory (the captain's ritual). The setting does not constrain middle choices; the lab and cliffside do more spatial work. The library's thematic charge (knowledge sinking willingly, preserving the artifact) enriches meaning but does not alter tactics. It is present in setup and conceptually linked to closure but absent from middle development.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"After finding Amelia Earhart's plane" anchors the story's start and provides the snow globe, but the timeframe does not tighten later decisions. The seventy-three lab nights are mentioned but do not create urgency; no live clock pressures the cliffside choice. The timeframe is setup-only, providing context rather than shaping escalation or closure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"To understand the physics of letting go" is stated explicitly ("My motivation wasn't treasure or fame") and dramatized through the investigation: noting patterns, spending seventy-three sleepless nights, speaking to Amelia. The desire conflicts with the need to act rather than solve, forcing the cliffside choice with visible cost (opening palms, the globe vanishing, becoming "hollow and humming"). The motivation drives two beats (investigation, release) and is causally active at closure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Sophisticated melancholy" coheres from the opening ("mahogany shelves warped by salt and silence") through the investigation (Amelia as hallucinated companion) to the ending (wind "now warm," death's smile, "It was enough"). The tone modulates under pressure—analytic detachment layered with longing—and charges the final image. Diction ("hollow and humming," "wind whipping my coat like impatient hands") sustains the mood without static repetition. The tone reweights the closure with quiet resonance.</comment>
