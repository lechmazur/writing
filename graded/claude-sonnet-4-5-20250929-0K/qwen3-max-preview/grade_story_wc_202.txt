<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The protagonist translator carries sufficient interiority through memory and gesture ("my soles remembering," "barefoot across hemp planks"), and the historian arrives with "eyes hollowed by years of archival dust." Motivation coheres around recovering erased cultures. However, the protagonist's arc relies heavily on told competence ("I trade in truths too delicate for common tongues") rather than on-page struggle or contradiction under pressure; the lens transaction and triptych reading proceed smoothly without meaningful resistance or cost to the translator's own stance. The historian's transformation is asserted ("he weeps quietly, not from sorrow, but recognition") rather than earned through dramatized internal conflict.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—the piece accrues details (market, memory-trade, lens fragment, triptych reveal) toward a final image where the historian recognizes ancestors. Orientation anchors are present early (market, translator role, quest object). The closure unit reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (the historian's recognition reweights grief into continuity), but cost remains ambiguous: the translator pays a memory to Mara, yet this transaction feels ornamental rather than foreclosing a live option for the protagonist. The ending's conceptual repricing ("truth isn't shouted") tilts toward theme statement instead of an image that demonstrates cost on the page, weakening closure legibility under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The alchemist's market is vividly rendered with rope bridges, suspended lanterns, and crow-feather shawls; the lens fragment glows amber with "edges sharp as regret." Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through the translator's professional lens. Spatial choreography remains clear across stalls and the attic chamber. The lens fragment constrains the historian's choice (he must hold it to see the triptych's hidden layers), meeting the 9+ gate's requirement that setting or object pressure a choice. However, the market itself functions more as atmospheric backdrop than as a space that narrows options or alters tactics during the quest.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—unfastening the historian's grief by revealing hidden ancestors—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs when the translator presses the lens and the triptych "begins to breathe," revealing hidden figures. However, this turn arrives without resistance or complication; the lens simply works as promised, and the historian gasps and weeps on cue. No live option is foreclosed, no trade-off dramatized. The resolution feels delivered rather than earned by protagonist agency under pressure, and the cost (returning the lens, accepting a new commission) reads as narrative housekeeping rather than a price that reweights prior choices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme—honoring erased cultures, truth whispered through hidden details—emerges organically from the triptych reveal and memory-trade. The final image of the child's drawing ("anchors hope") and the translator walking bridges "suspended above rooftops and ruin" offers resonance. Yet the closing paragraph shifts into overt thematic declaration ("truth isn't shouted. It's whispered through brushstrokes") that states the premise rather than letting the final image perform it. The lens fragment's task is summarized ("its energy spent honoring overlooked histories") instead of shown through a charged reprise, reducing subtext and inviting the Thematic Echo penalty.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice is consistent and textured: "truths that shimmer elusively tangible, like heat haze over desert stone," "crow-feather shawls," "origami birds, each chirping forgotten dialects." POV remains stable in first person; psychic distance modulates purposefully (intimate in memory, observational in the market). Perceptual signature is distinct—filtered through the translator's profession and loss. However, under peak emotional beats (the historian's weeping, the lens's thrumming), the prose shifts into elevated diction ("architects of resilience, their laughter stitched into the canvas like golden thread") that edges toward poetic summary rather than embodied reaction, slightly weakening voice-under-pressure control.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies; opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes effectively. Information density is high in the market and lens-transaction beats. However, the piece exhibits overwriting in figurative clusters: "truths that shimmer elusively tangible, like heat haze over desert stone" followed by "stories folded into origami birds, each chirping forgotten dialects" within two sentences; "edges sharp as regret, its center swirling with captured twilight." Mixed metaphors appear ("grief… calcified into silence," then "unfasten the knot in my client's soul"). The final third accumulates summary and theme statements ("not as tragedies, but as living continuums"; "truth isn't shouted") that reduce propulsion. Template cadence in the closing lines ("Between childhood and now, I've learned") and paraphrase loops ("not by force, but by revealing"; "not as victims, but as architects") trigger modest line-level debt.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The alchemist's market above rooftops and the memory-vial transaction offer fresh specificity. The lens-as-intuition-anchor and the triptych's hidden-layer reveal provide a non-obvious synthesis of object, method, and theme. However, the core arc—magical consultant helps grieving client recover lost heritage through enchanted relic—follows a familiar template (specialist retrieves artifact, artifact solves problem, consultant departs with new mission). The story does not transform the pattern through moral ambiguity or structural risk; the historian's recognition arrives without complication, and the translator's role remains facilitator rather than participant with skin in the game. Emotional specificity in the grandmother memory and driftwood dolls elevates texture, but the resolution's tidiness undercuts bold risk-taking.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The between-worlds translator character is present throughout and makes decisions (seek lens, trade memory, guide historian), meeting setup and development gates. However, the protagonist's choices do not create key turns; the lens and triptych perform the work while the translator observes and facilitates. The memory-trade to Mara is transactional rather than a choice that narrows options or imposes visible cost on the translator's own stance. The character is functional but does not drive causal pressure or closure; swapping in another consultant role would leave the arc largely unchanged.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The lighthouse lens fragment appears in setup (rumored, sought), development (purchased, held, pressed), and closure (dims after use, returned). It is handled across multiple beats: the velvet-pouch reveal, the cold-then-warm touch, the thrumming that animates the triptych, and the final dimming. Its unique property—responding "only to those who see through hidden details"—enables the triptych reveal, a causal turn. The fragment's return charges the ending by making space for the new commission, though this closure linkage is modest. The object is essential to the historian's arc but not irreplaceable for the translator's own stakes, capping the score below 8.5.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The core concept "anchors of intuition" is named in the setup ("a lodestone for those who navigate… the tides of memory") and returns implicitly when the lens anchors the historian's recognition. It shapes the quest's framing and reweights at closure when the new commission "anchors hope." However, the concept remains largely thematic label rather than a rule that constrains tactics or enables on-page choices with visible cost. The lens functions as a magical key rather than as a dramatic test of intuition-as-navigation. Lyric reprise (setup → closure) lifts the score into mid-band, but lack of mid-scene causal pressure caps it.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The attribute "elusively tangible" is mentioned once in the first paragraph ("truths that shimmer elusively tangible") as a descriptor of the translator's trade. It does not constrain or enable any on-page action, nor does it return with reweighted meaning at closure. The lens fragment embodies tangibility-with-mystery, but the phrase itself remains ornamental. Present but swappable; no demonstrated causal work or cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The action "unfasten" is seeded early ("unfasten the knot in my client's soul") and returns at closure ("the courage to unfasten what the world insists must stay sealed"). It defines the quest and reweights in the final image, meeting lyric-reprise criteria. The lens's thrumming and the triptych's breathing could be read as the unfastening action, but this connection is implied rather than explicit; the text does not show the translator performing a distinct unfastening gesture at the peak beat. The verb is integral to theme and framing but does not drive a major physical or decisional turn that could not be replaced by "reveal" or "unlock" with minor edits, capping it in mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The method "through hidden details in paintings" is signaled in setup (triptych commission, monk's witness to coastal purge) and executed in the climactic beat when the lens reveals "tiny figures… from the underlayers: children clutching dolls, elders etching maps." The method's mechanics matter: the lens must be pressed, the fragment dims after use, and the hidden scripts and tide-pattern vows are specific. It shapes the historian's transformation and is causally indispensable to the resolution. The method is demonstrated rather than merely told, and its unique properties (requiring the lens, not just close looking) prevent easy substitution. Strong integration across setup, middle use, and closure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The alchemist's market is vividly described in the opening (rope bridges, lanterns, stalls) and provides the location where the translator finds Mara and purchases the lens. It supplies a resource (Mara, the lens) that affects outcome. However, the market does not constrain choices or pressure tactics; the translator walks directly to Mara beneath the Clockwork Crane, and the transaction proceeds without spatial complication or market-specific obstacles. The setting is atmospheric and legible but functions more as backdrop than as a force that narrows options or alters the protagonist's moves. Setup and development gates met; closure participation minimal (market mentioned in passing in final lines).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The timeframe "between childhood and now" is seeded in the opening reflection ("Back then, elders called my visions 'fancies'… between childhood and now—I trade in truths") and returns in the closing paragraph ("Between childhood and now, I've learned"). It frames the translator's arc as a passage from disbelief to mastery. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions or constrain tactics on the page; the story unfolds in a vague "today" with no live clock or countdown. The phrase is thematic rather than causal, used for lyric resonance without tactical pressure. Present in setup and closure but not developed in the middle; ornamental reprise only.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The motivation "to honor overlooked histories" is dramatized: the translator seeks the lens to help the historian hear "lullabies sung by mothers whose names were scrubbed from ledgers," and the climax reveals ancestors "not as victims, but as architects of resilience." The desire is present in setup, drives the quest, and is fulfilled at closure when the historian recognizes his ancestors. However, the motivation belongs more to the historian than to the translator; the protagonist facilitates rather than wrestles with personal friction between this want and competing costs. The translator's grandmother memory adds personal stake but is traded away without visible consequence to the protagonist's choices. Functional and thematically coherent but lacks on-page internal conflict for the POV character.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The tone "eternal instant" is invoked explicitly in the final paragraph ("in this eternal instant, suspended above rooftops and ruin") and implicitly through timeless, lyric phrasing ("truths that shimmer elusively tangible," "the city pulses… oblivious"). The tone is coherent and modulates subtly—reflective in memory, transactional in the market, quietly charged at the triptych reveal. However, the tone does not shift dramatically under pressure; the prose remains elevated and contemplative even at the climactic lens-touch, reducing tonal range. The final image reuses the "eternal instant" phrase, charging closure, but the effect is asserted rather than earned through rhythm or cadence break. Functional lyric reprise; mid-band for coherence without dynamic modulation.</comment>
