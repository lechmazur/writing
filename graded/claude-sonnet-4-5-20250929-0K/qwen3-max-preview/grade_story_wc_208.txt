<comment>Elara's motivations are stated early (scaffold complexity with simplicity) but remain abstract; the progression from seeing the slide's image to carving is asserted rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. Her realization about timewoven alliances arrives through exposition ("she realized") rather than embodied discovery. The final choice to teach villagers feels declared rather than earned by prior on-page struggle with competing desires. Interiority leans toward thesis articulation rather than moment-specific contradiction.</comment>

<comment>The piece infers an Accumulative/Textural lens: the GPS failure, archway setting, slide viewing, and carving beats layer toward a final image of communal lantern-lighting. However, the closure unit (villagers holding hands at the archway) occurs largely in summary ("Days later… people didn't panic"). The cost—Elara's shift from solitary artist to community teacher—is told rather than shown in a final beat where options narrow. The ending lands thematically but lacks a discrete on-page moment where a visible price is paid or a path foreclosed.</comment>

<comment>The storm-tossed archway anchors space and recurs with purpose: Elara shelters under it, carves within it, and later it becomes a communal shrine. Sensory detail is vivid and POV-filtered ("turbine-hum reverie," "rain needled her scalp"). The archway's stone ribs and the projection onto cliff rock constrain her final gesture, charging the closure image. Minor: spatial transitions after "Days later" compress without clear re-anchoring, but the core setting shapes tactics throughout.</comment>

<comment>One dominant stake—Elara's desire to carve meaning from chaos—is signaled early and deepens when she sees the slide's shifting figures. The on-page carving under storm pressure constitutes one meaningful tightening. However, escalation is muted: the "deadlines, critics, pressure to monetize" are mentioned but never test her in scene, and the resolution (teaching villagers) is recounted rather than dramatized as a choice with visible trade-off. Agency remains contemplative rather than decisional at the closure beat.</comment>

<grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>Theme—trust and shared survival across time—emerges from the slide's image and is embodied in Elara's carving and the villagers' ritual. The line "Simplicity is not absence. It is architecture" borders on thesis statement but functions as a felt epiphany tied to her sculptural act. The final image (hands clasped, lanterns lit) reweights prior material without overt moralizing. However, the ending's summary mode ("people didn't panic… They remembered") abstracts the thematic payoff rather than grounding it in a single, charged gesture.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>POV remains stable in close third, anchored to Elara's perceptual signature (salt-crusted boots, calloused fingers, tidepool mind). Diction is distinct and voice-motivated ("arrogance of thinking satellites could map what tides and time rewrote daily"). However, phrases like "turbine-hum reverie" and "timewoven alliances" veer toward elevated register that feels authorial rather than character-internal. Dialogue is absent. The summary epilogue shifts psychic distance without clear anchoring to Elara's ongoing experience.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>6.3</grade>
<comment>Rhythm varies purposefully, and many lines carry double duty (e.g., "She didn't understand it yet—she was perpetually learning, her mind a tidepool refreshed with each wave"). However, scaffold phrasing recurs: multiple sentences open with "She [verb]" across the carving sequence, and paraphrase loops appear ("not contracts signed, but gestures repeated, trust layered like sediment" echoes the prior image without advancing pressure). The phrase "turbine-hum reverie" is repeated without reweighting. The ending's summary mode dilutes propulsion, and the line "They had gestures. They had hands. They had trust" borders on rhythmic template.</comment>

<grade>5.4</grade>
<comment>The magic lantern slide and timewoven alliances offer a fresh frame, and the carving-under-storm beat feels specific. However, the arc—solitary artist learns communal lesson via mystical object—follows a recognizable template, and the resolution (villagers adopt the ritual) is telegraphed early. The transformation test is borderline: swap the archway for another ruin and the slide for another artifact, and the emotional arc holds unchanged. Risk-taking is present in the lyric-summary ending, but it reduces specificity rather than heightening stakes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question>
<grade>6.2</grade>
<comment>Elara frames the opening, drives the carving beat, and appears in the epilogue as a recurring teacher. Her choice to carve the archway-within-archway and later to "tell them what she'd seen" shape two beats. However, the final decision (teaching villagers) is summarized rather than shown as a turn. Early signal present, two beats involved, closure linkage via summary.</comment>

<question>9 B</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The magic lantern slide is introduced early (unearthed from lighthouse keeper's chest), examined mid-scene ("held the slide to the flame"), and integrated into the projector to create the final shadow image. It drives two distinct beats (revelation of timewoven figures, projection onto cliff) and charges the closure image. Specificity high: the shifting tableau is irreplaceable. Cost connection: the slide's images reweight Elara's understanding and enable the communal ritual.</comment>

<question>9 C</question>
<grade>4.8</grade>
<comment>Timewoven alliances appear as the slide's content and as a thematic realization ("she realized—not contracts signed, but gestures repeated"). The concept is discussed but does not constrain a choice or narrow options on the page. It functions as thematic gloss rather than a tactical pressure. Present in setup and ending, but ornamental in development.</comment>

<question>9 D</question>
<grade>3.6</grade>
<comment>"Perpetually learning" is mentioned twice as a label ("She didn't understand it yet—she was perpetually learning" and "She remained perpetually learning"). It does not constrain a choice or enable a visible action with cost. The trait is asserted rather than demonstrated through a trade-off or mistake. Ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question>
<grade>5.9</grade>
<comment>"Reimagine" appears in the storm-pressure reflection ("Each figure had reimagined survival") and in Elara's stated intention to "reimagine alliance." The term frames her teaching goal but does not drive an on-page turn. The carving itself is the pivotal act, and "reimagine" functions as thematic vocabulary rather than a discrete action. Present in setup and ending; functional but replaceable with "redefine" or "rethink."</comment>

<question>9 F</question>
<grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>"Layered meanings" is signaled early ("She worked through layered meanings: the outer arch, the storm; the inner arch, sanctuary; between them, figures") and shapes the carving's design. The method recurs when the projection layers slide and carving onto cliff. Two beats involved, causal pressure present (the layering enables the communal image), closure linkage clear. Specificity moderate; "nested symbols" could substitute with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 G</question>
<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>The storm-tossed archway anchors the opening, shelters Elara during the carving, and becomes the communal shrine at closure. It pressures her physically (wind, rain) and symbolically (echoed in her carving). Present in setup, development (she works "beneath the archway's ancient curve"), and payoff (villagers return to it). Spatial constraint alters tactics (she aligns the sculpture with the arch). Essential across beats and ending.</comment>

<question>9 H</question>
<grade>5.1</grade>
<comment>The GPS failure opens the story and signals a departure from technological navigation. However, no ticking clock or time pressure shapes Elara's choices during the carving or teaching. The timeframe functions as premise rather than constraint. Present in setup, absent in development and closure escalation. Functional but replaceable with "during the storm" or "at dusk."</comment>

<question>9 I</question>
<grade>5.7</grade>
<comment>Elara's motivation "to scaffold complexity with simplicity" is declared early and recurs in the carving's nested design and the final communal gesture. It drives one beat (the carving) and thematically charges the ending. However, the motivation is never tested by friction or competing desire on the page. Present in setup and payoff, but told rather than dramatized through a choice with visible cost. Functional, but the abstract phrasing ("scaffold complexity") borders on prompt echo.</comment>

<question>9 J</question>
<grade>6.1</grade>
<comment>"Turbine-hum reverie" appears twice: once describing the wind through the archway and again as descriptor of Elara's archive-art. The tone—meditative, layered, cyclical—coheres through the carving sequence and modulates with storm intensity. However, the phrase itself is repeated without reweighting, and the summary epilogue flattens the hum into expository calm. Present in setup and ending, tone consistent, but the final image does not charge the reverie with new cost.</comment>
