<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The skimmer remains a static figure throughout, performing observation rather than decision. Interior life is conveyed through labels ("weathered resolve," "duty as your skin") rather than embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. The arrowhead is handled twice but never constrains a choice with visible cost. No agency-driven change or renunciation forecloses a path on the page—the ending restates the opening posture without dramatized alteration.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation Test penalty (−0.4): who/where/when remain abstract past 120 words; "harmonic stone skimmer" and "tower of bone" are never concretely anchored in a legible present moment. No on-page decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing with felt cost occurs—the final paragraph ("would not move… let the world move around it") restates the opening stance without dramatized closure. The inferred lens (Accumulative/Textural) is never taught or paid off; the piece asserts thematic weight but delivers no tightening, pattern break, or cadence shift that reweights the dominant stake.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The towers of bone and canyon are evocative but remain postcard description; no spatial choreography, no constraint on choice. The arrowhead is cradled and traced but does not alter tactics or charge the final image beyond symbolic mention. Sensory detail (dust, wingbeats, thermals) is vivid yet passive, never filtered through urgency or POV priority that would shape a decision.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake ("to navigate without moving") is declared but never tested by an on-page tightening or reversal that narrows options. The crow flock's flight delivers information passively; the skimmer registers it without agency, trade-off, or visible cost. No escalation under any lens—pressure remains static assertion rather than dramatized deepening or choice-driven turn.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Theme (guidance as mirroring, stillness as alignment) emerges from repeated images and assertions but is stated overtly in the final paragraphs ("guidance is not given—it is mirrored"). The closing lines moralize rather than offering a resonant, non-literal answer through image. Subtext is thin; the piece tells its philosophy directly rather than earning it through concrete, conflicted particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and lyric with controlled diction ("obsidian shards," "marrow of its bones"), but the perceptual signature remains uniform across all beats—no modulation under pressure. Psychic distance is stable, though the narration leans into elevated register ("sediment," "murmuration," "receiver tuned to frequencies") that borders on over-ornamentation without strategic purpose. No dialogue present to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops across adjacent lines (e.g., "It did not move… movement was the enemy" / "It would not move… let the world move around it") and template cadence ("It did not smile. It did not weep. It simply knew") appear in high-pressure beats (−0.6). Figurative density is high without taught pattern or payoff: "towers of bone," "dust motes," "fossilized marrow," "aerial hymn," "node in the world's quiet network" stack within single paragraphs without causal pressure (−0.5). Stock metaphors ("duty as your skin," "physics dressed in reverence") reduce specificity. Information density is low; many sentences restate the skimmer's stillness without advancing situation or choice.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The premise (learning stillness to decode hidden patterns) is conceptually intriguing but executed through assertion rather than specific, causal demonstration. The synthesis of navigation, patience, and observation feels abstract rather than inevitable. The final image ("become the landmark") is a tidy moral summary rather than a fresh inflection earned from prior particulars. Risk-taking in voice and structure is present but does not heighten stakes when the closure unit lacks dramatized cost.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>The skimmer is present throughout but makes no on-page choice that creates a turn or alters tactics. Observation ("lifted its gaze," "began to appraise," "lowered its gaze") substitutes for agency. The final stance ("would not move") restates the opening without dramatized decision or cost. Setup and closure gates met; middle development is label-only (−0.8 for ornamental use).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The arrowhead appears in three beats (cradled, traced with thumb, traced again at end) but serves only as symbolic anchor without constraining choice or enabling a tactic under pressure. Setup, development, and closure gates met, but swappable with any talismanic object (−0.6). No visible cost tied to its use (−0.4).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The pulse is mentioned mid-story and at closure ("felt the pulse nestle into its chest") but functions as thematic claim rather than shaping stakes or altering on-page options. It does not constrain a middle choice or enable a tactic; it is decoded passively. Late appearance (second third) and summary-only use (−1.0 combined).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Historically reverent" appears twice as label in exposition ("arrowhead was historically reverent," "skimmer, historically reverent") but never constrains or enables an action with cost. Ornamental descriptor without dramatized tradeoff (−0.8). Missing middle development gate; cap 3.4 applies but deductions pull final score lower.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Appraise" is signaled early and drives one extended beat (decoding the crow flock's flight) that delivers information used at closure. The action shapes the middle and ending but does not narrow options or force a choice with cost—information arrives without friction. Setup, development, closure gates met; causal pressure weak (mid-band).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The crow flock appears in the middle third and its flight pattern delivers the pulse; the method is signaled and functional. However, it arrives late (−0.3), does not shape prior attempts, and the mechanics are asserted rather than earned through trial. Missing setup gate; cap 4.6 applies.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The towers and canyon are described vividly but supply no constraint or resource that alters outcome. Spatial choreography is absent; the setting remains backdrop. Present throughout but ornamental (−0.8). Development and closure participation missing; cap 2.8 would apply but generous read of lyric resonance lifts slightly.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Centuries of layered dust" and multi-generational timeframe are asserted in exposition but never tighten a decision or alter tactics on the page. Time remains vague and untracked; no live clock. Ornamental use (−0.8); missing all three gates.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The desire to navigate without moving is declared early and restated at closure, but never dramatized through conflicted choice or friction between want and cost. The skimmer's stance is static rather than tested. Setup and closure gates met; middle development is told rather than shown (−0.6 for summary-only use).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Weathered resolve is coherent and stable across beats, reflected in diction ("weathered but unbroken," "stripped bare and left only duty") and rhythm. Tone does not modulate under pressure—no cadence shift to charge the final image. Present throughout and consistent but does not participate causally in closure; lyric resonance weak.</comment>
