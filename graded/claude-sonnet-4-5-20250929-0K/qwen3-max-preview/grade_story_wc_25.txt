<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lena's defining trait (reading walks) is established early and her calibrated silence creates a distinct character. The decision to pocket the coin and later plant evidence shows agency, but the choice feels more clever than conflicted—no visible internal friction between competing impulses. The final act of slipping the map to Ruiz forecloses confrontation, which reads as Earned Stasis, but the cost (what she surrenders by not acting directly) remains implicit rather than embodied on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through layered discoveries (coin → map → keyhole → overheard confession) toward a conceptual repricing: the "key with no apparent lock" reweights the premise from physical tool to metaphor for truth-gathering. Closure lands with Lena's deliberate non-confrontation and the map's transfer, a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) that crystallizes her stance. Cost is legible in the choice to work through silence rather than direct action, forecloses spectacle. Orientation is clean by the second paragraph. One meaningful deepening when the keyhole's purpose inverts from mechanical to metaphorical.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The container labyrinth is established early with rust streaks, sodium lamps, junctions, and gantries that shape Lena's navigation choices (the gap "no wider than her shoulders" gates access to the keyhole). The storm's static interference disrupts her usual tool (listening for gaits) and raises the stakes. The keyhole bolted to the gantry charges the final discovery by positioning Lena to overhear Delgado's confession from above—environment directly enables the climax.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: proving whispers travel farther than shouts (thematically and tactically). The coin's warmth and the map's guidance create one meaningful tightening that narrows Lena's path toward the keyhole. The reversal arrives when the keyhole produces no mechanical result but instead positions her to gather evidence—escalation under the Accumulative lens. Agency is present (she chooses to track, climb, and later plant the map), but the overheard confession is coincidental positioning rather than a choice Lena forces, which caps pressure slightly.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: the zodiac coin as silent currency, folded maps encoding secret routes, and the keyhole that opens ears rather than doors. The final image—Lena refolding the map "along its original creases" and slipping it to Ruiz—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the premise that truth moves best when carried quietly. No overt moralizing; the conceptual cost (Delgado's removal will be quiet, no spectacle) reweights the opening claim about whispers versus shouts with undeniable specificity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Single POV maintained throughout with a distinct perceptual signature: Lena reads time in "the sway of stacked containers" and tracks people by gait rhythms. Psychic distance is controlled; diction remains consistent (port-worker register with selective technical detail). The storm's "electric growl" and "falling ash" similes support voice. Brief convergence risk when the narration philosophizes ("whispers travel farther than shouts") but the claim is anchored to Lena's on-page choices and the final image proves it through action rather than assertion.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high—most lines advance character, discovery, or atmosphere. Minor template cadence in the opening paragraph ("didn't flinch—she'd learned," "not to fix cranes or patch hulls, but to navigate") and one paraphrase loop ("whispers travel farther than shouts... Whispers, she knew, echo longer") that restate the same concept without added pressure. The keyhole revelation beat is clean and propulsive. No filter-verb stacks or major clarity breaks.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The premise—port labyrinth worker uses zodiac relics to expose corruption through listening—synthesizes familiar noir investigation with the fresh angle that the "key" is metaphorical positioning rather than a literal tool. The inversion (keyhole opens ears, not doors) feels earned in hindsight by the map's secret-passage motif and Lena's established gait-listening skill. The choice to fold the map and pass it silently to Ruiz rather than confront Delgado directly is a specific, non-obvious moral calculus that follows from character and theme. Risk-taking in structure (accumulative pressure, quiet ending) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Lena's role as labyrinth maintenance worker frames her navigation skill (established early) and her access to the container maze. Her decisions—pocketing the coin, following the map, climbing to the gantry, and planting evidence with Ruiz—create every key turn. The profession is causally active in at least three beats (tracking Delgado, using her maze knowledge to reach the keyhole, leveraging her silent observation role) and shapes the ending when her non-confrontational method mirrors her maintenance function (fixing problems invisibly). Removing this exact occupation would break the logic of her access and her tactical silence.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The zodiac coin appears in three functionally distinct beats: discovery at Junction Gamma-7 (setup), guiding/pulsing toward Sector Theta (development), and insertion into the keyhole (payoff/closure participation). Its warmth ("recently clutched in a sweating palm") and vibration create specific sensory pressure, and its Libra symbol links to the scales-shaped keyhole, making it irreplaceable. The coin's failure to open anything mechanical reweights its meaning at closure (it positions Lena to gather truth). Cost is tied to the choice it enables.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Folded maps frame the Harbor Guild's method (setup in paragraph 8) and the sailcloth map is handled physically across two beats: unfolding to reveal hidden routes (middle) and refolding "along its original creases" as Lena seals evidence (closure). The folding action at the end ("each fold sealing another layer of evidence") becomes a deliberate tactic that alters how truth is passed. The concept shapes one key turn (the map guides Lena to the keyhole) and charges the final image with metaphorical weight, but the middle navigation sequence could function with a simpler set of directions.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Lena's ability to identify people's walks is established early (paragraphs 3–4) and creates one constraint: the storm's static "dissolved [the] usual footfall signatures into white noise," forcing her to adapt. She uses the skill once more when tracking Delgado and the shadowed figure ("tracking their movements by the scrape of boot soles and the tilt of shoulders"). The trait enables her silent intelligence-gathering and reflects her broader ethos (listening over shouting), but it does not directly alter the climax—the overheard confession depends on her position at the gantry, not her gait-reading. Present across two beats with thematic resonance but swappable with general observational skill.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The "challenge" element is somewhat diffuse: Delgado's argument near Crane 9 complicates Lena's night (she must track him silently), and the coin itself "grew heavier with each step" as a form of pressure. The climactic challenge arrives when the keyhole produces no mechanical result, forcing Lena to reinterpret success. This reversal shapes the ending's conceptual repricing, but "challenge" as stated could encompass any obstacle—its exact nature (interpersonal confrontation vs. puzzle vs. physical trial) is not clearly foregrounded early, making it functional but not indispensable in its current framing.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"A key with no apparent lock" is signaled on the map (paragraph 14), becomes the gantry keyhole two paragraphs later, and its mechanics matter critically: when the coin insertion produces no click or light, Lena must reinterpret the tool's purpose. The method shapes two attempts (insertion, then listening from above) and the payoff redefines the entire investigation—truth-gathering replaces door-opening. The phrase is repeated verbatim at closure ("The key with no apparent lock wasn't meant to open a door—it was meant to open ears"), charging the final image. Removing this exact framing would collapse the metaphorical turn.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The container labyrinth is established in paragraph 2 and constrains Lena's movements across the story: Junction Gamma-7 (coin discovery), Sector Theta (forbidden zone that raises stakes), the three-level climb and shoulder-width gap (physical gate to the keyhole), and the gantry overlooking the sea (enables eavesdropping). The maze's verticality and acoustic properties directly affect the outcome—Delgado's confession is audible from above while his shouts "died unheard ten feet away." The setting is causally active in setup, middle navigation, and closure, and its specific architecture (steel canyons that echo whispers) reinforces theme.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The geomagnetic storm is present in the opening line and disrupts Lena's usual gait-reading tool (paragraph 5), raising difficulty. It "swallowed" Delgado's argument voices (paragraph 9) and ebbs by the final paragraph, bracketing the action. However, the storm does not tighten a live decision clock—Lena's movements are methodical, not race-against-time urgent—and its effects (static interference, electric growl) create atmosphere more than tactical pressure. The timeframe shapes one constraint (sensory disruption) and bookends the narrative but could be replaced with night fog or equipment failure without major structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lena's motivation "to prove that whispers travel farther than shouts" is stated explicitly (paragraph 11) and then dramatized through her refusal to confront Delgado directly (paragraph 10: "Instead of shouting back... Lena stayed silent"). The entire investigation—silent tracking, map-following, evidence-planting—enacts this belief, and the closure validates it ("whispers echo longer in steel canyons"). The want is consistent and shapes every choice. Minor friction: the motivation is declared rather than emerging purely from action, and no on-page moment tests whether Lena is tempted to shout or act openly, which would deepen the conflict. Cost is visible (she forgoes spectacle and direct credit) but the internal struggle remains implicit.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Calculated spontaneity" manifests in Lena's improvised yet purposeful moves: she pockets the coin "not out of greed, but curiosity," follows the coin's pulse as it "grew heavier," and adapts when the keyhole fails mechanically. The tone balances deliberate silence (her "quiet certainty," "calibrated ears") with reactive discovery (finding the coin, the map, the overheard confession). Modulation is present—urgency rises when she climbs and squeezes through the gap, then resolves into measured action when she plants the map. The ending's calm descent mirrors the calculated method. Tone coheres across turns and charges the final image of "calibrated silence," though "spontaneity" is more implied than vividly enacted in peak moments.</comment>
