<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The lamplighter demonstrates clear motivation ("hunting the color of sound") and his final choice to lay down the ledger is earned by the discovery sequence. Interior states are embodied through physical action (diving, grasping, surfacing) rather than diagnostic labels. However, the protagonist remains fundamentally reactive—events unfold *to* him (woman slips key, ledger reveals his name) rather than being driven by his micro-choices under pressure. The pre-signed vow reduces agency; he's discovering a predetermined path rather than forging one through contradictory impulses.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): the protagonist stops searching and begins "signifying," with visible cost in the shift from seeker to witness. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through layered images (lanterns, dive, ledger, signature) toward a cadence shift at "no longer searching, but signifying." Orientation anchors clearly by the second paragraph (pier, midnight, lamplighter). One meaningful tightening occurs when he finds his own name pre-signed, reweighting all prior wandering. Cost is felt in the renunciation of active pursuit.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The sunken library constrains choice by forcing the underwater dive and supplies the ledger that charges the closure. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful: "pages blooming like anemones," "barnacles," "sediment," all filtered through the protagonist's focused attention. The pier and ship are handled as lived-in spaces with clear spatial choreography. The key tag functions as micro-setting—its weight and warmth recur to charge the final pocket-tucking gesture. The sky lanterns frame the time window and reappear at closure to bookend the piece.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (discover the color of sound) is signaled early and pursued consistently. The dive represents meaningful escalation—physical risk plus the revelation of the pre-signed vow narrows his existential options. The ledger discovery provides one clear reversal that reweights his understanding of his purpose. However, the protagonist's agency is compromised by the predetermined signature; he's confirming fate rather than choosing under conflicting pressures. Cost is legible in the shift from searching to signifying, though the lack of a live tradeoff (no competing want vs. fear at the peak) keeps this from higher bands.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from concrete particulars: vows as binding promise, sound as visible color, truth hiding behind truth. The ledger's glowing ink and the protagonist's synaesthetic experience avoid direct statement. The final image—walking away "no longer searching, but signifying"—offers a resonant answer to the central question without moralizing. However, "truth hides behind truth—the more you grasp at one layer, the deeper the next one retreats" edges toward thematic echo, and "Let the next seeker find it" risks tidy closure that softens ambiguity. The recurring lanterns and key tag constrain choice and charge the ending.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Voice is consistent and distinct with purposeful compression ("meteor hush," "drowned stars reborn") and controlled psychic distance. Perceptual signature is character-specific: a lamplighter who sees light's behavior when unwatched. The prose texture shifts appropriately under pressure—short breaths during the dive, expansive rhythm at discovery. However, elevated diction occasionally clashes with the working-class lamplighter POV: "banish dark," "alchemical blend," "bioluminescent plankton" read slightly Wikipedia-adjacent. No dialogue is present (correctly, given solo scene). Free indirect style is clean with stable tense.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines advance atmosphere and discovery. Rhythm varies purposefully, accelerating through the dive sequence and breathing at closure. However, figurative density approaches overwriting in the opening third: "drowned stars reborn," "color of sound," "metronome counting toward revelation," "pages blooming like anemones" cluster without pattern-teaching. Minor paraphrase loop: "He didn't chase her" followed immediately by "Truth, he knew, hides behind truth" restates non-pursuit thematically without added pressure. Stock metaphor "cathedral" for the ballroom recurs without fresh angle. No major scaffold or template cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of underwater library, pre-signed ledger, and synaesthetic revelation offers a non-obvious premise. The lamplighter's shift from seeker to signifier provides a fresh inflection on the quest narrative. However, the "destined discovery" frame (protagonist's name already in the ledger) is a widely used template that reduces earned agency. The lyric compression and sensory blending show craft, but the emotional truth—solitary seeker finds predetermined answer—lacks the lived-in friction or moral calculus that would fully transform the familiar structure. Within-band risk-taking (underwater library, color-of-sound conceit) adds +0.2.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lamplighter present throughout and his choice to lay down the ledger and walk away provides the closure action. However, his role is more observer/recipient than active decision-maker at key turns—the woman gives him the key, the ledger reveals his name. Two beats: lighting shift work (setup), final walk (closure). Functional but reactive.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Key tag appears in four beats: pocket discovery, lashed to wrist during dive, realization it unlocks "Room 7" (metaphoric ledger entry), final pocket-tuck. It enables the dive and is reweighted from literal hotel key to vow marker. However, its middle use is more symbolic than causally constraining—he would dive regardless. Strong lyric reprise charges the ending gesture.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Luminous vows shape the entire quest: whispered hint from the woman, ledger title, glowing ink that reacts to touch, protagonist's pre-signed entry, the woman's gold-edged signature. The concept drives the stakes (understand the vow's binding nature) and supplies the closure revelation. It appears across setup, middle discovery, and ending image. Essential to story logic.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Hides behind truth" is stated early as a philosophical stance and motivates his choice not to chase the woman. It reappears thematically in the layered discovery (surface truth → ledger → his name). However, it functions more as thematic label than a visible constraint with cost. The protagonist doesn't face an on-page tradeoff where grasping one truth sacrifices another.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Signifying" appears only in the final line as the culmination of his shift from searching to witnessing. It names the closure state but is not dramatized across beats—we see him search and discover, but "signifying" itself (marking, indicating for others) is more告announced than enacted. The ledger-on-bench gesture supports it, but the action could be described as "witnessing" or "accepting" with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Wandering purposefully" is signaled early ("wandered purposefully toward the pier's edge") and demonstrated through the deliberate dive and search sequence. The method contrasts aimless drift with intentional exploration, shaping his approach to the mystery. It appears in setup and is implicit in the middle quest. The final walk embodies it: "kept walking—no longer searching, but signifying." Causal role in two beats and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The sunken library is essential: it houses the ledger, forces the underwater dive (raising physical stakes), supplies the glowing ink and barnacle-crusted chandeliers that charge the atmosphere, and its "Room 7" desk location unlocks the key-tag metaphor. Without this exact setting, the story's central discovery and synaesthetic revelation collapse. Present in setup (divers' reports), middle (dive sequence), and closure reference (ledger pulse). Indispensable to logic and tone.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Sky lantern release frames the opening and closing, providing atmospheric bookends and a loose time boundary ("last lanterns still hovered" / "last sky lantern winked out"). However, the timeframe doesn't tighten decisions—the protagonist could complete his dive during any night shift. The lanterns add symbolic resonance (light, ascent vs. submersion) but don't constrain tactics. Functional reprise, replaceable pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation appears early ("hunting the color of sound"), drives the dive and ledger search, and is fulfilled on the page when he experiences "cerulean streaked with amber" vibrating behind his eyelids. The pre-signed vow in the ledger reweights his personal quest as a bound promise across time. Friction exists between the individual pursuit and the predetermined binding. Shapes setup, middle action, and closure revelation with visible synaesthetic payoff.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Meteor hush" is defined early as "breathless quiet between falling stars and rising sun" and sustained through lyric compression, soft imagery (lanterns, drifting, glowing), and restrained action. Tone modulates appropriately—tightens during the dive, opens at discovery, settles into quiet wonder at closure. The final image (last lantern winks out, ledger pulses gently) charges the hush with earned resonance. Coherent and purposeful throughout, shaping the piece's contemplative register.</comment>
