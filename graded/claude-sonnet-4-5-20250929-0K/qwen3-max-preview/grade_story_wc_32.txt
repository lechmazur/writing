<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elric's motivation (to interrupt stifling destiny) is clear and shapes his turn to error-embracing methodology. The iterative adjustment ("Too sharp," "Too slow") shows micro-choices under pressure. However, interiority leans on abstract formulations ("collision as the only path to rebirth," "the seed beneath could stretch") rather than embodied perception, and the final change reads as philosophical declaration more than lived cost. The bruised-violet eyes and "stoically sensitive" trait remain label-only without constraining a key choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates density through ritual layering (moonstone, bronze, blood, failed stone shard) and the crozier's transformation provides closure as Resonant Reconfiguration (the serpent head reborn, Elric becoming "the road"). Cost is conceptual—he abandons hope-as-destination—but the final image charges prior failure motifs. Orientation anchors quickly (who, where, when by line 2). The escalation is a cadence deepening rather than a causal tightening; the reconfiguration lands cleanly under the accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The ember nexus functions as more than backdrop: its tectonic thrum responds to the chant, shadows peel, and the final ember flares in affirmation, all shaping the ritual's success. The crozier (object-as-micro-setting) constrains choice—its fractured base anchors the circle, its trembling signals progress. Sensory detail (frost petals, liquid twilight, heat whispers beneath cooled crusts) is vivid and filtered through Elric's alchemical attention. The setting charges the closure image when frost melts into singing light.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: vivify the crozier to prove creative destruction works. One meaningful deepening occurs when Elric adds his blood and corrects cadence mid-ritual, narrowing his options ("not mastery, but motion"). The crozier's tremor and reborn serpent head deliver a visible pressure point. However, no live antagonist or external cost appears; the transition from failure-prone to "becoming" reads as internal shift rather than a choice that forecloses a concrete path with on-page price. The "held breath before the thaw" tone suspends tension but does not escalate it through a second reversal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme (creative destruction reframed as deconstruction, space-making for growth) emerges through the ritual's successive-approximation structure and the "penny drops" realization. The crozier's brokenness-as-becoming and Elric's shift from "hopeless" to "the road" offer a resonant answer without moralizing. Minor slip: "Hope was a destination; he was becoming the road" borders on thematic summary. The frozen bloom and ember motifs recur with reweighted meaning, charging the final image with conceptual cost (abandoning arrival for approach).</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Single POV, stable distance, and narrative certainty match Elric's alchemical lens. Diction is elevated and consistent ("indigo syrup," "tectonic thrum," "liquid twilight"). However, register drifts into abstract-philosophical at peak beats ("deconstruction," "contingent creation," "frequency," "portable, personal, potent" alliteration) rather than staying character-particular. The whispered corrections ("Too sharp," "Too slow") ground voice in action, but the closing paragraphs ("resonance," "harmonized into a new frequency") lean toward committee voice rather than a singular perceptual signature under stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is high in the ritual sequence. However, overwriting clusters in the final third: "burden and benediction," "not in farewell, but in affirmation," "portable, personal, potent," and multiple "not X, but Y" parallelisms create template cadence. The phrase "frozen bloom" recurs without evolving function. Mixed metaphor: frost "blooms" then "melts into light," but earlier the bloom was "delicate and lethal"—the vehicle's logic shifts. Stock phrases ("held breath," "penny dropped") appear at closure beats. These artifacts touch the ending; combined penalty −1.0 in Q7, disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The successive-approximation ritual and creative-destruction-as-deconstruction reframe offer a specific angle on alchemical-failure tales. The crozier vivification through iterative error rather than flawless formula provides freshness. However, the "failed alchemist discovers brokenness is the path" arc follows a familiar template without deeper lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The final image (frost melting into singing light, portable ember nexus) is evocative but borders on symbolic convenience introduced late. Risk-taking in structure (accumulative ritual beats) is modest.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elric's choices—embracing error, adding blood, correcting cadence—create the ritual's key turns. His decision to iterate rather than perfect drives the vivification. Present in setup, middle adjustments, and the final stance crystallization.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The crozier appears in setup (stolen for vivification), is handled across multiple beats (placed in circle, trembles, serpent head lifts), and its reborn state anchors the closure image. Its brokenness matters causally. Specific properties (fractured base, serpent head, silver) are irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Creative destruction shapes Elric's method and the "deconstruction" realization at the penny-drop moment. It reweights the premise. However, it is more thematic claim than on-page constraint; Elric does not visibly destroy a tool or sacrifice a component to enable the vivification. Mid-band for concept-as-theme rather than tactic-shaping force.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Stoically sensitive" is mentioned in setup ("bore each collapse without flinching, yet his eyes held bruised violet") but does not constrain or enable a choice with cost. It remains a descriptive label without causal work.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Vivification is the ritual's goal, the dominant stake, and the closure event. The crozier's serpent head lifting with ember-light eyes defines the ending. Removing "vivify" would break the story's logic. Present in motivation, ritual beats, and final image.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Successive approximation is signaled ("iterate, fail, adapt, repeat") and demonstrated on-page when Elric corrects cadence mid-ritual ("Too sharp," "Too slow"). It shapes the ritual's method and distinguishes his approach from prior perfectionism. Present in setup, middle beats, and conceptual payoff.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The ember nexus at twilight provides spatial anchor and responds to the ritual (tectonic thrum, shadows peel, final ember flares). Twilight thickens into indigo syrup, affecting atmosphere. The setting's responsiveness constrains Elric's confidence and supplies the affirmation at closure. Early signal, middle pressure, closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"When the penny drops" names the realization moment (deconstruction vs. destruction) but does not function as a live clock. The phrase appears mid-ritual and at the insight beat, yet time pressure does not tighten Elric's tactics. More a metaphorical marker than a timeframe constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Motivation to interrupt stifling destiny drives Elric's turn to error-embracing and the entire ritual. It is dramatized in his choice to add blood, correct cadence, and walk forward as "the road." Cost: he abandons hope-as-destination. Present in setup, middle choices, and final stance. Friction between perfectionist past and iterative present is visible.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Frozen bloom appears in the crozier's frost petals ("delicate and lethal") and again when frost melts into singing light. The tone—suspended grace, held breath—modulates under pressure and charges the final image. However, "frozen bloom" also titles the timeframe element, creating some overlap. It reweights the ending with beauty-in-fragility but does not constrain a tactical choice. Lyric reprise qualifies for mid-6 band.</comment>
