<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elira's motivation—encrypting vulnerability as strength—is poetically stated but never dramatized through contradictory impulses or a moment where she must choose between fragility and armor. Her "calm defiance" remains a declared trait rather than an embodied struggle; we see choreographed competence (pirouettes that trigger vents, dice that summon submersibles) but no genuine friction between her stated mission and her choices. The final dance that collapses the mainframe and "rewrites" her is abstract; we cannot trace what she sacrifices or forecloses, so the cost reads ornamental. The mother's lullaby and seven lunar cycles are told backstory without on-page micro-choices that tilt present stakes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The story anchors who (Elira, code breaker), where (sunken lab), and when (after seven cycles, during an Overseer patrol) by the opening third, so no orientation penalty applies. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: phosphorescent algae, dice glyphs, dance notation, and journal capsules layer into a pattern of encrypted resistance. However, the final image—Elira "rewritten" as water surges and survivors dance her steps—declares closure rather than landing it with visible cost on the page. We cannot point to a sentence where a choice forecloses a path or a price is paid; the "harmony" collapse and the washed-ashore journals arrive as summary, not dramatized consequence. The lens holds, but closure lacks the felt cost required for higher bands.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The sunken lab is vividly rendered—silt-choked glass, corroded consoles, phosphorescent algae, drowned steel—and the setting constrains Elira's tactics (coolant vents to mislead drones, fissure for capsule launch, submersibles in Bay Theta). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through an operator's eye. The final beat, where water surges "not as destroyer but as veil," charges the closure image with the lab's transformation from extraction site to encryption chamber, lifting the score toward the 7.0 threshold. However, the body and props (dice, journal sheets) are described more than handled in tactile, lived-in ways, and spatial choreography blurs during the dance sequences.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—liberate trapped survivors by encrypting resistance into a transmissible code—is signaled early and sustained. Elira's pirouette triggers coolant vents to mislead drones, and rolling the dice awakens submersibles, both tactical moves under pressure. Yet the escalation is procedural rather than protagonist-driven: no on-page reversal forces a trade-off or narrows options with felt consequence. The Overseers' patrol sweeps past without complication, the mainframe yields to her final dance without resistance, and the survivors' eventual freedom is recounted in summary. One tightening (the choice not to board the submersible) arrives too late and without clear cost, leaving pressure coherent but static.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Theme—liberating through resonance rather than force, encrypting vulnerability as strength—emerges through the dance, dice, and journal capsules, not overt statement. The final image of survivors dancing her steps in candlelit basements offers a resonant answer to the central question, reweighting spectacle-rebellion into quiet transmission. However, the thematic language is elevated and abstract ("rewritten," "harmonized collapse," "mysterious familiarity") without grounding in the messy particulars of Elira's emotional cost or the survivors' lived constraints. The transmission imagery (morse-tap lullaby, salt-resistant ink, buoyant capsules) is purposeful but borders on symbolic convenience, arriving fully formed rather than earned through on-page friction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited, focalized through Elira, with no head-hopping. The voice is lyric and compressed—"tide-bound ghost," "slow certainty of a spider," "sonar hymns"—creating a distinct perceptual signature that filters the lab through an operator's patience and precision. Diction remains elevated throughout, even during high-pressure beats (the patrol, the final collapse), which is consistent with the established voice but risks flattening urgency. The narrator withholds key mechanics (how the dance triggers vents, how the dice glyphs function) in service of mystery, but this elision never imposes visible cost or creates friction that the scene then resolves, so it reads as purposeful compression rather than motivated withholding. No dialogue appears.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Figurative language is dense and often stacked without rest: "silt-choked glass," "static hymns," "tide-bound ghost," "slow certainty of a spider," "narrative arcs," "coded triumph," "sonar through metal and marrow" all within the opening quarter. Many metaphors shift vehicles mid-image—Elira is both tide and spider, both ghost and dancer—creating register drift that obscures rather than clarifies. Template cadence appears in repeated "not X, but Y" constructions ("not shouted, not shattered," "not to flood, but to redirect," "not dead, not gone, but rewritten") and in parallel "she had" / "she didn't" / "she turned" stems. Paraphrase loops recur: paragraph six recaps the journal-encoding already stated in paragraph five; "calm defiance" and "mastery of timing" are restated across multiple beats without new detail. The final third is pervaded by these artifacts, disqualifying 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of code-breaking, underwater resistance, dance-as-protocol, and maternal transmission is specific and non-obvious, avoiding stock prison-break or hacker templates. The hangman's dice—relics from a regime that "punished truth with silence"—offer a fresh inflection on liberation tools. However, the emotional arc (patient operator executes plan, chooses martyrdom, inspires mass movement) follows a familiar trajectory without transformation through lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The dance notation readable only by candlelight or moonbeam, the survivors' midnight rituals, and the "mysterious familiarity" phrasing trend toward ornamental lyricism rather than grounded consequence. Risk-taking in structure (accumulative layering, lyric compression) is present but does not fully cohere at closure, limiting the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elira is present throughout and her choices (pirouette to trigger vents, roll dice to purge locks, dance to collapse mainframe) drive beats. However, these are procedural executions of a plan formed off-page across "seven lunar cycles"; no on-page decision alters tactics or stakes. The choice not to board the submersible arrives in the final third without setup, and her "final dance" collapses the lab through asserted harmony rather than visible tradeoff. She is observation-with-action more than decision-under-pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The hangman's dice appear in three distinct beats: tucked in her belt pouch (paragraph 4), rolled across the mainframe (paragraph 10), and placed on the console for the final dance (paragraph 17). Each use escalates function—from relic to key to encryption catalyst—and the glyphs' mechanics (dissolve locks, purge cores, awaken submersibles) shape the liberation attempt. They are signaled early, causally active in the middle, and present at closure, satisfying all three gates. However, the dice resolve problems (biometric locks, memory cores) they did not help create, and their "trembling" at the end is told atmosphere rather than dramatized consequence, capping the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Calm defiance shapes Elira's tactics on the page: she moves "not with urgency, but with the slow certainty of a spider," pirouettes through the reactor to mislead rather than confront, and her "mastery of timing" replaces spectacle-rebellion. The concept is signaled early ("calm defiance—not shouted, not shattered, but radiating"), recurs in the procedural beats (coolant redirection, dice-rolling as patience), and charges the final image where she "vanishes—not dead, not gone, but rewritten." However, the concept is declared more than tested; no moment forces her to choose between calm and urgency, defiance and surrender, with visible cost. It themes the piece without constraining a choice.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Dance as explanation is signaled early ("she danced—a silent ballet...translating pressure gradients and sonar echoes") and recurs across beats: the pirouette triggers coolant vents (paragraph 8), each step corresponds to a cipher (left heel unlocks archives, right wrist reroutes surveillance, paragraph 9), and the final dance encrypts her heartbeat into an algorithm that collapses the mainframe (paragraph 17). The attribute constrains her method—no spoken orders, no manual keypads—and the trade-off (legibility to Overseers vs. legibility to survivors) is implied in the washed-ashore notation. However, the mechanics are asserted ("not flourish—it was protocol") rather than shown failing or costing her time, and the dance never traps her in its own constraints, so the cost remains conceptual.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Liberation is the dominant stake from paragraph 1 ("lyrical code breaker") through the ending where survivors "felt...the mysterious familiarity of a freedom that had always been theirs." The action drives beats: journal entries map escape vectors (paragraph 6), the dice awaken evacuation submersibles (paragraph 10), the final dance collapses the Overseers' cipher (paragraph 17), and the capsules transmit the method to dry cities (paragraph 18–19). However, the liberation itself occurs off-page and in summary; we see Elira's preparation and encoding but not the survivors' escape or the Overseers' reaction. The action is essential but not fully dramatized at closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Coded journal entries are signaled early ("journaling in salt-resistant ink on polymer sheets, each entry a stanza in an unfolding algorithm," paragraph 6) and their function is specified: they map escape vectors, resistance nodes, and emotional coordinates. The method reappears in paragraph 9 ("Each step corresponded to a journal cipher") and at closure where the buoyant capsule contains "dance notation in mirrored stanzas, readable only when held to candlelight or moonbeam" (paragraph 15). The journals enable the transmission that charges the ending. However, we never see Elira write an entry in scene, and the mechanics (how ink maps vectors, how notation becomes actionable instruction) are told rather than demonstrated with cost or friction.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The sunken laboratory is signaled in the opening line and pressures every beat: corroded consoles limit access, the collapsed dome hides Elira from Overseer sensors (paragraph 8), coolant vents become tactical misdirection (paragraph 8), the fissure in the ceiling allows capsule launch (paragraph 15), and Bay Theta's docked submersibles are the escape mechanism (paragraph 10). The setting is not postcard; it supplies resources (vents, fissure, submersibles) and constraints (depth, temperature, corrosion) that alter Elira's tactics. The final image—water surging as veil, the lab exhaling—recharges the setting as encryption chamber rather than extraction site, satisfying closure linkage and causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The spider-web timeframe is invoked in paragraph 2 ("slow certainty of a spider spinning its web") and paragraph 12 ("moved as a spider spins its web: patient, inevitable"). However, this is metaphor for patience, not a dramatized ticking clock. "Seven lunar cycles submerged" (paragraph 6) establishes duration but not urgency, and the Overseer patrol (paragraph 8) passes without complication or time pressure. The final dance and collapse are not constrained by a deadline; Elira "turns back" (paragraph 16) at will. The timeframe describes her temperament but does not tighten decisions or alter tactics on the page.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The motivation is declared in paragraph 5 ("to encrypt vulnerability as strength, to weave fragility into cipher so potent that even collapse became a coded triumph") and the final journal entry (paragraph 15) echoes it ("Liberate not by force, but by resonance. Let them mistake your retreat for surrender"). However, the motivation is never dramatized through a choice where fragility and strength conflict with visible cost. Elira's "calm defiance" and procedural competence (vents, dice, dance) do not embody vulnerability; she executes a plan without struggle, doubt, or a moment where encryption fails or demands a trade-off. The desire is told and themed but not tested in friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mysterious familiarity is signaled in the opening ("phosphorescent algae," "static hymns," "tide-bound ghost") and sustained through lyric compression, elevated diction, and purposeful withholding of mechanics. The tone modulates slightly—intimate in the mother's lullaby (paragraph 11), procedural during the dice-roll (paragraph 10), reverent at closure ("survivors...felt...the mysterious familiarity," paragraph 19)—without breaking coherence. The final image reweights the tone: what was mysterious (glyphs, dance, silence) becomes familiar (rhythm, dice, freedom) for the survivors, charging the ending. However, the tone remains static across beats of varying pressure (patrol, dice, collapse), and the lyricism sometimes obscures causality (how dance triggers vents, how water "rewrites" Elira), preventing higher scores.</comment>
