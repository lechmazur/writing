<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The tracer's specialized expertise and persistent curiosity are established early, though her interiority relies heavily on exposition rather than contradictory impulses in scene. The girl's grief is embodied effectively through physical staging ("knees drawn to chest, eyes wide and unblinking"), but the tracer's emotional arc remains steady without internal friction. The final choice to guide the girl feels inevitable rather than wrought from competing needs. Backstory exposition about the parents' fire exceeds the allowance and flattens present tension.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration: the girl moves from paralyzed waiting to walking toward the exit, and the photograph's pulse calms—visible cost is the relinquishment of her vigil. The Drive Lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (atmosphere, rhythmic pulses, mist thinning) with a single meaningful deepening when the tracer kneels and offers the counter-pulse. Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraph. One substantive escalation when the tracer finds the girl and broadcasts the counter-pulse, though the turn feels more atmospheric than causally urgent.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The atrium is rendered with strong sensory specificity ("glass ceiling wept condensation," "lilies floated like surrendered hands") and the mist-clad twilight atmosphere is sustained throughout. Spatial choreography is clean: colonnade, toppled planter, fountain, exit sequence. The hearing aid and photograph function as micro-setting objects that charge the final moment when their pulses synchronize and "the mist thinned." The setting subtly mirrors the girl's entrapment and guides the tracer's search.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—freeing the girl from her haunted waiting—is signaled early and narrows once when the tracer finds her and chooses to kneel rather than pull. The syncopated pulse provides a coherent pressure thread, though the escalation is more atmospheric accumulation than a turn that forecloses options. Agency manifests as the tracer's choice to assure and the girl's choice to take her hand, but the cost (ending the vigil) is more stated than dramatized through resistance. No antagonist or secondary complication tests the commitment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Theme—love persists by changing frequency, and grief can be answered without rescue—emerges through the photograph's vibration, the hearing aid's counter-pulse, and the calm final image. The tracer's line "love doesn't die—it just changes frequency" borders on thematic statement but is grounded in the device mechanics. Incidental heroism is gestured at in the phrase "quiet, incidental heroism: the choice to kneel in the damp" but this meta-commentary replaces scene pressure. The ending offers resonance through the synchronized pulse and the mist thinning, though the moral is articulated rather than left implicit.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited on the tracer with consistent perceptual signature: she interprets pulses, recognizes "vulnerable voice, fractured by grief," and her vocabulary ("whisper-thin heartbeat," "syncopated ache") reflects her specialized training. Psychic distance is controlled; the girl's interiority remains opaque until her whispered line. The prose carries a distinct lyric texture ("boots whispering," "voice low as falling ash") that modulates appropriately under pressure. Dialogue is sparse and purposeful; the girl's "They told me to wait here" and the tracer's response feel natural and goal-driven.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies effectively and sensory detail is vivid, but overwriting clusters in the opening and closure: "mist-clad atrium," "marble veined with forgotten histories," "bruised twilight into liquid gold puddles," "voice low as falling ash" stack figurative language densely without pattern-teaching or cost. The phrase "vulnerable voice, fractured by grief, stranded between worlds" is a metaphor pile-up. "Quiet, incidental heroism: the choice to kneel in the damp, to tune broken devices, to assure a lost child she still mattered" is authorial summary that scaffolds theme rather than letting the scene stand. Minor filter-verb reliance ("She recognized," "She knew") in exposition. Information density is high in action beats but dips during thematic framing.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The contact-tracer-for-hearts premise is fresh and the hearing-aid pulse-tuning method is inventive, though the core emotional arc—helping a ghost-child let go—follows familiar contours. The specificity of the profession and the device mechanics elevate the material. The photograph as proof of love and the counter-pulse as assurance are purposeful rather than ornamental. The mist-thinning and pulse-calming closure feels earned in hindsight, though the thematic articulation ("love doesn't die—it just changes frequency") leans on articulation over implication. Risk-taking in the lyric register is partially offset by explanatory scaffolding.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The contact tracer is seeded in the title and opening, drives the search (tracking the pulse, following the rhythm deeper), makes the key choice to kneel and broadcast the counter-pulse rather than pull, and walks the girl to the exit. Her expertise and method shape every beat. The character's decision to assure rather than explain or rescue is the story's pivot. Removing this exact character would collapse the logic.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The photograph is introduced in the opening beat ("last photograph," two children beneath a willow), vibrates in her palm to guide tuning, is slid beside the girl as proof, and is tucked between them at the exit with its pulse "now calm, its echo finally at rest." It is handled in at least four distinct beats, its state changes causally (vibrating → calm), and it charges the closure. Swapping it for another object would require rewriting the proof-of-love logic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Incidental heroism is named explicitly in the penultimate paragraph ("quiet, incidental heroism: the choice to kneel in the damp...") but does not constrain tactics earlier. The tracer's choice to kneel rather than pull is quiet and unheroic in tenor, but the concept is asserted rather than dramatized through a tradeoff. Present and functional but could be removed with minor tonal edits.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Persistent curiosity is stated early ("She was persistently curious, not out of whimsy, but because unanswered echoes festered into hauntings") and motivates her to follow the pulse deeper, quickening her pace when the rhythm stutters. The trait enables the search but does not create visible friction or cost—no moment where curiosity conflicts with caution or safety. Functional in one key beat (following the pulse) but swappable with "diligent" or "driven."</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Assure" is the climactic action: the tracer broadcasts a counter-pulse and says "You're not alone," then tells the girl "They're not coming back" but "that doesn't mean you're forgotten." This direct assurance (not rescue, not explanation) is what allows the girl to place her palm over the tracer's and walk toward the exit. The pulse synchronizes after the assurance. Removing this action would leave the girl stranded. It defines the resolution.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The hearing aid is introduced early ("decades-old hearing aid, brass casing tarnished green, its battery long dead"), she presses it to her temple to tune the pulse, then activates it again to "broadcast" a counter-pulse "steady and warm, like a lullaby." The method is seeded, used twice with distinct functions (listen, then broadcast), and the broadcast is the mechanism that stills the girl. Specificity (brass, tarnished, battery dead, yet still functional for emotional frequencies) is high. Swapping it for a generic device would lose the textural resonance.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The mist-clad atrium at twilight is anchored in the opening line, provides spatial structure (glass ceiling, statues, fountain, colonnade, toppled planter, exit), and its mist thins at closure in direct response to the emotional shift. The twilight condensation and wet stone scent sustain atmosphere. The setting is not merely backdrop; the atrium is the meeting-place promised by the parents, which makes it the site of the girl's entrapment. Removing this exact setting would break the closure logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"When the dead call" appears on the envelope in the opening beat and frames the summons, but time does not tighten decisions thereafter. The story unfolds in a single continuous scene with no clock pressure or deadline. The phrase functions as thematic coloring rather than a tactical constraint. Present in setup and conceptually linked to closure (the dead have called and been answered), but replaceable with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Protecting vulnerable voices is stated early ("unanswered echoes festered into hauntings, and she'd seen too many souls fracture from listening to silence") and motivates the tracer to follow the pulse and kneel beside the girl. The desire is dramatized in her choice to broadcast rather than pull and her assurance "You're not alone." Friction is mild—no moment where protecting the girl costs the tracer safety or another goal. Present across two beats (following, assuring) and linked to closure, but the tradeoff is understated.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Reeling hush is sustained through diction ("boots whispering," "voice low as falling ash," "tears tracked silently," "around them, the mist thinned. The atrium sighed") and syntactic pacing (long, lyric sentences that breathe). The tone modulates subtly: opening wonder, mid-scene urgency ("quickened her pace"), then final calm ("pulse now calm, its echo finally at rest"). The hush charges the ending image when the mist thins and the pulse synchronizes without fanfare. Coherent and purposeful throughout.</comment>
