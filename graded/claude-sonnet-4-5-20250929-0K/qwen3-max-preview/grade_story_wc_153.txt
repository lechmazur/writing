<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The medium's interior state is embodied through physical action (pressing shard, walking deeper, tracing words), and the moonlight healing trait creates a visible cost (memory loss). However, the protagonist remains largely passive—spirits, moonlight, and the labyrinth act upon her rather than her making difficult choices that narrow options. The final "smile" feels asserted rather than earned through contradictory impulses wrestling in scene. Interiority occasionally drifts toward label-speak ("fierce tenderness" as a descriptor rather than embodied state).</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers images (shard, letters, leaf-windows, moonlight) toward a final reconfiguration. Orientation anchors who and where early, but "when" remains vague (night, but no prior situation or pressing clock). The closure—letters dissolving, shard planted, path revealed—offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise: options crystallized, cost felt in memory erasure), but the cost is told retrospectively ("each mended tear steals a memory") rather than dramatized in the ending beat. The causal chain is thin: moonlight heals, letters vanish, path appears—more sequential magic than because/therefore pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The mangrove labyrinth is rendered with vivid, purposeful detail: moss-slick roots, aerial roots tightening, branches curling, water pooled black. The leaf-windows are a memorable micro-setting that constrains action (she must lean close, trace words) and charges the final image (new droplets, messages rearranging). However, spatial choreography occasionally floats—her movement deeper is asserted rather than tracked through specific turns or distances. The setting does guide choice (roots trip her, branches part to reveal a path), pushing into the 7+ band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: "to stir the moment before deciding" and deliver the unsent apologies. One meaningful turn occurs when she places the letters and they dissolve, reconfiguring her stance from withholding to release. However, the escalation is gentle accumulation rather than tightening pressure—spirits sing, moonlight heals, messages appear, path opens—without a moment where her agency forecloses a live option with visible cost. The shard's planting and the smile suggest release, but the trade-off (memory vs. healing) is told, not tested in a pivotal choice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: apology, hesitation, moonlight healing at the cost of memory, the moment before deciding. The final messages ("Go gently. You are loved.") and the medium's smile offer a non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. The unsent letters' dissolution and the shard's planting reweight prior material with quiet resonance. Minor slip: "fierce tenderness" is stated twice as a thematic label rather than fully embodied in contradictory action, and the moonlight-memory cost is told rather than dramatized as a choice she makes in the ending.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited; perceptual signature is consistent (medium notices spirits, shard warmth, condensation words). Diction is elevated and lyric but remains coherent and voice-motivated throughout. The prose occasionally drifts into expository interiority ("This was the evocation: not a summoning of ghosts, but a reshaping of silence") that tells rather than trusts the image. Psychic distance is controlled; no head-hopping. Rhythm modulates purposefully, compressing in moments of action and expanding in reflection.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "She didn't read them again. She didn't need to." echoes structure without adding pressure; "not cryptically, not sadly, but with fierce tenderness" is a mechanical toggle. Figurative density is high throughout ("fingers around time," "threads of silver resolve," "seed of stone") without pattern-teaching or payoff, risking overwriting. Stock metaphors accumulate: "frozen regret," "drinking the sorrow like rain after drought." Pronoun references and tense remain stable. The loop and density issues prevent entry to 7.5+.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The combination of cryptic medium, mangrove labyrinth, singing spirits, and moonlight healing offers a rich synthesis, but the emotional arc (withheld apology → release through mystical aid) follows a familiar template. The leaf-windows as message surfaces are a fresh inflection. However, the resolution relies on convenient mystical mechanics (letters dissolve, path appears) rather than a non-obvious moral calculus or lived-detail transformation. The piece commits fully to its lyric premise but does not fundamentally surprise in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The cryptic medium is present throughout and her choices (kneeling, whispering, pressing shard, tracing words, placing letters, stepping onto new path) drive the sequence. However, most choices are ritual actions that unfold the mystical mechanics rather than creating sharp turns with visible trade-offs. She does not wrestle with contradictory impulses on the page; the spirits and moonlight guide her more than her decisions reshape the stakes. Two gates (setup, closure) are met; middle development is thin. Score reflects causal work across beats but limited agency-driven reversals.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The gargoyle's rainspout shard appears in three beats: clutched in palm (opening), pressed to chest (middle), and slipping into water (ending). Its properties evolve (cool → warm → living flesh) and it reacts to truth and sorrow, shaping the medium's tactics (she holds it while placing letters). All three gates met. However, its causal pressure is moderate—it absorbs hesitation and pulses, but does not constrain a pivotal choice with visible cost. The final planting charges the ending image but feels symbolic rather than irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Unsent letters are the core concept and dominant stake. They appear early (setup), are pulled out and held to moonlight (middle development), and dissolve at the ending (closure participation). Their presence shapes her journey and their release reweights the premise with felt cost (she lets go without reading). All three gates met. The letters' transformation (ink blurred by tears → glowing with release → dissolved into mist) drives the emotional arc. Cost is legible: she surrenders control without rereading, forecloses the option to hold on. Strong integration.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Heals in moonlight" is present (moonlight kisses her wounds, stitches fractures) and the cost is stated ("each mended tear steals a memory"). However, the healing is passive (moonlight acts upon her) and the memory-loss cost is told in exposition rather than dramatized in an on-page choice or visible consequence at the ending. She does not wrestle with the trade-off or lose a specific memory we witness. Setup and closure gates met (moonlight present at opening and ending), but middle development is thin. The trait constrains minimally; it explains her state rather than forcing a visible price.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Evoke" is signaled early ("not to summon, not to banish, but to evoke") and the action frames the entire sequence: she evokes the moment before deciding, stirring silence rather than summoning ghosts. The method shapes her tactics (she whispers, presses shard, traces words, reshapes silence). All three gates met. However, the evocation is more ritual unfolding than sharp turning point—it defines the mode but does not create a pivotal reversal with visible cost. The final reconfiguration ties to evocation but could be achieved with minor edits (e.g., "commune" or "witness"). Moderate causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Messages in condensation on windows (leaf-panes) appear in the middle (words bloom: "You could have stayed") and at the ending (new messages: "It's not too late," final message: "Go gently"). The method is signaled ("leaf-pane," "mist") and its mechanics matter: she must lean close, breath fogging the surface, and trace words, smudging "afraid" into "alive." This reshaping changes the spirits' songs and alters her stance. All three gates met. The method constrains action (she must interact with the leaves) and charges the ending image (final rearrangement). Strong integration with visible causal work.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The mangrove labyrinth is present throughout: moss-slick roots, aerial roots tightening, branches curling, water pooled black, oldest mangrove with bark like a face. The singing spirits inhabit it and respond to her actions (songs stutter, swell, fall silent). The setting constrains choice (roots trip her, branches slow her, labyrinth holds her) and supplies resources (leaf-windows, oldest mangrove as altar). At the ending, branches part to reveal a new path. All three gates met. The labyrinth is irreplaceable—its specific properties (roots, leaves, spirits) drive tactics and charge the final image. High integration.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"The space where an apology waits unspoken" is the conceptual timeframe, framed early ("Show me the space where an apology waits unspoken") and present at closure ("the moment before deciding" and "the moment she could still choose differently now"). However, it remains abstract—there is no ticking clock or urgency that tightens decisions. The timeframe is more thematic frame than tactical constraint. Setup and closure gates met; middle development is thin (the phrase recurs but does not alter tactics). The concept shapes the emotional arc but does not create visible pressure through time scarcity or a live deadline.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Motivation "to find the moment before deciding" is stated early and dramatized in her actions: she walks deeper seeking it, places letters, and finally opens her eyes to find it ("the moment she could still choose differently now"). The desire is coherent and the ending answers it with a visible choice (stepping onto the new path). Setup and closure gates met. However, the friction between wants and costs is told more than shown—she does not wrestle with contradictory impulses in scene. The motivation drives the arc but lacks on-page internal conflict that would elevate to 7.5+.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>"Fierce tenderness" is stated twice (moonlight "knit them closed with fierce tenderness"; final smile "with fierce tenderness, the kind that knows pain and chooses to cradle it anyway") and embodied in the ending image: she smiles through cost, the labyrinth exhales around her, and the final message ("Go gently. You are loved.") charges the tone. The tone is coherent through turns—spirits fall silent in reverence, moonlight stitches with both severity and care—and modulates with pressure. However, the phrase is used as a label rather than fully dramatized through contradictory action. All three gates met; tone charges the final image, reaching 7.0.</comment>
