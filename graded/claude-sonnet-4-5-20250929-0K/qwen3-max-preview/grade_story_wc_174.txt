<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The calligrapher's motivation is clear and his arc—from weaponizing aesthetics to embracing accountability—is dramatized through the story stick and puppet rehearsal. However, interiority leans heavily on abstract epiphany language ("half-lit epiphanies," "moral evasion") rather than embodied contradiction acting in scene. The final choice to return to Mira with a new show feels asserted more than earned by on-page micro-choices that foreclose a path with visible cost. Mira's accusation ("You make poison look like calligraphy") anchors the conflict effectively, but the protagonist's transformation occurs largely in reflective summary rather than through pressured decisions.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation is clear: who, where, and when anchor early. The story follows a single-POV reflective mode; the dominant stake (ethical accountability via storytelling) is signaled and the protagonist's decision to return to Mira with a new show provides a Charged Poise moment where options crystallize. However, the closure lacks visible cost—the protagonist's smile and earned serenity read as resolution without demonstrated sacrifice or foreclosed path. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, but the final image doesn't reweight prior material with undeniable pressure; instead it summarizes his transformation. The structure is reflective-led with ~40% backstory, which anchors to the present stick but doesn't generate on-page micro-choices that alter tactics.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The decommissioned radar dome is vivid and atmospheric ("skeletal ribs of Cold War machinery," "rivets into eyes, girders into grasping fingers"), and the story stick is handled across multiple beats with evolving meaning. The setting constrains the protagonist's solitary rehearsal and the candlelit shadows charge the final image. However, spatial choreography within the dome remains abstract—no tactile interaction with the curved walls or machinery that alters a choice. The seedy bars (The Rusty Needle, The Unreliable Narrator) are named but not dramatized on the page, reducing their impact to backstory color.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—ethical storytelling versus aesthetic evasion—is clear and sustained. The heated argument with Mira provides backstory pressure, and the protagonist's decision to return with a new show tightens options. However, escalation is largely reflective rather than dramatized: the turning point (the beer bottle thrown at the stage) is recounted in summary, not shown in scene. The final choice lacks a visible trade-off or cost; the protagonist's serenity feels awarded rather than fought for. Under an Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening is sufficient, but the on-page pressure doesn't narrow options or charge the final image with felt consequence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The theme—accountability in storytelling—emerges organically from the calligrapher's reflections and the Navajo elder's warning ("stories burn twice"). The motif of the story stick returns with shifted meaning at the end, and the puppet shows embody the theme through subversive truth-telling. However, the final epiphany ("ethical storytelling wasn't about purity, but accountability") is stated rather than dramatized, and the closing line ("The story wasn't over. It was just finally being told right.") edges into thematic summary. The piece resists easy morals but leans on the protagonist articulating the thesis rather than letting the image carry it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct and lyrical, with controlled diction ("velvet fog," "meteor hush") that suits the reflective calligrapher POV. Psychic distance is stable in first-person-limited past tense with brief present-moment anchors (tracing grooves, lighting candle). However, register occasionally drifts into elevated abstractions ("aestheticizing harm," "reversal through subversion") that feel more like prompt language than the character's lived idiom. The puppet monologue ("We don't break promises—we just rewrite the font") is sharp, but Mira's direct accusation is the only dialogue on the page, limiting voice distinction. No head-hopping or POV leakage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and figurative language is generally controlled, but several passages show template cadence and stock phrase reliance: "He'd learned to listen," "He'd penned wedding vows," "He'd take a popular myth" all open with identical stems across adjacent paragraphs. Metaphors are occasionally mixed ("stories burn twice" is vivid; "meteor hush" remains unexplained and tonally incongruous). The phrase "half-lit epiphanies" recurs as a label without dramatized specificity. Paraphrase loops appear in the opening ("not to escape, but to reverse... not of the fight, but of the stories"). Information density is moderate; several sentences ("Tonight, though, he practiced alone, rehearsing beneath...") compress transit effectively, but peak beats lean on summary rather than scene pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The combination of urbane calligrapher, subversive puppet shows, and ethical reckoning offers a fresh angle, and the decommissioned radar dome setting is specific and memorable. The Navajo story stick and the "half-lit epiphanies" concept aim for originality but risk abstraction; the moral calculus (accountability over purity) is thoughtful but not deeply surprising. The seedy-bar puppet shows and the beer-bottle moment gesture toward boldness, yet both remain backstory rather than on-page risk. The synthesis is coherent and the voice is distinct, but the arc follows a familiar redemption template (artist realizes he's complicit, commits to truth-telling) without a non-obvious turn that redefines the premise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The urbane calligrapher is present throughout and his final decision to return to Mira anchors closure. However, his choices on the page are limited: he traces grooves, lights a candle, whispers a line, picks up a puppet, and smiles. The key decision (creating the new show) happens off-page in the future tense. Most of his transformation is conveyed through reflective summary rather than pressured action. Present in all three gates (setup, middle reflection, ending decision), but the middle development is contemplative rather than choice-driven, and the ending announces intent rather than enacting consequence. Cap at ~4.6 for late-arriving agency; functional but not irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The campfire story stick appears in the opening beat (traced with "serene fingers"), anchors the Navajo elder's warning mid-story, and returns in the candlelit ending where its warmth grounds the protagonist's earned serenity. It participates in three distinct beats and its meaning evolves from compass to epiphany trigger to closure symbol. However, its physical properties remain static—no mechanical use or constraint that alters tactics. The stick's "charred grooves" and warmth are described but not handled in ways that narrow options or impose cost. Present at setup, middle, and payoff; shapes two beats (opening and ending) with thematic weight, but swappable with another talismanic object. Exceeds the two-gate minimum and benefits from charged reprise, landing in mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Half-lit epiphanies are named explicitly and illustrated ("flickering insights caught between shadow and flame") in the backstory reflection. The concept anchors the protagonist's realization three months prior and recurs in the candlelit present when he whispers his new insight. However, the epiphanies function as thematic label rather than dramatized stake: they describe his process but don't constrain on-page choices or shift tactics under pressure. Present in setup (explained early) and middle (the three-months-prior realization), with a nod at the ending beat, but no causal pressure. Functional theme echo but replaceable with "sudden insights" or "moral clarity" without breaking story logic. Two gates met (setup, middle) allow eligibility to ~6.0, but lack of causal work and ornamental final mention lower the score.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Uncommonly serene is attributed to the protagonist's fingers in the opening line and returns as "earned" serenity in the closing paragraph. The trait is mentioned but never tested or constrained: no moment where his serenity costs him an option or enables a difficult choice under pressure. The beer-bottle moment (he "didn't flinch") gestures toward serene composure, but it's recounted in backstory summary. Setup and payoff gates are met (opening and ending), but middle development is absent—no on-page action where serenity shapes tactics or forecloses a path. Swappable with "calm" or "composed" with minor edits. Cap at ~3.8 for missing middle development and label-only use.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The action "reverse" frames the protagonist's motivation and anchors his puppet-show method: he reverses myths, slogans, and soundbites through subversive performance. The concept appears early ("He'd come here not to escape, but to reverse the damage") and recurs in the dome rehearsal ("I reverse not to undo, but to reveal"). However, the reversal itself is described in backstory (the bar shows) rather than enacted on the page. The on-page action is reflection and preparation, not active reversal. Setup and middle gates met (early framing, mid-story elaboration), and the concept charges the protagonist's final declaration, but no on-page beat where reversal alters tactics or narrows options. Functional but largely thematic; could be replaced with "redeem" or "reframe" without breaking story logic. Lands in mid-5s for two-gate presence and thematic weight without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Subversive puppet shows in seedy bars are described in detail (The Rusty Needle, sock-puppet kings, button-eyed bureaucrats, the beer-bottle incident) and anchor the protagonist's method. The method is signaled early, elaborated in backstory, and the ending announces a new show for Mira. However, all performances occur off-page in backstory; the on-page action is solo rehearsal without audience or subversive interaction. The protagonist picks up a puppet and whispers a line, but no mechanics of subversion shape on-page tactics or choices. Setup and payoff gates met (early framing, ending announcement), but middle development is summary-only. Functional method but not enacted on the page. Cap at ~4.9 for two-gate presence without dramatized pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The decommissioned radar dome is vividly described (curved steel shell, skeletal ribs of Cold War machinery, rivets and girders) and grounds the protagonist's solitary rehearsal. The setting's hush and isolation support the reflective mode, and the candlelit shadows charge the final image. Setup and payoff gates are met (early anchor, ending candle scene). However, the dome's physical properties don't constrain or enable a choice: the protagonist could rehearse anywhere isolated. No middle beat where the environment alters tactics or supplies resources that affect outcome. Postcard-level description elevated by atmospheric detail and closure linkage, but no micro-setting pressure. Lands in mid-5s for two-gate presence and tonal contribution without causal work.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The timeframe "in the hush left behind by a heated argument" anchors the story's present moment and is referenced in the opening paragraph. The hush recurs as "meteor hush" in the closing beats. However, time itself doesn't tighten decisions or tactics: the protagonist has indefinite time in the dome, and no live clock or urgency presses his choices. The heated argument with Mira occurred off-page in the past; the present hush is atmospheric rather than pressurizing. Setup gate met (early framing), but middle development and payoff lack temporal constraint that alters moves. Swappable with "in the quiet after a fight" without structural impact. Cap at ~4.6 for missing middle development; functional framing but no causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The motivation "to explore ethical storytelling" is stated explicitly and drives the protagonist's puppet shows and his decision to return to Mira. The desire is signaled early, elaborated in the backstory reflection on moral evasion, and recurs in the closing realization about accountability. Setup, middle, and payoff gates are met. However, the motivation is told and reflected upon rather than dramatized in conflicted choices: the protagonist never faces a live on-page dilemma where ethical storytelling costs him something immediate. The heated argument with Mira provides backstory friction, but no present-tense trade-off between wants and costs. All three gates met allow eligibility above 6.0, but lack of on-page friction and choice-driven cost lowers the score. Lands in high-5s for presence across beats without dramatized pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>The tone "meteor hush" is invoked twice (implicit early in "the hush left behind by a heated argument" and explicit in the penultimate paragraph) and colors the reflective, suspended atmosphere. However, "meteor hush" remains an unexplained, somewhat incongruous phrase that doesn't modulate with pressure or charge the final image in a legible way. The tone is static—contemplative quiet throughout—without a purposeful shift or break that reweights the stake. Setup and payoff gates met (early atmospheric framing, late explicit mention), but middle development is absent and the tone doesn't constrain or enable a choice. Swappable with "deep silence" or "charged stillness" with minor edits. Cap at ~4.6 for missing middle development; functional mood but ornamental phrasing.</comment>
