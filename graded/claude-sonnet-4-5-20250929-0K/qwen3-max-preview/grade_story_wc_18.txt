<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The mirror maker's motivation is clear and her task-driven interiority is concrete ("dreams, like glass, reflect only when properly angled"), but internal contradiction is absent—she moves through her ritual without genuine struggle or competing impulses. The dream's descent feels passive rather than earned by her choices; it arrives because she breathes correctly, not because she wrestles with cost or risk. Embodied emotion is present in trembling hands and synchronized breath, but the protagonist never faces a moment where her wants conflict with her needs or where blind spots generate compounding mistakes. The final choice—pressing glass against the dream—lacks visible cost; the dream "did not resist" and simply flows in, undermining the weight of alteration.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (mirror maker, ruined orchard, fog-bound twilight) arrive early and remain stable. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: density increases through layered imagery (sextant fragments, frost glow, apple blossoms) and the cadence shifts at the dream's descent, reweighting the dominant stake with a final capture. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the mirror maker completes her craft, boundaries dissolve, and the fog thickens again, crystallizing her mastery with felt cost (finality: "no dream would dare flee from her again"). One persistent flaw: the dream's arrival and capture feel coincidental rather than motivated by the protagonist's earlier micro-choices, weakening causal texture even under an accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The ruined orchard—gnarled trees, thick fog, rust and wet bark—supplies vivid sensory anchors filtered through the mirror maker's craft-focused attention. The sextant fragments and obsidian glass function as micro-setting tools that constrain her method and charge the final image. Spatial choreography (circle of shards, dream alighting on a fragment, glass pressed to flank) remains clear across moves. The frost's glow and erupting apple blossoms tie environment to action, and the fog's thinning and re-thickening bookend the piece, making setting an active participant in closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—capturing the runaway dream—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs when the dream descends and the mirror maker must synchronize breath to draw it near, narrowing her tactical window. However, escalation is thin: the dream arrives without resistance, driven by "harmonic resonance" rather than protagonist struggle, and the final capture involves no reversal or trade-off. The resolution lacks visible cost; the mirror maker stands victorious, the fog returns, and no live option is foreclosed. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure accumulates through imagery but does not crystallize into a choice that tests commitment or forecloses a path with felt consequence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—boundaries between maker and made, memory and mirror, sleep and waking—emerges through concrete imagery (sextant's harmonic resonance, frost-glow blossoms, the dream flowing into obsidian glass) rather than direct statement. The mirror maker's recognition ("She had once been that child") and the dream's motivation (fleeing "the cage of becoming") ground the theme in specific experience. The final image—fog thickening again after the capture—offers a resonant, non-literal answer: mastery achieved, boundaries restored, isolation re-embraced. One slip: "Glass mountains" tone is asserted in exposition ("that was the tone she carried in her marrow") rather than fully dramatized through scene pressure, edging toward thematic statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on the mirror maker; perceptual signature (noticing rust, ozone, pulse rhythm, frost edges) is craft-specific and consistent. Diction is elevated and lyric ("opalescent," "shimmer of twilight frost," "glass mountains") with purposeful compression that teaches a pattern early. Two slips lower the score: (1) "Glass mountains—that was the tone she carried in her marrow" breaks into meta-commentary that explains rather than shows, and (2) the dream's interiority ("not in fear, but in curiosity") briefly violates POV distance, attributing certainty to a non-focalizer. Syntax and rhythm modulate effectively under pressure, and the piece avoids filter-verb stacks.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "The fog responded, thinning in concentric rings above her, revealing for the first time in centuries the bruised violet sky of true twilight"). However, three issues accumulate: (1) paraphrase loops across adjacent lines ("She did not chant. / She did not plead. / She breathed" reads as template cadence without adding pressure), (2) stock metaphors ("eyes like molten mercury," "wings of folded parchment") appear in a high-pressure beat without fresh inflection, and (3) the final paragraph's list-like transitions ("between maker and made, between astronomer's failure and artisan's triumph") feel mechanical rather than propulsive. These artifacts dull momentum in the closure sequence, triggering a −0.8 deduction and disallowing 9+ globally per artifact rules.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of mirror-making craft, dream-catching ritual, and broken astronomical tool offers a non-obvious premise. Specific details (synchronized breathing cadence "7-3-11," sextant shards as harmonic anchor, obsidian glass) ground the fantastical in tactile particulars. However, the emotional arc—artisan capturing elusive dream—echoes familiar craft-as-magic templates without fully transforming them through unexpected moral calculus or lived cost. The dream's willing surrender and the mirror maker's frictionless success reduce risk and specificity. Transformation test: the plot could function with different objects (nets, songs, mirrors) without fundamentally altering the emotional stakes, signaling mid-band originality.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The mirror maker initiates the breathing method, lays sextant fragments, and presses glass to the dream—three distinct beats. However, her "choices" are procedural rather than conflicted; the dream arrives because she breathes correctly, not because she wrestles with competing options or accepts a visible trade-off. Early signal (kneeling with task stated) +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure linkage (pressing glass) +1.0, but swappability (another artisan could execute the same steps) −0.6 and lack of causal pressure (no narrowed options) −0.8 place her mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The sextant appears in setup (traded for, laid in circle), development (shards vibrate and levitate, dream alights on largest fragment), and payoff (harmonic resonance draws the dream). Three beats +1.4, early signal +0.6, causal pressure (its "harmonic resonance" enables capture) +1.0, closure linkage +1.2. One friction: the mechanics of how broken brass produces "harmonic resonance" remain abstract, limiting irreplaceability −0.5; a tuning fork or bell might serve similarly. Still, the object drives two key beats and the ending depends on it.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Erasing boundaries" is named explicitly in exposition ("not to celestial navigation, but to erasing boundaries between what sleeps and what wakes") and echoed at closure ("boundaries dissolved: between maker and made..."), but it functions as thematic claim rather than on-page constraint. The mirror maker's actions do not dramatize a choice shaped by boundary-erasure; she simply completes a capture. Label-only −0.6, late thematic reprise without middle development −0.4, and swappability (the story could frame the task as "capturing essence" with minor edits) −0.6 keep this low.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Firmly grounded" is stated early ("The mirror maker was firmly grounded—not in denial of magic, but in reverence for its cost") but never constrains or enables an on-page action with visible trade-off. She performs a fantastical ritual without skepticism, hesitation, or cost tied to her groundedness. The trait exists as character label, not dramatized friction. Label-only −0.8, ornamental use −0.7, and missing middle development cap this at 3.4; brief lyric reprise (she "understood" theme) lifts it slightly to 3.8.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Recreate" is implied in her task ("to capture a runaway dream") and the final act of pressing glass to absorb the dream, but the verb "recreate" itself is not foregrounded as distinct from "capture" or "trap." The ending hinges on absorption, not re-creation. Two beats (breathing ritual, glass press) +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, early signal +0.5, but swappability (could substitute "contain" or "bind") −0.8 and summary-only ambiguity −0.4 place this mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Synchronized breathing is signaled early ("inhaling for seven counts, holding for three, exhaling for eleven"), used in the middle beat (frost pulses, shards vibrate), and reprised at closure ("With a final synchronized breath...she pressed the glass"). Three beats +1.4, early signal +0.7, causal pressure (the breathing cadence matches "the dream's last known frequency" and draws it near) +1.2, closure linkage +1.0. Specificity (exact counts) +0.5. Minor friction: the mechanics remain slightly abstract, but the method shapes every major move.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The ruined orchard supplies vivid anchors (gnarled trees, thick fog, rust/wet bark/ozone scent) and micro-setting (frost on grass, apple blossoms erupting). The fog thins to reveal twilight sky (middle development) and thickens again at closure, bookending the action. Early signal +0.7, two beats (fog thinning, blossoms) +0.9, closure participation (fog returns) +1.0, sensory specificity +0.6. One friction: the orchard does not constrain her method or force a tactical choice; she could perform the ritual elsewhere −0.6. Still, it charges the final image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Upon the shimmer of twilight frost" is signaled early and the piece unfolds in one continuous ritual window as twilight deepens. The frost pulses with her breath (middle beat) and the "bruised violet sky of true twilight" is revealed, anchoring temporal progression. Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, closure atmosphere (twilight into re-thickened fog) +0.8. However, no ticking clock or urgency tied to timeframe constrains her choices −0.5, and the ritual could occur at dawn or midnight with minor edits −0.6, capping around 5.9.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"To capture a runaway dream" is stated in the opening and drives all three beats (breathing, sextant layout, glass press). Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.2. Friction: the motivation is told ("Her hands...trembled...from the weight of her task") but not conflicted—she never hesitates, doubts her method, or faces a want-versus-cost trade-off. The dream arrives willingly, removing dramatized friction between desire and obstacle. Lack of on-page cost tied to motivation −0.9 keeps this mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Glass mountains" tone—sharp, luminous, refracting truth into brilliant facets—is named in exposition but enacted through diction ("opalescent," "prismatic shards," "obsidian glass," "shimmer of twilight frost") and the mirror maker's precise, reverent focus. The tone modulates from trembling weight to crystalline calm at closure. Two beats (diction cluster, closure calm) +0.9, closure charge (final image of fog thickening, mirror cradled) +1.2, early thematic anchor +0.6, specificity (glass/light imagery coheres) +0.7. One slip: the explicit gloss ("Glass mountains—that was the tone she carried") is meta-commentary −0.5, but overall coherence keeps this strong.</comment>
