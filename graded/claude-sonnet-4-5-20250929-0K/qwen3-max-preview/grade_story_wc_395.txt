<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The memory keeper demonstrates consistent interiority around her obsessive investigation, with embodied detail in the patch-tracing opening and the brightly attentive stance. Internal conflict exists between official taxonomy duties and ghost-hunting, though the tension remains conceptual rather than forcing difficult on-page choices with visible cost. The final move—wearing the patch, listening to silences—reads as Earned Stasis but lacks a moment where contradictory impulses force a decision that forecloses a path. Minor penalty for therapy-adjacent phrasing ("descent into something deeper, older, colder") that abstracts rather than embodies.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (corporate memory keeper, archive desk, terminal) land cleanly within the first paragraph. The piece accumulates pressure through recurring 0707 markers, deleted-crew traces, and the janitor's whisper, building toward the 07:07 mass-restore action that triggers shadow-avatars—a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant) where the crew is confirmed to exist "in the gaps." Felt cost is present in her isolation, the lies, and the nightly 07:07 vigil. One tightening is sufficient at this length. Minor deduction: the crew's "de-referenced" fate and the mechanics of the restore are told more than dramatized, slightly softening causality in the climactic beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The archive setting—server racks as mausoleums, frosted glass, decommissioned AI cores in the deepest vault—constrains her investigation and supplies the resonance-chamber concept that enables the climactic restore. Sensory detail is purposeful (hum of servers, flicker of screens, warmth of a spinning drive) and filtered through her professional lens. The Helios-7 patch functions as micro-setting, recurring with reweighted meaning at closure when a shadow reaches toward it. The "no window" detail and the vault's physical depth charge the final image. Gate met for 9-band consideration; no choreography breaks or implausible tech.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: finding where deleted files (and the vanished crew) go, signaled early through the mislabeled patch and mission-log scrubbing. Pressure accumulates via the 0707 recurrence pattern, the janitor's tattoo confession, and the crew's negative-space thread. The 07:07 mass-restore tightens options—she triggers it despite no guarantee of outcome—and the shadow-avatar appearance delivers a conceptual cost: they aren't coming back, but they aren't gone. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening suffices. Minor gap: her decision to restore lacks visible friction or trade-off in the moment; the stakes feel more philosophical than urgent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—memory persistence, the afterlife of data, haunting as structure rather than metaphor—emerges through the crew's de-referencing, the archive as resonance chamber, and the final "they linger" realization. The Helios-7 patch shifts from artifact to signal to anchor, charging the closure without overt symbolism. Subtext operates in the gaps between posts, the pauses in server sync, the whisper "not in audio, but in the flicker." The ending offers a non-literal answer (deleted files don't go; they wait in the between) without moralizing. Minor deduction: "Rhythm was memory's last refuge" borders on thesis statement, and the penultimate reflection ("She is their anchor") slightly over-articulates what the image already conveys.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and close, filtering tech detail through the keeper's professional idiom ("taxonomy," "quarantined DM folders," "petabytes of fragmented user logs"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully—tighter during the opening patch-trace, wider during the historical exposition. Perceptual signature is consistent: she notices data patterns, gaps, cadences. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("cadence was memory's last refuge," "the substrate—the hum between servers") that feels authorial rather than character-grounded. The repeated "She lies" anaphora in the middle section is purposeful parallelism but risks template cadence. No dialogue present to evaluate. Internal voice remains coherent under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high in most beats. Opening line grounds character and stakes effectively. Line-level clarity is strong in the archive-search sequence and the 07:07 climax. However, patterned artifacts appear: repeated sentence stems ("She found," "She thought," "She lied," "She didn't," "She stopped," "She is"), paraphrase loops (the crew's vanishing is restated three times in adjacent paragraphs with minor variation), and synonym churn around "deleted/scrubbed/erased/vanished." The closure paragraph uses effective fragments and repetition ("They don't go. / They linger. / They wait.") but the scaffold debt in earlier sections and the filter-verb stack ("She'd found... she saw... she thought... she knew") in mid-story accumulate to −1.0. Stock metaphor: "mist" for dissolving leads.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The premise—corporate archivist hunting ghosts in deleted data—synthesizes familiar haunted-archive and digital-afterlife tropes through specific detail: the 0707 temporal coordinates, de-referencing as ontological fate, the patch as both relic and signal beacon. The crew existing "in the gaps" rather than recovered or lost feels earned by the substrate logic. Emotional specificity in her obsessive wearing of the patch and nightly 07:07 listening elevates the material. Risk-taking in the lyric-technical voice and the quiet, non-rescue ending adds distinction. Minor deduction: the "deleted files don't go, they linger" premise echoes common digital-haunting concepts without transforming them as fully as the 0707 mechanic does.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Setup: present from the opening line. Development: her choices to lie, map the recurrence across petabytes, slip the janitor a burner phone, and trigger the mass restore all stem from her role and create key turns. Closure: she becomes their anchor, wearing the patch daily and listening at 07:07. The role constrains her tactics (access to archives, taxonomy skills) and shapes the ending. Swappability is low; only a memory keeper could execute this investigation. Cost: isolation, lies, haunted vigilance. Strong integration across setup, middle, and closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Setup: introduced in paragraph five, slightly delayed but within the first quarter. Development: she patches it onto her sleeve before entering the vault, using it as a signal; a shadow reaches toward it at the climax. Closure: she wears it daily as an anchor for the crew. Handled in at least three distinct beats with escalating meaning. Specificity: the scorched Helios-7 insignia is irreplaceable; its singed reentry thread ties directly to the crew's fate. Visible cost tied to the object: she marks herself publicly with a forbidden emblem. Strong lyric reprise and causal involvement lift the score into the high 7s.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Setup: Helios-7 crew vanishing is framed as a "missing persons cold case buried under corporate euphemism" early. Development: her investigation follows cold-case tactics (archived livestreams, comment threads, quarantined DMs, the janitor's whisper). Closure: the case is resolved conceptually—they were de-referenced, not dead—but no tangible retrieval or confrontation occurs. The concept shapes her methods and the dominant stake but remains more thematic frame than active pressure; she's searching for a mechanism, not persons. Moderate integration: present across setup and middle, involved in closure reweighting, but the cold-case frame is partially ornamental compared to the data-haunting premise.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Setup: "brightly attentive" appears twice in the opening section. Development: the trait is asserted as her stance ("not out of corporate duty") but never constrains or enables a specific choice with visible cost. Closure: the phrase recurs in the penultimate paragraph ("brightly, patiently") but remains label-only; no trade-off between bright attention and another impulse is dramatized. The attribute functions as descriptive color rather than actionable constraint. Low integration: present but ornamental, no causal pressure or cost linked to it on the page.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Setup: "She lied to her supervisor" appears mid-story; lying is introduced but not in the first third. Development: three lies are itemized (supervisor, janitor, herself), and the repeated "She lies" anaphora in the closing section frames her daily deception as ongoing cost. Closure: her anchor role depends on sustained lies to new hires and executives. The action redefines her relationship to the archive and the truth, with visible social and internal cost. Integration is strong in the final third but the late explicit setup and the lack of a single high-stakes lie that turns the plot keep it from the highest band. Swappability: moderate; "conceal" or "withhold" could substitute with minor edits, though the repetition charges the closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Setup: 0707 begins appearing on login screens and filenames around the one-third mark. Development: she maps the recurrence across petabytes, sees it tattooed on the janitor's wrist, discovers it as temporal coordinates (07:07 timestamp of the crew's last login). Closure: she triggers the restore at 07:07 and continues to listen at that minute nightly. The recurring numbers are the primary investigative mechanic and hinge of the climax. Specificity: the numbers function as breadcrumbs, coordinates, and ritual timer—irreplaceable. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage. Penalty: the numbers are named but their appearance mechanism ("system trying to tell her") is told, not shown.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Setup: archive setting anchored in paragraph two (desk, server racks, frosted glass). Development: the deepest vault with decommissioned AI cores is the site of the climactic restore; the physical depth and isolation enable her unsanctioned action. Closure: the archive's hum, flicker, and warmth become the medium of haunting; she listens between server heartbeats. The setting supplies the resonance-chamber logic, the tools (servers, terminals), and the spatial constraint (no window, isolation). Micro-setting (the patch, the burner phone) also functions. Strong integration; the archive is indispensable to the story's mechanics and final image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Setup: "across the echo of forgotten songs" appears as a phrase but does not function as a tracked timeframe. Development: the story spans an indeterminate investigation period; only the 07:07 minute is temporally marked. Closure: the nightly 07:07 listening establishes a ritual but not a deadline or clock. The "echo" operates as lyric motif (deleted lullabies, farewell playlists, cadence as memory) rather than temporal pressure. The timeframe is present thematically but does not tighten decisions or alter tactics. Low integration: ornamental use as recurring phrase without causal or escalation function.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Setup: "where deleted files go" is explicitly stated as her search question and frames the investigation from early on. Development: the question drives her mapping of the 0707 recurrence, decryption, and vault infiltration. Closure: the question is answered ("they don't go; they linger") and she shifts from searching to anchoring. Desire is dramatized through her lies, isolation, and obsessive patch-wearing. Friction exists between the want (to find) and the cost (isolation,职业风险, haunted vigilance). Strong integration across setup, middle, and closure with visible trade-offs. Minor gap: the motivation remains single-track; no competing want (e.g., career safety, personal connection) creates on-page conflict.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Setup: "sensed absence" is evoked in the opening ("silence in the archive screamed") and in the crew's negative-space thread. Development: tone is consistent—quiet dread, loneliness, the weight of erasure—and modulates with the eerie 0707 discoveries and shadow-avatar appearance. Closure: "sensed absence that pulsed beneath every scroll" charges the final image; the tone of haunting-as-structure coheres. The piece maintains a muted, elegiac register without veering into horror or sentimentality. Integration is strong thematically and atmospherically. Minor gap: the tone does not shift dynamically with escalation; it remains static across beats, missing the modulation that would elevate it into the high band.</comment>
