<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The tutor's internal journey from exile to self-forgiveness is traced through embodied detail—fidgeting fingers, tracing phantom boards—and her micro-choices (kneeling, winnowing, tracing fog) show contradictory impulses under pressure. The mirror confrontation earns the shift from self-punishment to acceptance, with "I see you" carrying visible cost. However, interiority occasionally drifts into therapy-speak ("winnowing the past until only truth remained") and the pupil's shattering is told rather than dramatized, reducing the felt weight of her original transgression.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes an accumulative/textural lens early (frozen village, platinum labyrinth, compressed silence) and delivers Resonant Reconfiguration at closure: the mirror dissolves into acceptance, tapestries reknit, and the village exhales. Causality is clear—her decoding work releases the woven hush—and the cost (exile remains irrelevant, not revoked) is legible on the page. Orientation anchors are present by the second paragraph. One weakness: the labyrinth's mechanics (how winnowing frayed threads unlocks time) remain abstract, relying on metaphor over concrete action.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The time-frozen village and platinum labyrinth ground the action with vivid particulars: cobblestones holding breath, tapestries with dangling threads, tarnished silver mirror. The tutor's interaction with the tapestry border (kneeling, tracing threads) constrains her choices and the mirror charges the final image. Spatial choreography inside the labyrinth is coherent (corridors, turns, heart). Minor gap: the village's thaw (leaves stir, coin clinks) lacks specificity about how her work causally triggers the release.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—self-forgiveness—is signaled in the third paragraph and coheres through the labyrinth trial. Pressure accumulates via the tapestries (each thread echoing her own unspoken regrets), then tightens at the mirror where she must confront her past self. The final choice ("I see you" instead of turning away) forecloses the path of self-punishment with visible cost: exile becomes "irrelevant" rather than revoked, an earned endurance. Agency is present in every winnowing choice. No antagonist is required; the woven hush and her own ghost provide sufficient opposition.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars—frayed threads, the boy she broke, the mirror's fog—without thesis statements. The final image (walking through rain, carrying truth lightly) offers a resonant answer to the forgiveness question without moralizing. The tapestries' reknitting "stronger at the broken places" risks cliché but is earned by prior winnowing work. One slip: "Forgiveness had not come from decree or deed, but from winnowing the past until only truth remained" edges toward thematic echo in the penultimate beat, though it stops short of sermon.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable and close to the tutor's perceptual signature: chess metaphors (gambits, feints, traps), phantom boards, pattern recognition. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (tight at the mirror, wider during village description). Occasional filter-verb stacks ("she sought," "she paused," "she stepped") in mid-pressure beats slightly dull immediacy. Diction is mostly character-appropriate, though "woven hush" and "winnowing" feel imposed by prompt rather than organically voiced. No dialogue to assess.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose is mostly clean with strong imagery ("breath-fog," "hollow-cheeked, trembling, eyes glazed with triumph that tasted like ash"). Rhythm varies and information density is high. However, paraphrase loops appear: "not for redemption, but for forgiveness—not from others, but from the ghost she carried inside" and "not by shifting, but by softening" create template cadence. The phrase "woven hush" is repeated without evolving meaning (−0.3). "Not…but" constructions recur four times, flattening syntactic variety. Final image is strong but the penultimate paragraph over-explains the transformation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The chess-tutor-seeks-forgiveness frame is familiar, but the platinum labyrinth with time-frozen village and the tactile method (decoding frayed tapestry threads) offer fresh angles. The mirror confrontation avoids the expected shattering or clearing, instead dissolving fog into acceptance—a non-obvious choice. Emotional specificity (tracing air as if resetting invisible pieces, the boy shattered under ambition) grounds the abstract stakes. Risk-taking is moderate; the piece commits to its lyric-metaphorical mode but does not venture beyond elevated literary fantasy conventions.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The exiled chess tutor drives every major turn: entering the labyrinth (setup), winnowing threads at the tapestry (middle development), and tracing "I see you" on the mirror (closure participation). Her chess training shapes her perception ("Each turn in the labyrinth mirrored a gambit she'd once taught") and her choices (kneeling, decoding, stepping forward) carry visible cost. The element is irreplaceable; removing "chess tutor" would break the pattern-recognition mechanics and the thematic link between her teaching failure and her labyrinth tactics. Three beats, strong causal pressure, closure linkage, cost connection present.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The platinum labyrinth appears in setup (village square), shapes middle choices (corridors mirroring gambits, tapestries on walls), and houses the closure beat (mirror at its heart). Its metallic walls "soften" and "warm" in response to her resolve, a charged reprise. The labyrinth's purpose shifts from trial to testament in the final third, reweighting its meaning. Removing it would collapse the spatial structure and the metaphor of navigating her own mind. Three distinct beats, closure linkage, specificity (platinum, not generic stone), cost embodied in its resistance then yielding.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The woven hush is seeded early ("silence of woven hush," "held sigh of children mid-laugh") and explicitly drives the middle action: she winnows to decode "fragments" whispered by unraveling threads, and the hush "thickens" as pressure. At closure, "the woven hush lifted—not shattered, but shared" as the village exhales, reweighting the concept from constraint to communion. However, its mechanics remain abstract—how silence is literally woven, or how her decoding releases it, is never concretized. Two beats (middle accumulation, ending release), closure linkage present, but swappable with "trapped silence" or similar. Cost connection weak.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Fidgets productively" appears in the second paragraph (brushing dust, adjusting satchel, tracing air) as character texture but does not constrain or enable a key turn. The trait signals her restless pattern-seeking mind, which matters thematically, but the actual fidgeting behavior disappears after setup—at the tapestry and mirror, her fingers "tremble" from recognition, not fidget. The ending notes she is "no longer fidgeting," a lyric callback that reweights the trait slightly. One beat (setup), weak reprise, no middle development, ornamental role. Swappable with any nervous habit.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Winnow" is introduced at the tapestry beat ("she began to winnow—not with hands alone, but with mind attuned to tension"), drives the middle section (separating grief from guilt, intention from impact), and is referenced at closure ("winnowing the past until only truth remained"). The action is specific to her chess training (pattern recognition, elimination) and irreplaceable: swapping "winnow" for "decode" or "unravel" would lose the grain-from-chaff precision that links her method to forgiveness. Two beats (tapestry work, final realization), causal pressure strong, closure participation clear. Minor weakness: the final mention is told rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Decoding frayed threads is seeded at the first tapestry ("threads dangled like unfinished thoughts"), executed in the middle ("she decoded frayed threads in the tapestry's border, each unraveling whispering a fragment"), and pays off when "threads reknit themselves along the borders" after the mirror moment. The method is specific and chess-adjacent (pattern recognition), irreplaceable, and causally linked to the village's release. Three beats (signal, execution, payoff), strong causal pressure, closure participation via the reknitting image. Cost visible: her own frayed regrets force painful recognition before the threads mend.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The time-frozen village frames the story (opening and closing images) and provides the labyrinth's stakes: releasing the "suspended sorrow" restores motion. Its stillness (cobblestones holding breath, shop signs mid-sway) creates atmosphere and the thaw (leaves stir, coin clinks, children chase puddles) signals closure success. However, the village does not constrain her choices inside the labyrinth—she could complete the trial anywhere. Setup strong, closure participation strong, but no middle development where the village's frozen state alters her tactics. Two of three gates, lyric reprise reweights the stake moderately.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"During the lull of distant thunder" appears in the opening line and recurs once mid-story ("Thunder rumbled again, far off—a reminder that time outside still moved"). The timeframe creates mood but does not tighten decisions or alter tactics; the tutor's labyrinth work proceeds without urgency tied to the lull ending. At closure, rain begins, a weather shift rather than a time constraint paying off. Setup present, no middle development where the lull pressures her choices, weak closure link (rain is consequence, not clock). Swappable with any atmospheric frame.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Self-forgiveness is seeded in the third paragraph ("not for redemption, but for forgiveness…from the ghost she carried inside"), dramatized through every labyrinth beat (her trembling recognition, "Every thread she traced echoed her own"), and crystallizes at the mirror when she writes "I see you" instead of striking or fleeing. The motivation is conflicted (she seeks absolution "in the only language she trusted" yet must abandon that language to succeed) and costly (exile remains, she carries truth "lightly" but carries it). Three beats, strong causal pressure, closure participation unmistakable, visible cost. The final articulation ("Forgiveness had not come from decree or deed, but from winnowing") slightly over-explains but does not break the motivation's integrity.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Fierce repose is sustained through controlled paradox: "fingers fidgeted productively," "woven hush" (presence compressed, not absence), "no longer fidgeting…just walking, steady," and the ending's "gentle, patient" rain after the labyrinth's metallic cold. Tone modulates with pressure—tight and coiled at the mirror, exhaling at closure—without breaking the contemplative frame. The final image ("choosing to carry it lightly") charges the tone's core tension between fierce recognition and restful acceptance. One slip: "shrieks of delight" in the penultimate paragraph tilts slightly out of the established repose. Coherent through turns, modulates under pressure, charges the ending.</comment>
