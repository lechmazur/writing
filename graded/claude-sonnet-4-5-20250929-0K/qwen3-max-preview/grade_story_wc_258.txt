<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The cartomancer is established through concrete, embodied detail—stained fingers, methodical work rhythms, measuring gestures—and her curiosity drives her systematic approach to mapping cultural fragments. However, her motivation remains largely asserted rather than tested under pressure; she never faces a choice that costs her something or forces a meaningful internal contradiction. The visitor at the end arrives to observe, not to challenge, so the protagonist's agency never crystallizes into a decision that forecloses a path. The final act of unspooling the measuring tape reads as continuation rather than transformation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors—who, where, when—arrive within the opening paragraph ("onyx-ink cartomancer," "rain-beaded skylight loft," "after the cryptocurrency crashes"). The accumulative/textural lens is taught through layered images (cards, measuring tape, journal, maps) and a pattern of observation-cataloging-connection that builds density. Closure registers as Resonant Reconfiguration: the visitor's line "remembering forward" reweights the cartomancer's labor, and the measuring tape's final unspooling signals Charged Poise. Cost is felt conceptually—the endless, solitary labor mapped across pinned constellations—but the ending does not foreclose a path or impose a visible trade-off, which limits the sharpness of the closure effect.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The skylight loft is established early through rain glyphs, corkboards, shoeboxes, and drafting table; these anchors remain stable and return with purpose (vellum sheet, pinned maps, the tea offered to the visitor). The measuring tape functions as micro-setting, constraining her methodology and charging the final image. Thunder, rain intensity, and dawn's arrival modulate atmosphere in step with the cartomancer's progression from solo labor to shared recognition. The old stock exchange and university locations pressure the cultural mapping but remain off-stage; the loft itself does not force a tactical choice, which caps the band slightly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—mapping cultural patterns after systemic collapse—is signaled early and sustained through each beat (cards, measuring tape, journal, convergence points, visitor exchange). Pressure accumulates via density increase: from solo observation to pattern emergence (phoenix stencil, chalk equations) to the visitor's articulation. However, escalation is textural rather than oppositional; no reversal narrows options or forces a trade-off. The cartomancer's stance deepens but does not crystallize under duress, and the visitor's arrival affirms rather than tests her work, which limits the felt stakes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—resilience and cultural recomposition after collapse—emerges through concrete particulars: broken QR codes reborn as phoenix, foreclosure notices painted over with constellations, the phrase "We remember how to share." The visitor's line "remembering forward" reweights the premise without stating a moral, and the cartomancer's ledger/measuring metaphor carries the piece's inquiry into how symbols rebuild what numbers destroyed. The final pinned map offers a resonant image of scaffolding rising "brick by symbolic brick." Minor thematic echo risk in "They're remembering forward" hovers near prompt-thesis territory but is rescued by the concrete image work surrounding it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable; focalization through the cartomancer's perceptual signature (onyx ink, measuring metaphors, "emotional temperature") is distinct and sustained. Distance is controlled, and the visitor's brief dialogue introduces voice distinction without head-hopping. Diction is consistent, blending lyric texture ("liquid runes," "cathedral of collated whispers") with methodical precision. However, several beats drift toward over-wrought figurative density ("metallic tongue coiled like a dormant serpent," "forgotten bassline") that risks obscuring immediacy, and filter verbs ("began to see," "began sketching") accumulate in the second half without clear voice motivation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Figurative language is dense and often precise ("onyx-ink," "rain-beaded," "liquid runes") but in several high-pressure beats—the convergence-point discovery, the visitor exchange—metaphors stack without clear propulsion: "algorithms once screamed," "cathedral of collated whispers," "emotional payload," "dormant serpent." These compress clarity rather than sharpening it. Minor paraphrase loop between "shared glances" and "gestures" and between "emotional resonance logged" and "emotional temperature." Sentence openings vary, but rhythm flattens in the middle third with repeated "She [verb]" stems across four consecutive paragraphs. The Cost Proof Test is marginal: the cartomancer's solitary labor and the ledger's weight suggest cost, but no specific sentence in the closure unit makes sacrifice or foreclosure legible.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The premise—post-collapse cultural cartography via fragments and measuring tape—offers a fresh synthesis of archival obsession and symbolic archaeology. The measuring tape's non-standard use (quantifying meme virality vs. irony depth) feels specific and earned. However, the emotional arc follows a familiar template: solitary expert validates her fringe method through an affirming visitor. The visitor's arrival lacks friction; their immediate alignment ("remembering forward") resolves too smoothly. The phoenix-from-QR-codes and chalk-equations images are vivid but hover near stock resilience iconography without further complication. Risk-taking in lyric density is present but does not fully transform the underlying observer-validation structure.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The cartomancer is present throughout, framing the piece and driving observation, cataloging, and pattern-recognition across multiple beats. Her choices—shuffling cards, measuring distances, confiding in her journal, pinning maps, offering tea, unspooling the tape at the end—shape the story's rhythm and closure image. However, these are continuations of her established method rather than decisions that narrow options or impose visible cost. The visitor exchange is observation-sharing, not a turn that tests her commitment. The cartomancer's agency is methodical but not conflicted, placing her in the mid-5s: causal involvement across beats but no pivotal decision that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The measuring tape appears in the first third ("beside her drafting table"), is used to quantify meme virality vs. irony and to measure distance "not in miles, but in shared hashtags," and returns in the closure ("unspooled her measuring tape one more time"). It constrains her methodology and charges the final image with continuity and precision. However, its mechanics are more metaphorical than tactical; it does not enable a specific on-page choice that alters outcome. Three beats with a charged reprise earn mid-6s, but the lack of a decision-forcing moment or visible cost tied directly to the tape caps the score.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Reverse engineering is signaled early ("dismantling cultural artifacts to find the blueprints beneath") and enacted on the page: the cartomancer cross-references symbols, multiplies paths via overlays, and traces structural assembly of hope and rage. The concept shapes her tactics (measuring, overlaying trajectories, sketching connections) and underpins the closure's "scaffolding as it rose" metaphor. However, the concept is more method than stake; it does not create friction or impose a choice with cost. It appears in setup, development (pattern emergence), and closure metaphor, meeting three gates, but its causal pressure is descriptive rather than constraining, placing it in the lower 6s.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Steadily curious is asserted twice ("Steadily curious, she never rushed," "her curiosity never sated but always steady") and demonstrated through methodical pacing—study, cross-reference, logging, measuring—across every beat. The trait constrains her tempo (no rushing) and enables persistence (working alone through dawn). However, it does not create visible cost or a trade-off on the page; her curiosity is uncontested and frictionless. The attribute is consistent and present in closure (steady drip metaphor) but label-heavy and does not force a decision, placing it in the mid-5s for functional but replaceable integration.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The confide action occurs mid-story when the cartomancer writes in her journal: "I think they're rebuilding in symbols now." This beat crystallizes her emerging thesis and pivots the narrative from data collection to pattern recognition, directly enabling the convergence-point discovery that follows. The visitor later echoes this insight ("remembering forward"), creating a reprise that charges closure. The action is causally essential to the story's turn from observation to articulation and appears in both development and closure, but it does not impose cost or foreclose a path, capping it in the upper 6s.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Multiplying paths is signaled early ("overlaying trajectories of graffiti migrations, protest routes, and viral dance challenges") and demonstrated on the page: the cartomancer cross-references twelve cards, measures distances in shared hashtags and replicated brushstrokes, and sketches connections onto vellum. This method enables the convergence-point discovery (phoenix stencil, chalk equations) and structures the story's escalation from fragments to pattern. It appears in setup (measuring width vs. depth), development (overlaying trajectories), and closure (pinned constellation map). The method constrains her approach and charges the ending, but does not impose a specific cost, placing it in the low 7s.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The rain-beaded skylight loft is established in the opening line and sustained through corkboards, shoeboxes, drafting table, vellum, and tea. Rain intensity modulates atmosphere (thunder, drumming, dawn), and the loft's spatial layout remains coherent. The setting enables her solitary method and houses the visitor exchange. However, it does not pressure a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome; it is backdrop rather than constraint. The loft appears in setup, development, and closure (pinned map, narrow stairs), meeting three gates, but its causal role is atmospheric, placing it in the low 6s.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The cryptocurrency crashes are established as backstory context ("not since the cryptocurrency crashes had hollowed out the financial district") and inform the thematic premise (collapse of number-based systems). The timeframe shapes the world's silence and the cartomancer's motivation (mapping after systemic failure), and off-stage details (bank closures, phoenix stencil timing) reference the ongoing aftermath. However, time does not tighten on-page decisions; the cartomancer works "steadily" without deadline or urgency, and the visitor's arrival is untimed. The timeframe is present in setup and thematically linked to closure but does not alter tactics, capping it in the mid-4s.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>To map cultural patterns is stated early ("Her motivation wasn't profit or prophecy—it was to map") and dramatized through every beat: shuffling fragments, measuring, logging, journaling, overlaying trajectories, pinning maps. The motivation drives her solitary labor and shapes the closure (pinned constellation, unspooling tape). However, it is never conflicted or tested; no want-versus-fear friction appears, and no cost is paid to pursue it. The motivation is omnipresent and essential to the story's design, but its frictionless execution caps it in the mid-6s: causal across beats, but told more than it is contested.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Inherited mystery is established through the opening's "liquid runes," "silence where algorithms once screamed," and "cathedral of collated whispers," then sustained via "latent meaning," "mythologies whispered into existence," and the phoenix/chalk-equation discoveries. Tone modulates with pressure: contemplative during solo work, intensifying with thunder and convergence, easing into recognition at dawn and the visitor exchange. The tone charges the final image (constellation, unspooled tape) and coheres across turns without static monotony. It appears in setup, development, and closure, shaping the story's texture and supporting thematic resonance, placing it at the lower edge of the 7s.</comment>
