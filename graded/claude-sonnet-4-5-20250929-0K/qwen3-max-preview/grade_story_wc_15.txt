<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The weaver remains more archetype than individual—her interior life consists of poetic declarations rather than contradictory impulses under pressure. No meaningful choice occurs on the page; she performs a ritual of mending without genuine struggle, cost, or foreclosed alternatives. The "hauntingly optimistic" label is asserted but never embodied in a micro-choice that reveals hierarchy of values. Emotions are named ("stubborn hope") rather than shown through embodied contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density of imagery meant to reweight the dominant stake. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within acceptable range. The closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration via the plate's transformation and the weaver's vow to return, but no visible cost appears on the page—the plate "warmed," "pulsed," succeeds without trade-off or forfeiture. The final paragraphs summarize future intent ("she would return tomorrow") rather than landing a decisive present-moment change or charged poise with felt price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The canyon labyrinth is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (dust that "tasted of forgotten hymns," walls that "curved inward like cupped palms"). The setting does not constrain a choice or meaningfully alter tactics—it serves as atmospheric backdrop. The plate as micro-object returns with reweighted meaning in the final image, lifting the score, but the environment itself remains postcard-level rather than pressure-shaping.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—mending the plate to honor breakage—is signaled early but never faces opposition or cost. No reversal or tightening occurs; the weaver kneels, sews, succeeds without friction. The resolution is achieved by solo ritual with no trade-off, forfeiture, or tactical adjustment under pressure. Accumulative lens allows for deepening via density, but the final act does not foreclose a path or demonstrate visible price paid.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Theme of transformation-through-repair emerges clearly from imagery and the plate's arc. The final image (stars rearranged as grandmother's loom, child stepping out with storm) offers symbolic resonance but edges toward overt allegory. "Broken precedents" and the closing moral ("even shattered things hold the map to their own becoming") veer into direct thesis statement rather than letting particulars speak. The penultimate paragraph's explicit theme summary ("she sewed not to fix the world, but to remind it…") functions as sermonizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited with lyric compression throughout. Diction is elevated and uniform—"moon-pale intuition," "ghost of salt," "cathedral"—without modulation under pressure or perceptual signature specific to the weaver's trade or lineage. The prose reads as a single poetic register rather than reflecting the character's mind under stress. Purposeful lyricism is taught early, but the lack of variance or embodied POV texture in peak beats (the sewing itself) limits band entry.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Figurative density saturates nearly every sentence without pattern-taught payoff: "poetic wharf weaver," "overlapping sleepwalking paths," "shipwreck silk and whale-song echoes," "rebellion dressed in lace," "orchid solace." Mixed metaphors appear ("silence had grown too heavy to wear"). Template cadence runs through the closing third ("She would return tomorrow. / And the next night. / And the next."). Paraphrase loops recur: "not to erase the breakage, but to honor its shape, to make the scars part of the story's spine" restates prior content. Information density is low; many lines rephrase mood without advancing situation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The premise—artist mends magical heirloom in sacred space—follows a familiar template without fresh synthesis. Imagery is vivid but interchangeable: swap "wharf weaver" for "canyon potter" and "plate" for "bowl" with minimal structural change. The transformation-through-acceptance theme is executed earnestly but arrives at a predictable destination without risk or non-obvious moral calculus. No bold structural or perspectival choice elevates the work beyond competent genre exercise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Poetic wharf weaver is present throughout and performs the central ritual, but her choices do not create turns—she decides to mend at the outset and proceeds without complication. Observation and declaration dominate; no on-page decision alters tactics or options. Late first mention of "wharf" (implicit in opening, explicit only in closing) and swappable occupation lower the score.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Storybook illustration plate appears in setup (carried to chamber), development (examined and sewn), and closure (warmed, pulsed, child's eyes blinked). The plate's transformation is central to the arc and its changed state charges the final image. However, the transformation is passive—it responds to the weaver's actions rather than constraining her choices or imposing cost. Strong multi-beat presence and closure linkage, but no visible price tied specifically to the plate.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Broken precedents" is named twice and thematically echoed ("endings could be rewoven," "scars part of the story's spine") but does not shape on-page stakes or tactics. The concept functions as theme claim rather than a rule or constraint that changes options. Swappable with "embrace imperfection" or similar without altering plot structure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Hauntingly optimistic" is labeled by elders in a single line and asserted in the final paragraph ("hauntingly optimistic, as the first dew of dawn kissed her brow") but never constrains or enables an action with cost. The trait remains ornamental descriptor rather than a choice-shaping attribute. No visible trade-off demonstrates how optimism competes with caution or realism.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Sewing drives the middle beat (stitching fractures, threading plate edges) and the ending depends on its completion. The action is irreplaceable in its specific detail (bone needle, kelp fiber, following cracks) and redefines the plate's state. However, the act itself faces no resistance or mid-process complication; it proceeds linearly without cost or tactical adjustment. Setup, development, and payoff gates are met; causal pressure is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"Overlapping sleepwalking paths" is named in the opening and closing but its mechanics never shape a choice or alter tactics on the page. The weaver walks to the chamber and later "forge[s] a new overlap" without demonstrating how this method differs from ordinary navigation or imposes constraint. Ornamental label without functional integration.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Centuries-old labyrinth carved into red canyon walls is established early and provides spatial continuity (heart-chamber, curved walls, buried bell). The setting enables the ritual space but does not constrain tactics or supply resources that affect outcome. The final image includes canyon response (walls shimmer, ghostly tapestries), offering lyric reprise that reweights the space's meaning. Functional but does not pressure choices.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"After the tide pools empty" frames the opening hour but exerts no temporal pressure on the weaver's actions. No clock tightens decisions; the ritual unfolds without deadline or competing urgency. The timeframe is atmospheric rather than stake-shaping. Present in setup only; absent from development and closure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"To carve a path from ruin to reverence" is stated as motive in setup ("each a vow") and echoed in closure reasoning ("reverence grows best in the soil of ruin"). The desire is declared rather than dramatized through conflicting wants or visible friction. No on-page moment shows the cost of pursuing reverence over another viable path. Told-only integration.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>"Orchid solace" appears once as a scent descriptor ("A breeze, sweet as orchid solace") in the late middle. The tone throughout is elevated and reverent, cohering with "solace," but does not modulate with pressure or charge the final image—closing remains at the same lyric register as opening. Single ornamental mention; no tonal shift or recurrence that reweights stake.</comment>
