<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The linguist's meticulous cross-referencing and cautious exuberance show embodied contradiction, though her interior voice tilts toward elevated diction ("symphonies of truth weren't metaphorical") that strains credibility for someone under archive dust. The curator's brief presence adds pressure without muddying focus. Motivation is clear—restore trust through linguistic resurrection—but the protagonist's flawless execution (she never stumbles, only "immediately double-checks") undercuts genuine struggle, and the final collective singing feels more like validation than a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors cleanly: who (linguist), where (archive), when (after the Great Silence). The causal lens holds: she deciphers glyphs → discovers musical notation → reconstructs vows → conducts the restoration. The closure lands on-page with the collective singing and the glass ink well's final chime, offering a Resonant Reconfiguration (trust begins to rebuild). Cost is present but muted—years to rebuild fully—rather than a sharp forfeiture in the climactic moment, and the path from solo scholarship to communal performance compresses quickly without visible friction or failure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The archive's vaulted ceiling, dust motes spiraling under resonant vowels, and the glass ink well's meniscus all ground the setting in tactile detail. The rotunda's acoustics directly enable the climactic singing, and the curator's ink-stained cuffs signal his institutional presence. The drowned monastery's bell-tower library and the scent of rain on stone add atmospheric depth, though some details (chandelier emitting a tone, dust falling like snow) risk decorative overreach without clear constraint on the linguist's tactical choices.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—restore mutual understanding after the Great Silence—is signaled early and tightens through the discovery that a single altered promise fractured civilization. The linguist's warning "If you break the promise, the truth shatters again" raises cost at the climax. However, escalation is smooth rather than pressured: each deciphered phrase succeeds without setback, and the final singing unfolds without dissonance or dissent, so the tightening feels more like accumulation than a choice that narrows options or forecloses a live alternative.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—trust rebuilt through meticulous, embodied promises—emerges organically from the Syrathi's oath-like syntax and the linguist's own careful methodology. The glass ink well's transformation from half-empty to empty and prismatic grounds the abstract in a concrete image. "She was repairing. Reknitting the social fabric with syntax and song" edges toward stating the thesis, but the final image of scattered prismatic promises and converging paths offers resonance without overt moralizing. The story resists easy binaries (silence as ignorance vs. betrayal) and the ending's quiet awe carries weight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV holds cleanly; psychic distance is controlled. Diction tilts elevated ("crescendo of musical notation embedded in their legal parchments," "semantic dissonance") in ways that strain the immediate texture of an archivist under pressure, though it remains internally consistent. The curator's brief dialogue ("You're playing with frequencies that broke civilizations") and the linguist's reply demonstrate subtext and goal pursuit. No head-hopping, and the perceptual filter (dust, resonance, ink trembling) anchors the focalizer's professional priorities, though the voice sometimes reads more like an omniscient historian than a woman breathing dust and gambling on dead tongues.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and most sentences advance action or atmosphere. Several beats, however, loop near-synonyms: "not declared, but performed" followed immediately by "literal compositions...meant to be sung aloud" restates the same insight without added pressure. "She documented everything" then "dipping her quill...as if the ink itself remembered" piles two acts of recording in adjacent lines. Minor template cadence in the climax ("A second phrase followed..."; "By the third movement...") and elevated metaphor density ("dust fell like snow," "prismatic shards like scattered promises") in the final third slightly dull propulsion. No outright artifacts touch closure, so deductions remain moderate.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of extinct language, musical notation as legal contract, and communal singing as the mechanism of trust is specific and non-obvious. The piece avoids the template of lone scholar triumphs; instead, it requires collective performance with shared risk. The Syrathi's collapse through "semantic dissonance" rather than war offers fresh stakes. Some elements (glass ink well chiming, chandelier emitting a tone) trend toward symbolic convenience, and the ending's smooth convergence without dissent or failure softens the risk. The emotional arc and thematic question cohere, but the execution plays safe in the final third, privileging wonder over friction.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The arcane linguist drives every major beat: she traces codices, deciphers glyphs, reconstructs the vow, and conducts the final restoration. Her meticulous cross-referencing and decision to gather the remaining linguists alter tactics and enable closure. The character is indispensable; without her agency, the story has no engine.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The glass ink well appears early (beside the slate tablet), returns at the podium during the climactic singing, trembles and chimes with the restored frequency, and in the final image sits empty, casting prismatic shards. It participates in three distinct beats and its emptiness at closure reweights meaning (promises kept, work complete). However, its role is more symbolic marker than tactical constraint; removing it would not break causality, only resonance.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Symphonies of truth" is not metaphorical but literal: the Syrathi encoded legal understanding in musical compositions that required communal performance. This concept shapes the protagonist's central discovery, drives the reconstruction method, and dictates the climactic singing. The stakes hinge entirely on restoring these performative truths, and the method of resolution (singing the restored vow) is inseparable from the concept. Highly integrated and indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Carefully reckless" is dramatized twice: the linguist gambles on dead tongues yet cross-references every vowel shift, and she celebrates each recovered note with a fist-pump then immediately double-checks tonal alignment. The trait informs her methodology and appears in two beats. However, it does not constrain a high-stakes choice or create visible cost; it colors her process without forcing a tradeoff. Functional but not essential to closure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Unsnarl" anchors the inciting action: "She unsnarled the first knot in the archive's central mystery" unlocks the discovery that the Syrathi ceased writing with musical notation. This verb recurs conceptually in her syllable-by-syllable reconstruction and the warning "If you break the promise, the truth shatters again." The action of disentangling syntactic promises drives escalation and shapes the restoration. Removing this framing would soften the narrative's engine, though a near-synonym (decode, unravel) could substitute with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Via interconnected promises" is introduced in the second act as the Syrathi's oath-like syntactic structure, where meaning holds only if every speaker honors the prior clause. This mechanism explains the Great Silence (one altered harmonic promise fractured mutual understanding), shapes the linguist's reconstruction method (tuning each phoneme), and governs the climactic singing (break one promise and truth shatters). The method is signaled, tested, and indispensable to closure. The story's logic collapses without it.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The extinct language archive provides the crumbling codices, slate tablets, drowned monastery charts, and the rotunda's acoustics that enable the climactic performance. The setting's vaulted ceiling hums during the test phrase, and the archive's natural acoustics calibrate the restoration score. The curator's presence adds institutional pressure. The archive is not mere backdrop; it supplies resources and acoustic constraints that alter tactics and enable the resolution. Strong integration across setup, development, and payoff.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Before paths diverge" appears as an opening mantra and closing image ("the path was no longer diverging. It was converging"). The timeframe brackets the story thematically but does not tighten decisions or impose a live clock. The linguist works at her own pace; no urgency constrains her reconstruction or the gathering of remaining scholars. Present in setup and closure but does not pressure middle choices, so it remains functional yet replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"To restore trust after silence" is stated early ("Her motivation was not fame...it was to restore trust") and dramatized through the entire arc: the Great Silence collapsed scholarly trust, her meticulous method rebuilds credibility brick by broken brick, and the final singing begins to repair communal understanding. The curator's tears and the silence of awe (not abandonment) at closure validate the effort. The motivation drives every beat and charges the ending. Slightly didactic in its single statement but otherwise fully integrated.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Cautious exuberance" is demonstrated in the linguist's fist-pump followed by immediate double-checking and her steady voice during the climactic singing despite the trembling glass ink well. Tone modulates from archive dust and despair to the final awe and converging harmony. The contrast between meticulous caution and celebratory exuberance runs through two beats and colors the ending. However, the tone is more a byproduct of character trait than a distinct pressure; it supports rather than charges the final image. Solid integration but not indispensable.</comment>
