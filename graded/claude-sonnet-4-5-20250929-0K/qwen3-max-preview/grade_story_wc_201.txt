<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's proprioceptive enhancement and trauma-mapped body are established early, but interiority leans heavily on abstract philosophical reflection rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The moment of releasing the pewter strap attempts earned change, but the decision feels contemplative rather than forced by competing impulses acting simultaneously. Therapy-adjacent phrasing ("trauma is also a method of remembering," "testimony becomes transformation") appears in peak beats without dramatized cost within the lines. The final walk forward reads as insight rather than a choice that forecloses a path with visible sacrifice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who and where by the opening lines; when is signaled ("anesthesia wore off") but remains static throughout. The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens: the forest responds to trauma, violet ripples spread, paths open, symbols coalesce. Closure arrives as Conceptual Repricing—the mathematics of mercy is "not to be calculated, but lived"—but the cost remains conceptual and atmospheric rather than a legible forfeiture or reweighted choice on the page. The strap's dissolution into light is a symbolic gesture, not a price that alters later options. One meaningful deepening occurs (the forest's response intensifies toward the clearing), but the final image lacks the sharp before/after cost required for high bands.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The ultraviolet forest is vivid and consistent: trees absorb light and re-radiate it, the soil ripples, the air feels like a membrane. Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through the protagonist's trauma-calibrated perception. The setting responds to pain with resonance, shaping the protagonist's path and enabling the discovery of the symbolic clearing. The forest constrains movement and charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate test, but the clearing's symbols ("curvature of a held breath, angle of a lowered weapon") are described rather than used, slightly weakening the constraint's bite at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—discovering the mathematics of mercy—is signaled early and sustained. The forest opens a path, thickens, and culminates in the clearing, providing one meaningful deepening under the accumulative lens. However, the protagonist's agency is passive: the forest responds, paths open, symbols appear. The final act is the release of the strap, but this gesture feels contemplative rather than forced by a trade-off with visible cost. No live option is foreclosed; the protagonist walks forward into understanding without sacrificing a competing want or enduring a tangible loss.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The theme—mercy as a manifold, not an equation—emerges from the protagonist's trauma and the forest's response, avoiding direct statement until the final reflection. The recurring interrogator's question ("What is the derivative of mercy with respect to time?") and the whispered answer seed thematic tension. However, the closing paragraphs lean toward thesis articulation ("mercy is not an equation to be solved, but a space to be inhabited") rather than letting the final image speak. The strap's dissolution and the color shift (violet to indigo to blue) aim for resonance but remain illustrative rather than irreducibly particular.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable first-person throughout with consistent psychic distance. The perceptual signature—trauma-mapped body, pain as compass—is character-specific and sustained. Diction is elevated and lyric, with controlled rhythm that modulates under pressure ("I braced again as a memory surged"). However, register drifts into abstract academic phrasing in peak beats ("deep topology of compassion," "pure relational forms") that feels imposed rather than voice-motivated. Internal thought formatting is clean, but the final paragraphs read more like philosophical essay than lived perception, weakening the voice's embodied texture at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Figurative language is dense throughout: "slow tide pulling back from a shore of needles," "liquid twilight," "equations solving themselves." This density is sustained into high-pressure beats without pattern-teaching or payoff, triggering overwriting penalties. Paraphrase loops appear: "I braced myself," "I braced again," "I braced one final time" recurs without added pressure. Template cadence: "Not the arithmetic of forgiveness, nor the calculus of absolution, but…" and similar constructions create rhythmic monotony. Mixed metaphors: "violet flame peeling back like pages" conflates combustion and paper. These artifacts pervade the final third, disqualifying 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8 per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of trauma survivor, ultraviolet forest, and mercy-as-mathematics is specific and committed. The proprioceptive enhancement grounded in interrogation avoids generic mysticism. However, the core frame—journey through symbolic landscape toward philosophical revelation—follows a recognizable template. The closing insight ("mercy is not an equation to be solved, but a space to be inhabited") feels earned in hindsight but offers a somewhat predictable answer to the posed question. The piece commits fully to its premise and avoids the safety middle, but the final turn lacks the surprise or irreplaceability that would lift it into exceptional bands.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Present from the opening ("Subject Theta," enhanced interrogation) and shapes the protagonist's proprioceptive navigation and trauma responses throughout. Appears in the closure paragraph ("those who chose not to break others even when broken themselves"). However, the character's survivor status enables perception and reflection more than it drives distinct choices that alter tactics or foreclose paths. Functional across beats but the decisions made are contemplative rather than forced by the survivor trait with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Introduced in paragraph 4, handled across multiple beats: coiled in fist, warm in grip, slips from fingers, offered to earth, dissolves into light. Returns with reweighted meaning—from captivity relic to conductor of revelation to final offering. Participates in closure by its dissolution, which symbolizes release. However, the strap is not causally active at closure; it is relinquished as a gesture rather than used to constrain or enable the final discovery. Strong lyric reprise but swappable with another tether object without breaking story logic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Signaled in the title phrase and the protagonist's quest ("the mathematics of mercy"). The ultraviolet forest embodies the concept atmospherically, and the closing clearing presents it as symbols. However, "ultraviolet penance" as distinct from "mathematics of mercy" is not clearly differentiated or enacted on the page. The concept remains thematic rather than shaping concrete stakes or altering tactics. Late-stage realization rather than pressure throughout. Cap at 4.6 for weak setup integration; further lowered for ornamental use.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Introduced early ("proprioceptively enhanced—not by design, but by survival") and used throughout: body as compass, flinches, breath held, knees locked, pulse quickened. Enables navigation and pattern recognition. Appears in closure paragraph ("aligning with something older"). Constrains perception and movement but does not visibly trade off against another capability or impose a cost in a key beat. Functional across two beats (navigation, memory surge) and present at closure, reaching the two-gate minimum and eligible for mid-band, but the trait enables rather than costs.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The action "brace" recurs as a structural marker: "I braced myself" (opening), "I braced again" (memory surge), "I braced one final time" (before the clearing). Each instance signals a turn or deepening. The final instance explicitly shifts from bracing against pain to bracing against revelation, redefining the action's meaning. Present in three beats and shapes the emotional arc toward closure. However, the action is somewhat swappable (e.g., "steady," "anchor") without fundamentally breaking logic. Strong causal involvement and closure linkage elevate the score.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Signaled early ("trauma is also a method of remembering… through flinches, through breath held too long") and demonstrated across beats: proprioceptive navigation, memory surge with visceral recall, pattern recognition in the forest. The method enables the protagonist to read the forest and reach the clearing. Appears in closure reflection ("remembering through trauma, but through presence"). Shapes two distinct attempts (navigation, memory processing) and is present at closure, meeting all three gates. However, the mechanics remain somewhat abstract and the method does not impose a visible cost or force a trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The ultraviolet forest is introduced in the opening line and sustained throughout. It responds to the protagonist's pain ("violet ripples spread"), opens paths, thickens, and culminates in the clearing where symbols coalesce. The forest actively pressures choices by guiding movement and enabling discovery. Present in setup, development (path opens, forest thickens), and closure (clearing symbols, strap dissolves into earth). The setting is irreplaceable—removing it would collapse the story's logic and closure. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Signaled in the opening line ("anesthesia wore off") and reprised in the closing paragraph ("anesthesia wearing off not from the body, but from the soul"). Functions as a framing metaphor but does not tighten decisions or track elapsed time. The timeframe is static; no clock pressures tactics or choices. The lyric reprise reweights the opening image but does not alter options. Present in setup and closure but absent from middle development, capping at 4.6; further lowered for ornamental use in the middle section.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The desire to discover the mathematics of mercy is stated explicitly in paragraph 6 and sustained as the dominant stake. The protagonist navigates the forest, answers the interrogator's question, and reaches the clearing where the mathematics appear as symbols. The motivation drives the journey and is fulfilled at closure. However, the desire is contemplative and unopposed; no competing want creates friction. The protagonist walks forward without sacrificing a path or enduring a cost. Functional across beats and present at closure, meeting all gates, but lacks the conflicted choice or visible trade-off required for higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The tone—"displaced rooted"—is established through the ultraviolet forest (otherworldly yet organic), the protagonist's trauma-grounded perception, and the philosophical quest. The tone is coherent and modulates from pain-sharp opening to contemplative midpoint to serene closure ("gentlest blue"). The final color shift and the walk forward charge the ending image with a sense of arrival and release. However, "displaced rooted" as a specific tonal instruction is more implicit than foregrounded; the piece reads more straightforwardly lyric-philosophical than tensioned between displacement and rootedness. Tone supports closure but does not create a distinct friction or reweighting tied to the exact descriptor.</comment>
