<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The summoner's interior is largely passive observation with minimal embodied contradiction. Her motivation—"to cradle the sky's forgetting until it remembered itself"—arrives as declared epiphany without prior friction or cost-laden micro-choices. Seventeen nights of bare-footed walking establish habit but not conflicted impulse; the climactic "cradle" gesture is acceptance rather than a decision that forecloses a live path. The piece leans on label-only interiority ("resolve," "quiet purpose") where embodied sensation would anchor agency.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. The closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration (reframing the prophecy from doom to plea), but cost remains asserted rather than dramatized—no visible forfeiture or trade-off appears on the page. The origami wing's spiral and star-absorption read as conceptual payoff, yet the summoner's stance at the brook tomorrow is identical to tonight's; no option has been foreclosed. Orientation is clean by ~80 words. The piece teaches its lyric pattern early, but the final reconfiguration lacks the undeniable pressure or felt price required for higher bands.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Moonlight, brook, moss, and ferns are filtered through tactile and auditory detail that grounds the summoner's practice. The origami wing on water constrains the ritual and returns charged at closure, lifting the band. Spatial choreography (kneeling, placing, rising) remains clear. "Terrestrially cosmic" rhythm is evoked but not concretely anchored to a micro-setting choice; the environment supports atmosphere more than it pressures tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—hushing the prophecy—is signaled early but never truly tightens; the summoner's method succeeds without visible friction or a moment when failure looms. The prophecy's reframing from warning to plea is a conceptual pivot, not an escalation that narrows options. No live trade-off or cost appears: she will return tomorrow with the same tools and stance. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening is present (the whisper "The sky forgets only when the earth stops listening"), but it does not foreclose a path or impose felt price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Theme—listening as guardianship—emerges from image and gesture rather than statement until the final paragraph's "silence that makes space for stars to speak," which edges toward thematic summary. The origami wing's luminous spiral and the brook's sigh offer non-literal resonance. However, the piece leans on prompt-adjacent phrasing ("to cradle," "to map silence until it bloomed into understanding") that echoes the assignment rather than transforming it through earned particulars. The central question is posed but answered through affirmation without contradiction or ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Single-POV narration is stable with a distinct perceptual signature: the summoner notices texture, resonance, and celestial weight. Diction is elevated and consistent ("velvet void," "lullaby-light," "tranquil blaze"), though register occasionally drifts toward generic lyricism ("soul alight with quiet purpose"). No dialogue. Purposeful compression and patterned rhythm are taught early and sustained. Filter verbs ("seemed to breathe," "letting it show her") are voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy. Minor: "terrestrially cosmic" and "smoothed hush" read as imported labels rather than organic perception.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout ("moonlight draped," "slithered into her dreams," "velvet void," "memory given motion"), creating persistent elevation that flattens urgency in what should be peak beats. Several paraphrase loops: "not to silence prophecies, but to hear them fully, to cradle their tremors until they found peace" restates the prior realization without new pressure. Template cadence: "not [X], but [Y]" appears in seven sentences, mechanically toggling binaries. Sentence openings vary, but information density sags under metaphor weight. Subtract baseline −0.6 for density and template runs, plus −0.3 for paraphrase in the closure third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The core premise—summoner hushing prophecy through listening—follows a familiar template (magic-user reframes doom through acceptance/understanding). "Mapping silence" and origami as ritual object offer some specificity, but the emotional arc (acceptance without cost) and the nocturnal-haven frame are median choices. The prophecy's pivot from warning to plea is a gentler version of widely used "misunderstood monster" tropes. No bold structural risk; the piece retreats into affirmation rather than testing its own stakes. Transformation test: swap "summoner" for "empath" or "wind-whisperer" and the arc holds unchanged.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The solitary summoner is present throughout and her choices (kneeling, placing the wing, cradling the whisper, rising) frame the ritual. However, these are acceptance gestures rather than decisions that narrow options or foreclose a path. She does not choose between competing tactics or pay a visible cost; her stance tomorrow is identical to tonight's. Setup, development, and closure participation are present, but causal pressure is minimal. Mid-band: functional presence without irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The crane's origami wing is handled in three distinct beats: placement on water, trembling with resonance, and spiral ascent. It is signaled early, constrains the ritual method, and charges the final image with glowing runes and star-absorption. Specificity (parchment older than trees, folds holding unsaid futures) makes it irreplaceable. Strong closure linkage. One point shy of indispensable: the summoner's agency could theoretically operate without it, though the story's logic would weaken.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Smoothed hush" appears as atmospheric label in paragraph nine ("The smoothed hush settled over her") and again in the penultimate paragraph as thematic summary. It does not shape a visible tactic or constrain a choice on the page. The concept echoes the broader silence-mapping theme but remains ornamental rather than operational. Present, but swappable with "deep stillness" or similar without structural impact.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Terrestrially cosmic" modifies the brook's rhythm in paragraph two and reappears in the final third as "terrestrially cosmic dark." It is descriptive mood rather than a trait that constrains or enables action. No visible cost or trade-off tied to this quality; it could be replaced with "timeless" or "elemental" without altering choice or outcome. Ornamental use only.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Flow" is the summoner's stated creed and governs her method: matching breath to brook cadence, "flowing into the whisper," and the wing's spiral ascent. It appears in at least three beats and shapes her stance throughout. However, it is a philosophy she already embodies rather than an action under pressure; no moment tests whether she can sustain flow when resistance appears. Strong thematic presence and closure linkage, but causal pressure is modest. One key turn: flowing into the whisper reveals the prophecy's plea.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>"Mapping silence" is introduced in paragraph three as the summoner's taught method and enacted in paragraph ten ("began to map: not with ink or stone, but with intention"). It constrains her ritual approach and differentiates her technique from force-based alternatives. However, the mechanics remain abstract; we do not see how tracing "contours of stillness between cricket chirps" produces the reframing. Present in setup and middle; closure shows result (wing glows) but not the map itself. Functional but somewhat replaceable with "listening deeply" or similar.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The nocturnal haven beside the quiet brook is established early, houses all action, and supplies ritual resources (water surface for the wing, moonlight, ferns). The brook's murmur is matched by the summoner's breath, and its sigh closes the sequence. Spatial anchors (kneeling, water's edge, bare feet on earth) are clear. The setting enables the method and charges the final image. Strong integration across setup, development, and payoff; one step shy of indispensable because the ritual could theoretically occur in another still-water locale.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Amid whispered secrets" evokes atmosphere but does not function as a tightening timeframe. The summoner has walked here for seventeen nights; tonight is continuous action without a clock or deadline. "Nocturnal" anchors time of day, but no temporal pressure alters her choices. The whispers are ambient rather than a schedule that narrows options. Present as mood, but time does not constrain tactics. Functional background only.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The motivation "to hush a prophecy spoken in code" is established in paragraph three and pursued throughout. The summoner's goal drives her nightly walks and ritual at the brook. Paragraph fourteen reframes the prophecy from doom to plea, altering her understanding. However, the desire is never conflicted or tested; no moment shows her tempted to silence by force or to abandon the task. The prophecy's surrender is gentle acceptance rather than a choice under friction. Strong setup and development; closure pivots understanding but without visible cost tied to the want itself.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Tranquil blaze" anchors tone in the final third and recurs in the last paragraph ("a tranquil blaze now banked"). The piece sustains quiet intensity throughout—reverent, elevated, meditative—without tonal rupture. Under pressure (the whisper, the prophecy's shudder), tone modulates into soft urgency but never breaks serenity. The oxymoron ("tranquil" + "blaze") is signaled and paid off at closure, recharging the final image. Strong coherence and closure linkage; one point shy of indispensable because the meditative register could hold without this exact phrase.</comment>
