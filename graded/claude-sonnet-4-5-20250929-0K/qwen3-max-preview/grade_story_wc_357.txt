<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elira's interiority is vivid and concrete ("Her breath caught," "She wept"), and her micro-choices under pressure (touching the arrow, sprinting to the Grandmother Canopy) drive the narrative. However, the transformation from pilot-who-fixes to listener-who-echoes feels declared rather than earned through contradictory impulses acting in scene; the final stance arrives without visible internal resistance or cost. The embodied emotion is strong, but the arc lacks the friction required for high-band entry.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation is swift and concrete (orchard pilot, nebula planet, gravity inversion window). The closure—jamming the arrow into the tree and understanding resilience as memory—lands on the page with a visible act and conceptual shift. However, the causal linkage between touching the arrow and the epiphany feels compressed; the "gathering of echoes" mechanism is told more than dramatized in choice-altering pressure. The cost (renouncing the fixer role) is felt but not fully tested through a prior foreclosed path.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The orchard planet is richly rendered with concrete, POV-filtered detail: floating rock arches, inverted dew-trails, moss-draped shelves that were ceiling. The arrow tip constrains Elira's final choice (jamming it into the Grandmother tree), and the gravity inversion directly shapes her tactical window. Spatial choreography is clear throughout, and the environment charges the closure image with the tree's pulse radiating fruit and petals.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—tracing the orchard's resilience during the inversion hour—is signaled early and tightens when Elira discovers the arrow tip. The vines erupting around her and the sprint to the Grandmother tree narrow options under time pressure. However, the escalation lacks a visible trade-off or live consequence; the arrow solves the mystery without prior cost or friction. One meaningful deepening occurs, but the price feels conceptual rather than viscerally tested on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The theme—resilience as remembering rather than fixing—emerges organically from Elira's discovery and the arrow's function. The closing image of the song and her commitment to listen offers a resonant, non-literal answer without a stated moral. However, the final paragraph edges toward thesis statement ("resilience is not grown—it is recalled") and the metaphor of "gathering of echoes" shifts from literal mechanism to symbolic claim, blurring subtext with direct theme statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The voice is distinct and lyric, with controlled psychic distance and a consistent perceptual signature (navigating by scent, vapor corkscrews, ghost-trails of dew). Syntax modulates well under pressure (short bursts during the sprint, layered description in calmer beats). However, elevated diction occasionally drifts from POV plausibility ("bio-harmonic convergence," "echo-anchors" read as archive vocabulary rather than lived interiority), and the final paragraphs compress multiple realizations without dramatized friction, flattening the voice's texture under peak stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully, and sensory density is high without clutter. However, figurative language appears in most sentences of high-pressure beats without pattern-teaching or payoff ("liquid memory," "whirling silence," "gathering of echoes" all vie for symbolic weight), triggering overwriting penalties. Paraphrase loops are present: "It didn't pierce. It planted. It resonated" restates the same content across three lines without added pressure. The closure beat is clean, capping non-closure deductions, but the cumulative line-level debt lowers the score.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The orchard-pilot-as-listener arc and the arrow-as-catalyst offer a fresh angle on resilience narratives, and the gravity-inversion mechanic is specific and well-integrated. However, the core emotional turn (from fixing to listening) follows a familiar template of renunciation-as-wisdom without a non-obvious synthesis. The "gathering of echoes" mechanism is intriguing but leans on abstract metaphor rather than grounded world logic that would make it feel inevitable in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elira's choices (following dew-trails, touching the arrow, sprinting to the Grandmother tree, jamming the arrow into the bark) drive all key turns. Setup is immediate, development spans multiple beats, and the final act of insertion is the closure moment. Her role is indispensable to the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The broken arrow tip appears early (glint, then touch), triggers the vine eruption (middle beat), and is jammed into the Grandmother tree at closure, fusing and radiating the song. It is handled in three distinct beats, its properties (catalyst, echo-anchor) constrain Elira's final act, and the story would collapse without it. High irreplaceability and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The "gathering of echoes" is named early and explained as literal memory storage in the arrow, shaping the thematic stakes. However, it remains largely metaphorical and told rather than dramatized in a choice-altering way. It does not constrain tactics or enable a visible trade-off; the orchard's resilience is revealed, not tested through Elira's agency under this concept's pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Accelerates plant growth" is demonstrated when Elira touches the arrow and vines erupt instantly. This beat enables her realization and motivates the sprint to the Grandmother tree. However, the trait does not constrain a later choice or impose a visible cost; it functions as a clue rather than a force that narrows options. Present in two beats (touch, final pulse), but swappable with any "catalyst" mechanic.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Discover" is the spine of the plot: Elira discovers the arrow tip (inciting incident), discovers its function via the vines (middle turn), and discovers the orchard's memory mechanism (closure realization). All major beats trace to acts of discovery. However, the action is somewhat generic; "uncover" or "learn" could substitute with minor edits, lowering irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Navigating by water flow" is signaled early ("ghost-trails of dew that spiraled upward") and establishes Elira's method during the inversion. It shapes her approach to finding the source but does not constrain a key choice or return with reweighted meaning at closure. Present in setup and mentioned in passing, but not causally active in the final beats.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The orchard planet and floating rock arches provide the spatial arena for all action: Elira skims beneath arches, lands on a moss-draped shelf (former ceiling), and flies to the Grandmother Canopy. The gravity inversion mechanic is inseparable from the setting's logic, and the environment directly shapes her tactical window and final act. The setting would fundamentally break the story's stakes and closure if removed.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The one-hour inversion window is signaled early, creates urgency ("She had minutes"), and tightens Elira's sprint to the tree before gravity snaps back. However, the clock is not tracked beat-by-beat, and the story does not test what happens if she misses the deadline. Time pressure is felt but not causally decisive; the closure could occur in a longer window with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Elira's motivation to trace the orchard's resilience is stated early and drives her flight during inversion. The discovery of the arrow and the final realization fulfill this goal. However, the motivation is not dramatized through internal conflict or competing wants; she pursues it without friction or visible cost. Present across all beats, but lacks the tension of a want-versus-fear dynamic.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Whirling silence" appears early ("a whirling silence that pressed against her eardrums") and returns implicitly in the final paragraph ("And in that whirling silence, between falling and rising"). The tone is coherent and modulates with pressure (lyric calm, then urgency, then resonant stillness). However, it functions more as atmospheric description than a force that charges the final image with undeniable weight. Purposeful reprise, but impact is moderate.</comment>
