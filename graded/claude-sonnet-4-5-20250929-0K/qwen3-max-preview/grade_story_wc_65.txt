<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The cartographer remains abstract throughout—no bodily reaction, no embodied contradiction under pressure, only declarative interiority ("she learned," "she knew"). The seventeen-winter backstory and predictive-modeling exposition occupy significant real estate without dramatizing a single micro-choice or revealing hierarchy of values. The final glyph sequence operates as ritual description rather than decision with visible cost; we never see her weigh competing goods or pay a price that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>No on-page closure effect: the cartographer performs a ritual that "invites" off-stage actors (engineers, poets, children) whose future actions are summarized in conditional mood. The piece teaches an accumulative/textural lens early but deflates it by summarizing hypothetical outcomes rather than landing a reweighted present image with felt cost. Orientation is delayed past 120 words (name, location, and stakes clarify only after the frozen lake paragraph), triggering the −0.3 penalty and Q3 cap at 7.0. The dominant stake—seeding innovation—is stated but never tested by an on-page reversal or tightening that narrows her options.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Vivid sensory catalog (glacial mist, obsidian inkwell, iridescent barbs) anchors location and atmosphere, but the setting never constrains a choice or alters tactics—props are handled ceremonially without friction. The parchment's luminescent veins and the spire's pulse are ornamental flourishes that do not pressure the protagonist's decisions. Spatial choreography is clear and the recurring ice/stone imagery supports tone, lifting the score above mere postcard description.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The stated stake—seeding innovation within constraint—remains abstract and unchallenged. No on-page reversal, tightening, or deepening: she climbs, reflects, writes glyphs in sequence, and the ritual succeeds without obstacle or trade-off. The summary of downstream actors (engineers, poets, children) replaces protagonist agency at the closure beat. Coincidence does not resolve because nothing is dramatized to resolve; pressure is declared ("tension," "friction") but never embodied in a choice that forecloses a live option.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Theme of uncertainty-as-resource and permeable transformation emerges through imagery (hollow reeds, lichen glyphs, glacial melt + meteorite), but the final paragraph moralizes explicitly: "True transformation sustains itself not by perfection, but by permeability." The closing image—earth exhaling in recognition—gestures at resonance yet remains a declarative coda rather than a non-literal answer earned by prior action. Subtext operates in the quill-as-covenant metaphor, but the conceptual stakes never incarnate as on-page cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Consistent third-limited POV with a distinct perceptual signature (equations as "living threads," models as "groundedly imaginative constructs"). Diction remains elevated and voice-coherent throughout, but the register never modulates under pressure—reflection at the opening and ceremonial inscription at the close carry identical syntactic calm. No dialogue to assess. Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping. The narrative withholds nothing the focalizer knows, yet the uniformly elevated lexicon ("tectonic thought," "probabilistic landscapes") flattens urgency at what should be the peak beat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Dense figurative language pervades nearly every sentence without pattern-teaching or payoff: "ignorance cartographer," "territories of ignorance where innovation hides, curled like frost inside hollow reeds," "living threads of causality, branching like roots beneath frozen soil." Mixed/competing metaphors (threads branch like roots; innovation curls like frost) reduce clarity (−0.5). Template cadence in the glyph sequence: "The first stroke… The second stroke… By the seventh glyph…" (−0.4). Paraphrase loops: paragraphs 9–10 restate "constraints focus innovation" without added pressure (−0.2). Information density is high but propulsion stalls in the middle third under the weight of ornamental description. No loops touch the closure beat directly, capping cumulative deduction at −1.1 and preventing the Text-Artifact floor from applying.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The "ignorance cartographer" role and the ritual of writing glyphs on bespoke parchment offer a fresh surface synthesis, and the obsidian-spire setting is specific. Yet the emotional and thematic arc—solitary visionary learns humility, embraces uncertainty, invites collaboration—follows a familiar template without transformation through lived cost or non-obvious moral calculus. The quill-covenant and glacial-melt-plus-meteorite ink are inventive props, but they do not generate a turn that feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in voice and imagery is evident, but the lack of on-page dramatic pressure prevents the premise from paying off as bold structure.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>The ignorance cartographer is named and present throughout but makes no on-page decision that alters tactics or narrows options. She reflects, dips the quill, writes glyphs—all ritual gestures without dramatized conflict or trade-off. Her past failure ("once tried to force grandeur") is summarized in one line without causal linkage to present action. Present by setup and middle, absent from causal closure; ornamental use within those beats.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The kingfisher feather quill nib appears in paragraph 2 (early setup), is dipped in paragraph 13 (middle), and inscribes glyphs in paragraphs 15–17 (closure participation, all three gates). Its properties—hollow shaft, iridescent barbs, precision-diving origin—are described but do not constrain or enable a contested choice; the inscription proceeds without friction. Swappable with any ceremonial writing tool; no visible cost tied to its use. Functional presence across beats, but lacks causal pressure or irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Writing the future" frames the premise (setup) and the glyph sequence enacts it (closure participation), but the concept remains thematic decoration: the act of writing generates no on-page consequence or trade-off, only summarized downstream invitations. Middle development is thin—reflection on past failure mentions the concept without dramatizing how it shapes present tactics. Functional but largely ornamental; no felt cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Groundedly imaginative" is asserted in paragraph 8 as a descriptor of her models, and the glyphs are said to derive from "lichen growth patterns" and "salmon leaping" (specificity), but the trait never enables or constrains an on-page action. It is label-only, without visible trade-off or moment where pragmatism and imagination clash. Present in setup and referenced at closure via the glyph imagery, but ornamental; no causal work or cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>"Prevail" is invoked in paragraph 10 ("prevails not through dominance but through resonance") as thematic claim, and the closing line—"the earth itself had exhaled in recognition"—gestures at success. The action is summarized and conceptual rather than dramatized; no beat shows her overcoming resistance or paying a price to achieve resonance. Swappable with "succeed" or "transform" with minimal edits. Present in setup (implicit goal) and closure (declarative acknowledgment); middle lacks development.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Predictive modeling is named in paragraph 5 (setup), elaborated in paragraphs 6–8 (middle: "equations unfold," "probabilistic landscapes"), and paragraph 19 states "Her predictive modeling had shown her this." The method shapes her epistemic stance but never matters mechanically—no trade-off between model outputs, no moment where a prediction proves wrong or costly. The means is present across beats but remains thematic frame rather than tactical constraint. Functional, replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The obsidian spire and frozen lake anchor location from paragraph 1 (setup), are revisited in paragraph 4 (the lake mirrors sky, ice groans), and the spire pulses in the final line (closure participation). Paragraph 20 asserts "she wrote within the spire's shadow, within the lake's freeze…constraints that focused her vision," but on the page the setting supplies atmosphere without altering her choices—no inaccessible resource, no weather obstacle, no spatial friction. Purposeful early–final reprise reweights the stake modestly via the closing pulse, justifying mid-band placement despite lack of middle tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The timeframe—"the moment before the pen meets the blank page"—is signaled in paragraph 14 (setup), structures the entire ritual sequence (middle: paragraphs 13–21 enact the approach and contact), and is fulfilled in paragraph 15 when nib touches parchment (closure participation, all three gates). The constraint is conceptual rather than a live ticking clock; no urgency or competing deadline tightens her choices. Yet the frame coheres and the ending fulfills the promised threshold, creating a satisfying bracket. One key turn (crossing from reflection to inscription) shaped by the timeframe; modest causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"To seed innovation within a constraint" is stated in paragraph 5 (setup), elaborated in paragraph 19 ("innovation thrives…in tension"), and enacted via the glyph invitations in paragraphs 21–23 (closure participation). The desire is told rather than dramatized—no scene shows her torn between competing methods or sacrificing an immediate gain for long-term seeding. Friction between wants and costs is asserted ("constraints that focused her vision") but not embodied in a choice with visible price. Functional across all three gates, but told-only; lacks on-page conflict.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Tone of meditative, ceremonial transformation is established early (paragraphs 1–2: breath curling, stillness, reverence) and sustains through the glyph sequence without rupture. The prose modulates subtly—denser description in the setup, tighter beats during inscription, expansive declaration in the close—but remains within a single elevated register. The final image (earth exhaling, parchment humming) charges the tone with recognition of success, reweighting prior solemnity. Coherent and purposeful; one meaningful intensification at closure; no static flatness, but also no stark modulation under pressure to reach higher bands.</comment>
