<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Veyra's interiority shows some embodied detail (calloused fingers, coiled regret) and her scavenging motivation is clear, but the ghost functions more as a thematic mirror than a genuine antagonist applying pressure. The final choice to drop the camera wheel and wade into the lagoon arrives without sufficient on-page struggle between contradictory impulses; the transition from exhaustion to acceptance feels declared rather than earned through micro-choices. Internal conflict is mostly sequential (remembering failures, then letting go) rather than simultaneous and contradictory in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes who/where/when by the opening paragraph and attempts a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) at closure when Veyra releases the camera wheel and sleeps. However, the cost of this renunciation is asserted ("I'm tired") rather than demonstrated through a visible foreclosed path; the rose appearance and her walking into the lagoon read as symbolic reward rather than price paid. The drive lens wavers between Accumulative (fragment-collecting, lyric imagery) and Causal (ghost confrontation), and the final image's conceptual weight is undercut by the fishermen coda, which diffuses rather than charges the ending.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The kinetic lagoon is rendered with vivid sensory particulars (bruised violet, electric gold, westward slosh at dawn) and its fractured time affects Veyra's perception (seed still a seed, sun stuck). The lagoon constrains her scavenging choices and the camera wheel itself is a concrete object handled across beats. Micro-setting (froth, shore, depths) is used purposefully, and the final wade into the current shows spatial consequence, elevating the category despite the somewhat ornamental carousel backdrop.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Veyra negotiating with her ghost to release self-blame—is signaled early, but escalation is thin: the ghost appears, they exchange lines, she drops the wheel, and the ghost nods approval. No reversal narrows options or raises cost; the confrontation resolves through declaration rather than a tightening choice. The seed of the camera wheel as potential "key" is planted but never tested on the page, and the rose appearance feels like a symbolic gift rather than a consequence of her agency.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme (forgiveness, release from eroded ambitions) emerges from Veyra's actions and the lagoon's imagery rather than statement, and the final image of her wading away offers resonance without overt moralizing. The camera wheel and rose recur with shifted meaning, and the ghost's "Because you haven't forgiven yourself" is specific enough to avoid pure platitude. However, the fishermen coda and "The lagoon, however, knew the truth" veer toward thematic assertion that undercuts the earned ambiguity of the wade-into-horizon moment.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with a distinct perceptual signature (scavenger's attention to debris, lagoon rhythms, texture). The ghost's dialogue carries subtext and Veyra's replies feel goal-driven, though "You cling to fragments" and "Because you haven't forgiven yourself" edge toward thematic exposition. Diction is consistent and voice-motivated, with purposeful compression in the time-distortion passages. Minor slips: "chronologically confused" is a label rather than shown confusion in real time, and the fishermen frame-shift at the end introduces a brief omniscient distance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and imagery is concrete (bruised violet, grinding gears, coiled regret), but several beats suffer from synonym churn and template cadence: "She'd memorized... the way the water sloshed... the way it hissed" repeats structure without adding pressure. Metaphor density is high ("ghost that materialized," "echo of her younger self," "stuck coin," "mirrored surface") and occasionally mixed (ghost as hologram, then echo, then mirror). The closure beat is clean, but paraphrase loops in the ghost dialogue ("You've brought me trinkets" / "You cling to fragments") and expository interiority ("Regret coiled... hot and familiar") lower the band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The kinetic lagoon above the clouds and the self-haunting conceit offer fresh sensory texture, and the camera wheel as memory artifact is a specific choice. However, the protagonist-confronts-their-ghost frame is a familiar template, and the emotional arc (guilt → confrontation → release) follows expected beats without a non-obvious turn. The fishermen epilogue and "For the girl who collects stories" note add a storybook quality that softens the risk. Transformation is partial: swap "ghost" for "shadow-self" and "camera wheel" for another relic, and the arc holds unchanged.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Veyra scavenges in the opening beat, confronts the ghost at dusk, drops the camera wheel, and wades into the lagoon—three distinct on-page actions. Her choice to release the wheel is signaled as key ("This was someone's memory. Maybe it's mine too") and the wade-away is closure participation. However, the decision to drop the wheel is not shown as a difficult trade-off; she simply tires and the ghost approves. Her scavenger role frames expectation but does not constrain later moves with visible cost. Mid-band: functional across beats but swappable for another guilt-ridden collector.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The camera wheel appears in the opening (found in froth), is held up during the ghost confrontation ("This was someone's memory"), and is dropped into the lagoon at the climax. Three beats with rising significance. Its lens is noted ("might capture the lagoon's true nature") but never tested, so the object's unique properties remain potential rather than demonstrated. It anchors a key choice (release), but the choice feels thematic rather than causal. The rose replaces it in the final image, slightly diluting its closure charge. Solid early signal and beat involvement; lacks irreplaceable mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Eroded ambitions" is introduced early ("Veyra's ambitions had eroded like the lagoon's shores") and shapes her scavenging stake: she no longer dreams of repairing the carousel, only collects fragments. This erosion drives her to barter with the ghost and informs her exhaustion ("I'm tired"). The concept reappears in the ghost's challenge ("where's the courage to let go?") and the final act of wading away forecloses the scavenging path. The cost—abandoning even fragment-collection—is legible in the final image. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage; the concept is weight-bearing throughout.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Chronologically confused" is mentioned explicitly ("You're chronologically confused," the ghost says) and illustrated with the seed example and the stuck sun. The trait colors Veyra's perception but does not constrain a tactical choice with visible cost; she scavenges and confronts the ghost in linear sequence despite the lagoon's time distortion. The confusion is atmospheric rather than action-shaping. Present in two beats (setup, ghost dialogue) but swappable for "haunted by grief" or another label without altering the plot. Functional description, limited causal work.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Regret is named mid-story ("Regret coiled in Veyra's chest") and motivates the ghost's accusation ("You haven't forgiven yourself") and Veyra's exhaustion. The action of dropping the camera wheel is framed as release, and her sleeping without dreaming marks a shift. However, regret itself is more a motivational state than a discrete action; the on-page acts are "drop wheel" and "wade into lagoon," both of which could trace to grief or exhaustion without substantive edit. Present and thematically central but not mechanically indispensable; the label could swap for "guilt" or "grief" seamlessly.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Collecting fragments of overheard stories" is introduced in the middle section ("To negotiate with her ghost, Veyra gathered stories. She eavesdropped on fishermen..."). The method is signaled and illustrated (mermaid tale, poet's verse), and the camera wheel is positioned as the culmination of this collection. However, the stories themselves do not reappear or constrain the ghost confrontation; Veyra uses the wheel, not the tales. The method shapes one beat (story-gathering) but does not drive the closure. Functional setup without payoff in the final choice; swappable for "collecting objects" with minor loss.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The kinetic lagoon is introduced in the opening line with vivid sensory detail and its time-distortion properties constrain Veyra's perception throughout. The froth supplies debris for scavenging, the shore hosts the ghost encounter, and the violet depths swallow the camera wheel. The lagoon's calm state upon waking signals the shift, and the current carries Veyra away in the final image. The setting is present in all three gates, supplies resources (fragments), constrains choices (time confusion), and charges the closure (wade into current). Strong causal and atmospheric integration; irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"After the carousel halts" is established early as the temporal frame and recurs ("since the carousel stopped"). The halt marks the loss that eroded Veyra's ambitions and sets the scavenging context. The timeframe is less a ticking clock than a static condition—past event whose consequences persist. It shapes the stakes (no crowds to lure back, dreams gone) and the ghost's accusation hinges on time ("chronologically confused"). Present in setup and middle beats, contributes to motivation, but does not tighten decisions in real time. Solid integration as backdrop; lacks live pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Veyra's desire to negotiate with her ghost is stated early ("to barter with her own ghost") and dramatized in the dusk confrontation where she offers the camera wheel and asks "Then why do you haunt me?" The ghost's reply ("Because you haven't forgiven yourself") reframes the negotiation as internal work, and Veyra's exhaustion and release complete the arc. The motivation drives two beats (story-gathering preparation, confrontation) and shapes closure (acceptance, sleep). Friction between wanting absolution and lacking courage is visible. Strong setup, development, and payoff; the exact phrasing is specific to this story.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Fractured stillness" is embodied in the opening (churning waters, stuck sun) and recurs in "The lagoon's fractured stillness amplified her confusion." The tone modulates from restless energy to calm ("the lagoon was calm, its surface reflecting a sky unmarred by storms") and charges the final image (wade into gold horizon). Diction and rhythm support the stillness (elliptical time, quiet exchange with ghost) and the fracture (memory fragments, disrupted causality). Tone is coherent and purposeful across beats, though the fishermen coda introduces a slight shift toward fable register. Strong atmosphere and closure linkage.</comment>
