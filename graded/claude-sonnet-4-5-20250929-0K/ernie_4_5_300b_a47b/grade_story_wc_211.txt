<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elder Voss's motivation to "archive emotional patterns" is stated but remains abstract; his interior life during the phonograph moment shows embodied attention (trembling fingers, spine tightening) but the epiphany—"not disaster, but awakening"—arrives without sufficient dramatic struggle or contradiction. The memory of children's faces and tree's pulse provides texture, yet no micro-choice under pressure tests his values or forecloses a visible path. The final smile and resolve feel asserted rather than earned through on-page cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation is established by ~120 words (garden, skyscraper, wax shaving). The structure is a single continuous scene with embedded memory; the inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, building through sensory layering toward the final realization. However, the closure—Voss understanding the prophecy as "awakening" and resolving to archive it—lacks visible cost or a felt decision that forecloses an option. The "not to stop the storm, but to listen" stance is poised but does not reweight prior material with undeniable pressure; it reads as confirmation of intent rather than transformation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The rooftop orchard is vividly anchored (roses blooming in human breath, gnarled apple tree, sap-sticky children) and the garden's breathing pulse charges the atmosphere. The wax shaving's grooves are handled twice (tracing, then placing in the cradle), providing tactile specificity that shapes Voss's investigative action. The foghorn's absence and the city's flickering lights supply a coherent spatial frame. The garden does not constrain a pivotal choice, preventing entry to the 9-band, but the setting is purposefully detailed and integral to tone.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—decoding the accidental prophecy—is signaled early and coheres through the listening beat. The discovery of the harmonic hum beneath the shriek provides one meaningful deepening, narrowing Voss's interpretation from "terror" to "warning." Yet no on-page decision alters his tactics or forecloses a live option; he confirms a pre-existing mission (archiving) without visible trade-off. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure accumulates but the final image of watching stars feels like a pause rather than a tightening that charges the closure with cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the motif of roots versus leaves (memory versus present awareness) and the prophecy as "awakening" rather than disaster. The wax cylinder reprise reweights the field-trip memory with new harmonic data, creating a lyric pattern. However, the final image—stars as "silent counterpoint"—feels decorative rather than resonant; the closing line "The roots remembered, and so would he" restates the theme without adding conceptual or emotional cost. The piece invites reflection but stops short of a non-literal answer that transforms prior material.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with consistent focalization through Voss. Perceptual signature is present: he notices grooves, frequencies, the garden's breath, and speaks Old High Martian internally. The prose carries a measured, archival texture ("velvet disquiet," "bruise-purple twilight") that fits the character. However, one moment reads as a typo/artifact: "his皱纹 (wrinkles, though he spoke the word in Old High Martian)"—the parenthetical intrudes unnaturally, breaking immersion. Diction remains mostly within Voss's register, though "emotional patterns" and "archive" occasionally drift toward abstraction under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and figurative language ("defiant green thumbprint," "velvet disquiet") enriches atmosphere without overwhelming clarity. The paraphrase loop in paragraph six—"He saw...He felt...And he heard"—uses parallel stems for effect but borders on template cadence. The artifact "皱纹 (wrinkles...)" in paragraph seven is a clear scaffold error that breaks immersion (−0.4). The final paragraph's repetition of "The roots remembered" functions as thematic callback but adjacent to "he would stay, watching" and "he would transcribe" creates slight synonym churn. Information density is moderate; some lines advance atmosphere more than plot.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The combination of wax-cylinder prophecy, rooftop orchard, and dead-language oath scribe offers specific world-building. The "accidental prophecy" captured during a field trip is a fresh angle, and the harmonic hum beneath the shriek provides a non-obvious twist. However, the core arc—wise elder decodes ancient warning and resolves to continue his mission—follows a familiar template without transforming it through risky choices or non-obvious moral calculus. The emotional specificity (children sticky with sap, tree's pulse) adds texture, but the protagonist's passive decoding and unchanged stance limit freshness at closure.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elder Voss is present throughout and his choice to listen, decode, and archive the prophecy drives the scene. However, his decisions do not create key turns that alter tactics or foreclose options; he confirms a pre-existing mission without visible cost. He is the lens but not the pivot.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The wax cylinder shaving is handled in multiple beats: tracing grooves (opening), placing in cradle (midpoint), removing and cradling (ending). Its grooves and frequency pattern are causal—they reveal the harmonic hum that reweights the prophecy. The shaving's reprise in the satchel charges the final image, making it indispensable to closure. A stronger on-page cost tied explicitly to the object would push it higher.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Accidental prophecy" is the central stake: the phonograph captured an unexplained shriek and harmonic pattern that Voss decodes. It shapes his investigation and the middle discovery (hum matching foghorn silence). However, the prophecy's content—"awakening" rather than disaster—does not change his options or impose a visible trade-off; it confirms his archival mission. The concept frames but does not transform.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Voss speaks Old High Martian twice: once in the field-trip memory ("The roots remember...") and again in the present ("...the leaves will scream"). The trait provides atmosphere and thematic echo but does not constrain or enable a key action with cost. It is a label that colors the character without altering tactics.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Immerse" is enacted when Voss places the shaving in the phonograph, closes his eyes, and lets the memory wash over him. This beat enables the discovery of the harmonic hum and the realization of the prophecy's meaning. However, immersion does not redefine his options or impose a trade-off; it is a method of investigation rather than a turning point. The action is functional but replaceable with another investigative approach.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The third-grade field trip is seeded early (paragraph two) and its memory is the vessel for the prophecy. The children's laughter, the apple tree recording, and the unexplained shriek are all causal: they created the wax shaving Voss now decodes. The memory returns in the immersion beat and its details (children's faces, sap) charge the ending. The method shapes the investigation and primes closure, though the field trip itself remains passive backstory rather than a present constraint.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The ancient orchard atop the skyscraper is vividly anchored (roses requiring human breath, gnarled apple tree, canopy of stars) and provides the physical stage for Voss's investigation. The garden's "breath" and "pulse" supply atmospheric pressure, and the tree was the source of the original recording. However, the setting does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters the outcome; it enriches tone and world but remains a backdrop. The micro-setting (wax shaving, phonograph cradle) is more tactile and functional.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The foghorn's silence is noted in the opening and its frequency matches the harmonic hum Voss discovers, providing a causal link. "Hours ago" and "tonight" establish a loose timeframe, and the dusk-to-stars progression tracks evening. However, time does not tighten Voss's decisions or impose urgency; he has the leisure to listen, reflect, and resolve to transcribe "tomorrow." The timeframe is present but does not pressure tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"To archive emotional patterns" is stated as Voss's motivation in paragraph four and echoed in the ending ("he would archive this pattern, too"). The desire drives his investigation of the wax shaving and his resolve to preserve the prophecy. However, the motivation is told more than dramatized; no on-page friction between this want and a competing cost or fear tests his commitment. It is a consistent throughline but lacks conflict or visible trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Velvet disquiet" appears once in the phrase "heavy with velvet disquiet" (paragraph six). The tone—layered unease beneath measured calm—is sustained through images like "bruise-purple twilight," the shriek's "unresolved terror," and the garden holding its breath. The modulation from investigation to realization to resolve feels coherent. However, the tone does not sharply intensify or break at closure; the final image of stars and watching feels contemplative rather than charged with undeniable pressure. The tone supports but does not transform the ending.</comment>
