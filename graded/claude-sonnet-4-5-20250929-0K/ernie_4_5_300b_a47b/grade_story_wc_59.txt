<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Corvin's motivation is clear and intensifies throughout, but his interiority relies heavily on stock phrasing ("trembled," "heart racing," "tears streaming") and therapeutic self-awareness ("fear the egg might shatter if he breathed too hard"). The final choice feels unmotivated by prior causality—the orb's transformation of the palace arrives without dramatized struggle or micro-choices that earn the shift. Elder Thalos appears only to deliver exposition and validate the protagonist, applying no pressure. Internal contradiction is present (obsession vs. doubt) but not embodied in simultaneous action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece anchors who/where/when adequately within the opening paragraph. A causal lens is discernible: Corvin assembles the contraption, adjusts the lens, the egg cracks, the orb emerges and transforms the world. However, the final transformation lacks visible cost—Corvin's hand closes around the orb and the palace blooms without any on-page forfeiture, renunciation, or tactical narrowing. The closure reads as wish-fulfillment rather than a Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration with felt price. One meaningful tightening (the egg cracking) is present, but the resolution is gifted by the orb's autonomous magic rather than earned by protagonist agency.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The suspended palace anchored to stalactites is vivid and consistently rendered; the gears, pistons, and bioluminescent flora establish a coherent world. Spatial choreography is clear throughout. The palace's transformation at the end—metal fading, stone blooming with moss—directly charges the closure image and reflects the thematic shift from mechanical to organic. This meets the 9+ gate for Q3 (environment charges the final image), but sensory detail occasionally tilts toward catalog ("riot of bioluminescent flora," "liquid light") without POV filter, and the stalactites' resonant tones remain ornamental until the final beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—reawakening beauty in a mechanical world—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs when the egg begins to crack, narrowing Corvin's options. However, the resolution is delivered by the orb's autonomous power rather than Corvin's agency; he adjusts a lens, then the egg hatches on its own, and the world transforms without a visible price paid by the protagonist. Coincidence (the egg's autonomous hatching) resolves rather than complicates. Cost clarity is absent: Corvin's struggle does not foreclose a path or impose a felt trade-off at closure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme—beauty cannot be engineered but must be nurtured—emerges from the premise and images (egg, palace, mechanical vs. organic). The orb's "flawed, imperfect" nature and "bitterly sweet struggle" are stated rather than dramatized at closure. The final paragraph moralizes directly: "in that imperfection...lay the truest beauty of all" and "We'll remember," reducing earned resonance. Subtext operates in the palace's sighing and the stalactites' hum, but the ending explains rather than invites reflection. The piece resists full complexity by framing the Mechanists as purely wrong without dramatizing their perspective or cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited on Corvin with consistent psychic distance. Voice carries a heightened, slightly archaic register ("bedraggled form," "riot of bioluminescent flora") that matches the fantasy setting. However, diction occasionally drifts into generic intensity without character-specific texture: "heart racing," "bones ache," "tears streaming." Elder Thalos's dialogue ("You reawakened the genesis") and Corvin's reply feel expository rather than goal-driven. Free indirect style is clean, and filter verbs are minimal. Perceptual signature is present but not sharp—Corvin's way of noticing defaults to visual grandeur without idiosyncratic bias.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and syntax is generally clear, but the piece carries several template patterns: repeated "his [noun] [verb]" constructions ("his boots clicking," "his hands trembled," "his voice echoing") and stock metaphors ("like a dying star," "like a frozen tear"). Figurative density is high in the opening without payoff: "suspended palace," "crystal spires," "stolen starlight," "fractured grandeur" accumulate within two sentences. Paraphrase loops appear: "beauty was not engineered but *grown*" / "life could not be forged but must be *nurtured*." The final paragraph summarizes rather than dramatizes ("It was flawed...it was *alive*"), reducing propulsion at closure. Information density is moderate; scaffolding phrases ("he'd written," "he said") could be cut.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The core premise—prince seeks to hatch an extinct bird's egg to restore organic beauty to a mechanical world—follows a familiar template (lost magic artifact, restoration quest, mechanical-vs.-organic binary). Tropes (ancient relic, lone prince, dying world) are executed competently but not transformed through specific, non-obvious choices. The emotional arc (obsession → success → renewed hope) is predictable, and the ending's tidy resolution (world blooms, Elder arrives to validate) lacks the risk or ambiguity that would distinguish the piece. The palace setting offers visual interest, but the Mechanists remain off-page antagonists without complexity. One specific inflection: the orb emerging as light rather than a living bird adds a degree of surprise, but its autonomous transformation power still resolves the conflict through convenient magic rather than protagonist-driven synthesis.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Corvin is present throughout and his choices frame the narrative: he cradles the egg, assembles the contraption, adjusts the lens. However, the egg's hatching and the orb's transformation of the palace occur autonomously—Corvin's final action is to close his hand around the orb *after* it has already flared and begun the transformation. His decisions enable setup but do not create the key turn at closure. Early signal is strong (+0.8), beat involvement spans two distinct beats (+0.9), but the final beat's lack of protagonist-driven causality limits the score. Swappability is moderate: a different character with similar motivation could perform these actions.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The egg is signaled in paragraph two, handled and described in multiple beats (cradled, placed in the contraption, glowing, cracking), and its transformation into the orb directly shapes the closure. It appears in three distinct beats (+1.4), demonstrates causal pressure by narrowing Corvin's focus (+1.0), and charges the final image where Corvin closes his hand around it (+1.2). Specificity is high: the "porcelain shell etched with faint, golden veins" and its hatching into a "shimmering orb of light" are unique and irreplaceable (+0.6). The egg's mechanics (requires moonlight, hum of a living heart) are hypothesized but not tested on the page, slightly reducing causal necessity. No major frictions apply.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Flawed genesis" is named explicitly in paragraph two ("Genesis of the Unmade") and echoed at closure ("flawed, imperfect thing"). However, the concept functions primarily as thematic assertion rather than a stake that shapes on-page tactics. The egg's genesis is declared flawed, but the story does not dramatize what makes it flawed or how that flaw constrains Corvin's choices—the orb emerges successfully and transforms the world without complication. The concept appears in two beats (setup, closure reprise) but does not narrow options or impose visible cost. Swappability is high: "ancient relic" or "lost magic" would function identically. Late thematic echo in final paragraph reduces integration further.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Bitterly sweet" appears once as a descriptor of the egg's sound ("bitterly sweet crescendo") and is echoed in the final paragraph ("bitterly sweet struggle"). It does not constrain or enable an on-page action with cost—Corvin does not face a trade-off between bitter and sweet outcomes. The attribute is label-only, invoked to color tone but not dramatized through conflicting choices. Setup is present (+0.3), closure reprise adds lyric resonance (+0.4), but no causal pressure or cost connection is visible. Ornamental use applies (−0.7).</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Assemble" drives two major beats: Corvin assembles the contraption in the central atrium (paragraph four), and the final line closes with "they began to assemble the future." The action is signaled early (+0.8), appears in two distinct beats (+0.9), and the second instance reweights the first with thematic cost (+0.6). However, the contraption's assembly does not create the key turn—the egg hatches autonomously after Corvin adjusts the lens, and the orb's transformation occurs without further assembly. Causal pressure is moderate: the contraption enables the hatching but does not require Corvin to make a high-stakes choice about *how* to assemble. Swappability is moderate: "prepare" or "arrange" could substitute with minor edits (−0.5).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Hypothesizing about everything" is explicitly named in paragraph three and illustrated through Corvin's notes ("requires the hum of a living heart," "tears of a prince who still believes in miracles"). However, the method does not shape on-page attempts—Corvin adjusts a lens, but we do not see him test competing hypotheses or revise tactics based on failed theories. The method is declared in setup (+0.3) but does not constrain middle choices or closure. Summary-only use applies (−0.6): the hypotheses are recounted in past tense rather than dramatized as active problem-solving. Swappability is high: "obsessive experimentation" would function identically.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The suspended palace is vividly described in the opening and recurs throughout. It supplies resources (the archives, the central atrium, the stalactites' resonant tones) and transforms at closure, directly charging the final image when "the metal fad[es], the stone bloom[s] with moss and vines." Early signal is strong (+0.8), beat involvement spans three beats (+1.4), and closure linkage is clear (+1.2). However, the setting does not pressure Corvin's choices—he works uninterrupted, and the palace's transformation is a gift of the orb's magic rather than a consequence of Corvin navigating spatial constraints. Causal pressure is absent: the palace enables but does not complicate tactics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Through the discovery" is loosely tracked: the piece opens after Corvin has found the egg and closes when the orb emerges. However, time is vague—"years" of work are mentioned in backstory, "one night" frames the climax, but no live clock tightens decisions. The timeframe does not constrain tactics or alter moves; Corvin adjusts the lens without urgency, and the egg hatches on its own schedule. Functional presence in setup and closure (+0.6), but no causal pressure or cost connection. Vague tracking applies (−0.4).</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Corvin's desire "to reawaken beauty in a mechanical world" is declared in paragraph three and sustained through his actions (assembling the contraption, working in "quaking reverie"). The motivation shapes two beats: the assembly and the final transformation. However, the motivation is told more than dramatized—we do not see Corvin face a choice between beauty and another competing want (safety, efficiency, acceptance). The orb's success validates his desire without friction or cost. Early signal (+0.8), beat involvement (+0.9), closure linkage (+0.8), but no visible trade-off or conflicting impulse that tests the motivation under pressure. Dramatized conflict is minimal.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Quaking reverie" is invoked explicitly in paragraph four ("worked in a quaking reverie") and sustained through the piece's heightened, trembling diction: "trembled," "shaking," "shuddered," "swore," "stumbled back." The tone modulates with pressure—calmer in the opening palace description, intensifying as the egg cracks—and charges the final image where the palace "sigh[s]" and Corvin's voice becomes "steady." Coherent through turns (+0.8), modulates with pressure (+0.6), closure linkage present (+0.7). However, the tone is somewhat static in emotional register (awe and hope throughout) without a sharp shift that reweights the stake. Single mood with minor modulation trends mid-range.</comment>
