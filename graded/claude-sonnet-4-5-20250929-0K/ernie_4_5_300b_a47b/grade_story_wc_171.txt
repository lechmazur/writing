<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is consistent and her micro-choices show clear pressure, particularly in guiding the delegates through tense negotiation beats. However, interiority relies on abstract phrasing ("the weight of her task felt heavier," "her heart heavy yet hopeful") rather than embodied contradiction under stress. The final act of packing the clipboard feels more like a ritual gesture than a choice with visible cost that forecloses a path. Internal conflict remains largely told rather than dramatized through simultaneous contradictory impulses.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: pressure accumulates through the negotiation day, with a cadence shift at closure as Elara packs the clipboard and descends. Orientation anchors are clear (terrace, midsummer, dawn arrival). The closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis)—Elara's acceptance that "the price of redemption would never be fully paid" reconfigures her stance with a felt cost (endurance of imperfect peace). One meaningful deepening occurs when "the atmosphere had shifted" and delegates' hostility softens, though the turn is summarized rather than dramatized on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The ancient terrace is vividly established with volcanic stone, weathered statues, and celestial tracking. The setting constrains the negotiation spatially (delegates retreat to "shaded corners") and the statues' "silent vigil" charges the final image as Elara descends. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Elara's professional lens. However, the terrace functions more as atmospheric backdrop than active constraint on her tactical choices during peak beats.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—achieving a signed treaty—is clear and signaled early. Pressure coheres through the negotiation arc with one meaningful tightening when "tempers flared" and Elara intervenes. However, escalation is largely summarized ("posturing," "accusations," "slow erosion of trust") rather than dramatized through specific reversals. The treaty signing feels inevitable rather than earned by on-page choices with visible trade-offs. Cost is asserted ("her heart heavy yet hopeful") but not concretely legible in the final image.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The theme of redemption's price emerges through the treaty work and statue imagery, and the flawed-beauty concept is woven into the "rough edges" and "ambiguous language" of the treaty. However, the final paragraphs risk over-articulation: "the price of redemption would never be fully paid" and "the act of trying...was worth the cost" state the theme rather than letting the image carry it. The clipboard's scars offer resonance, but thematic weight is told more than earned through scene pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-person limited on Elara throughout with no head-hopping. Diction is controlled and purposeful, with a formal register appropriate to the diplomatic context. The brief dialogue ("You always bring that thing" / "It's seen more peace than most men") carries subtext and feels natural. However, perceptual signature is somewhat generic—elevated prose without strong character-particular habits of noticing. Voice modulates appropriately with the day's arc but lacks distinct rhythmic or syntactic texture under peak pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Clarity and concision are generally strong, with good information density. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "the weight of her task" is restated multiple times, and "the price of redemption" recurs in near-identical phrasing across paragraphs without added pressure. Template cadence is visible in repeated "Elara [verb]" sentence stems. Stock phrases weaken peak beats: "her heart heavy yet hopeful," "weary resignation," "the fragile line between peace and ruin." Metaphor density ("fragile balance," "slow dance," "bridge between enmity and hope") approaches overwriting without clear pattern payoff. Apply −0.6 for paraphrase loops and template stems, −0.4 for stock metaphor strings.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The core premise—peace negotiator with ritual clipboard—offers a workable frame but lacks a fresh inflection. The negotiation arc follows familiar beats (arrival, posturing, lull, breakthrough, signing) without transformation. The clipboard's significance is asserted rather than demonstrated through irreplaceable function. Emotional specificity is limited by generic phrasing ("weary resignation," "relief and regret"). The terrace setting and celestial timeframe are atmospheric but do not generate non-obvious choices or turns.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara appears throughout and makes decisions (intervening when tempers flare, guiding delegates through clauses), satisfying setup and development gates. She is present at closure but packs the clipboard in a ritual gesture rather than a choice that alters tactics or forecloses a path. Her role as "forever war peace negotiator" frames the story but does not create key turns—the delegates' shift and signing happen around her rather than because of a specific tactical choice with visible cost. Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure presence +0.3, but largely observational with summary pressure −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The ebony clipboard is introduced in the opening, handled or referenced in multiple beats (pressed to chest, traced, eyed by delegate, tapped, signed upon, packed), and present at closure. Setup, development, and payoff gates are met. However, it functions primarily as a symbolic anchor rather than a tool whose unique properties constrain or enable action—any treaty document would serve the same plot function. The scars and ritual significance are described but do not alter Elara's tactics or create visible trade-offs. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +0.4, but high swappability −0.8, ornamental description −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The price of redemption is stated explicitly in paragraph two and repeated in later reflection, satisfying setup. It is invoked during the lull ("the price...was not in the grand gestures but in the small concessions") and restated at closure ("the price...would never be fully paid"). However, it remains abstract theme language rather than a stake or tactical constraint that narrows on-page options. The concept does not change what Elara can or cannot do; it colors her reflections without forcing visible trade-offs. Early theme mention +0.5, two reflective beats +0.4, closure echo +0.3, but label-only without causal pressure −0.6, summary-only −0.4.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Operatively gentle" appears twice as a descriptor of Elara's hands and once modifying her intervention style. Setup gate is met. However, the trait is asserted rather than dramatized through specific action that would fail if she were not gentle—her "questions that probed for common ground" could be executed with many interpersonal styles. No visible trade-off or cost is tied to this specific gentleness. Late signal (second paragraph) −0.3, label-only without constraint −0.6, swappable with "tactful" or "careful" −0.6.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Muster" appears in "muster the will" (paragraph two) and "mustering the courage" (final paragraph), framing Elara's internal preparation. Setup gate is met, and the concept bookends the piece, but it does not create a key turn or decision point. The term describes her resolve without constraining or enabling a specific tactic. Swapping "muster" for "gather" or "summon" would not alter the plot. Early signal +0.5, closure reprise +0.4, but ornamental without causal pressure −0.7, swappable −0.6.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Ritual significance is introduced early ("ritual significance of the object was not lost on her," paragraph three) and invoked at closure ("ritual gesture," "packed the clipboard...its weight a comfort"). Setup and payoff gates are met. The ritual frame colors Elara's relationship to the clipboard but does not shape the mechanics of the negotiation—she does not perform a ritual that alters the delegates' stance or her own tactics. The method is descriptive rather than operative. Early signal +0.6, closure linkage +0.5, but ornamental without beat involvement −0.6, does not shape attempts −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The ancient terrace at midsummer is vividly established in the opening and remains the sole location throughout. Setup, development, and payoff gates are met. The terrace provides spatial choreography (delegates retreat to "shaded corners," Elara "descends the terrace steps") and atmospheric charge via the statues and sun arc. However, it does not constrain Elara's negotiation tactics or supply resources that alter the outcome—the talks could unfold in any neutral venue. Early signal +0.8, continuous presence +1.0, closure image (statues watching, descent) +0.8, but postcard description without tactical pressure −0.9, swappable venue −0.6.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Timeframe is signaled in the opening ("midsummer sun") and tracked through "dawn," "sun climbed higher," "midday," "sun dipped low," "stars beginning to twinkle." The celestial arc provides structure and is invoked as metaphor ("slow dance...mirrored the fragile balance"). Setup and development gates are met. However, the time progression does not tighten decisions or create urgency—the treaty could be signed at any hour without altering stakes. The "slow dance" remains decorative rather than a live clock that forces choices. Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.4, but vague pressure without tactical constraint −0.8, metaphorical rather than operative −0.6.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>"To anchor ideals in practice" is introduced in paragraph two and recurs in the final section ("she had anchored ideals in practice"). Setup and payoff gates are met. The motivation frames Elara's professional mission and is dramatized through her guidance of the delegates ("guiding them through the clauses with a deft hand"). However, it remains somewhat abstract—the friction between ideals and practice is told rather than shown through a specific on-page choice where the two conflict with visible cost. Early signal +0.6, closure reprise +0.6, one beat (clause guidance) +0.4, but told more than dramatized −0.5, limited friction −0.4.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Flawed beauty" is signaled in paragraph two ("acceptance of flawed beauty in compromise") and returns at closure ("the flawed beauty of compromise"). The tone is maintained through mixed imagery (sorrow/serenity, rough edges, ambiguous language) and Elara's acceptance of imperfection. Setup and payoff gates are met. The tone modulates appropriately with the day's arc (tension → lull → weary resolution) and charges the final image of the scarred clipboard. However, the phrase "flawed beauty" is stated rather than embodied solely through image. Early signal +0.7, closure charge +0.9, coherent modulation +0.6, but explicit label in final section −0.5, single dominant mood −0.4.</comment>
