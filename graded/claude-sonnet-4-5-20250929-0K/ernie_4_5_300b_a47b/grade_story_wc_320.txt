<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Kael's interiority relies heavily on abstract concepts ("hush," "beginning in every ending") rather than embodied contradiction. His decade-spanning expertise is asserted but never encounters genuine struggle or blind spots; the tower's systems "resist" for one beat before he solves them by discarding components. The final laugh and awestruck response feel performed rather than earned through prior micro-choices that reveal a hierarchy of conflicting values. No secondary character applies immediate pressure to test his commitment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors appear late: "who" is named at line one but his mission and the hush concept require multiple paragraphs to clarify stakes. The drive lens wavers between causal (he tunes/dismantles to unlock the hush) and accumulative-textural (lyric images of transformation). Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration—the tower reborn—but the cost is invisible: Kael pays no price, loses nothing, and the fragment simply goes inert without consequence to him. The Orientation Test penalty (−0.4) applies; anchors unclear past ~120 words and no disorientation pattern taught.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The gorge, tower spire, and lunar perigee create vivid spatial staging. The Hollywood fragment's azure glow and holographic projection offer concrete sensory work. However, spatial choreography drifts: Kael kneels at a floor fissure, climbs to an observation deck, then the fragment is "on a pedestal of crumbling concrete" without clear transition. The fragment's heat and the river of light charge the final image, meeting the micro-setting gate, but the tower's interior geography remains vague across moves.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding the beginning in every ending via the hush—is signaled early but remains abstract. One tightening occurs when Kael dismantles the console, but no live option is foreclosed; the tower's resistance collapses in a single beat without trade-off. The lunar perigee timeframe is mentioned but never tightens tactics or creates urgency. Closure shows transformation (tower reborn, river revealed) but Kael's agency is observational; he witnesses rebirth rather than choosing between competing goods with visible cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The theme—endings as doorways, silence as potential—emerges clearly from the hush concept and the fragment's dual nature. However, the final paragraph moralizes directly: "It had served its purpose: to show him that endings were merely doorways, and silence was the key" is explicit theme-statement rather than resonant image. The Hollywood fragment shifts meaning (fame relic → mirror of final act) but the insight is told, not discovered through specific struggle. Subtext in gesture and implication is minimal; most meaning is declared.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with no head-hopping. Kael's perceptual signature—copper-coiled headset, dials, celestial interpreter lens—is established early. Distance control holds, though some elevated diction ("serenely electric," "spectral fingers") reads ornamental rather than voice-motivated. The mantra "Discard assumptions" and internal monologue remain consistent. No dialogue present. Psychic distance is steady, and focalization tracks cleanly through action and perception without filter-verb stacks or unmotivated register shifts.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Figurative density is high without pattern-teaching: "skeletal hand," "spectral fingers," "shedding like scales" cluster without clear payoff. Mixed metaphors appear: shadows "stretched toward the moon like spectral fingers" then "merging into a labyrinth of steel and silence" conflates vehicle and tenor. Template cadence in the climax: "He laughed... He reached... He stepped back..." runs three identical stems. Paraphrase loop: "The hush wasn't absence—it was potential" in paragraph four echoes "The hush was a language" in paragraph three without added pressure. Deductions: density without payoff −0.5, template stems −0.5, mixed metaphor −0.4, paraphrase −0.2 = baseline ~5.4 before other craft checks.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The celestial signal interpreter and "hush as language" premise offers a fresh synthesis of decay, radio-tower infrastructure, and cosmic tuning. However, the emotional arc—lone expert unlocks secret through discarding assumptions—follows a familiar template without transformation through specific moral calculus or surprising constraint. The Hollywood fragment's dual identity (fame relic/closure mirror) provides one non-obvious angle. The gorge's river of light and tower rebirth read as ornamental payoff rather than consequence of prior particular choices. Risk-taking in lyric mode is present but does not heighten stakes; the ending delivers spectacle without cost.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Kael appears throughout and makes decisions (adjust headset, climb deck, place fragment, dismantle console), but these moves do not create key turns with visible cost. His expertise is asserted, not tested; the tower's resistance collapses in one beat. The final transformation happens to him (he witnesses rebirth) rather than through a choice that forecloses a path. Present and functional but agency remains observational at closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The Hollywood star fragment is introduced early (setup), handled in multiple beats (floor fissure, pedestal placement, holographic projection, heat searing palm, final inert clatter), and present at closure where it goes dull after serving its purpose. It enables the holographic map and energy surge, shaping two middle turns. However, it does not constrain a choice or impose cost on Kael; it simply works when he uses it, then becomes inert. Strong beat involvement and closure participation but no visible trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The "shard of hush" is seeded early as Kael's target and recurs across beats (tuning, observation deck hum, console syncing, final surge). It shapes his tactic: tune into the silence rather than noise. However, the hush remains abstract; its mechanics are told ("a frequency only celestial interpreters could perceive") rather than dramatized through specific costs or constraints. It reweights meaning at closure (silence as potential) but does not narrow options in prior beats. One causal role plus thematic charge, but swappable with another abstract signal.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Serenely electric" appears twice (opening line's "serenely electric static," final paragraph's "serenely electric tension") as descriptive flourish. It does not constrain or enable a choice, impose a trade-off, or alter tactics. The trait remains ornamental, a tonal label without causal pressure. Present but replaceable with similar adjectives.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Tune" is Kael's primary action: adjusting the headset, syncing dials to the fragment's frequency, creating space for silence by dismantling components. It drives the middle turn (console work) and culminates in the hush surge. However, the tuning succeeds without complication; no cost or failed attempt tests the method. The action is central but mechanically executed without friction. Two beats and closure linkage earn mid-band, but lack of cost caps higher.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Discarding assumptions" is signaled early as Kael's mantra and demonstrated when he dismantles the console's "obsolete functions." It shapes one beat (the stripping-away moment) but arrives late in the second half. The method is told more than shown: "Each discarded component brought the hush into sharper focus" summarizes rather than dramatizes the cost or friction of unlearning. Present in the ending's thematic claim but mechanics remain vague. Setup weak, middle beat present, closure participation thematic only.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The abandoned radio tower city over a gorge is introduced immediately and provides concrete staging: central spire, observation deck, fissure, crumbling pedestal. The gorge's depth and mist create spatial pressure, and the tower's infrastructure (console, wires, gears) supplies resources Kael uses. The setting transforms at closure (glowing veins, river of light) and charges the final image. However, the setting does not constrain a choice or impose a trade-off; it enables rather than pressures. Strong setup, beat involvement, closure participation, but no visible cost tied to location.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Lunar perigee is mentioned in the opening ("Tonight, during lunar perigee, the veil between worlds thinned") and its light recurs (casting towers in stark relief, moonlight on the fragment). However, it does not tighten decisions or create urgency; no clock pressure, no consequence if Kael delays. The timeframe remains atmospheric rather than tactical. Present as setup and visual detail but does not alter moves or impose cost.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"To find the beginning in every ending" is stated as Kael's mission in the opening and recurs in his realization ("the beginning wasn't a point in time, but a state of being"). It frames his goal but is never dramatized as a conflicted choice with competing costs. The desire remains abstract; we see no friction between wanting this and fearing a price. The motivation shapes theme and drives his tuning action, but lacks embodied struggle or visible trade-off. Setup, thematic payoff, but told-only friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Tone blends fantastical elements (celestial interpreter, lunar perigee veil) with practical detail (copper-coiled headset, dials, console dismantling). The grounded physicality of tools and the tower's decay balance the visionary hush and holographic map. However, the tone does not modulate with pressure; elevated diction ("serenely electric," "spectral fingers") persists even in the dismantling beat. The ending's spectacle (glowing veins, river of light) shifts into pure fantasy without practical constraint. Coherent but static, and the final image abandons the practical anchor.</comment>
