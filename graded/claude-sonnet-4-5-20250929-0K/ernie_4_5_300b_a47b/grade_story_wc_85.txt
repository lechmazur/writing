<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's guilt and professional identity are established, but his interiority relies heavily on atmospheric metaphor ("salt and secrets," "guilt that pulsed beneath his ribs") rather than embodied contradiction. The final choice to reveal the truth feels declared more than earned through visible internal conflict—we're told he decides, but the wavering between professional habit and moral imperative isn't dramatized in micro-choices. The watch's trembling functions as an external correlative rather than a moment where contradictory impulses act simultaneously on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (Elias, terrace, dusk) arrive promptly. The piece follows a causal lens: discovering the driftwood carvings → vision of the erased brother → decision to reveal the truth. However, the closure unit—Elias's walk back with his resolve—offers a decision stated in summary ("He would tell her...") rather than a visible, felt cost paid on the page. The final image of him wondering if she'll forgive him reconfigures his stance, but the cost remains projected rather than landed in a concrete beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The cobalt terrace, salt air, and beach setting are vivid and purposeful. The driftwood carvings constrain Elias's investigative method and charge the middle beats with tactile specificity (cedar sliver, split heart). The watch's coldness and the sand shifting beneath his feet anchor sensory perception to his emotional state. However, the terrace itself—signaled early and reprised at the end—remains more atmospheric frame than a constraint that alters his final choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake—discovering the weight of Lila's withheld truth—is clear and drives the beach sequence. The driftwood visions provide one meaningful tightening: Elias learns the brother was erased, which narrows his options to either continue the lie or reveal the truth. The cost of his decision is asserted ("some truths were too heavy to carry alone") but not paid on the page; we don't witness Lila's reaction or a forfeited relationship, only Elias's anticipatory dread.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The theme of silence and erasure emerges through the driftwood particulars and the "sieved hush" motif. However, the final paragraph edges toward thematic summary ("some truths were too heavy to carry alone," "The sieved hush had to be broken, even if it meant drowning in the sound") rather than letting the image of Elias ascending the steps carry the weight without gloss. The question of whether revelation is mercy or betrayal is posed but not answered through concrete action or a resonant final beat.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Elias; no head-hopping. The perceptual signature—"the air tasted of salt and secrets," "guilt twisted, sharp and familiar"—is consistent, though some diction ("sieved hush," "writhing in his chest") leans toward elevated register that occasionally distances rather than embodies. The watch's anthropomorphic reactions (hand "trembled," "vibrated," "grew colder") blur the line between Elias's projection and objective narration. No dialogue appears, so those bullets do not apply.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose is generally clean with strong images (cobalt terrace fading to gray, split heart labeled Father and Son). However, several lines loop or inflate: "the weight of unspoken words pressed harder than usual" and later "her unspoken words a noose around his neck" restate the same core image. "The sieved hush wasn't just absence. It was the space left behind when a truth was swallowed by the tide" is a paraphrase loop within two sentences. Metaphor density in the opening and closing paragraphs risks overwriting without pattern-teaching payoff at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The premise—black market genealogist who manufactures false memories—is fresh, and the driftwood-as-archive method offers a specific angle. However, the emotional arc (guilt-ridden professional decides to tell the truth) follows a familiar redemption template, and the erased-sibling reveal arrives late without prior groundwork in Lila's on-page behavior. The piece synthesizes its elements competently but does not transform them into an inevitable, non-obvious outcome.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias is present throughout and his guilt shapes his final decision, but most of his arc is internalized reflection rather than visible choice under pressure. His professional identity (black market genealogist) is established early and the beach investigation is his agency, but the pivotal turn—deciding to reveal rather than manufacture—is told in future tense summary rather than dramatized in a beat with immediate cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The watch hand appears in three beats: trembling in the opening, vibrating at the first carving, and growing cold at the split-heart carving. However, it functions as a mood indicator rather than a tool that constrains or enables Elias's choices. Its "stopping trembling" at the end signals resolution but does not reweight the closure image with new meaning or cost.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Sieved hush" is named three times and explained as "the space left behind when a truth was swallowed by the tide." It operates as a thematic label rather than a stake-shaping constraint. Removing the phrase and leaving "silence" or "unspoken truth" would not alter Elias's actions or the plot's causality.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Elias's profession—manufacturing false memories—is established in the opening and contextualizes his guilt, but we never see him perform the skill on the page. The attribute enables the premise (he's hired to erase infidelity) but does not constrain a visible on-page action with cost. His final choice is to *not* manufacture a memory, which inverts the trait without dramatizing its mechanics or trade-offs.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Quell" appears explicitly ("to quell the rising panic in a client's voice") as Elias's task, and his decision at the end—to give Lila "the weight of the truth"—is framed as an alternative way to quell her fear. The action drives the plot's middle investigation and final turn, but it could be swapped for "resolve," "answer," or "calm" with minimal structural impact.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Sifting through driftwood carvings is signaled early ("sifting through driftwood carvings along a forgotten shore") and occupies two beats in the middle, where Elias kneels, brushes over pieces, and presses them to his temple to access visions. The method is specific and its mechanics (carved names, ocean preservation, vision trigger) shape his discovery of the erased brother. However, it does not constrain his final choice or appear in the closure image.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The cobalt terrace at dusk opens and closes the story, providing atmospheric bookends. It establishes Elias's spatial position and his return journey, but it does not constrain his choices or supply a resource that alters the outcome. The beach—where the investigation occurs—does more causal work than the terrace itself.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Under the weight of unspoken words" is invoked as a pressure throughout, but the timeframe remains vague. Elias checks his pocket watch once, but no ticking clock or deadline tightens his decisions. Lila is waiting, but we don't see urgency shaping his tactics on the beach or his walk back.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Discovering "the weight of a withheld truth" is Elias's stated goal and drives the beach investigation. The driftwood visions deliver that discovery (the erased brother). However, the motivation is asserted more than conflicted—Elias's professional habit (manufacture lies) versus moral imperative (reveal truth) is summarized rather than dramatized in a choice with visible friction and cost on the page.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Tempered regret saturates the prose: "guilt that pulsed beneath his ribs," "guilt twisted, sharp and familiar," "the cost of his work." The tone is coherent and modulates slightly (reflective on the terrace, immersive during visions, anticipatory on the return). The final image—wondering if Lila will forgive him—sustains the regret but does not charge it with a new emotional dimension or cadence shift that reweights the prior beats.</comment>
