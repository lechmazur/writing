<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lira's interiority is concrete and image-rich (coffee stains as Rorschach, mulberry ache), but her final choice—dismantling the dream piece by piece—feels unmotivated by prior causality; the plants whisper warnings yet she proceeds, then reverses without visible friction. Emotional progression relies on poetic assertion ("a sound brittle as ice") rather than embodied contradiction. The renunciation carries conceptual cost but lacks the on-page micro-choices that would earn Stasis; we see the outcome, not the struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraph and pursues an accumulative lens: Lira contemplates usurping the throne via the violin's reality-fracturing music, weighs two futures (crown vs. garden), and dismantles the dream. The closure unit reads as Earned Stasis—she refuses the throne, the violin shatters—but the reversal from "propagate" (empire path) to dismantle lacks a clear because/therefore turn; the plants' warnings and the violin's string-snaps feel atmospheric rather than causal triggers. Cost is present (the mulberry ache remains) but the tightening is conceptual rather than dramatized pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The velvet observatory, midsummer heat, and ice-crystal violin are vivid and purposeful; the violin's melting under her touch and the plants creeping up the pedestal constrain her final choice. Spatial choreography (teacup, pedestal, window) remains clear across moves. The micro-setting (coffee cup, ice shards in her palms) charges the ending when she lets the violin shatter, meeting the 9+ gate for environment-constrains-choice, but the midsummer sun and velvet curtains repeat without evolving, capping the score in the 7s.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether to seize the throne via the violin's music—is signaled early and sustained, but escalation is declarative rather than dramatized: the violin's strings snap "one by one, each break a note of resolution" without showing Lira's hand in the act or the tactical cost of that moment. The two futures (throne vs. garden) are presented as alternatives rather than choices forged under pressure. The ending forecloses the throne path with felt cost (the ache remains), qualifying as closure, but the tightening lacks agency-driven turns.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme—weighing personal desire against imperial ambition, the cost of dreams—emerges from the violin, coffee stains, and the two futures without direct statement. The final image (violin shattered, child's laugh, mulberry ache) reweights prior material with resonance. However, "propagate" repeated three times edges toward thematic echo, and "to weigh a dream against an empire was to stand on a knife's edge, blindfolded" abstracts the question rather than letting the particulars speak. The ache as permanent stain is earned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, and Lira's perceptual signature (telepathy with plants, coffee as divination) is distinct. Diction is elevated and image-dense ("liquid moonlight," "supernova," "mulberry ache"), fitting a provenance researcher's interior lexicon. However, register consistency wavers: "propagate" and "perforated destiny" read as concept-labeling rather than natural thought under pressure. The piece avoids head-hopping, but the single line of dialogue ("Propagate") feels ritualistic rather than goal-driven, and the metaphoric density (thousand secrets, tiny galaxy, knife's edge) risks overwriting in peak beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout—nearly every sentence carries metaphor (velvet hum, moonlight strings, stardust)—creating a lyric texture that fits the accumulative mode but slows propulsion in the middle third. Paraphrase loops appear: "The observatory's velvet curtains stirred, though no breeze dared enter" echoes "The observatory's velvet walls seemed to exhale" without added pressure. Template cadence in the "propagate" beats (whispered, repeated, said one last time) and stock embodiment ("hands trembled," "heart split") dull immediacy at closure. Clarity remains high; the metaphors cohere, but the density flattens momentum per the overwriting check (−0.5 in Q7 for pattern without payoff at closure).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The premise—provenance researcher with plant telepathy uses a reality-fracturing violin to contemplate empire usurpation—is specific and non-obvious, avoiding template plots. The fusion of coffee divination, ice-crystal instrument, and perforated destiny creates a memorable synthesis. However, the core dilemma (throne vs. garden) resolves through renunciation without fresh inflection; the dismantling is stated rather than shown with a tactical or moral surprise. The violin's shattering and the child's laugh offer lyric closure but do not transform the established question in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Lira is present throughout and her role as provenance researcher frames her attention to the violin's history, but her profession does not constrain the key choice; she could be any character contemplating power. She reads coffee stains and dismantles the dream, but these acts are assertions rather than decisions with visible trade-offs. Present in setup and closure, functional in middle (she pours coffee, touches the violin), but swappable with "occultist" or "seer" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The ice-crystal violin appears in setup (pedestal, shimmering strings), middle (Lira's touch melts it, it hums), and closure (strings snap, shards melt in her palms, it shatters into stardust). It shapes two beats—her divination and the dismantling—and its destruction is the visible cost of renunciation. However, the violin's "perforated destiny" and "thirsty for meaning" are told rather than shown through its mechanics; it does not enable a tactic under pressure, only symbolizes the choice. Strong lyric reprise but not indispensable causally.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Perforated destiny" is named once in the second paragraph ("holes in its fate where choices bled into chaos") and echoed in "gaps where love or loss might slip through," but it remains a thematic label rather than a rule that alters tactics. It does not constrain Lira's divination method or the violin's use; removing the phrase would not change the plot. Present as atmospheric concept, not causal agent.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Lira's accidental telepathy with plants is signaled early (office overgrown, gift spilled into inanimate things), used in two beats (plants whisper warnings, vines creep up pedestal at her command), and present at closure ("letting the plants' whispers wash over her"). The trait enables her final renunciation—she listens to the plants rather than the violin—so it shapes one key turn. However, the mechanics are vague (how does she hear them? what cost?) and the telepathy could be replaced with intuition or divination without major edits. Functional but not irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Propagate" is whispered to the coffee, then to the plants, then to herself, driving three beats: divination (coffee stain blooms), tactical choice (plants respond by creeping), and closure frame ("not to the future, but to herself"). The action is repeated with escalating meaning and ties the ending to the method. However, the word is ritualistic rather than mechanically specific; "grow," "spread," or "choose" could substitute with minor loss. Strong lyric structure, essential to two beats and closure participation, but not mechanically indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Coffee-stain divination is introduced early (she pours coffee, dips her finger, the stain blooms into patterns showing throne and garden) and drives the key choice by revealing two futures. The method is signaled, used once in the middle, and its result (the two paths) shapes the ending. However, the mechanics are underspecified—does she always see futures in coffee? does the violin amplify it?—and the method does not return at closure; she dismantles the dream without consulting the stains again. One beat involvement, setup and middle present, closure absent; functional but not revisited.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The velvet observatory at midsummer is anchored in the opening and provides atmospheric detail (heat, curtains, foundation), but it does not pressure Lira's choice or supply resources that alter outcome. She could perform the same divination and renunciation in any private room. The "midsummer sun blazed, indifferent" is poetic but postcard; the setting does not constrain her physically or socially. Present throughout, logically consistent, but replaceable without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Before the promise loses its glow" appears once in the first paragraph as an internal reminder, but the timeframe is never dramatized—no clock tightens her decision, no consequence of delay is shown. The phrase is abstract and does not recur or shape tactics. Ornamental thematic flourish, not a live pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The desire to weigh a dream (personal garden, child) against an empire (throne, rewriting the creed) is named explicitly in the middle and drives the two-futures structure. Lira's final choice—dismantling the dream—enacts this motivation with cost (the mulberry ache remains). However, the friction is told ("heart split between two futures") rather than shown through contradictory impulses in action; she contemplates, then renounces, without visible struggle between wants. Present in setup, middle, and closure; causal role in ending, but the tension is asserted rather than embodied.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Mulberry ache" is named twice (middle and end: "a bruise that refused to fade," "only the ache remained—a mulberry stain on the fabric of the world") and coheres with the reflective, elegiac register throughout. The tone modulates slightly—contemplative opening, brittle laugh, quiet dismantling—but remains static in the mid-melancholy band without sharpening under pressure. The final image (ache as permanent stain) charges closure with the tone, meeting lyric-reprise standards. One meaningful modulation (the laugh), closure linkage strong, but no escalation in tonal pressure across beats.</comment>
