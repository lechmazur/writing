<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lila's interiority is concrete and embodied through the pendant and her hands-in-soil work, and her confession aftermath creates visible pressure. The final choice to invite Elias and plant the sapling shows agency with cost (opening vulnerability after viral exposure). However, Elias functions more as gentle facilitator than genuine pressure source; his arc is minimal, and the "grafting" metaphor is articulated by him rather than discovered through Lila's struggle. Internal contradiction appears ("proactive about grief" / "Or reactive?") but remains discussed rather than enacted in competing impulses within a single beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph without penalty. The piece follows a causal lens: Lila waits → Elias arrives → dialogue deepens understanding → joint planting action. Closure is a Decisive Change (she invites him to stay, they plant together, she accepts moss in the pendant) with relational cost (exposing protected space to another). However, the tightening is modest—Elias's arrival doesn't narrow options so much as confirm a pre-existing readiness, and the viral confession functions as backdrop rather than live pressure that forces the final choice.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The moss garden and rusted server racks are vivid and purposeful, filtering through Lila's transformation project. The drip-pattern stones and bioluminescent moss ground spatial choreography cleanly. The pendant (amber/obsidian/moss) constrains the pivotal gesture when Elias presses moss into the setting, charging the final image. Sensory detail (honeyed hush, mosslight, snow outside) modulates with scene needs and reflects Lila's protective curation of the space.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: grafting new meaning onto grief after public exposure. One meaningful tightening occurs when Lila unclasps the pendant and Elias adds moss, a concrete trade-off (risking alteration of brother's relic for new growth). Agency is clear in the planting and invitation to stay. However, escalation is gentle—Elias's orchid and affirmation don't genuinely narrow Lila's options; she was already moving toward openness. The cost is relational vulnerability rather than a harder choice between competing goods.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme (healing through integration rather than erasure) emerges organically from the grafting metaphor, drip-pattern stones, and pendant transformation without overt statement until "healing wasn't about erasing the past but letting it breathe"—which edges toward summary but follows enacted choices. The ending offers a resonant image: sapling, moss-threaded pendant, hands in soil together. Subtext operates in Elias's quiet approach and Lila's hesitation before unclasping. The final "conversation" line risks restating theme but stays anchored in the planting action and mild ambiguity about impermanence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Single-POV third limited holds cleanly with a distinct perceptual signature: Lila's attention to patterns, protective curation, amber pendant as talisman. Dialogue carries subtext (Elias's "You've been proactive" / Lila's "Or reactive?") and pursues goals (reassurance, invitation). Psychic distance modulates purposefully from close interiority to slightly wider framing at closure. Minor slip: "The garden's hum became a language, and she understood" verges on generic epiphany phrasing, though the prior concrete actions (planting, moss insertion) earn the shift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is generally high (server racks as anchors, drip pattern mapped to sun angle, obsidian shard inside pendant). Clarity is strong across spatial choreography and action sequence. Two friction points lower the score: "honeyed hush" appears three times with slight synonym churn ("deepened," "settled," "container") without clear escalation, and the closing paragraph includes minor template cadence ("All those wounds, now threaded…"). The figurative language (drips as heartbeat, grafting as conversation) remains coherent but borders on density in peak beats without full pattern-teaching.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The moss-garden-in-data-center premise offers a fresh spatial fusion, and the drip-pattern stones show inventive specificity. Grafting metaphor is purposeful but well-trodden in grief narratives; here it's enacted through pendant alteration rather than only discussed, which elevates execution. Elias as supportive botanist and the viral confession as inciting pressure are functional but not surprising. Transformation test: plot and emotional arc (reclusive griever opens to connection) would hold with different setting/names, suggesting originality rests more in sensory texture than structural ingenuity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Lila is watchful (tracing drip patterns, noticing icicle rhythm) and decisions are present (arranging stones, unclasping pendant, inviting Elias to stay, planting sapling). Her observation feeds action rather than remaining passive. However, the key turns (opening the pendant, planting) feel more enabled by Elias's gentle prompts than driven by internal conflict forcing a breakthrough; her watchfulness curates but doesn't create crisis.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Amber pendant appears in beat one (adjustment, warmth), beat two (discussion of brother/fossilized time), beat three (unclasping to reveal obsidian), and beat four (moss pressed into setting, swinging in mosslight at closure). It evolves from static relic to active site of transformation and constrains the pivotal choice (risking alteration). Strong causal and closure linkage; only modest deduction for the slight ornamental quality in the opening touch before it gains function.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Honeyed hush" is named three times and creates atmospheric texture (thick silence, container for vulnerability). It shapes tone and reflects Lila's protective curation but does not constrain a choice or alter tactics on the page. The concept remains thematic echo rather than a pressure mechanism that changes options. Present and coherent, but functional role is limited to mood.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Quietly proactive" is attributed to Elias in exposition (taught grafting, brings orchid and sapling, kneels to place orchid, offers moss insertion). One visible trade-off: his gentle interventions enable Lila's shift but cost him no on-page struggle or resistance; the attribute guides his supportive actions but lacks friction. The trait is demonstrated more than label-only, and it enables key beats, but does not constrain or create cost for him.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Lila proffers the drip pattern to Elias as metaphor early ("she'd proffer the pattern… as a metaphor"), then together they arrange stones along the lines and plant the sapling at the center. The action frames the encounter and anchors the closure (joint work on the pattern). However, "proffer" itself is slightly swappable with "offer" or "show"; its necessity rests on the pattern's presence rather than the verb's unique properties. Strong beat involvement and closure linkage; modest deduction for verb replaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The drip-pattern is seeded early (traced weeks ago, stones arranged), explained mechanically (east-to-west melt by sun angle), used tactically (orchid placed at center, stones arranged jointly), and present at closure (planting sapling at pattern's center). It shapes the space's logic and the final collaborative gesture. The pattern constrains where they plant and charges the ending image as a map of transformation. Strong causal and closure presence; slight deduction because the mechanics (sun angle) arrive mid-story rather than opening.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Abandoned data center turned moss garden is introduced immediately, grounds all spatial choreography (server racks as anchors/terrariums, concrete floor with drip stains, chamber heart), and supplies the bioluminescent moss Elias uses to alter the pendant. The setting enables the grafting metaphor literally (plants on tech ruins) and provides the resource (moss) that resolves the pendant dilemma. Micro-setting (pendant itself as container) also functions. Indispensable to premise, tactics, and closure image; no other locale would support the layered transformation logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"After the confession goes viral" is stated in paragraph one and creates emotional backdrop (strangers flood inbox, Lila is raw). However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions on the page—Elias's arrival feels awaited rather than urgent, and no ticking clock alters moves. The "after" context is present but does not function as live pressure that narrows options or accelerates choice. Functional setup; modest causal weight.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Lila's desire to graft new meaning is stated early ("wanted to graft new meaning onto old wounds"), dramatized in the pendant unclasping and moss insertion (exposing inner layers, risking alteration), and tested in the choice to invite Elias (expanding brother's story vs. losing him twice). Friction between cost (fear of second loss) and want (healing through integration) drives the central beats and closure. Strong causal and closure linkage; slight deduction for one moment of direct articulation ("I wanted to graft…") rather than pure enactment.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Protected vulnerability" is embodied in the moss garden's honeyed hush, Lila's waiting after public exposure, her hesitation before unclasping the pendant, and the final line "the garden held its heat" as snow falls. Tone modulates from heavy silence to shared work to warmth at closure, tracking the emotional arc. The tone charges the final image (heat held, pendant swinging) and coheres across turns. Strong tonal control and closure presence; minor deduction because "protected vulnerability" is also directly named ("she realized the garden's silence… was protected vulnerability"), reducing some resonance.</comment>
