<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation ("aberrant mercy," cradle empathy in arms of steel) is stated repeatedly but never tested by a choice that forces him to trade one value for another. The retrocognitive trait remains label-only; it produces atmospheric flashbacks but never constrains a present decision or imposes visible cost. Interiority leans on abstract phrasing ("warm coldness," "gentle radical") and therapy-speak ("aberrant mercy") rather than embodied contradiction. The final act—placing the tessera—reads as symbolic gesture without foreclosing an alternative path or dramatizing internal conflict.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The piece anchors who/where/when adequately within the first paragraph. Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the tessera-placement ritual accumulates symbolic weight rather than causal turns. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant)—the final image reweights the plaza and Elias's resolve—but the cost remains abstract ("promise forward," "warm coldness") rather than felt on the page in a specific forfeiture or trade-off. One meaningful deepening occurs when Elias fits the tessera into the stepping stone, but no prior choice narrows his options; the act is uncontested.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The shattered sky, ash-tasting air, and ruined minaret anchor locale and tone effectively. The tessera and stepping stone function as micro-setting elements that charge the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate for this category. Sensory detail is vivid ("stars burned like fractured glass," "air tasted of ash and ozone") and filtered through Elias's retrocognitive perception. Spatial choreography is clear throughout the single-scene frame.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—symbolic rebirth of the plaza—is signaled early but never tested by opposition or scarcity. Elias encounters no friction: no competing focalizer, no physical obstacle, no internal hesitation that costs him something else. The tessera placement is a unilateral act; pressure does not escalate because nothing resists or narrows his options. The resolution is gestural rather than earned by a choice that forecloses an alternative with visible cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Theme (transformation through memory, mercy amid ruin) emerges from image and action rather than direct statement, meeting baseline expectations. The tessera's return with reweighted meaning provides one layer of resonance. However, "aberrant mercy" and "warm coldness" are stated repeatedly as mantras without dramatic friction; the ending offers a mood rather than a non-literal answer to a central question. The artisan flashback enriches texture but does not complicate Elias's stance or impose a thematic trade-off.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV is stable; no head-hopping. Diction carries a consistent elevated register ("retrocognitively trapped," "aberrant mercy," "warm coldness") that reads as character-particular rather than generic, though some phrases ("gentle radical," "arms of steel") border on stock formulation. Psychic distance is controlled; the one dialogue line ("Aberrant mercy," "Via the chipped patterns…") serves ritual tone rather than pursuing a goal. Perceptual signature—flickering past/present, artisan's memory—is purposeful and legible throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear with purposeful rhythm variation ("The shadow was gone, and the air hummed…"). However, paraphrase loops appear: "He had not stopped the fire, nor could he undo the past. But he could rename the present…" restates resolve without added pressure; "warm coldness" recurs three times as a label without evolving embodiment. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes adequately. Figurative language ("stars burned like fractured glass," "waves rippling outward") is coherent, though "warm coldness" as a recurring phrase reads more as thematic assertion than felt paradox. Filter verbs ("He saw," "He thought") cluster in retrocognitive passages but remain voice-motivated and legible.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The premise—retrocognitive protagonist ritually restoring a symbolic plaza after catastrophe—offers a lyric angle on post-disaster recovery. However, the core narrative (lone figure performs uncontested symbolic act) follows a familiar template; the tessera-placement beat could be transplanted to many settings without structural change. "Aberrant mercy" and "warm coldness" are fresh phrases, but their meanings remain asserted rather than dramatized through conflicting choices. The artisan flashback provides texture but does not introduce a non-obvious moral calculus or earned reversal.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elias ("gentle radical") is present throughout and performs the central action (tessera placement). However, he makes no choice that alters tactics or forecloses an alternative; his role is observer and ritualist rather than decision-maker under pressure. The trait is signaled early and shapes the tone, but without contested agency the character does not drive key turns.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The tessera appears in multiple beats: discovered in rubble, traced for its pattern, pressed into the stepping stone, and invoked in the final image ("a single mosaic tessera held the promise of tomorrow"). It is handled on the page and its chipped pattern reweights the plaza's meaning at closure. The object is indispensable to the symbolic arc and charges the ending image, though no cost is tied specifically to possessing or using it.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Aberrant mercy" is stated as Elias's mantra and motivation ("to cradle empathy in arms of steel") but never tested by a choice that forces him to balance mercy against another imperative. It functions as thematic label rather than stake-shaping force; removing the phrase would not alter the plot's mechanics or Elias's actions. Present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Retrocognitively trapped" generates flashbacks to the artisan and the plaza's past but never constrains a present action or imposes a visible tradeoff. Elias's retrocognition enriches atmosphere and provides backstory, yet he does not struggle against temporal disorientation or sacrifice present awareness for past insight. Label-only trait without on-page cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Rename" frames the story's central act: Elias renames the plaza through tessera placement and declares "He had renamed the world, one chipped stone at a time." The action is literalized in the stepping-stone ritual and invoked in the final line. It appears early, recurs at the climax, and charges the closure image, though the renaming itself is symbolic rather than causal—no option is foreclosed by the act.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The method—"via the chipped patterns on a mosaic stepping stone"—is signaled when Elias examines the tessera's interlocking waves, then dramatized when he presses it into the stepping stone's gap. The patterns mirror each other, and the fit is described on the page. However, the mechanics are symbolic rather than tactical; the method does not shape an attempt or impose a constraint. Present in setup and payoff but does not drive middle choices.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The ancient plaza beneath a shattered sky anchors the entire scene, provides the ruined minaret and stepping stone, and supplies sensory pressure (ash, ozone, rubble). The setting is present throughout and charges the final image ("In the ancient plaza, beneath the weight of history…"). It does not constrain Elias's choices—no spatial obstacle or resource scarcity alters his plan—but it is indispensable to tone and closure resonance.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"After the great fire" establishes backstory and the ruined state of the plaza. The timeframe is invoked in the opening and final paragraphs but does not create urgency or tighten decisions; Elias performs his ritual without a ticking clock or competing deadline. Present as context but does not shape tactics or escalate pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"To cradle empathy in arms of steel" is stated as Elias's motivation and paired with "aberrant mercy." It frames his symbolic act and is invoked in the closing lines. However, the desire is never dramatized through a choice where empathy costs him strength or vice versa; no friction arises between the paired values. Functional but told rather than tested.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Warm coldness" is declared three times as Elias's tonal signature ("The warm coldness of his tone," "warm coldness of his resolve"). The phrase attempts to modulate hope and resignation but remains a label rather than an embodied contradiction enacted through syntax or pacing. Tone is coherent and purposeful—lyric, elegiac—but the specific oxymoron does not charge the final image in a way unique to this exact phrase.</comment>
