<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation ("to find the place where stories begin") is clear but remains abstract throughout; her interiority relies heavily on conceptual vocabulary ("void," "absence," "glimmering parole") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The hooded man's single eye and frosted knife are vivid but his choice to take the jar lacks dramatized internal conflict—he simply agrees and leaves. The final smile and understanding ("stories didn't begin in grand gestures...") reads as unearned epiphany, not a realization forged through on-page struggle or cost. No micro-choices under pressure reveal competing values; the stance crystallization at the end feels asserted rather than earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (Elara, her stall, opening day) appear early. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: the man's request and the floating note create a pattern of absence → presence. However, closure relies on Elara's internal assertion ("she understood") rather than a visible cost or constraint that forecloses a path. The golden residue and her walk outside suggest Resonant Reconfiguration, but the "grateful for the absence" framing tells rather than shows a felt trade-off. One meaningful deepening occurs (the man's departure with the jar), but the cost remains conceptual and diffuse, not anchored to a specific on-page sacrifice or altered tactic.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The glass orchard library, cloud sea, and translucent panes are vivid and consistent. Sensory detail ("mist," "prismatic shards," "hummed") is present but does not constrain Elara's choices or alter her tactics; the setting functions as backdrop rather than pressure. The floating note at the end is a purposeful reprise that charges the final image, lifting the score. Spatial choreography is clean (stall, aisles, outside), and the golden residue in her palm anchors the closing beat. The body (her hand) becomes micro-setting at closure, satisfying the 9+ test partially—but the environment does not force a trade-off earlier.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Elara's search for where stories begin—is signaled early but remains abstract and untested by a concrete on-page dilemma. The man's request introduces a complication, yet his departure lacks friction or cost to Elara; she watches and wonders but does not act or renounce. The floating note's return suggests a tightening, but it arrives as external validation rather than a choice-driven reversal. No visible price is paid (time, resource, relationship) that alters later tactics. Pressure is coherent under the Accumulative lens but does not escalate to a moment where Elara must choose between competing goods or endure a foreclosed path with felt consequence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Theme (stories arise from absence, the space before creation) is woven through imagery (jars of silence, bottled moonlight, golden residue) rather than stated outright, which is strong. The final realization ("stories didn't begin in grand gestures...") veers toward direct statement and risks thematic echo, though it stops short of moralizing. The floating note as a "fragment of melody, unattached to any song" offers a concrete image that reweights the premise, supporting Conceptual Repricing. However, the piece leans on conceptual vocabulary ("glimmering parole," "void," "absence") that abstracts rather than grounds; subtext in the man's exchange is minimal. The ending invites reflection but the resonance rests more on assertion than on earned discovery through struggle.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization is stable and perceptual signature is present (Elara notices jars, absences, the man's eye). Dialogue feels purposeful and carries subtext ("I incise the void"), though the man's lines are somewhat expository. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("glimmering parole," "possibility pooled like water") that, while evocative, risks distancing the reader from immediate embodiment. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping. The final paragraph's rhythm ("She stood, her heart light, and walked...") modulates appropriately. Brief filter-verb use ("wondered," "felt") is voice-motivated and does not dull immediacy significantly. No voice convergence or POV leakage observed.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally good. However, synonym churn and conceptual paraphrase loops appear: "void," "absence," "emptiness," "silence" cycle without added pressure; "glimmering parole" recurs as thematic tag rather than evolving image. The phrase "glimmering parole—a prisoner of its own potential" relies on metaphor that self-explains rather than trusts the image. Stock body language ("her mind racing," "her heart light") in key beats dulls specificity. The final paragraph's "she was ready to begin again" is scaffolding that recaps rather than advances. Figurative density in the opening (prismatic shards, swirling sea, translucent panes) is high but remains legible. Template cadence is minimal; no major clarity breaks. Apply cumulative artifact penalty (paraphrase loops, stock phrases, scaffold line) totaling approximately −0.6 to −0.8 within Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The premise—vendor of absences in a floating library—offers a fresh frame and avoids overt genre clichés. However, the emotional arc (unsettled → understanding) follows a familiar trajectory of epiphany without struggle, and the "stories begin in small things" insight is not a non-obvious synthesis. The glass orchard library and bottled moonlight are vivid particulars, but the man's shadowed coat and frosted knife read as ornamental rather than transformative choices that reshape stakes. The piece commits to its metaphysical premise but does not push past the conceptual middle; the resolution (golden residue, floating note) validates Elara's initial belief without complication or cost. Swapping the library for another liminal setting would not fundamentally alter the arc. No close echoes of famous works, but the vendor-of-intangibles trope has wide precedent.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara (clean slate vendor) is present throughout and her profession frames the stall and its jars. However, her role as "vendor" is largely observational; she hands over the jar and reflects but does not make a choice that narrows options or forecloses a path. The final decision to "begin again" is internal and uncontested. She appears in setup, middle (transaction), and ending (reflection), meeting all three gates. Yet her choices do not create key turns—the man drives the transaction, the note arrives unbidden. Her profession is essential to the premise but her agency within it is passive. Score: setup +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure presence +0.4, but low causal pressure and passive role cap near mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Bottled Moonlight is introduced early (first paragraph, "most prized possession"), handled in the transaction beat (placed in the man's palm, glows faintly), and returns obliquely at the end (golden residue from the floating note, implied connection). Three touches across setup, middle, and closure. However, the jar itself does not constrain a choice or alter tactics—Elara simply gives it away with a warning. The ending reprise (golden residue) reweights its meaning as a cycle of return, supporting lyric resonance, but the object's specific properties (moonlight, glimmer) do not enable or block an action under pressure. Score: early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.6, but low causal pressure and no cost tied directly to the object cap below 6.5.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Glimmering parole" appears as a label in paragraph two ("bottled moonlight held the glimmering parole of unwritten narratives") and again in the man's exchange ("it remains a glimmering parole—a prisoner of its own potential") and once more in paragraph nine ("The glimmering parole had found its way back"). It functions as thematic vocabulary but does not shape on-page tactics or narrow options. The concept is present in setup and echoed at closure, but it remains ornamental—a metaphor recited rather than a rule or constraint that Elara or the man must navigate. Two gates (setup, closure mention) allow eligibility to ~6.0, but ornamental use and swappability (could be "seed of story," "nascent tale") lower the score significantly.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Mindfully scattered" is mentioned once in paragraph two ("Her stall was mindfully scattered with jars") as description of spatial arrangement. It does not constrain or enable any on-page action, nor does it carry a visible cost or tradeoff. The trait is label-only; we never see Elara choose to scatter mindfully or pay a price for the arrangement versus another layout. Single mention in setup only; no middle or closure participation. Score: ornamental use −0.8, swappable (could be "carefully arranged," "artfully displayed") −0.6, label-only −0.3, summary-only −0.3. Cumulative cap and default anchor place this in the low band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"Incise" appears once in dialogue: "I incise the void." It is a metaphor for Elara's method but does not drive a major turn or action beat. No character physically incises anything on the page; the verb remains abstract. The transaction (handing over the jar) and the final understanding do not trace to incising as a concrete act. Single mention in middle dialogue; no setup or closure participation. Missing setup gate caps at 4.6, but also missing closure participation caps at 2.8 (lowest cap wins). Swappable with "open," "mark," "cleave" without altering story logic. Score reflects ornamental, single-mention use with no causal work.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"By quantifying absence" appears in Elara's dialogue in the middle beat: "By quantifying absence, I make room for creation." The method is named but its mechanics never matter on the page—we do not see Elara measure, count, or weigh absences; she simply places jars on a stall and hands one over. The phrase is thematic claim without procedural consequence. Single mention in middle; no setup or closure participation. Missing setup and closure gates apply cumulative caps (missing setup → 4.6, missing closure → 2.8; lowest wins: 2.8). Label-only and summary-only use further lower the score. Score reflects the method being told but not shown or used to shape attempts.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The glass orchard library floating on clouds is introduced in paragraph one and remains the story's spatial frame throughout (aisles, stall, closing, Elara stepping outside). It provides vivid backdrop and anchors orientation. However, the setting does not pressure choices or supply resources that affect outcome—Elara's decisions (handing over the jar, walking outside) would work in any liminal marketplace. The clouds and glass panes do not constrain movement or enable tactics. Three gates present (setup, middle, closure) allow eligibility above 6.0, but the lack of causal pressure or micro-setting constraint caps the score. The setting is memorable and consistent but functionally replaceable with another metaphysical venue. Score: early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, but ornamental use −0.8, swappable −0.6.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"During the lull...on the library's first opening day" is stated in the opening sentence and reprised at closure ("When the library closed for the night"). The timeframe brackets the action but does not tighten decisions—no live clock or deadline alters Elara's choices. The lull versus rush is mentioned but not exploited; the man could arrive at any time with the same outcome. Two gates (setup, closure mention) allow eligibility to ~6.0, but the time remains vague and untracked in the middle, and it does not narrow options or raise cost. Score: early signal +0.5, closure mention +0.3, but vague tracking and no causal pressure −0.8, swappable (could be "any quiet afternoon") −0.6.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation "to find the place where stories begin" is stated in paragraph two and reprised in her final realization ("she understood: stories didn't begin in grand gestures..."). The desire is clear and frames her profession, satisfying setup and closure. However, it is never conflicted on the page—no on-page friction between this want and a competing need or cost. The man's request unsettles her (paragraph seven), but she does not struggle or sacrifice to pursue her goal; understanding arrives as revelation rather than hard-won choice. Two gates (setup, closure) allow ~6.0 eligibility, but told-only framing and lack of dramatized friction lower the score. Score: early signal +0.6, closure linkage +0.5, but told-only −0.6, no cost connection −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Integrated fragmentation" as tone must be inferred from the text's structure and diction. The piece weaves conceptual fragments (jars of absence, floating notes, prismatic light) into a coherent frame, and the prose modulates from vivid description (opening) to dialogue to reflective realization (ending). Tone remains stable and contemplative throughout, without jarring breaks. However, the fragmentation does not intensify under pressure or create dissonance that charges the final image; instead, the ending resolves fragments into unity ("she understood"). The tone supports the concept but does not shift or reweight meaningfully at closure. Coherent modulation across beats supports mid-band; lack of pressure-driven tonal shift or closure charge prevents higher scoring. Score: coherence +0.8, modulation +0.6, but static mood and no closure charge −0.6.</comment>
