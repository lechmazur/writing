<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation (decode dead tongues → rewrite life's work) is clearly stated early, but her characterization relies heavily on told competence ("carefully resourceful," "arcane linguist") rather than contradictory impulses shown in action. The moment she admits ignorance to the guardian represents growth, but the internal conflict between pride and humility needed more embodied texture during the journey. The "renegotiate" pivot feels functional yet somewhat externally imposed rather than emerging from a dramatized flaw or contradiction. Minor penalty for therapy-adjacent phrasing ("acknowledge their ignorance") in a pivotal beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens infers as Causal with Accumulative undertones (maze, diary cipher, gaps). Orientation anchors who/where/when adequately by the opening paragraph. The closure unit—Elara entering the library with Kael after proving her worth—reads as a Decisive Change, but the cost remains abstract: she "embraced the unknown," yet no specific forfeiture or tactical constraint is visible on the page. The "renegotiate" mechanic structures the plot, but Kael's overnight vanishing and the guardian's sudden test feel more like plot convenience than inevitable pressure. One meaningful tightening occurs (decode *Silence* shelf), but the final image lacks the felt weight required for high-band entry.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The labyrinthine bookstore is vividly rendered (sentient shelves, spiders in hollow spines, velvet-bound books), and sensory details filter through Elara's arcane expertise (Old Thalassic counter-charm, grooves forming patterns). The blue orchid and diary function as micro-setting anchors that charge two beats. However, spatial choreography becomes vague in the "cavernous chamber" finale, and the mountain's interior lacks the persistent physical constraint that would push this into the 7+ band. Time folding is mentioned but never exploits tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (find the Library of Unlearned Lessons) is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs when the guardian demands she decode *Silence*, narrowing her path. However, escalation is thin: the poisonous-fungi book sidestepped without consequence, and the guardian's test resolved quickly via intuition and childhood tune. The final cost—entering the library—feels more like arrival than renunciation; no live option is visibly foreclosed, and Kael's presence dilutes agency at closure. Coincidence (Kael vanishes, map fragment appears) complicates but borders on convenience plotting.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Theme of ignorance versus mastery emerges through the diary's gaps and the Door's inscription, but the orchid and "Symphony of Forgetting" feel like symbolic convenience introduced late rather than earned from prior particulars. The final line ("ready to listen") gestures toward thematic resonance but doesn't reweight earlier material with undeniable cost. The "renegotiate" motif recurs but remains more plot mechanic than thematic depth. No overt moralizing, yet the epiphany ("gaps mirrored her own blind spots") trends toward thesis statement rather than felt discovery.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Single-POV third-person limited maintains stable distance and character-specific diction (arcane linguist idiom). However, perceptual signature flattens under stress: Elara's observations remain equally articulate throughout, and her internal voice doesn't degrade during the guardian encounter. Dialogue with the guardian is functional but lacks subtext or character distinction. The childhood-tune beat ("her mother had claimed") introduces backstory without present friction. Minor filter-verb stack in the climax ("She ran her fingers… feeling grooves… suddenly, she understood") dulls immediacy without material harm to closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear with varied sentence structure, but the opening paragraph overloads figurative density (labyrinthine bookstore, no entrance, shifting maze, human-skin tomes, arcane linguist—all in one sentence). Paraphrase loop in paragraph two: "disoriented… muttering… collapsed… nursed back to health, trading knowledge" recaps the same rescue beat without added pressure. Template cadence appears: "She adjusted… She scowled… She flipped… She ran." Stock metaphor "struck chord" and "rustling parchment" voice lack specificity. Minor register drift ("acknowledge their ignorance") at a peak beat. Information density is adequate; no causality breaks, but momentum drags during the cipher-decoding exposition.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The labyrinthine-bookstore-as-trial premise combines familiar fantasy tropes (sentient library, time traveler, lost knowledge) without a transformative angle. The "gaps in cipher = gaps in self-knowledge" metaphor is present but not surprising. The botanist's diary and blue orchid add texture yet feel ornamental rather than irreplaceable to the core logic. Elara's childhood tune resolving the *Silence* shelf introduces a late rule without groundwork. The rescue mission and renegotiation framing gesture toward freshness but execute at median within the genre. No close echoes of famous work, yet the synthesis reads more assembled than inevitable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara (arcane linguist) is present throughout and makes one key decision: admitting ignorance to the guardian and decoding *Silence*. However, her expertise is told more than shown—Old Thalassic counter-charm and cipher-reading occur but lack on-page cost or wrong turns. She observes and reacts more than she drives reversals. The childhood-tune solution feels intuitive rather than linguistic, diluting the character's specificity. Present in closure but shares agency with Kael. Mid-band: shapes one turn, but swappable with another scholar-type without major rewrites.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The botanical diary appears in three distinct beats: (1) opening exposition (Kael's possession → Elara inherits it), (2) blue orchid falls as clue at the fungi-book shelf, (3) orchid presses against her thigh during *Silence* decoding, triggering the intuition. It seeds the "gaps" mechanic early and recurs with evolving function. However, the diary's cipher-as-key remains more told than demonstrated—we never see Elara decode a specific gap that alters her tactics. Present in closure prep but not the final image. Strong development, but irreplaceability is moderate; another fragmentary map or journal could substitute with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Rescue missions (core concept) frames the initial stake: Kael vanished, Elara pursues. However, the "rescue" resolves off-page convenience—Kael is already at the library center, unharmed, when Elara arrives. The concept does not shape tactics or escalation; the guardian test and cipher-decoding could function identically in a solo quest. Present in setup and mentioned at closure ("You came!"), but the mechanics are generic retrieval without cost tied to rescue-specific friction. Functional but highly replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>"Carefully resourceful" (attribute) is asserted in narration ("carefully resourceful by nature") and shown in one beat: sidestepping the poisonous-fungi book with a counter-charm, pocketing the orchid as clue. These actions demonstrate competence but lack visible cost or tradeoff—no moment where caution conflicts with urgency or where resourcefulness enables one path while foreclosing another. The trait does not constrain the guardian negotiation or *Silence* decoding. Present and plausible, but trends toward label-only. One causal beat keeps it at mid-band threshold.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Renegotiate" (action) structures two major turns: (1) Kael's ash-scrawled word initiating the mission, (2) Elara offering to restore lost languages in exchange for passage, which the guardian accepts. The term recurs with thematic weight and drives the climax dialogue. However, the mechanics feel somewhat external—"renegotiate" as plot device rather than organically discovered tactic. The guardian's acceptance is swift, reducing friction. Essential to at least two beats and present at closure; the exact word's recurrence charges the frame, but the negotiation itself could be rephrased without breaking story logic. Strong integration, yet not fully indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"By researching gaps" (method) is seeded early (diary cipher, gaps in text) and mentioned as Elara's realization ("research gaps… fill in blanks"). However, the actual mechanics remain vague—no on-page scene shows Elara cross-referencing entries or testing hypotheses. The *Silence*-shelf solution arrives via intuition and touch, bypassing explicit research. The method appears in setup and is invoked at the midpoint turn, but does not shape the climax attempt. Present in two beats as theme/explanation, but swappable with "by intuition" or "by decoding patterns" with minor edits. Functional, borderline replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The labyrinthine bookstore (setting) is vividly established and exerts constant pressure: sentient shelves test resolve, the *Silence* section provides the climax puzzle, and the bookstore gatekeeps the library. It supplies three distinct obstacles (fungi book, shifting maze, velvet spines). However, the mountain itself remains backdrop—no terrain or spatial constraint alters Elara's tactics. The bookstore's sentience could function in any large magical repository. Strong atmospheric presence and two causal beats, but not irreplaceable to the exact "entire mountain" specification. Solid integration, shy of essential.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"After the time traveler arrives" (timeframe) anchors the inciting event (Kael's arrival three days prior, vanishing overnight). However, time pressure is absent thereafter—no ticking clock, and Elara notes "hours later (or was it days?)" without consequence. The timeframe sets up causality but does not constrain choices during the journey or closure. Present in setup, mentioned once in the middle, absent from ending. Functional framing, but easily replaced with "after discovering the diary" or similar. Swappable with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"To find the Library of Unlearned Lessons" (motivation) is stated early ("crystallized then: rewrite her life's work") and drives Elara's pursuit through all beats. She voices it to the guardian and achieves it at closure. However, the motivation remains largely surface-level—no on-page friction between professional ambition and ethical cost, or between wanting knowledge and fearing what she'll lose. The desire is consistent but not conflicted in choices. Present in three beats including closure, but depth is limited. Solid functional integration without the felt tradeoff that would reach higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Unheard symphony" (tone) is introduced early ("air hummed like a struck chord, an unheard symphony of whispers") and recurs at closure ("the unheard symphony swelled, a chorus of voices"). The motif charges the frame and modulates from individual whispers to collective chorus, supporting the thematic shift toward listening. However, tone itself remains relatively static—mysterious and heightened throughout—without the pressure-driven modulation (e.g., panic narrowing to focus) that would demonstrate tight craft. The symphony image bookends purposefully and reweights the ending, qualifying for lyric-resonance credit, but the tone does not escalate or breathe with scene tension. Reprise is strong; dynamic range is moderate.</comment>
