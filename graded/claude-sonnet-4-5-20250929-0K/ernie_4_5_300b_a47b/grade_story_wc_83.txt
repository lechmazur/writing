<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's grief and rage are embodied through concrete actions—slamming the console, descending into the crater—and her final stance (walking away as "a seer. A disrupter") is earned by the vortex encounter. However, the transformation from survivor to "seer" arrives through assertion rather than dramatized contradiction; her internal conflict (grief versus forward motion) is declared more than it acts simultaneously in scene. The geode-handling and descent provide agency, but the peak beats rely on labels ("anger," "grief," "alive") rather than letting contradictory impulses collide without summary.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraph. The piece follows a causal lens: Elara presses the geode → node appears → she enters → vortex interaction → new crystal and transformed stance. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): she walks away with the new crystal, options reweighted from passive survivor to active hunter. Cost is legible—the observatory is gone, she discards Orion's caution—but the vortex's mechanics (how it generates the new crystal) remain abstract, weakening the because/therefore chain at the climax. One meaningful tightening (crater descent under alarm pressure) supports escalation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The floating observatory, glass floors, fractal veins, and smoldering crater are vivid and purposeful. The geode guides her "like a compass," the node's ozone/ash smell grounds the descent, and the final image (veins of light in the ground) charges her new path. Spatial choreography is clear (observatory above → spiral staircase down → vortex at node). The recurring crystal object constrains the hunt choice and charges closure, meeting the 9+ gate in principle, though the observatory's "labyrinthine corridors" are mentioned but never navigated, leaving one setup underused.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding and accessing unused potential—is signaled early and drives the descent. Pressure tightens when alarms blare and Orion urges abort, forcing Elara's defiant choice to continue. The vortex encounter provides one reversal (images of her fiancé alive appear, but she focuses on "raw edges"), and her final walk with the new crystal narrows options (she's no longer a survivor, now a hunter). However, the node's instability is declared but never tests her with a tangible cost during access; she steps in, the geode shatters, light erupts, and she emerges with a better tool—luck resolves the peak beat, undercutting agency at closure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Theme—trauma as fuel, grief transmuted into agency—emerges through the geode-as-key and the vortex's "unused potential" image. The final crystal and her walk toward new nodes offer a resonant, non-literal answer to the opening question (how to survive catastrophe). Yet the piece leans on prompt-adjacent phrasing: "unfiltered awakening," "perturbation," "intangibly tangible" are invoked as labels rather than discovered through particulars. The closing assertion "She was no longer a survivor. She was a seer. A disrupter" risks Thematic Echo, stopping just short of overt moralizing but still articulating the thesis rather than letting the image speak.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and close to Elara's rage-sharpened perception. Diction is elevated but consistent ("tremor in her hands," "grief made solid"), and her internal voice—bitter laugh, defiant shouts—remains distinct under pressure. Orion's dialogue is functional and contrasts with her recklessness. However, peak beats drift toward abstract register ("the intangibly tangible—a sensation like static electricity, like grief made solid") that sits at the edge of the POV's plausible real-time lexicon during crisis. Psychic distance is controlled; no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and sentence openings are mixed, but several artifact patterns appear. "Intangibly tangible" and "perturbation theory" recur as unexplained tokens, treated as mystical rather than concrete. The line "It was the tremor in her hands, the way her breath hitched…" uses an "It was" scaffold, and "The hunt had changed her. She was no longer a survivor. She was a seer. A disrupter" runs three template-stem sentences in sequence. Mixed metaphor: "grief made solid" clashes with "sensation like static electricity." These issues cluster in high-pressure beats (vortex, ending), triggering artifact penalties and disallowing 9+ globally. Information density is otherwise high, and no paraphrase loops.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The premise—grief-driven quest through sci-fi "perturbation theory" to access trauma's energy—attempts a fresh synthesis, and the geode-as-compass is a specific touch. However, the core frame (lone survivor seeks mystical/technological closure device in ruined zone) is recognizable, and "perturbation theory" and "intangibly tangible" function as unexplained magic words rather than transformed scientific concepts. The vortex sequence leans on familiar beats (images of lost loved one, protagonist resists, gains power object). The final walk toward new nodes hints at serialization rather than self-contained risk. Transformation is partial; the emotional truth (rage as awakening) is present but not deeply particularized.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elara (drone strike wedding survivor) is present from the opening line, frames the inciting memory, and drives all key turns: pressing the geode, defying Orion, descending, entering the vortex, walking away. Her choices narrow options (discarding caution, the device) and the closure image depends on her transformation. Setup, development (console slam, descent), and payoff (final walk) are all present. However, her survivor status is more backstory anchor than live constraint; the story could function with a different traumatic origin. Strong causal role and closure linkage, moderate irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The geode crystal appears in the opening paragraph (dug from rubble, edges biting her palm), is pressed to the console to reveal the node, guides her descent "like a compass," grows hot and shatters in the vortex, and is replaced by a new, brighter crystal that she carries in the final walk. Five distinct beats, causal pressure (unlocks the scan, enables the hunt), and closure linkage (new crystal charges her transformed stance). Cost connection: the original shatters; the new one commits her to further hunts. High integration, though the crystal's properties ("intangibly tangible") remain abstract.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Unfiltered awakening" is mentioned once in the opening paragraph as "a way to see the world as it truly was, unshackled from denial," then echoed thematically in the final realization ("awake"). It colors the emotional arc but does not constrain a middle choice or supply a tactical method. The vortex access and transformation could proceed identically if framed as "revenge," "understanding," or "power." Present as theme claim, not as a stake-shaping mechanic. Setup and payoff (thematic reprise) only; no middle development. Ornamental, replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Intangibly tangible" is assigned to the crystal in paragraph one by Orion, repeated in the vortex beat ("a sensation like static electricity, like grief made solid"), and used to describe the paradox of accessing unused potential. It functions as a mystical label rather than a trait with mechanical cost. The crystal's tangible use (pressing, guiding, shattering) does not depend on this attribute; it could be "quantum-entangled" or "emotionally resonant" with no scene edits. Present across beats but swappable; no visible tradeoff tied to the paradox itself.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The hunt structures the entire plot: Elara comes to the observatory to hunt unused potential, Orion recommends aborting "the hunt," she scans and descends to complete it, and the final lines declare "The hunt had just begun" and "The hunt had changed her." Three beats (scan, descent, closure stance) and causal pressure (the hunt justifies defying Orion, entering the vortex). However, "hunt" is broad; the action could be reframed as "quest" or "search" with minimal impact. Strong presence and closure linkage, moderate specificity.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"Perturbation theory" is named by Orion in paragraph two ("a method to map the ripples of trauma"), Elara repeats it internally ("It was the tremor in her hands…"), and she shouts it in the vortex. The theory is described as method but never demonstrated; no mechanics explain how the geode interacts with the node or why the vortex yields a new crystal. The term appears in three beats but remains a label without causal work. Present, logically mentioned, but the hunt's success does not visibly depend on understanding or applying the theory. Ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The floating observatory is introduced immediately, houses the AI and console, provides the glass floor through which veins are revealed, and offers the spiral staircase descent to the crater. It supplies the scanning tool and high vantage. The timeframe element (circuit breakers cooling) ties to the observatory's systems. However, the observatory itself is passive backdrop; the key choice (entering the vortex) occurs outside it, in the crater. Setup, middle resource (console), and mentioned at closure ("The observatory was gone"), but it does not constrain the vortex decision or charge the final walk. Functional, limited causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Circuit breakers cooling ("will reset in 12 minutes") is announced early by Orion, creating a ticking clock. Alarms blare when breakers overheat, Elara orders continued scanning, and Orion's final transmission says "Circuit breakers reset." However, elapsed time is never tracked on the page—no countdown, no accelerating choices tied to minutes remaining. The reset announcement feels post-hoc rather than a live constraint. Setup and payoff mentions only; the timeframe does not visibly tighten the descent or vortex entry. Present but not pressurizing tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elara's motivation—to find where unused potential pools—is stated in paragraph two, drives the scan ("Show me"), justifies her defiance of Orion's abort command, and propels the crater descent and vortex entry. The closing walk follows new veins of potential, confirming the desire's continuity. The motivation is conflicted in one beat (vortex images of her fiancé test her focus), though she resolves it quickly by choosing "raw edges" over the vision. Three beats, causal role, closure linkage. Cost: she loses the observatory and commits to endless hunts. Strong integration, brief friction moment.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Tone balances grief and defiant energy throughout: bitter laugh, "sound like shattered glass," "bleak exhilaration," "wild thing." The opening's smoldering crater and charred bones establish bleakness; the final smile and sure steps deliver exhilaration. Tone modulates under pressure (rage-sharpened during the vortex shout, breathless triumph in the walk) and charges the final image ("she felt *alive*"). However, several lines ("Caution's overrated," "Let them come") risk veering into action-hero bravado, briefly tensioning the bleak foundation. Coherent, purposeful, with one minor drift. Strong closure linkage.</comment>
