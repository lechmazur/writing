<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lira's motivation (confronting maternal guilt through firmware repair) is signaled but her interior remains generic—"hands trembled," "breath hitched"—without contradiction or embodied specificity under pressure. The decision to enter the firmware reads as plot obedience rather than a choice shaped by competing impulses; no visible cost forecloses a path on the page. Dr. Althea Voss's reveal as Lira's mother arrives late and unearned, a convenience that replaces psychological causality. Elara exists solely to exposit stakes without applying immediate interpersonal pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed—"laboratory of lost sounds" anchors setting but not spatial or temporal stakes until Elara's exposition past the first third. The closure (letters quiet the cries, amber fades, lab silent) lands on the page but the causal chain is stitched by convenience: the amber pulses when needed, the letters are already stacked and ready, and the nursery materializes without prior setup. The firmware's "memory labyrinth" and Althea's disembodied voice function as expedient devices rather than causally motivated elements. Lens reads as attempted Causal but expedience undercuts linkage; cost (guilt dissolving) is asserted, not dramatized with visible forfeiture.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The lab's "ozone and regret" and amber's "honeyed glow" offer texture, but spatial choreography is vague—where does the scanner sit, how does Lira position herself relative to the amber and machines? The digital corridor and nursery lack anchoring detail; "flickering light" and "antiseptic and old paper" are stock sensory notes. The amber constrains one mid-story choice (entering the firmware) but does not charge the final image with environmental cost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake (silence the firmware's dissonance) is signaled at the halfway mark via Elara's exposition. One tightening occurs when Lira kneels and reads the letters, but the escalation is expositional rather than tactical—no visible trade-off or foreclosed option. The baby's cries "soften" off-camera; the firmware rewrites itself mechanically. Agency is passive reception (Althea's voice guides, the lab groans externally) rather than a protagonist choice that narrows options with felt cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Theme of unspoken goodbyes and maternal guilt emerges through the letters and Althea's name-drop, but the resolution—"guilt dissolving into understanding"—is stated rather than earned through image or paradox. The final paragraph tells the outcome instead of offering a resonant non-literal answer. The amber and letters recur but function as convenient unlocks rather than accumulating pressure that reweights meaning.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable, but diction toggles between lyric elevation ("silver quill against the canvas of flesh") and expository flatness ("They tried to silence the world's dissonance"). Dialogue is functional but lacks subtext—Elara's lines exposit stakes without implication. The phrase "firmware's haunted by the scientists who encoded their guilt" is explanation rather than character-specific perception. Under peak stress (entering the firmware), interiority compresses to generic signaling ("Lira froze") without rhythmic or perceptual distinctness.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops appear: "guilt… guilt of that silence" and "dissonance… dissonance of old guilt" recycle phrasing without added pressure. Template cadence: "The air tasted of ozone and regret… The air smelled of antiseptic and old paper" mirrors structure mechanically. Stock metaphors ("silver quill," "canvas of flesh," "digital ghosts") appear without fresh inflection. The climax—"guilt dissolving into understanding"—summarizes instead of enacting transformation through concrete image. Clarity is adequate but momentum drags through exposition-heavy beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The premise (tattoo artist + haunted firmware + maternal letters + time-folding) assembles disparate prompt elements without organic synthesis—each feels bolted to the next. The constellation tattoos vanish after the opening; "time folds" is declared but not demonstrated through perception or consequence. The firmware-as-guilt-code and letters-as-cure read as convenient symbolic toggles rather than lived-in world logic. No bold structural risk or non-obvious moral calculus elevates the material; the resolution follows a predictable forgiveness-heals-trauma arc without transformation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Lira is present throughout but her tattooist identity disappears after the opening beat; she does not tattoo, does not apply craft skills to the firmware challenge. Her key action (reading letters aloud) is reactive instruction-following. The profession is ornamental setup, not causal driver.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Amber appears early (display case), pulses to signal the inciting turn, and is positioned under the scanner to enable entry. Its insect and glow recur across three beats. Removing it would require rewriting the entry mechanism, though the thrift-store desk backstory and honeyed light are decorative. It shapes one middle turn and the entry tactic but does not charge the final image after the lab goes silent.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Haunted firmware is exposited midpoint, drives the goal (rewrite the code), and the nursery/Althea voice are its manifestation. The firmware's mechanics (translates cries, holds scientists' guilt) enable the letters-cure logic. However, it resolves passively—"the firmware's code rewrote itself"—rather than through protagonist struggle. Present across beats but agency is offloaded to the system.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Translates baby cries into silence" is told in Elara's exposition and echoed in the nursery's wail, but Lira never hears a live baby cry on the page, and the trait does not constrain her tactics. It thematically colors the guilt-motif but remains abstract rather than a visible, costly tradeoff she navigates.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Tether" is named ("I need to tether the firmware") but its mechanics are vague—does she bind, anchor, or redirect? The actual action is reading letters aloud in the firmware's memory; "tether" is label-only and swappable with "repair" or "rewrite" without structural change. Late signal, minimal tactical specificity.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Handwritten letters are seeded early (thrift-store desk, false bottom) and Elara hands them over mid-story. Lira reads one aloud in the nursery, which triggers the firmware's rewrite. The method shapes the climax beat and the desk backstory primes the amber's provenance, but the letters' content ("I left because I loved you too much") is generic and the mechanics (voice → code rewrite) are unexplained. Two-gate presence (setup, payoff) with thin middle development.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Laboratory appears in the title and opening, houses the machines that amplify frequency, and the nursery within the firmware is the closure location. The lab's "walls hummed," machines "roared to life," and groaned during the rewrite—tactile presence that enables the entry and reflects the transformation. Spatial vagueness (where is the scanner, how big is the lab?) and the shift to the digital corridor/nursery are abrupt, but the setting participates in three beats and the final silence.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"When time folds in on itself" is declared by Elara ("Time's folding," "boundaries blur") but never demonstrated through perception, impossible simultaneity, or loop. The firmware's "memory" is metaphor, not temporal mechanic. Lira experiences a spatial shift (lab → corridor → nursery) but no paradox or urgency tied to folding time. Present as theme label, absent as constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Motivation to hush guilt is stated midpoint ("her mother's sobs had once been muffled… guilt… etched itself into her bones") and again in Althea's prompt ("hush the dissonance of old guilt"). Lira's decision to enter the firmware and read the letters enacts the desire. The cost—confronting maternal abandonment—is named but not felt as friction; she completes the task without on-page struggle. Setup and payoff present; middle friction thin.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Meteor hush" is not explicitly present but implied in the quiet closure ("lab was silent, the dissonance gone") and the amber's fading glow. Tone oscillates: lyric elevation ("silver quill," "honeyed glow") in the opening, expository flatness in the middle ("They tried to silence," "rewrite the firmware's code"), and summary calm at the end. Modulation does not track pressure; the nursery's wail is resolved through assertion rather than tonal cadence that charges the final image.</comment>
