<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Lira's motivation to find the library of unspoken words is declared but never tested by competing pressures or choices with visible cost. Interior life consists largely of observations and determination-assertions ("her resolve," "cautious exuberance") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final "smile beneath her shawl" and mixed fear-excitement read as label-only emotion without embodied specificity. No meaningful change or renunciation occurs; she simply arrives at her goal without forfeiting anything on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive by the second paragraph, satisfying the test. However, no decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing with visible cost occurs at closure—Lira finds the library and smiles, but no option is foreclosed, no stance crystallizes under pressure, and no felt price is paid. The story reads as arrival-at-goal rather than transformation or earned stasis. Drive lens appears Causal (she follows clues, measures delays, pulls a book), but the final beat offers discovery without cost, failing the closure gate.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The glowing library with pulsing walls and mist is vividly rendered and the confidence man's watch recurs across beats, but neither constrains a choice or charges the final image with cost. Sensory detail (amber light, dampened shawl, humming watch) is filtered through Lira's perception and the spatial choreography remains coherent. The setting supplies atmosphere but does not pressure tactics or alter the outcome, capping the score below 7.0 per the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake (find the library) is signaled early, but pressure remains static throughout—Lira investigates without meaningful obstacles, reversals, or trade-offs. The watch guides her, the pattern emerges on cue, and the book appears when she pulls it; no tightening narrows options or forces a cost. The resolution is arrival-by-persistence rather than protagonist agency under escalating pressure. One deepening (plotting delays to find the pattern) provides modest escalation, but the ending delivers discovery without visible price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The theme of unspoken truths and hidden knowledge emerges from the premise, but the ending offers discovery-as-reward rather than a resonant reweighting with cost. The confidence man's watch and cyclical cipher are mentioned but not integrated into a non-literal thematic answer. No epiphany is earned through sacrifice or renunciation; Lira simply finds what she sought, and the final image ("words began to appear") asserts revelation without ambiguity or felt consequence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with consistent distance and perceptual filter (Lira's restless determination, her attention to light patterns and the watch). Diction is controlled and purposeful ("ghostly serpents," "cyclically reversed"), though some phrases veer toward elevated register ("the weight of time itself pressing against her chest"). No dialogue appears. The prose maintains a singular narrative stance, but the voice lacks a character-specific perceptual signature beyond a generalized quest-narrative texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Clarity and rhythm are generally strong; sentences vary in structure and information density is adequate. However, several paraphrase loops and scaffold phrases appear: "sharp and restless" → "mind that refused to sleep" restates the same idea; "moved faster now, her steps echoing" → "She traced the pattern with her finger, following the loops" recycles forward-motion beats without adding pressure. Filter verbs ("felt," "seemed," "wondered") cluster in expository passages, dulling immediacy. The final beat—"words began to appear"—summarizes the discovery rather than dramatizing it with concrete image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The premise (mysterious library, backward-ticking watch, cipher in light delays) assembles familiar quest-narrative and puzzle-box elements without a fresh synthesis. The confidence man's watch and propagation-delay cipher are intriguing but remain ornamental—neither transforms the emotional or moral stakes. The cyclically reversed pattern and "unspoken words" motifs echo common metaphysical-mystery templates, and the ending delivers discovery-as-reward without thematic risk or subversion. No bold perspectival or structural choice elevates the material.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Lira (veiled dreamer) is present throughout and her goal drives the sequence, but her choices are investigative observations rather than decisions that create turns. She documents, moves through aisles, plots delays, and pulls a book—all linear progression without competing pressures or visible trade-offs. She appears in the closure beat (opening the book, smiling) but no agency-driven reversal occurs there. Early signal and multi-beat presence earn mid-band placement, but lack of causal pressure and closure-shaping choice cap the score.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The confidence man's watch is introduced early (paragraph 3), recurs in paragraph 4 ("she would glance at the confidence man's watch"), and is referenced again when she plots the pattern ("mirrored the movement of the confidence man's watch"). It enables her to decode the cipher and is described with specific, irreplaceable properties (cracked face, backward hands, melodic hum). However, it does not appear in or shape the final image—the book's appearance and the unspoken words are the closure focus. Two-beat involvement and causal linkage lift the score, but absence from closure and lack of visible cost cap it below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The unfolding cipher shapes Lira's tactics across the middle section: she documents propagation delays, plots them on a graph, and follows the cyclically reversed sequence to the correct shelf. This changes her options and enables the discovery. It is seeded early ("the answer lay in an unfolding cipher") and returns at closure when the blank pages shift and rearrange, embodying the cipher's nature. Causal pressure, multi-beat involvement, and closure linkage satisfy all three gates. The cipher is integral to the story's logic and ending, earning solid integration in the 6+ band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The attribute "cyclically reversed" is introduced in paragraph 3 and applied to the cipher's sequence. It constrains Lira's investigation (she must trace loops and reversals) and matches the watch's backward movement, shaping her method. However, no visible cost or trade-off is tied to this reversal on the page—it is a descriptive feature that organizes the puzzle but does not force a choice or foreclosure. Present in setup and development, but closure participation is indirect (the pages "shift and rearrange," echoing the concept without a cost-bearing turn). Mid-band for functional causal use without felt price.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The action "document" drives Lira's investigation: she documents "every strange occurrence" in her journal, marks propagation delays, plots them on a graph, and uses the resulting pattern to locate the correct shelf. This action appears in setup, middle, and closure (the journal's graph guides her to the book that reveals the unspoken words). Removing it would break the story's causal chain. Multi-beat involvement, causal pressure, and closure linkage satisfy all gates. Strong integration earns a score in the upper 6-band, approaching 7.0 but shy of indispensability since an alternate method (direct observation, trial-and-error) could theoretically substitute.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The method "through propagation delays" is seeded in paragraph 3 ("the answer lay in… the propagation delays of the library's glow") and dramatized in paragraph 5 when Lira documents the delays, marks flickers, and plots them to reveal the pattern. This method constrains her tactics and enables the discovery. It appears in setup and development, shaping the middle turn, but is not directly invoked in the closure beat (the book's appearance is the focus). Two gates met; causal pressure evident. Swappability is low (no other method is offered), lifting the score into the upper 5-band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The glowing library in mist is established in the opening paragraph and remains the spatial anchor throughout. The amber light's propagation delays supply the cipher Lira decodes, and the library's hum matches the watch's tone, creating a cohesive sensory environment. The setting's physical properties (shifting books, intensifying glow) affect Lira's investigation and the final revelation. Setup, development, and closure participation are present. The library is integral to the puzzle's mechanics and the ending's atmosphere, earning solid mid-6 integration. However, it does not constrain a choice with visible cost, capping the score below 7.0 per the rubric.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The timeframe "between two fateful letters" is introduced in paragraph 1 and mentioned again in paragraph 4 ("The second letter had not yet come, but Lira felt its approach like a storm"). However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions or alter tactics—Lira investigates at her own pace with no live clock pressure. The second letter never arrives on the page, and no consequence of delay is dramatized. Present in setup, but lacks development (no mid-scene pressure from time) and closure participation (the discovery occurs without time-driven urgency or cost). Functional mention without causal work caps the score below 4.0.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Lira's motivation to find the library of unspoken words is declared in paragraph 2, repeated in paragraph 4, and drives her actions throughout (documenting delays, plotting patterns, pulling the book). It is the story's dominant stake and is present at closure when she opens the book and the unspoken words appear. Setup, development, and closure participation are satisfied. However, the motivation is never tested by competing desires or visible trade-offs—Lira pursues it without friction or cost. Causal centrality and multi-beat presence earn upper-6 integration, but lack of dramatized conflict or price caps the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Tone "cautious exuberance" is asserted in paragraph 5 ("Lira's cautious exuberance grew with each revelation") and echoed in the final line ("her heart racing with a mix of fear and excitement"). The phrasing attempts to establish a dual emotional stance, but it is label-driven rather than embodied in scene texture. The prose maintains a steady, quest-driven register without modulation under pressure or tonal reweighting at closure. Present in middle and ending, satisfying two gates, but static delivery and reliance on emotion labels rather than rhythmic or diction shifts limit integration to mid-5 band.</comment>
