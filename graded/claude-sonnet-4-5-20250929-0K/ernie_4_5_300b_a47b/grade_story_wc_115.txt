<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias's core motivation—seeking "the weight of a swallowed truth"—remains abstract and doesn't generate meaningful internal contradiction. His skepticism is declared ("religiously skeptical") but never tested; the supernatural reveal simply overwrites his worldview without visible cost to his identity. The final gesture of leaving the valve wheel reads as symbolic rather than a choice that forecloses a lived path. Interiority leans on stock phrasing: "the thrill of the unknown gnawed at him," "his skepticism fraying."</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story anchors who/where/when by the opening and delivers a Decisive Change (Elias finds the mill's buried secret and leaves the valve as sentinel), but the causal chain weakens mid-sequence: the valve "fit perfectly" and the hologram appears without dramatized resistance or cost to access. The climactic revelation—workers panicked, the collapse was a cover-up—arrives via exposition dump rather than through Elias's discovery choices. Closure lands with conceptual cost (the truth is "too heavy to carry"), but the final image of leaving the valve doesn't reweight prior tactics or constrain a visible option on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The tunnel's slick walls, crumbling concrete cap, and descending shaft guide spatial choreography cleanly. The valve wheel—beaded, rusted, icy—becomes a micro-setting element that constrains Elias's choices across beats (turn it to open the intake, fit it to the control panel). However, the underground chamber's "colossal machinery" and "blue light" remain generic; the 1920s mill-worker hologram supplies exposition rather than emerging from embodied environmental cues. The valve charges the final image by becoming a "silent sentinel," meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding the buried secret—is clear, but escalation is thin: Elias encounters locked doors (the concrete cap, the control panel port) that the valve wheel conveniently opens without trade-offs. The hologram's confession is delivered to him rather than forced by a choice under pressure. The final decision to leave the valve is framed as renunciation ("too heavy to carry"), yet no on-page cost—lost proof, social consequence, identity shift—is made legible. One tightening occurs (the valve unlocks the chamber), but it doesn't narrow options or charge the ending with felt price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme—human failure amplified by greed versus supernatural lore—emerges organically from the hologram's confession and Elias's final realization. The valve wheel recurs with shifting weight (trophy → talisman → sentinel), and the phrase "weight of a swallowed truth" reappears at closure. However, the final paragraph edge toward moralizing: "Some truths, he thought, were too heavy to carry" states rather than dramatizes the cost. The piece resists easy binaries (ghost versus machine, accident versus cover-up) but doesn't fully trust the image to carry thematic resonance without commentary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Elias with consistent psychic distance. Voice texture is present—"yawned," "gnawed," "drowsy alertness"—but leans on familiar descriptor phrases. The mechanical voice hissing from the valve and hologram are staged clearly. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register during crisis: "the hush that followed a sudden confession—a pause so thick it felt like a living thing" reads writerly rather than filtered through Elias's documentary-explorer lens. No head-hopping or tense breaks.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and spatial blocking is clear. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "the weight of a swallowed truth" is declared in paragraph one, echoed in the hologram's line, and restated in the final paragraph without added pressure. Stock metaphor intrudes at peak beats: "dawn bled through the ivy," "a living thing." Filter-verb stack in the climax paragraph ("Elias's hands trembled," "Elias stood alone") dulls immediacy. The hologram's exposition—"We were supposed to shut it down. But we didn't. We… couldn't"—tells rather than shows the mill's collapse. Apply −0.6 for paraphrase loops and stock phrasing at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The premise—urban explorer finds haunted machinery concealing industrial cover-up—follows a well-worn "abandoned place hides dark secret" template. The valve wheel as literal key and the holographic confession are functional but conventional genre moves. Elias's arc (skeptic encounters proof, leaves artifact behind) doesn't transform the trope. The story commits to its frame but offers no fresh synthesis or lived detail that would make this mill, this explorer, or this secret irreplaceable. Execution is competent; originality is limited.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elias is present throughout and his explorer role motivates entry to the tunnel and descent into the chamber. However, his choices are reactive—he turns the valve because it fits, he descends because the shaft opens—rather than generating key reversals. His "recklessness" is declared but not tested by a trade-off or cost. Present in setup and middle beats but does not drive closure; swappable with "curious investigator" without major edits. Two-gate participation (setup, middle) places him in the 4.0–4.9 functional range; reactive agency and limited causal pressure keep him mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The beaded valve wheel appears in four beats: plucked from the boiler room (backstory anchor), turned at the intake pipe (opens the shaft), inserted into the control panel (activates the hologram), and left as sentinel (closure image). Its beads clicking and turning icy add sensory specificity, and its unique design ("fit perfectly") constrains Elias's path. The wheel is essential to unlocking both physical and narrative gates and reappears with reweighted meaning at closure (trophy → key → memorial). All three gates met; strong causal role and closure linkage; slight swappability (another mill component could serve) and lack of visible cost tied specifically to handling it keep it from 8.5+.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The "factory ghost shift" concept frames the inciting rumor and is realized when the hologram explains the workers' failure to shut down the machine. It shapes Elias's goal (document the supernatural activity) and reappears in dialogue ("You're late for the shift"). However, the concept is mostly delivered via exposition rather than altering Elias's tactics on the page; the machinery's hum and the hologram are effects of the shift rather than live constraints. Present in setup (the rumor) and payoff (the hologram's confession), but middle development is thin. Two-gate participation places it in 5.0–6.9; thematic resonance and closure linkage push it to mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>Elias's "religiously skeptical" stance is declared in paragraph one ("dismissing ghosts as folk tales") but never constrains an on-page choice. When the valve speaks and the hologram appears, his skepticism "frays" without visible cost—no identity crisis, no tactical hesitation that alters the outcome. The trait is ornamental: present in setup but absent from middle beats and closure. Label-only mention without action pressure or trade-off; one-gate participation (setup) caps at 4.6, and ornamental use lowers further to low 3s.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elias's plan to "appraise" the valve's significance via talk-radio psychic recordings is mentioned in paragraph two but does not drive a key turn. He plays one clip ("The mill's ghost isn't a person—it's the machine"), which tonally supports the reveal but does not change his tactics or unlock the chamber—turning the valve does that. The appraisal action is present in setup and briefly invoked mid-sequence, but the hologram's confession arrives independently. Two-gate participation (setup, brief middle nod) without causal necessity; swappable with "investigate" or "test" without structural loss. Functional but replaceable, mid 4s to low 5s.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.7</grade><comment>The method—interpreting frantic calls to talk-radio psychics—is mentioned in paragraph two and one clip is played in paragraph three, but the interpretation itself does not shape Elias's approach or unlock new information. The psychic's line ("the machine is hungry") echoes the theme but does not guide his next move (turning the valve, descending). The method is ornamental: present in setup, briefly invoked, absent from closure. One-gate participation (setup) without causal work or cost; decorative mention lowers score to low 3s, and lack of mechanics drops it further.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The abandoned train tunnel anchors all action: its mouth choked with ivy establishes entry, its slick walls and curve guide Elias's descent, the intake pipe at its heart supplies the valve's lock, and the chamber below houses the machinery. The tunnel's spatial features constrain movement (he must descend, fit the valve, navigate darkness) and its sealed cap creates the first obstacle. Present in setup, middle beats (the cap splits, the shaft opens), and implied at closure (he climbs back "to the tunnel's mouth"). All three gates met; strong spatial pressure and beat involvement. Slight genericness (many abandoned structures could serve similar function) and lack of unique sensory signature keep it from 8.5+.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The timeframe "during the hush that follows a sudden confession" is invoked once in paragraph three as a figurative beat ("a pause so thick it felt like a living thing") but does not function as a ticking clock or deadline. The narrative spans entry at midnight to dawn at closure without time pressure shaping tactics. The "hush" is atmospheric—a single charged moment—not a constraint that tightens decisions. One-gate participation (middle, as a metaphor) without escalation role or closure linkage. Functional as mood but replaceable; swappable with "eerie silence" or similar without structural impact. Mid 3s to low 4s.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Elias's desire "to find the weight of a swallowed truth" is declared in paragraph one, drives his goal throughout (he follows the rumor, fits the valve, descends), and reappears in the hologram's confession ("the truth… it drowned") and his final realization ("the weight of a swallowed truth—here it was"). The motivation shapes all three gates (setup, middle pursuit, closure reconfiguration). However, the phrasing remains abstract and is told rather than embodied in conflicting micro-choices; no visible friction between wanting proof and fearing consequence appears on the page. All three gates met with thematic charge at closure, but lack of dramatized internal conflict and over-reliance on the phrase itself limit upper range.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The tone "drowsy alertness" is signaled once in paragraph two and recurs implicitly in descriptions of fogged breath, "sharp" boot echoes, and Elias's "headlamp shaking." The tone modulates from wary entry to frozen shock ("Elias froze," "his throat tightened") to quiet resignation at dawn. However, "drowsy" is underplayed—the narrative reads more as sustained tension than oscillating wakefulness. The tone is coherent and present across beats but does not distinctly charge the final image or constrain a choice. Two-gate participation (setup signal, modulation through middle) without strong closure linkage. Functional coherence places it in mid 5s; lack of specificity and missed opportunity to shape the ending keep it from higher bands.</comment>
