<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's synesthetic gift and motivations are established, but her choices feel pre-decided rather than dramatized under pressure. The pruning scene delivers labeled emotions ("joy," "despair," "reverie") rather than embodied contradiction—she simply selects "softer" memories without visible internal conflict or cost. The transformation is asserted through metaphor ("rewiring of its very essence") rather than earned through micro-choices that foreclose alternatives. Diagnostic label-speak ("synaptic plasticity") in peak beats reduces agency to therapeutic process.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: violet light, pruning cuts, memory floods build toward the bud's glow. However, closure is asserted rather than enacted—"she'd proven that...beauty could still grow" tells the reader the transformation succeeded without showing a decisive on-page choice or visible cost that forecloses a path. The notebook sketch of future plans arrives as expansion rather than reconfiguration. Cost is claimed conceptually but not legible in the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The rusted greenhouse with moss-streaked glass and the violet celestial light create a vivid frame. Spatial choreography is clear (kneeling beside the plant, violet light seeping through cracks). The pruning shears and the plant's physical transformation (yellowed leaves, translucent bud) constrain the action sequence. However, the greenhouse functions primarily as backdrop; it does not force a tactical choice at closure. The celestial alignment provides atmosphere but does not tighten the final decision.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—transforming the knowledge fruit seed—is signaled early and remains coherent. One meaningful tightening occurs: Elara prunes away traumatic memories and selects gentler ones, and the bud forms. However, the pruning's success feels guaranteed rather than tested; the plant's "resistance" is mentioned but not dramatized as a genuine obstacle that might cause failure. The alignment peaks on schedule, the bud forms as expected, and no live cost or trade-off is visible on the page. Agency reads passive—she executes a known method rather than choosing under conflicting pressures.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The theme of gentle rebellion and beauty from ruins is stated multiple times ("gentle rebellion against a world that had forgotten beauty," quoting graffiti, final paragraph moralizing). The synaptic plasticity metaphor is imposed rather than emergent from scene particulars. The final paragraph explicitly moralizes: "All it took was a little pruning, a little patience, and a willingness to rebel—gently—against the darkness." This replaces scene pressure with summary and undercuts thematic resonance. The vision of future gardens is told rather than earned through present cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with clear focalization on Elara. Perceptual signature is present: she tastes memories synesthetically, her interiority reflects scavenger resourcefulness. However, diction drifts into diagnostic register ("synaptic plasticity—reshaping the plant's neural pathways") that feels imposed rather than character-particular. The final notebook passage shifts into expository summary ("a community center, a school, a sanctuary") that flattens voice. Rhythm is functional but syntactically uniform across emotional peaks.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops appear: "She'd spent those years scavenging the ruins, salvaging tools and soil" recycles "scavenging/salvaging" without added detail. Template cadence runs: "A new wave of memories: a poet's reverie...a lover's whisper...a painter's brushstrokes." The closing paragraph stacks summary: "a little pruning, a little patience, and a willingness to rebel" is scaffold moralizing. "Synaptic plasticity" and "neural pathways" intrude as jargon. Filter verbs ("she could feel," "she saw") dull immediacy in peak beats. Figurative language ("sculpture of light and life") overwrites without concrete grounding. Apply cumulative artifact penalties: −0.6 baseline for loops and template cadence, escalated to −0.9 because they touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The premise—chef with synesthetic memory-tasting, pruning trauma from a knowledge fruit seed, post-Collapse greenhouse sanctuary—reads as a checklist assembly of prompt elements rather than an organic synthesis. The celestial alignment timing and the synaptic plasticity metaphor feel mechanically inserted. Emotional arc (traumatic memories → gentle memories → future hope) follows a predictable template without a non-obvious turn. Transformation test: swap "knowledge fruit" for any magical plant and "synesthetic tasting" for generic empath ability, and the core remains unchanged. Lacks a specific, lived-in detail or moral calculus that feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara's synesthetic gift (tasting memories) is introduced early and used in two beats: touching the soil initially and touching the bud at the end. However, her choices are not driven by the gift—she prunes based on the memories she tastes, but the decision to prune and which branches to cut feels pre-determined rather than constrained by her unique perception. The gift supplies flavor but does not create a key turn or force a trade-off. Swappable with a generic empath ability.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The knowledge fruit seed is present in setup (planted three months prior), development (the tangled plant she prunes), and payoff (the translucent bud forms). It drives two beats: the pruning sequence and the final vision. However, its specific properties—carrying memories of every mind that nurtured it—do not constrain Elara's tactics in a way that another magical seed would not. The seed is essential to the plot but not irreplaceable in mechanics. Closure linkage is strong (the bud is the culminating image), but causal pressure is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Gentle rebellion" is mentioned twice as a label ("her gentle rebellion against a world that had forgotten beauty," final paragraph moralizing) but does not shape on-page stakes or tactics. Elara's actions—pruning, patience—are gentle by description, but no scene tests the rebellion aspect (e.g., external opposition, risk of discovery). The concept is thematic echo rather than a dramatized constraint. Present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Informally wise intuition" is mentioned once ("her informally wise intuition telling her the seed's potential would peak") as a label without subsequent on-page demonstration. The trait does not constrain or enable a visible action with cost; it simply justifies her timing choice in backstory. The pruning itself relies on "old agricultural texts" rather than intuitive wisdom. Label-only.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Pruning is central: introduced early, executed in the middle (two cuts with memory floods), and results in the bud's formation at closure. The action is specific (shears, vine, branch) and its consequences (shedding traumatic memories, guiding growth) drive the narrative arc. However, the pruning's success feels guaranteed rather than tested by genuine resistance. Present in all three gates with strong causal role, but cost is asserted rather than dramatized. Removing pruning would break the story, but the specifics (which cuts, in what order) do not alter the outcome.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Synaptic plasticity" is named twice (once in exposition, once in summary) as the mechanism for the plant's transformation. The mechanics—"reshaping the plant's neural pathways," "rerouting energy to heal"—are told rather than demonstrated. The method does not shape Elara's attempts; she prunes based on memory content, not neural pathway logic. Mentioned but not operationalized. Functional but swappable with any healing metaphor.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The rusted greenhouse is present in setup (opening anchor), development (spatial choreography for pruning), and payoff (bathed in golden light, future plans sketched). It provides atmosphere and a contained space for the action. The violet light seeping through cracks charges the alignment beat. However, the greenhouse does not pressure Elara's choices—its decay or structure does not create obstacles or supply resources that alter tactics. The final notebook sketch ("community center, school, sanctuary") uses the setting aspirationally but does not tie to a present cost. Setting frames but does not constrain.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The celestial alignment is setup in the opening ("Tonight was the celestial alignment"), present during the pruning sequence ("As the alignment peaked, the plant shuddered"), and mentioned as fading at closure. It provides a ticking clock and atmospheric charge (violet light). However, the timing does not tighten Elara's decisions—she waits for it, it arrives, the bud forms. No on-page moment shows her racing the clock or adjusting tactics as the window closes. The alignment is causal (triggers the bud) but passive; Elara does not struggle against or exploit the timeframe. Functional but not pressurizing.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The desire to "create something beautiful from the ruins" is stated early (quoting graffiti, "her gentle rebellion"), dramatized through the pruning action, and invoked again at closure. The motivation drives the surface plot but lacks internal friction—no on-page moment shows Elara tempted to abandon the project, doubt its worth, or face a competing desire. The notebook sketch at the end extends the motivation but does not test it with cost. Present across beats but told more than conflicted.</comment>
