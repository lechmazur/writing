<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's dimensionally homesick state and guardian oath establish clear motivation, and her decision to throw the pendant creates a meaningful turn. However, her pivot from "I'll return it to the vaults" to discarding it in the fountain lacks on-page deliberation or embodied hesitation—the choice arrives suddenly after the cultist's plea, reading more as plot service than earned contradiction. The cultist collapses and gasps warnings, but his interiority and stakes remain opaque, reducing him to a device. Interior voice carries specificity ("waiting was her art"), but the climactic choice needed one more micro-beat of conflicted impulse to feel inevitable.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Hybrid-Causal: Mara waits, the cultist arrives, she tosses the pendant (narrowing options), then steps onto the moss path to closure. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph (frozen garden, Mara, liminal hour). The toss-and-step sequence functions as Decisive Change with visible cost (cultist's scream, Mara's departure from this reality), but causality frays: why does discarding the pendant open the door when the cultist demanded she give it to him? The pendant's mechanics—how it gates the library—remain unclear, so the climactic act reads more symbolic than motivated. The closure image (mentor with lantern, "you interiorized the exterior") lands with conceptual charge, but the cost proof is oblique; Mara's homesickness resolves too cleanly without on-page friction or trade-off in the final beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The frozen garden, rime-coated statues, topiary hedgehog, and fountain supply vivid, purposeful anchors. Mist thickens to "swallow sound" and the garden "felt less like a place and more like a thought," supporting the liminal tone and Mara's interiorizing technique. The moss path pulses "like a heartbeat" and directly enables the climactic step onto it, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clean (Mara behind hedgehog, cultist at fountain, moss path to hidden door). The library atrium's "shelves stretching into infinity" and "old paper and ozone" smell provide concrete sensory closure, though the shift from garden to library happens via mist-swallow without intermediate spatial cues.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: Mara's oath to guard this reality vs. her dimensional homesickness and the pendant's mystery. The cultist's arrival and Mara's choice to discard the pendant (rather than return or yield it) constitute one meaningful tightening that forecloses negotiation. However, the escalation is undercut by unclear causality: the pendant's discard seems to unlock the door, yet the cultist's plea ("give me the key") implied the opposite. The cost—cultist screaming, Mara vanishing—is visible but consequences remain off-page; the reunion with her mentor resolves homesickness too neatly without on-page friction or trade-off in the ending beat. Mara's agency drives the turn, but the mechanics don't compel inevitability.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme of boundaries as thresholds ("boundaries of light weren't walls—they were doors") and uncertainty as home emerges through Mara's interiorizing practice, the mist's liminal quality, and the final library reunion. The pendant's symbols mirroring her childhood home deepen mystery without over-explaining. However, the final paragraph edge-states the theme ("uncertainty? That was just another word for home") where the moss path and mentor's lantern already carried the work. The cultist's line "make friends with uncertainty" and Mara's echo risk thematic flagging. The fog/mist motif recurs purposefully, but "trust the fog" from the mentor's note tilts instructional. Subtext operates well in gesture (pendant toss, stepping onto path) until the ending over-articulates.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization remains stable; Mara's perceptual signature ("waiting was her art," "ice cracking beneath her bare feet") is character-specific. Dialogue carries subtext and goal pursuit: the cultist's "you invite it" and Mara's "I fear the light" advance theme and tension. Free indirect style is clean, and diction matches Mara's voice (rough from disuse, claws, feral). However, "interiorizing exteriors—a technique her mentor had taught her" reads expository mid-crisis rather than woven through perception. The cultist's void eyes and trembling voice distinguish him adequately. Psychic distance stays controlled, no head-hopping. Rhythm modulates well under pressure (short bursts during the toss, breath-held silence during waiting).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and sensory detail is concrete ("rime like ancient ghosts," "blue and smokeless" flame, "ice-crusted soil"). However, paraphrase loops appear: "The mist thickened, swallowing sound" followed shortly by "let the mist seep into her lungs until her breath matched its rhythm" restates atmospheric immersion without new pressure. Template cadence in the final paragraphs: "When she opened her eyes, she stood... The air smelled... And there, at the far end, stood her mentor" cycles identical stems. "Dimensionally homesick heart" recurs twice verbatim, reading like a prompt anchor rather than organic variation. Filter verbs ("seemed to hold its breath," "thought of her mentor") are voice-motivated and sparse. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes cleanly, but mid-story scaffold ("She'd promised herself") drifts toward summary.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The feral library guardian and dimensional homesickness offer fresh synthesis, and "interiorizing exteriors" as a reality-bending technique adds conceptual texture. The frozen garden + liminal mist setting avoids generic placeholders. However, the "cultist seeks artifact, guardian returns it" frame is familiar, and the pendant-as-key mechanic isn't transformed beyond standard fantasy logic. The moss-path revelation and mentor reunion deliver a satisfying turn, but the emotional arc (homesickness → homecoming) resolves predictably without a non-obvious moral calculus or cost that reweights prior choices. The "boundaries of light" metaphor and "trust the fog" note gesture toward originality but don't fully escape abstraction. Specificity in sensory detail and voice elevate execution within a recognizable template.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara (feral library guardian) drives two key beats: luring the cultist with the forged invitation (prior to on-page action) and discarding the pendant, which triggers the moss path and her departure. Her waiting and interiorizing practice shape middle pressure. The guardian role constrains her oath vs. homesickness conflict and her final choice to step onto the path rather than remain. Present in setup (opening), middle (waiting/practice), and closure (stepping through). Swappability is low; removing "feral library guardian" would collapse the dimensional stakes and vault-return motive. Cost is visible (cultist's scream, departure from this reality). Early signal, two+ beats, causal pressure, closure linkage all present.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The cultist's pendant appears in setup (mind's eye, stolen weeks ago, symbols pulse), middle (burns in pocket, edges dig into thigh, symbols rearrange), and climax (tossed into fountain, sinks with hiss, triggers moss path). Handled physically (pocket, fingers close around it, toss) and its presence constrains Mara's choice (she debates return vs. understanding). The pendant's discard is the pivot that opens the library door, making it causally indispensable. Cost linkage: cultist screams and claws at water. However, its mechanics (why discarding it opens the door when the cultist wanted it) remain unclear, slightly weakening irreplaceability. Early signal, multiple beats, causal pressure, closure participation all met.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"The boundaries of light" is mentioned once by the cultist ("not so easily breached") and restated in the final paragraph ("boundaries of light weren't walls—they were doors"). It does not shape on-page tactics or constrain choices; Mara's interiorizing and the pendant mechanics drive action. The concept functions as thematic overlay rather than actionable stake. Late-ish first explicit mention (cultist's line ~40%), no middle development where it alters options, and closure participation is summary-level restatement. Swappable with "the veil" or "threshold" without structural change. Ornamental use, no visible cost tied to it, minimal beat involvement.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Dimensionally homesick" appears twice verbatim (opening and near-end) as a label for Mara's ache for the library. It motivates her desire to return and her willingness to risk stepping onto the moss path, providing setup and closure frame. However, it does not constrain a specific on-page choice with visible trade-off; her decision to discard the pendant is driven by curiosity about the symbols and the cultist's plea, not homesickness pressure. The trait enables the final step (she goes home) but the cost (leaving this reality, the cultist's fate) is not framed as a struggle against or acceptance of homesickness. Present in setup and ending, weak middle development, label-heavy rather than action-embodied. Lyric reprise but no mid-scene causal work.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Wait" is Mara's art and her dominant tactic: she waits through the liminal hour, crouched behind the hedgehog, lets silence stretch, and times her step onto the moss path after the pendant sinks. Waiting shapes the garden encounter's pressure (she doesn't attack or flee) and her final move (she waits for the path to pulse before stepping). The cultist's arrival and the pendant toss are direct results of her patient setup. Present in setup ("she'd been waiting," "waiting was her art"), middle (silence stretch, mist rhythm matching), and closure (she steps after the path appears). Irreplaceable: shifting to "attack" or "flee" would require full plot rewrite. Cost: the cultist collapses, Mara departs. Early signal, multiple beats, causal pressure, closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Interiorizing exteriors" is introduced mid-story as a technique Mara practices, thickening the mist until "the garden felt less like a place and more like a thought." The mentor's closing line confirms "you interiorized the exterior" as the method that found the threshold. However, its mechanics are told rather than shown in action; we see Mara focus and the mist thickens, but no clear cause-effect between her technique and the moss path's appearance (the pendant toss seems the trigger). Present in middle (practice beat) and closure (mentor's confirmation), but setup is absent—first mention ~30% in. The method doesn't visibly constrain a failed attempt or force a tactical choice; it's credited retroactively. Swappable with "focused her will" without major edits. Late signal, summary-level payoff, weak causal chain.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The frozen garden supplies all on-page action: topiary hedgehog for concealment, fountain where the pendant sinks (triggering the moss path), ice-crusted soil and mist that thicken to support interiorizing, and the moss path that enables Mara's departure. Statues, rime, and fog create liminal atmosphere that matches "veil of sleep" timeframe. Spatial choreography is clean (Mara behind hedgehog, cultist at fountain, moss path to hidden door). The garden's micro-elements constrain and enable: Mara uses cover, the fountain receives the pendant, the moss path charges the final step. Present setup (opening paragraph), middle (mist practice, fountain), closure (moss path step). Environment is indispensable to tactics and final image. Early signal, multiple beats, causal pressure, closure linkage, high specificity.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Through the veil of sleep" is introduced as "that liminal hour when the world blurred between waking and dreaming" in the opening. It establishes tone but does not create a ticking clock or narrow tactical window; Mara waits indefinitely until the cultist arrives. The timeframe's haziness (mist, dream-blur) supports atmosphere and the interiorizing technique, but it doesn't pressure Mara's choices—she could wait longer or shorter without cost. Present in setup, absent from middle escalation (no countdown or fatigue), and not leveraged at closure (she steps onto the path with no temporal urgency). Ornamental framing rather than actionable constraint. Swappable with "twilight" or "midnight" with minor tonal edits. Setup only, no development or payoff, no visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"To make friends with uncertainty" appears in the cultist's question and Mara's final reflection ("uncertainty? That was just another word for home"). It frames Mara's willingness to discard the pendant and step into the unknown moss path. However, the motivation is told/restated rather than dramatized through conflicted micro-choices; her pendant toss reads abrupt, and the reunion with her mentor resolves uncertainty into certainty (she's home, homesickness stilled). The desire doesn't create on-page friction between competing wants—Mara moves from curiosity to action without visible hesitation or cost in the decision beat. Present in middle (cultist's line) and closure (Mara's summary), weak setup (implied via homesickness but not articulated as a goal), no embodied struggle. Thematic claim with minimal causal pressure or trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Foggy lucidity" coheres through mist imagery, liminal time ("veil of sleep"), and Mara's interiorizing that blurs garden into thought. Tone modulates: quiet waiting (breath matching mist rhythm), sharp dialogue exchange (cultist's hiss, Mara's rare smile), and dreamlike closure (mist swallows, shelves into infinity). The blue smokeless lantern "cast no light but revealing hidden things" embodies the oxymoron. Tone charges the final image (library atrium, mentor's lantern, "threshold" confirmation). However, the ending paragraph's explanatory coda ("boundaries of light weren't walls... uncertainty? ... home") shifts from evocative to declarative, slightly breaking the lucid-fog balance. Present setup, middle, and closure; strong coherence and modulation; one late tonal slip toward summary.</comment>
