<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Marlow's interior life is richly textured with concrete sensory anchors (chisel-calloused hands, rough ribbon texture) and his motivations are rooted in unspoken losses. However, the pivotal choice to write and read his own poem arrives without visible friction or contradictory impulses acting in scene; the progression from observing ancestral grief to authoring his own feels smooth rather than conflicted. The spectral voice functions more as exposition conduit than pressure source, limiting Marlow's agency in key beats. Embodied emotion is present early (heavy heart, memories) but flattens into abstract insight by the ending ("grief is not a hole, but a door"), which reads as earned wisdom without the struggle to reach it dramatized on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story establishes a coherent Accumulative/Textural lens: nightly returns, ancestral stories layering, butterfly migration marking seasonal passage. Orientation is clear by the opening paragraph (who, where, when), and the ending offers a Resonant Reconfiguration—Marlow shifts from silent mourner to poem-crafter with the ribbon as symbolic bridge. However, the decisive moment (writing and reading the poem) lacks visible cost; the voice vanishes without confrontation, and the "tomorrow" promise of carving a new gravestone pushes consequence off-page. The butterfly flood functions more as atmospheric intensification than causal pressure, and the spectral mentorship concludes without friction or renunciation, weakening the felt cost required for high-band closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The greenhouse is vividly rendered with layered sensory detail (damp earth, forgotten roses, glass rattle, lantern flicker) and functions as both memory repository and living presence. Spatial choreography is clean: Marlow walks, pauses, unrolls the ribbon, watches butterflies swirl. The setting constrains through its glass-domed enclosure and ancestral associations, and the final image of butterflies lingering "in his bones" charges the closure with embodied resonance. The recurring motif of glass panes rattling with "thundering calm" modulates effectively with emotional beats, though the greenhouse's transformation from abandoned to "breathing" relies more on assertion than demonstrated pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Marlow's need to articulate unspoken grief and join the family's poetic tradition—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs: the nightly returns across the butterfly migration accumulate ancestral stories, and the spectral voice's final lesson ("words outlive us") reweights the ribbon as bridge rather than burden. However, escalation lacks protagonist-driven pressure; the spectral voice delivers insights rather than forcing Marlow to struggle for them, and the poem's composition occurs off-page between penultimate and final beats. The butterflies' arrival and departure function as atmospheric markers rather than obstacles, and the closure cost (tomorrow's gravestone carving) is deferred, making the felt price oblique rather than unmistakable on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the greenhouse as living repository, the ribbon's color shifts, and the family's poem-trading custom as grief bridge. The ending poem ("grief is not a hole, but a door") reweights the premise without heavy-handed moralizing, and the butterflies' flight "lingering in his bones" offers a resonant physical answer to the central question. However, the spectral voice occasionally edges into direct thematic statement ("your family's grief is not a burden, but a bridge"), and the final paragraph's shift from present action to future intention ("Tomorrow, he would carve...") softens the immediacy of the thematic landing, making the resonance more told than shown.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The narrative maintains stable third-person limited focalization with a distinct perceptual signature (chisel-calloused hands, sketchbook margins, gravestone carver's lens). Diction is consistent and elevated without jarring register shifts, and the spectral voice is cleanly differentiated through its eerie serenity. However, POV modesty slips when the greenhouse is described as having "learned to mourn" and as a "living thing" without anchoring these perceptions strictly in Marlow's inference. The final poem's phrasing ("grief is not a hole, but a door") reads slightly polished for a shakily handwritten margin note, and the closing future-tense summary ("Tomorrow, he would carve...") distances the reader from immediate interiority at a pivotal moment.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Prose is generally clean with varied syntax and strong sensory anchors (brittle leaves crunching, lantern flicker, ribbon colors shifting). The opening establishes voice and stakes efficiently, and figurative language (butterflies as "living embers," glass-domed ceiling) enhances without overwhelming. However, several template-cadence runs appear: "he'd come here... to retrace... to discover" stacks infinitive phrases, and "his great-grandfather, who'd... his aunt, who'd... his mother, who'd..." creates mechanical parallelism in the ancestral catalogue. Paraphrase loops occur in the spectral mentorship explanation ("echo of those who came before" / "linger here, woven into the vines"), and the ending relies on a stock opener ("On the final night") followed by future-tense summary that dulls immediacy. These artifacts cluster in non-closure beats but still impose −0.8 for template cadence and loops.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The combination of gravestone carver protagonist, spectral greenhouse mentorship, and poem-as-grief-processing offers a cohesive synthesis with specific details (chisel-calloused hands, medicinal herbs, twilight-dyed ribbon). The butterfly migration as temporal frame and the family's poem-trading custom provide fresh texture. However, the core arc—isolated mourner learns to articulate grief through ancestral guidance—follows a recognizable template, and the spectral voice as wise mentor delivering insights without cost reads familiar. The greenhouse-as-living-repository and butterflies-as-flight-pattern metaphors are executed competently but do not transform their underlying conceits into something unrecognizable from common usage. The ending's "grief is not a hole, but a door" lands as heartfelt but not wholly unexpected, keeping the piece in the strong-functional band without reaching bold originality.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Marlow's occupation frames his sensory lens (chisel-calloused hands, gravestone epitaphs) and primes his engagement with death and memory. He makes two observable choices: returning nightly and writing/reading his own poem. However, neither choice narrows options with visible cost on the page; the nightly returns are recounted in summary, and the poem's composition occurs off-stage. His gravestone-carving skill does not constrain tactics or enable a key turn; it functions primarily as thematic resonance rather than active pressure. Present in setup, middle (via ancestral epitaphs), and ending (future carving promise), but causal pressure remains modest.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The ribbon appears in the opening beat (carried under arm, texture noted), is unrolled and examined in mid-scene as colors shift ("blue, now green, now deep purple"), and is rolled tightly and tucked into coat at closure, its "colors now faded but still vibrant." It accrues meaning as carrier of family poems and bridge across grief. However, it is not actively used in a choice or tactic; Marlow observes it but does not manipulate it to solve a problem or test a hypothesis. The final rolling and tucking offer mild closure participation but no causal consequence. Meets all three gates (setup, development, payoff) but remains more symbolic anchor than tactical object.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The spectral voice appears early, identifies itself as "echo of those who came before," and delivers ancestral stories across multiple nightly visits, shaping the thematic frame. It reappears in the final beat ("the voice was gone") to mark closure. However, the concept functions as exposition conduit rather than active pressure; the voice teaches rather than tests, and Marlow does not struggle against or negotiate with it. No visible cost or tactical constraint arises from the mentorship; insights are given freely. Present in setup, development, and ending, but causal work is limited to thematic priming rather than stakes-altering pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The phrase "fiercely meditative" appears once in the butterfly observation beat but does not constrain or enable a subsequent action with cost. Marlow's stance is described rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses or a tactical tradeoff. The trait could be replaced with "contemplative" or "absorbed" without altering the scene's logic. Label-only mention without on-page consequence; missing meaningful development and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Retracing structures the narrative: Marlow returns nightly to retrace ancestral paths, and the spectral voice guides him through family stories (great-grandfather, aunt, mother). The action appears in setup ("to retrace the steps of those who'd mourned before him"), drives the middle accumulation of grief narratives, and is implied in the closure as he integrates his own story. However, the retracing is largely passive observation; Marlow listens rather than actively testing or resisting the process. Swappable with "revisit" or "explore" without major structural loss. Present across all three gates but causal pressure is modest; the action enables the frame but does not force a key turn.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The family custom is introduced in the opening paragraph as generational context and backstory, priming Marlow's eventual poem. It reappears when he asks "Why do we trade poems?" mid-scene, and the ending action (writing and reading his own poem) directly enacts the custom, reweighting it from passive inheritance to active participation. However, the custom itself does not shape tactics or impose a constraint; Marlow does not struggle with whether to honor or break the tradition. Present in setup and closure, with thematic development in the middle question, but the mechanics do not alter options under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The greenhouse is the sole location, vividly detailed and spatially coherent (glass-domed ceiling, glass panes, lantern light, vines). It supplies the spectral voice, ancestral associations, and the butterfly migration entry point, directly shaping the story's pressure and tactics. The glass panes rattle to signal the voice's presence, and the environment's dual nature (abandoned yet alive) mirrors Marlow's internal state. The setting constrains through its enclosure and charges the final image (butterflies swirling, lantern flaring). Present in setup, development (all beats occur here), and ending; irreplaceable and causally active across the narrative.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The butterfly migration marks the passage of time ("across the butterfly migration," "the final night of the migration") and provides seasonal urgency, framing the nightly returns and culminating in the flood of butterflies that intensifies the climactic beat. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions with a live clock; Marlow returns "each evening" without missed opportunities or tactical pressure from the migration's progress. The butterflies' arrival and departure are atmospheric markers rather than constraints that alter tactics. Present in setup, development, and ending, but causal pressure on choices is modest; time operates as accumulative frame rather than forcing function.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Marlow's desire to "discover the shape of collective grief" is stated in the opening and dramatized through his nightly returns, questioning ("Why do we trade poems?"), and final poem that articulates his own losses. The motivation is conflicted: his heart "had grown heavy with the weight of unspoken losses," creating friction between silence and speech. However, the cost of pursuing this discovery is not visible on the page; ancestral stories are offered freely, and the final poem's composition occurs off-stage without shown struggle. Present in setup, middle question, and ending enactment, but friction between want and price is more asserted than demonstrated.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The phrase "thundering calm" appears twice: once in the opening beat ("low, thundering calm that vibrated in his chest") and again at closure ("the thundering calm remained"). The tone is coherent across emotional beats—quiet electricity, eerie serenity, flickering shadows, restless spirits—and the final invocation charges the ending image as a reminder of grief's dual nature. However, the tone remains largely static; it does not modulate sharply with pressure or escalate as stakes rise. The lantern's flare-and-dim in the final beat offers a micro-shift but not a decisive tonal reconfiguration. Present at setup and closure with consistent middle application, but lacks the dynamic range to reach higher bands.</comment>
