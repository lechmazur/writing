<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lira's precognitive curse provides interior texture, but her key choices feel reactive rather than self-contradictory under pressure. The final realization—"to witness them… to exist within their flow"—arrives as a declared epiphany without dramatized cost that forecloses a prior path. Mother's vanishing and the inheritance of title supply backstory weight, yet Lira's moment-to-moment struggle reads more as puzzle-solving than genuine internal conflict with competing impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through vision-fragments and rock-placement attempts that reweight the sacred-pattern stake. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land by ~100 words. Closure arrives on-page as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Lira shifts from "solve" to "witness," the eels form a living sigil, and the star dust settles to a steady pulse. Cost is asserted ("tears mingling with the salt spray," the storm threat receding) but not sharply legible as a foreclosed path or visible sacrifice; the ending image tilts toward affirmation without a felt price that alters her options.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The tidal bluff, frictionless water, and aurora provide vivid sensory anchors and constrain Lira's method (rocks must align with aurora shifts, eels hang suspended without friction). The aurora's color deepening to "bruise-purple" modulates with tension and charges the final image. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout; the setting actively shapes her tactical choices and participates in the closure beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore sacred order—is signaled early and pressure tightens through vision-fragments that show both harmony and catastrophic storm. The rock-arrangement sequences (Fibonacci, Pascal's triangle, Möbius strip, final obsidian shard) constitute meaningful attempts that narrow options. However, the resolution hinges on Lira's internal shift ("not to control… but to witness") more than a protagonist-driven trade-off with visible cost; the storm dissipates and eels respond without a clear on-page price that alters her circumstances.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme—understanding sacred patterns as witnessing rather than control—emerges organically from Lira's attempts and vision-fragments. The final image (eels forming a living sigil, star dust pulsing steadily) offers a resonant answer without overt moralizing. Yet the epiphany leans slightly abstract ("a language to honor") and lacks a sharper conceptual cost or counter-reading; the ending feels affirming rather than complicating prior material with undeniable pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization is stable; no head-hopping. Lira's perceptual signature (precognitive fragments, attention to mathematical sequences, sensory detail filtered through urgency) remains consistent and character-specific. Psychic distance modulates purposefully under stress. Free indirect style is clean, and narrative voice maintains distinct texture. No dialogue appears, so those bullets are not applicable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high. However, several beats carry elevated diction that clashes with the POV's urgency ("a dance of probability and intention," "bruise-purple," "living sigil"), trending toward lyric ornament in peak moments. One paraphrase loop appears: "The promise wasn't to control… but to witness" restates the prior "not to control… but to witness" without added pressure. A mild template cadence runs through the vision-flare beats ("The star dust flared. A vision struck… The vision fractured… The star dust surged"). These artifacts dull immediacy but do not obscure causality at closure; applying −0.6 in Q7 for the combined loop and template patterns.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The premise—precognitive eel herder restoring sacred geometry via mathematical rock sequences under aurora—offers a distinctive synthesis of elements. However, the emotional arc (puzzle-solver learns to witness rather than control) follows a familiar template: striving → epiphany → acceptance. The final turn feels more asserted than inevitable in hindsight, and the synthesis, while specific in surface detail, does not transform its underlying pattern through lived cost or non-obvious moral calculus.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Lira is present throughout and drives rock-placement attempts, but her choices read as sequential puzzle-solving rather than decisions that create key reversals. Her final shift (understanding → witnessing) is internal and culminates at closure, participating in the ending image. Early signal strong; two beats (Fibonacci attempt, Möbius strip adjustment); closure linkage present. Swappability low (her precognitive curse and inheritance are specific). Deduct −0.3 for passivity in middle beats where visions dictate rather than Lira choosing under competing pressures.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Star dust is handled in four beats: initial glow in palm, flare after Fibonacci sequence, surge with theta symbol, and settling at closure. It reacts to rock arrangements and its steady pulse at the end charges the resolution. Early signal strong; beat involvement high; closure linkage present. However, its mechanics remain vague (why it reacts, what "collapsed star dust" physically does), reducing irreplaceability slightly; a different magical catalyst could substitute with moderate edits. Deduct −0.4 for lack of cost connection—its use imposes no visible price on Lira.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The promise ("to restore the sacred order") is introduced early and frames Lira's goal, shaping stakes on the page. It surfaces twice: initial mention and a mid-story echo ("the lingering promise… weighed on Lira"). At closure, the promise is reinterpreted (not control but witness), participating thematically. Setup and payoff gates met; middle development weak (the promise constrains motive but does not narrow a tactical choice). Swappability moderate (generic "fulfill mother's wish" could replace with minor edits). Deduct −0.5 for ornamental middle presence and −0.3 for thematic-only payoff rather than a dramatized cost tied to the promise itself.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The precognitive curse is present throughout: it delivers vision-fragments that show futures and drives Lira's urgency. Setup strong. However, it functions more as a passive information source than a trait with visible tradeoffs; no on-page moment shows the curse imposing a cost (e.g., disorientation, physical toll, social penalty). Middle development minimal (visions inform but do not constrain a choice with price). Closure participation weak (the curse is not reweighted or resolved in the final image). Deduct −0.6 for label-only trait treatment and −0.4 for missing cost connection.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Harness" appears explicitly in the penultimate paragraph ("by harnessing the star dust and the rocks' sequences, she glimpsed the whole") and implicitly throughout as Lira attempts to channel star dust reactions via rock arrangements. Setup present (she withdraws rocks early). Middle beats show repeated harnessing attempts (Fibonacci, Pascal's triangle, theta symbol, Möbius strip). Closure participation strong: final obsidian placement and "the star dust settled" demonstrate successful harnessing. Causal pressure high; irreplaceability moderate (the action is specific but "channel" or "align" could substitute). Deduct −0.3 for summary phrasing at the key moment rather than a dramatized tactile beat.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The method is introduced early, signaled clearly ("place the rocks in mathematical sequences aligned with the aurora's shifts"), and executed across four beats (Fibonacci spiral, Pascal's triangle, theta-symbol adjustment, Möbius strip, obsidian shard). Each sequence produces a star dust reaction and eel response, shaping Lira's tactical choices. Closure participation strong: the final obsidian placement triggers the living sigil. Causal pressure high; specificity high (mathematical sequences are named and their ordering matters). Deduct −0.2 for slight vagueness in how sequences "align" with aurora shifts (visual pattern-matching is implied but not shown).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The tidal bluff is anchored early and remains the sole location. Frictionless water suspends the eels, creating the problem Lira must solve. Aurora shifts guide rock placement, and the bluff's stillness contrasts with the storm-vision threat. Setup and middle development strong; closure participation present (the bluff remains intact in the final future-vision). However, the setting supplies conditions more than resources Lira actively manipulates; it pressures her goal but does not alter her tactics beat-to-beat. Deduct −0.4 for static backdrop quality in the middle third.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The timeframe ("after friction disappears") is established early and creates the premise: eels can no longer move, sacred patterns dissolved. However, this is a background condition rather than a ticking clock that tightens decisions. No urgency escalates within the scene itself; Lira's attempts unfold without time pressure or mention of how long friction has been absent. Setup gate met; middle development and closure participation weak (the timeframe does not narrow options or charge the ending). Deduct −0.6 for ornamental use and −0.4 for swappability (a generic "world is broken" state could replace it).</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Lira's desire to understand sacred patterns is stated early ("Understand the patterns," she mutters) and drives her rock-arrangement attempts. The motivation reappears at closure when she realizes understanding means witnessing. Setup and payoff gates met; middle beats show her acting on this desire. However, no on-page friction between this want and a competing cost (e.g., safety, another obligation) creates internal conflict; the desire is singular and uncontested. Deduct −0.5 for told-only dramatization (the shift from "solve" to "witness" is declared rather than shown through a choice with visible price) and −0.3 for lack of competing pull.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Borrowed dawn" is introduced in the opening line and reprised in the final paragraph ("Under the borrowed dawn, Lira understood"). The phrase evokes transience and ambiguity, supporting the story's lyric texture. However, tone does not modulate purposefully with pressure; the register remains elevated and wistful throughout without sharpening or breathing in step with escalation. Closure participation present (final reprise reweights the opening image), but the tone's contribution is atmospheric rather than causally active. Deduct −0.4 for static mood and −0.3 for lyric-only payoff without charging the final action or choice.</comment>
