<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to preserve the covenant through small moments is clear and consistent, but her interior life lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously—she never wavers or doubts her method in scene. The locket photo triggers reflection but no micro-choice that alters her present stance; she simply continues her ritual. Embodied emotion is present ("edges warm against her thigh") but the peak moment—painting the locket with ink—feels more symbolic than conflicted. The character endures rather than changes, which qualifies as Earned Stasis, but the cost of this persistence isn't made visceral on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first paragraph. The piece accumulates through repeated motifs (covenant, small moments, walnut ink, the photo) and a single cadence shift at the end when Elara realizes "the covenant's weight...was in the now." This is a valid Resonant Reconfiguration (insight that reweights the premise), but the cost remains abstract—no visible forfeiture or tactical change results from her realization. The ending smile and confident departure lack friction, making the conceptual price implied rather than felt on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The blooming jetty at twilight is vividly rendered with sensory specificity (salt, jasmine, violets and gold, nightshade roots twisting through planks). The flowers closing "as if in prayer" charges the final image. However, the setting functions more as atmospheric backdrop than constraint—Elara could perform her archival work anywhere; the jetty's blooming state doesn't alter her tactics or choices. The micro-setting (driftwood post, walnut ink jar) is present but doesn't pressure her decisions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: ensuring the covenant's survival through preservation. The story signals this early and maintains focus, but escalation is minimal—Elara faces no opposition, reversal, or tightening choice. She arrives intending to document and paint the locket, and she does exactly that without complication. The "haunted euphoria" and fear that "beauty fades" are told anxieties, not dramatized pressures that narrow her options. The final realization is a conceptual deepening rather than a forced trade-off with visible cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The theme—that covenants survive through attention to small moments rather than grand gestures—emerges clearly from particulars (the baker's bread, the child's shell, Elara's ink-stained hands). The locket photo provides human specificity, and the final image ("the act of preservation itself") reweights the premise without overt moralizing. However, the great-grandmother's story is told rather than integrated causally, and the covenant's mechanics remain abstract—"a chain of small, deliberate acts" is asserted more than demonstrated through friction or consequence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Single POV, third-person limited, remains stable throughout. The perceptual signature is consistent—Elara notices textures (tarnished silver, curled edges, roots twisting like veins) in a character-specific way that fits an archivist's attention to detail. Diction is controlled and purposeful, though some phrases edge toward elevated lyricism ("bruise of violets and gold," "steep the past into the present") that occasionally drifts above the immediate scene's urgency. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping or POV leakage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully, sentence openings are diverse, and clarity is strong. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "small moments held the weight of empires" / "the weight of small moments" / "the covenant's weight...was in the now" recycles the same core metaphor without adding pressure. Template cadence in the second paragraph: "She believed...that a single gesture..." / "The woman in the photo had been..." / "The covenant's renewal had been..." uses similar stems across three sentences. Figurative density is high ("bruise of violets," "roots twisting through the planks like veins," "petals pulsing like tiny hearts") but remains coherent. Apply −0.6 for loops and template cadence per the patterned-artifact pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The walnut-ink archivist and blooming jetty offer specific, non-generic anchors, and the covenant-through-small-moments premise has a fresh angle on memory and ritual. However, the emotional arc—an archivist who worries beauty will fade but resolves to persist through documentation—follows a familiar template of preservation-as-meaning without a non-obvious turn. The great-grandmother's vanishing and the locket's tarnished edges are evocative but not transformed through Elara's choices; she learns what she already believed. Risk is present in the lyric mode but doesn't heighten stakes sufficiently to lift the score into the high band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her archival work frames the story. She makes one key choice—painting the locket with walnut ink—that dramatizes her method, though the choice feels predetermined rather than contested. Her observation ("Through proximate causes, she told herself") and final realization ("the covenant's weight...was in the now") are reflective rather than action-driven. The character shapes the story's texture but doesn't generate a reversal or tightening that alters tactics. Early signal, one beat involvement, minimal causal pressure, closure linkage via her realization. Apply −0.3 for late-paragraph summary-only realization, +0.4 for one distinct beat (painting the locket), +0.3 for early signal, +0.5 for closure linkage (her smile and walk toward town), −0.2 for swappability (another archivist could perform the same ritual with minor edits).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The locket photo is introduced in the opening line and handled physically in two beats (tracing its edges, painting it with ink). It returns with reweighted meaning in the final paragraph ("because of the woman in the photo"), charging the closure with human specificity. However, the photo's role is more symbolic than causal—it doesn't constrain Elara's choices or alter her tactics; she uses it to embody her theme. Early signal, two-beat involvement, lyric reprise that reweights the stake, but lacks irreplaceability (another family heirloom could serve the same function). Apply +0.8 for early signal, +0.9 for two beats, +0.8 for closure linkage, −0.5 for swappability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The regenerated covenant is the story's premise and shapes Elara's stake (preserving it through documentation). It's present in nearly every paragraph but functions more as thematic frame than on-page pressure—the covenant's unraveling is asserted ("had begun to unravel") but never dramatizes consequence or forces a tactical shift. The covenant's mechanics ("a chain of small, deliberate acts") are told rather than shown constraining choices. Early signal, multiple mentions, closure linkage (Elara's realization that "the covenant would hold"), but minimal causal pressure. Apply +0.8 for early signal, +0.4 for one beat (Elara's ritual), +0.7 for closure linkage, −0.8 for summary-only treatment of the covenant's mechanics, −0.3 for swappability (another magical pact could replace it with minor edits).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Gently thorough" is labeled in the second paragraph ("Her methods were gently thorough, a paradox of patience and precision") and demonstrated through Elara's weeks of documentation and careful ink application. However, the trait doesn't constrain or enable a pivotal choice with visible cost—it describes her habitual approach rather than forcing a trade-off under pressure. Present early, one beat involvement (painting the locket), but lacks causal pressure or closure participation. Apply +0.3 for early signal, +0.4 for one beat, −0.6 for label-only treatment without on-page cost, −0.5 for swappability.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Steep" appears multiple times ("steep the past into the present," "steep them in ink," "steep it into the world") and is literalized when Elara paints the locket with walnut ink. The action is central to her method but doesn't generate a reversal or tightening—she performs the ritual she intended without complication. Early signal, one beat involvement, closure linkage (final line), but minimal causal pressure. Apply +0.8 for early signal, +0.4 for one beat, +0.8 for closure linkage, −0.6 for swappability (another preservation action could replace it).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Through proximate causes" is introduced in the second paragraph and repeated in the fourth. The method is described (fisherman mending nets, baker leaving bread, child placing a shell) but not dramatized—Elara tells herself the covenant works this way, yet we don't see her document or intervene in any of these small acts. The method shapes her belief but not her on-page tactics. Early signal, no middle development, minimal closure participation. Apply +0.3 for early signal, −0.8 for summary-only treatment, −0.5 for swappability.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The blooming jetty at twilight is vividly rendered and present throughout. The flowers closing "as if in prayer" charges the final image, and the jetty's transformation (from shipwreck graveyard to blooming site) reflects the covenant's magic. However, the setting doesn't constrain Elara's choices—she could perform her ritual anywhere with similar effect. Early signal, multiple beats, strong closure linkage, but lacks causal pressure. Apply +0.8 for early signal, +0.9 for two beats (opening, closing), +1.2 for strong closure linkage (flowers closing), −0.6 for lack of causal constraint.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"When context changes" is the timeframe signaled in the third paragraph ("When context changes, so must ritual") and referenced in Elara's documentation of shifts over weeks. However, the live clock doesn't tighten decisions—the story unfolds in a single twilight with no urgency or deadline. The timeframe is thematic rather than tactical. Present by mid-story, no closure participation. Apply +0.3 for signal, −0.6 for lack of middle development, −0.8 for no closure participation, cap at 4.6 per missing-closure rule.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to preserve the weight of small moments is stated early and drives her archival work. The motivation is demonstrated through her ritual and final realization, but lacks friction—she never doubts or struggles against competing desires. The motivation shapes one key beat (painting the locket) and the ending insight, but the absence of on-page conflict between this want and a cost lowers the score. Early signal, one beat involvement, closure linkage, minimal friction. Apply +0.8 for early signal, +0.4 for one beat, +0.7 for closure linkage, −0.5 for told-only treatment without dramatized conflict, −0.3 for swappability.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Haunted euphoria" is signaled in the third paragraph ("the haunted euphoria she did—the dread that beauty fades, the thrill that it might not") and modulates through the piece: dread (covenant unraveling), reverence (flowers glowing), and quiet confidence (final smile). The tone charges the final image (flowers closing, Elara smiling) with ambivalent grace. However, the tone is more consistent than modulating under pressure—it remains contemplative throughout without sharp shifts. Early signal, coherent across beats, strong closure linkage. Apply +0.8 for early signal, +0.9 for coherence across beats, +1.2 for charging the final image, −0.5 for static mood without pressure-driven modulation, −0.5 for swappability (another bittersweet tone could serve).</comment>
