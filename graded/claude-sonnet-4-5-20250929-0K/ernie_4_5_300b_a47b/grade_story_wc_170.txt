<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lirael's motivation to persuade mirrors via song is established, but her interior life relies heavily on external labels ("perceptively calm demeanor") rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The borrowed heartbeat locket provides emotional texture but her choices feel predetermined rather than torn; no genuine struggle between competing goods appears on the page. The sister's memory drives the work but doesn't create live friction—Lirael executes her plan smoothly without cost until exhaustion, which reads more as physical depletion than character transformation. The final walk-away lacks visible foreclosure of a path or renunciation with felt weight.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the humming sequence builds through three mirrors toward a meadow vision, and the piece teaches its lyric pattern early. Orientation is solid (terrace, spring, prism parapet by line three). However, closure remains ambiguous—the mirrors "stood unchanged" yet Lirael "knew" possibilities were taking root elsewhere, an assertion that occurs off-page and lacks visible cost at the final image. The Orientation Test penalty is waived, but cost legibility at closure is weak: exhaustion is mentioned but the walk-away doesn't reconfigure options or meaning with undeniable pressure, capping high-band entry.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The prism parapet and terrace anchors are vivid and consistent (wet stone, jasmine, condensation, wrought-iron stand). Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Lirael's focus: the locket's chain "coiled like a question," bioluminescent forest in the cracked mirror. The mirrors themselves function as micro-setting, constraining her persuasion method and supplying the final "unchanged" state that ironically underscores her belief. The parapet's color refraction appears twice, framing and charging the sequence, meeting the 9+ gate for environment shaping the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—persuading mirrors to show possibilities—is signaled early and drives all three mirror beats. Pressure tightens as effort mounts (first glow, second flicker, third sweat/cracked mirror), and the bells' interruption provides external tightening. However, the resolution is soft: Lirael "knew" success occurred elsewhere, removing on-page consequence. No visible trade-off or foreclosed path; exhaustion doesn't alter her next move. Under the Accumulative lens one meaningful deepening is present (coded lullabies adapting to each mirror's mood), but cost at closure is asserted rather than shown, capping higher bands.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Theme of reflection versus reality, memory versus presence, emerges through the mirrors and borrowed heartbeat without overt statement. The "possibilities beyond edges" motif recurs purposefully and the final meadow image of a woman with Lirael's eyes offers resonance. Yet the ending pivots to assertion ("she knew") rather than a non-literal image that reweights prior material—the "unchanged" mirrors could charge irony but the text immediately retreats into comfort ("quiet comfort," "secrets"). The piece earns thematic coherence but stops short of the earned wisdom or conceptual repricing that would elevate it into high bands.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is clean with no head-hopping; Lirael's perceptual signature (colors bleeding, sound waves dancing, imagined sister's laughter) is consistent. Diction is controlled and purposeful ("mirage painter," "dusky harmony," "borrowed heartbeat"). However, filter verbs cluster in the middle passage ("she imagined," "letting the music flow through her") and the phrase "perceptively calm demeanor never wavering" reads as narratorial summary rather than embodied perception. The "though she spoke to no one" and "though the figure couldn't hear her" feel like helpful-narrator intrusions. Psychic distance remains stable but voice lacks the rhythmic modulation under peak stress that would lift this higher.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Prose is clear with varied syntax and vivid images (jasmine/wet stone, locket chain "coiled like a question," bioluminescent forest). Figurative density is high but mostly coherent. However, paraphrase loops appear: "she aimed to persuade mirrors" → "persuasion required patience"; "borrowed heartbeat thrummed" is repeated across paragraphs; "mirage painter" label recurs without fresh angle. Template cadence surfaces in the mirror sequence: "The first mirror... began to glow. / The second mirror... flickered next. / By the third mirror..." The "perceptively calm" phrase is stock and appears twice. These artifacts don't obscure causality but dull momentum in the middle third, preventing high-band entry.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The mirage painter who uses sound to persuade mirrors offers a fresh synthesis of reflection/art/memory, and the borrowed heartbeat locket is a specific, non-generic anchor. However, the core arc—artist performs ritual, exhausts herself, walks away believing in off-page success—follows a familiar template without transformation. The mirrors standing "unchanged" could subvert expectation but the text immediately reassures us that success occurred elsewhere, retreating from bold risk. The meadow vision and coded lullabies add texture but don't fundamentally alter the "artist's solitary ritual" structure widely seen in prompt-driven fantasy.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Lirael the mirage painter is present throughout and her humming drives all three mirror beats. Setup is immediate (paragraph one: "elusive mirage painter"). Development: her song adapts to each mirror's mood, a micro-choice under pressure. Closure: she walks away after the effort, but the decision to leave is low-stakes and doesn't create a turn—she planned to leave once done. The character is functional but her choices feel scripted rather than risk-laden; removing "mirage painter" and calling her a musician would require only minor edits. Mid-band functional role with no irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The prism parapet appears in paragraph one (Lirael leans against it, traces condensation, watches colors bleed) and returns in the penultimate paragraph ("prism parapet gleamed in the fading light, its colors muted but still present"). Two beats, lyric reprise, charged with the refractive color motif that ties to her mirage work. However, it doesn't constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters tactics—it's descriptive anchor rather than causal agent. The reprise reweights the motif but the parapet itself remains passive. Strong setup and closure linkage lift it above mere ornament, but lack of middle development and causal pressure cap it below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The borrowed heartbeat (sister's final rhythm on crystal sliver) appears in paragraph two, is handled in paragraph three (withdrawn from pocket), and recurs across the mirror sequence ("thrummed," "pulsed faster," "metronome," "quiet comfort" at end). Setup, development (the heartbeat's pulse adapts to mirror moods), and closure (tucked back as comfort) are all present. It shapes the coded lullabies' emotional charge and the meadow vision of the sister. However, it doesn't narrow options or enable a tactical shift under pressure—Lirael would hum and persuade with or without it. The heartbeat is thematically resonant but functionally ornamental, pushing it into mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Perceptively calm" appears twice as label ("perceptively calm despite the weight," "perceptively calm demeanor never wavering") but doesn't constrain or enable an on-page action with cost. It describes her state rather than shaping a choice—no moment where remaining calm forecloses a louder approach or where calm enables a tactic that panic would prevent. Label-only mention without causal work; ornamental trait.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Grace appears in "each gesture a study in grace" (paragraph two) and "her movements as graceful as ever" (final paragraph). The movements are described as graceful (slow, deliberate humming and locket handling), but no turn traces to grace specifically—speed, precision, or patience could replace it with minor edits. Setup and closure reprise present, but development and causal pressure absent. Lyric consistency without mechanical necessity; mid-low functional band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Coded lullabies in children's songs are introduced in paragraph three ("she'd altered it—embedded coded lullabies within the melody"), shape the mirror sequence (paragraph four: "Each note carried a fragment of memory"; paragraph six: "coded lullabies weaving a spell"; paragraph eight: "the coded lullabies adapting to the mirror's mood"), and appear at the climax when the song falters under the bells. Setup, development across multiple beats, and closure linkage all present. The method is signaled and its mechanics (adapting to mood, carrying memory) matter to the attempt. However, the exact mechanism—why coded lullabies rather than plain song—isn't tested with cost; it's asserted to work. Strong presence but lacks irreplaceability proof.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The echoing terrace in spring is anchored immediately (title phrase, paragraph one: "wet stone and jasmine, air thick with promise of rain") and sustains all action. The terrace's acoustics ("echoing") and the bells (timeframe element) provide environmental pressure; the "hush before bells ring" creates a literal countdown. The setting's spring dampness appears in condensation on the parapet and slick surfaces. Closure: "The echoing terrace in spring would remember her song"—the setting is named and charged in the final image. The terrace supplies resources (mirrors, acoustics) and its temporal constraint (bells) tightens the climax, meeting setup/development/payoff and causal pressure gates.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Over the hush before bells ring" is the stated timeframe (paragraph two) and the bells do ring at the climax (paragraph nine: "The bells began to ring then"), forcing Lirael to "quicken her pace" and creating the story's peak pressure moment. Setup and payoff present; the hush/bells structure tightens the song's urgency. However, the time between hush and bells is not tracked or felt as a live countdown—no mention of how much time remains or whether she's racing the clock until the bells suddenly arrive. The bells function as plot device rather than persistent constraint shaping tactics throughout. Functional timeframe with closure linkage but underdeveloped as escalation tool.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>To persuade mirrors to show possibilities is stated in paragraph one ("she aimed to persuade mirrors") and dramatized across the three-mirror sequence where each mirror shifts to show new scenes (meadow, city, forest). The motivation drives every beat and Lirael's dialogue ("See? There's more than what's reflected"; "That's the one") reveals her stake. Closure: she believes the persuasion succeeded elsewhere, tucking the locket away as the terrace "would hold her secrets." Setup, development, and closure all present. However, friction between want and cost is muted—she exhausts herself but doesn't sacrifice or renounce anything to achieve the goal; the mirrors remain unchanged on the page. Strong presence with moderate cost legibility.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Dusky harmony appears once as phrase ("the effort of maintaining the dusky harmony—the balance between sound and silence, light and shadow") in paragraph eight, late in the piece. The tone itself—a balance of melancholy beauty, quiet effort, twilight atmosphere—is sustained throughout via diction (wet stone, fading light, borrowed heartbeat, muted colors) and modulates appropriately (calm beginning, sweating effort, final silence). However, "dusky harmony" as explicit label arrives too late to frame the reader's experience and isn't reprised at closure. The tonal work is coherent and charges the ending's quiet, but the named element is ornamental rather than structural. Tone execution is solid; label integration is weak.</comment>
