<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lirael's interior life is largely told through abstract declarations ("felt adrift," "sense of purpose") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The chain-link moment gestures toward embodiment but remains static description. Her final "learning to navigate by starlight herself" reads as summary epiphany without on-page micro-choices that reveal cost or foreclose a path. Student Tarel appears only to ask a setup question, applying no real pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Orientation is established early (benthic city, instructor role, post-alien discovery). The closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration—Lirael feeling "purpose settle over her"—but the cost is asserted ("learning to navigate by starlight herself") rather than dramatized through a concrete choice or forfeiture on the page. The lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (alien constellations, edge geometry motifs recur), yet no pattern break or cadence shift reweights the dominant stake with visible consequence; the ending restates the opening premise without escalation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The benthic city, reinforced glass dome, cold water, and pressure are vividly anchored and filtered through Lirael's professional gaze. The chain link is handled twice (pocket → held up at lesson) and its rough edges constrain her tactile experience. However, the setting does not force a tactical choice at closure; the final beat floats in "cold, dark water" without the environment altering her options or charging the image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Lirael's desire to navigate by starlight for herself—is signaled in paragraph four but remains abstract throughout. The lesson at the city's edge introduces a spatial move but no reversal or tightening; Tarel's question deflates immediately with Lirael's reassuring answer. No on-page choice narrows options or forecloses a path with legible cost; the resolution ("learning to navigate by starlight herself") is told, not earned by protagonist agency under pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the "unfolded horizons" and edge-geometry motifs, and the chain link's reprise attempts to ground heaviness within vastness. Yet the final paragraph delivers overt thematic summary ("teaching her students to embrace the unknown") that replaces scene pressure. The piece gestures toward complexity ("somber marvel," smallness within vastness) but the ending articulates the thesis rather than letting the image resonate without statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, and perceptual filtering (spired silhouettes softened by black water, faint glow of energy crystals) is consistent. Dialogue from Tarel and Lirael advances the lesson but lacks subtext or distinct idiom; both speak in complete, articulate exposition. The prose carries a steady narrative distance, though peak moments default to filter verbs ("felt adrift," "felt a sense of purpose") that dull immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and sensory detail is selective (cold glimmer, rough edges, faint glow). Paraphrase loops appear: paragraph four's "wanted to learn…wanted to feel" and paragraph six's dual uses of "edge geometry" within three lines. Template stems recur ("She was," "She turned," "She began") without taught pattern. Filter-verb reliance ("felt," "looked," "listened") in peak beats reduces propulsion. Information density is adequate but scaffolding ("a sense of," "the beauty of") pads key moments.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The benthic-city setting and bioluminescent aliens offer surface novelty, but the instructor-learns-from-teaching arc and the chain-link-as-grounding-metaphor are familiar templates executed without fresh synthesis. "Unfolded horizons" and "edge geometry" function as prompt labels rather than transformed concepts with unique implications. The emotional truth—awe at vastness, finding purpose—reads as generic wonder without specific, lived particulars that distinguish this voice and stakes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Lirael is present throughout and her role frames every scene. She makes one on-page choice—taking students to the city's edge—but it does not narrow options or alter tactics under pressure; the lesson proceeds as planned. Her final realization is told in summary rather than shown through a decision with cost. Mid-band: functional but swappable with any mentor figure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The chain link appears in two beats: Lirael handles it alone (paragraph four) and holds it up during the lesson (paragraph six). Its rough edges and weight are embodied, and the sailor's advice ("keep you grounded") returns thematically at closure. However, the object does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; it illustrates the theme rather than driving causality. Two-gate participation (setup, payoff reprise) with thematic charge but no causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Unfolded horizons" is named three times and functions as thematic backdrop (new maps, expanded understanding, embracing the unknown). It does not shape on-page tactics or choices; Lirael's lesson and navigation methods remain abstract. The concept echoes in dialogue and reflection but never redefines options or constrains action. Functional atmospheric label, swappable with "new frontiers" or similar.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>Students are described once as "balancedly curious, neither too eager…nor too fearful" (paragraph two). The trait does not enable or constrain any student's on-page choice; Tarel's single question is polite setup, not a dramatized tension between curiosity and caution. Label-only mention without visible cost or friction. Ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>"Expand" appears in Lirael's dialogue ("expand our understanding of edge geometry") and thematically in her goal to expand her own horizons. The lesson at the city's edge expands spatial scope but does not turn the plot; no choice is redefined by the act of expansion. The action is present and thematically consistent but swappable with "deepen" or "explore" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Edge geometry" is named in paragraph two, explained in paragraph six (using chain-link angles to calculate distance), and repeated in Lirael's final line. Its mechanics are asserted ("angles and lines…chart a course") but never demonstrated or tested under pressure. The method shapes the lesson's content but does not alter tactics or outcomes. Present across beats, thematically coherent, yet functionally ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The benthic city is anchored early (dome, spired silhouettes, black water, pressure) and the edge lesson moves to colder, more intense water. Setting provides vivid atmosphere and professional context, and the final image places characters "surrounded by cold, dark water." The environment does not force a tactical choice or supply a resource that alters outcome, but it charges the closure image with physical specificity. Setup and closure linkage without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The timeframe "after discovering aliens" is established in paragraph one and referenced once more ("long before the aliens were discovered"). It provides backstory context but does not tighten decisions or create urgency; the lesson proceeds without time pressure. The aliens' presence enables new maps and constellations but the "after" itself does not constrain tactics. Functional setup, no development or payoff.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Lirael's desire "to learn to navigate by starlight" is stated explicitly in paragraph four and rephrased at closure ("learning to navigate by starlight herself"). The motivation frames her interior arc but is not dramatized through conflicted on-page choices; no friction between this want and a competing cost or fear. Told and reprised with thematic consistency, but not tested under pressure. Setup and closure mention without visible tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Somber marvel" is embodied throughout: "faint, cold glimmer," "smallness of her place," "awe at the vastness," and the quiet ending gesture. Tone modulates subtly (reflection alone → communal lesson) and charges the final image without melodrama. The tone is coherent and sustained, shaping the reader's stance, though it does not shift decisively under escalating pressure. Strong setup and closure coherence with moderate payoff.</comment>
