<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is declared ("to reimagine an entire civilization") but his interior life remains abstract and label-driven. The plan to cover mirrors reads as poet-archaeologist whimsy rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously under pressure. His final speech ("You see? The Luminari didn't build this. They buried it.") is thesis-statement delivery, not embodied choice with visible cost. The ending grants him victory without foreclosing a path or showing what he sacrificed to plant those seeds.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Drive lens: Causal with heavy exposition. The piece declares a dispute, a vase destroyed by lackeys, and a plan, but the core pressure—covering mirrors during a storm—occurs off-page in summary ("He began...he draped...the storm arrived"). The fungi blooming is a convenient reveal that solves the dispute without on-page friction or cost. Orientation is delayed (baroque asteroid, cobalt time haze, Council lackeys) until paragraph two, but the effect does not pay off at closure. The ending summarizes weeks of dispute rather than dramatizing a single decisive change, leaving closure as conceptual assertion rather than felt cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The baroque asteroid, cobalt haze, obsidian atrium, and bioluminescent fungi supply vivid texture, but setting functions as backdrop rather than constraint. Spatial choreography is vague (Kael kneels, then somehow drapes an entire atrium, then huddles in a corner). The fungi's growth in the atrium soil is a late convenience that does not constrain earlier choices. The micro-setting (the shard in his hand) recurs but does not alter tactics or charge the final image with physical cost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The dominant stake—proving the Luminari's fraudulence—is signaled early but never tested by on-page opposition. The Council "declared him a heretic" and "tore down his drapes," yet Kael had already planted the fungi before the storm, so the conflict is retrospective. No reversal narrows his options; the fungi bloom exactly as planned. The ending summarizes weeks of mounting evidence rather than a single tightening choice. Agency is preparation, not decision under pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The theme—truth buried by power, mirrors as distorted reflections—is stated overtly: "By obscuring the Council's distorted reflections, he'd forced them to confront the raw, unpolished truth." The final paragraph moralizes: "Civilizations...were built on the courage to see what mirrors hide." The vase shard and fungi are symbolic convenience rather than particulars that earn insight. The piece tells its theme instead of letting it emerge from Kael's choices and their cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited holds, but diction oscillates between ornate high register ("burnished with sorrow," "palimpsest of erased voices") and explanatory summary ("The scholars scoffed, but Kael's reputation...lent his madness a dangerous allure"). Kael's interior reads as narrator exposition rather than character-specific perception. Dialogue is sparse and thesis-driven; his final speech articulates the story's argument rather than pursuing a goal with subtext. POV modesty slips when narration asserts the fungi "mirrored the Luminari's architectural layouts" without showing Kael's process of discovery.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Sentence-level overwriting clusters in high-pressure beats: "a howling maelstrom of cobalt and violet," "his voice burnished with sorrow," "a fungus of revolution." Template cadence runs: "Once, Kael had fought...now, he fought..." and "The Luminari didn't build this. They buried it...This isn't a relic of their glory. It's a map to their crimes." Paraphrase loops: paragraph four explains the mirror-covering plan, then paragraph five re-describes the execution. The final paragraph recycles the shard/hope/promise triad without adding pressure. Stock metaphors (slow fuse, seed of doubt) dull specificity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The baroque asteroid and time-as-visible-haze offer surface novelty, but the core premise—lone scholar uncovers truth that powerful faction suppressed—is template. The mirror-covering plan reads as quirky flourish rather than synthesis of character, world, and stakes; it could be replaced with another symbolic act. The fungi blooming on cue to prove Kael's thesis is convenience plotting. The ending's metaphor ("to see what mirrors hide") is generic wisdom that could migrate to any story about hidden truth.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Kael's identity as a "defunct revolutionary" is mentioned in the opening and later referenced ("his reputation as a former firebrand"), but it does not constrain or enable his on-page choices. The plan to cover mirrors and plant fungi could be executed by any archaeologist. His revolutionary past is label-only context rather than a trait that shapes tactics or final cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The vase shard appears in the opening (Kael holds it), is wrapped during the mirror-covering (paragraph five), grows warm during the storm, glows faintly when he holds it up to the Council, and is displayed in the atrium at the end. It reappears across beats but functions as passive symbol rather than tool that alters tactics. Its "microscopic archive of voices" is scanned off-page and summarized. The shard's presence in the final paragraph charges the image slightly, but it does not create a turn or foreclose a path.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The archaeological dispute frames the story and drives Kael's goal throughout. The vase's destruction by Council lackeys sets up the shard as evidence. The fungi's markings matching the shard's etchings directly shifts the dispute's terms. The ending summarizes "weeks" of escalating argument, granting the dispute causal role in multiple beats. However, the dispute itself is told rather than dramatized; no rival scholar appears on the page to oppose Kael in scene, so the concept shapes stakes in summary rather than through on-page pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Poetically inclined" appears in the opening tag and colors the mirror-covering plan's "poetic logic," but it does not constrain or enable a specific action with cost. Kael's interior voice is more expository than poetic. The attribute is label-only rather than a trait that alters his choices or creates friction under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Devise" appears when Kael formulates the mirror-covering plan. The plan is executed, but the major turn (fungi blooming) results from the seeds he planted, not from the mirror-covering itself. The action is present and signaled, but it is swappable with another symbolic gesture; the mirrors do not mechanically constrain or enable the outcome. The plan's causal role is ornamental rather than indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Covering mirrors during storms is Kael's central method, explained in paragraph four and executed in paragraph five. The mirrors are said to "act as conduits for...fractures, amplifying the Council's lies," but this logic is assertion rather than demonstrated mechanics. The Council tears down the drapes, yet the fungi bloom anyway because Kael planted seeds beforehand, so the mirror-covering does not shape the outcome. The method is present across beats but functionally ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The baroque asteroid with visible time and bioluminescent fungi is vivid, but it supplies backdrop rather than constraint. The atrium's soil allows Kael to plant seeds, but any soil would suffice. The temporal storms glimpse alternate timelines yet do not alter Kael's tactics or create cost. The setting is described across beats but does not pressure choices or charge the final image with physical stakes.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Time had only recently become visible as a shimmering cobalt haze" is noted in the opening and tied to the temporal storms, but the timeframe does not tighten decisions or create a live clock. The story summarizes weeks at the end without tracking urgency. Time as a setting feature is ornamental rather than a tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Kael's motivation "to reimagine an entire civilization" is stated explicitly and drives his plan to prove the Luminari's fraudulence. It shapes his goal throughout and is invoked in the ending ("to reimagine, to remember, to grow"). However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choices with visible cost. No on-page moment shows him sacrificing a competing want to pursue this goal.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Burnished sorrow" appears in Kael's speech to the Council and again in the final paragraph ("The burnished sorrow of his task lingered, but so did hope"). The tone is declared rather than embodied through rhythm and image. Under pressure (the Council's accusation), Kael's voice remains explanatory rather than modulating with stress. The tone is present as a label but does not charge the final image with felt cost.</comment>
