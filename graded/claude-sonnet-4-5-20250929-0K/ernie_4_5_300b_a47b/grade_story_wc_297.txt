<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lirael's motivation is stated ("to find the intersection of dreams") but her micro-choices feel abstract—she follows tingles and visions rather than making decisions under visible internal conflict. The golden-eyed double delivers diagnostic wisdom ("fear is a mirror") that resolves her hesitation off-page; no contradictory impulses act simultaneously in scene. Embodiment is present (scars ache, breath hitches) but the final acceptance lacks a dramatized cost that forecloses a live option—her scars vanish painlessly and she walks out "ready," suggesting gain without trade-off.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the maze clipping, scars, visions, and golden-eyed figure layer toward the final convergence. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration ("The intersection of dreams wasn't a place—it was a choice"), but the cost remains abstract—her scars become "faint, glowing lines" without a felt price, and the covenant's repair happens in a single gesture ("pressed it to her heart, and the labyrinth shuddered"). Orientation is anchored early (cobalt glade, Lirael, dusk), but the mechanics of the eclipsed covenant and the future's early arrival are asserted rather than causally earned, leaving the final image more proclaimed than proven.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The cobalt glade is vivid (heather, fireflies, ozone and elderberries) and the Glass Labyrinth's shimmering walls supply atmosphere. Spatial choreography is mostly clear, though the glade-to-labyrinth transition ("hedges parting") blurs briefly. The maze topiary clipping is handled across beats but does not constrain a tactical choice—it activates visions and eventually merges into Lirael's skin without forcing a navigation decision or trade-off within the space.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake (mend the eclipsed covenant) is signaled early. Pressure attempts to escalate through visions and the confrontation with the golden-eyed self, but Lirael's agency is reactive—she follows the clipping's pull and accepts the figure's wisdom without a visible on-page choice that narrows options. The climax compresses into "pressed it to her heart, and the world split open," bypassing a decision beat where cost would be legible. No forfeiture or trade-off appears; the covenant mends and she gains glowing scars, suggesting resolution without price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Theme of accepting wounds/fear emerges through scars and the golden-eyed figure's counsel ("Chasing isn't heeding"). The final line "The intersection of dreams wasn't a place—it was a choice" attempts thematic crystallization but arrives as assertion rather than earned through specific action. The two-moons image offers a conceptual repricing of reality, yet the story does not invite reflection beyond the stated moral—"she'd learned to heed its warnings" closes with thesis rather than resonant ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable; perceptual signature is present ("cobalt light staining her dress," "air tasted of ozone and elderberries"). Distance control holds, though the golden-eyed figure's dialogue ("You're late... you hesitated") reads more as thematic mouthpiece than embodied character voice. Diction is elevated and consistent ("root-bound visionary," "anxious elation") but verges on ornamental at peaks—"the covenant's pulse beneath her skin" leans abstract when embodied specificity would sharpen the moment.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Prose is lyric and controlled ("time pooled like spilled ink," "sky had been sutured shut"), but figurative density is high throughout without pattern-teaching or payoff—nearly every sentence carries a metaphor, which flattens rather than charges key beats. Minor template cadence in the middle (repeated "The" + noun openings) and a paraphrase loop ("Chasing isn't heeding" / "she'd learned to heed") reduce propulsion. The climax compresses causality into summary ("the world split open... the labyrinth was gone"), obscuring the mechanism at the moment of highest stakes.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The core premise (scar-linked visionary mending a dream-world covenant) blends familiar fantasy elements without a sharp inflection. The scars-as-keys motif and the doppelgänger confrontation follow recognizable templates; the transformation occurs when Lirael accepts rather than resists, but this arc is stated more than dramatized. The two-moons image at the end offers visual freshness, yet the emotional and thematic resolution ("she was ready") does not surprise or reweight prior material in an unexpected way.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Lirael is present throughout and makes the final gesture (pressing the clipping to her heart), but most movement is reactive—she follows visions and the clipping's pull. The confrontation with her golden-eyed self offers wisdom, not a decision that narrows options. Her choice to "heed the scars" shapes the ending but arrives as acceptance rather than a turn with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The maze topiary clipping appears in the opening, activates the scar-link method in the glade, and is pressed to Lirael's heart at the climax, becoming "a part of her." It spans three beats and participates in closure, but its mechanics remain abstract—it tingles, provides visions, and merges without constraining a tactical choice or imposing a visible cost during use.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The eclipsed covenant is named early and frames the quest, but its mechanics and stakes remain abstract. The story asserts it fractured "when the future bled into the present" and that Lirael must reweave its threads, yet on-page action does not dramatize what the covenant governs or what cost its rupture imposes. The repair happens in a single gesture without showing how it alters options or tactics.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Purposefully curious" is invoked once as a label ("a phrase her mother had once used... Now, it was a compass") but does not constrain or enable an on-page action with visible cost. Lirael's curiosity is asserted rather than demonstrated through a choice that trades safety for knowledge or incurs a price for exploration.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Heed" is invoked repeatedly ("Heed the scars," "Chasing isn't heeding") and the golden-eyed figure's counsel centers on it. At the climax Lirael whispers "Heed the scars" and the labyrinth responds, shaping the final turn. The action is present in two beats and participates in closure, but its mechanics remain abstract—what heeding entails beyond acceptance is not dramatized, making it more thematic keyword than tactical method.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The scar-link method is introduced early ("scar-link method activated") and Lirael's scars pulse to guide her through the glade and labyrinth. At the climax, linking is implied when she presses the clipping to her heart and her scars vanish. The method appears in three beats but its mechanics are asserted rather than demonstrated—how linking works or what cost it imposes is told, not shown through tactical choices.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The cobalt glade at dusk is anchored early with vivid sensory detail (heather, fireflies, ozone, elderberries) and Lirael kneels there in the opening and returns at the end. The setting provides atmosphere and a spatial frame but does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters tactics—Lirael moves through it rather than using it. The final image adds two moons, reweighting the glade's meaning, which lifts closure participation slightly.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the future arrives early" is named in the setup ("the future arriving early," "The future had arrived early") and frames the covenant's rupture, but it does not create a live clock or tighten decisions on the page. Time remains vague—"three nights prior," "years ago"—and the urgency is asserted rather than felt through a countdown or deadline that alters Lirael's tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lirael's motivation "to find the intersection of dreams" is stated early and frames her quest. The golden-eyed figure challenges her hesitation, and the climax reveals the intersection as "a choice" rather than a place, which engages the motivation at closure. Desire is told more than dramatized—no on-page friction between cost and want pressures her choice; she accepts the wisdom and acts without visible internal conflict or trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Anxious elation" is named once ("The glade hummed with anxious elation") and the tone attempts to blend anticipation with dread ("anxious elation curdled into dread"). The ending shifts to triumph ("never felt so alive," "She was ready"), modulating with the turn, but the emotional charge at the final image reads more as relief than the charged ambivalence the phrase promises. Tone is present but not sustained as a contradictory pressure across beats.</comment>
