<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Mara's interior is present but generic: "she'd learned that some hushes were meant to be broken" reads as therapy-speak rather than character-particular insight. Her final state—"lucid," "awake," "alive"—is told via abstract labels without embodied cost. The needle-work shows micro-choices under pressure, but the fisherman's secret is explained by Elias rather than discovered through Mara's struggle, undercutting agency. Emotional progression from fear to readiness occurs off-page between paragraphs.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph. The net's unraveling drives a single meaningful tightening, and the silver key offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (the fisherman's choice is reweighted, silence is broken). However, the cost remains conceptual and diffuse—Mara's "burden she hadn't known she carried" is asserted rather than dramatized. Elias delivers the thematic explanation ("silence isn't always kindness") rather than the ending image proving it, diluting closure pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The prism sanctuary under starlight is vivid and purposeful; starlight refracts into colors, prisms dance across surfaces, and the setting charges the final image ("stars watched over her"). The tapestry needle is handled across two beats (attic discovery, unraveling work) and the net's physical unraveling structures the climax. Spatial choreography is clear. The sanctuary "accumulates" and releases the hush, constraining Mara's task and shaping the ending's pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—freeing the fisherman's restless spirit by unraveling the net—is clear and tightens once through Mara's needle-work. The net gives way in a burst of light, altering the situation. Cost is implied (the hush's weight lifts) but not viscerally felt; Mara's admission "I'm afraid" and her unsteady legs are brief gestures. The fisherman's secret is revealed by Elias in exposition rather than tested against Mara's own choices, weakening agency at closure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Theme—silence as prison versus release—emerges from the net's unraveling and the sanctuary's accumulated hush. However, Elias's line "silence isn't always kindness" states the moral directly rather than letting the final image prove it. The silver key "to a door that was never locked" risks forced symbolism. The ending offers a non-literal answer (the hum of freed conversations) but the transition from hush to hum is told rather than charged through Mara's final embodied choice.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited on Mara with consistent psychic distance. Voice has texture ("moved like smoke," "old skin") and the needle-work grounds perception. Elias's dialogue ("The stars are aligned") and Mara's ("Sharing secrets takes time") carry distinct idiom. Filter verbs ("She'd felt it too," "She realized") cluster in reflective passages but remain legible. No head-hopping. The phrase "interlaced hush" recurs with purpose, though "lucid" in the penultimate paragraph risks abstract label-speak at a peak beat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Sentences vary in rhythm and openings; the prism/starlight imagery is specific. However, paraphrase loops appear: "Each knot held a fragment of a voice, a laugh, a sob" is restated as "a chorus of ghosts pleading to be heard" without added pressure. Template cadence: "She'd been told… She'd found… She'd come… She'd felt…" across four paragraphs. The phrase "accumulated silence" / "accumulates" / "accumulated" recurs five times, risking synonym churn. Figurative density is controlled except for the late cluster of abstractions ("lucid," "awake," "alive").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The prism sanctuary and centuries-old net offer fresh detail, and the broken-mask-restorer occupation is specific. However, the core arc—mending what others discarded, releasing trapped spirits—follows a familiar template without transformation. The fisherman's secret (a lover's name, silence as protection) is a stock gothic motif. The silver key "to a door that was never locked" is a near-echo of well-worn riddles. Mara's final readiness ("she was ready to listen") resolves into a generic journey trope without a non-obvious synthesis.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Mara (broken mask restorer) is present throughout and her needle-work drives the net's unraveling, creating the key turn (the net gives way, the key appears). However, her choices are largely mechanical (working faster, continuing despite fear) rather than moral or tactical dilemmas. Elias explains the fisherman's secret rather than Mara discovering it through her restoration work. Present in setup, middle action, and ending, but her decisions do not redefine options—she completes the task as instructed.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The tapestry needle appears in two distinct beats: found in the attic (labeled "for the interlaced hush") and used to unravel the net's knots. Its "dulled tip" and years of use are noted, and it grounds Mara's physical work. However, the needle's specific properties do not constrain or enable a tactical choice—any tool could unravel the net. It does not return with reweighted meaning at closure; the silver key replaces it as the charged object.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Interlaced hush" is signaled early (attic box label), recurs as the net's accumulated silence, and shapes the dominant stake (breaking the hush to free spirits). The concept constrains Mara's task: each knot loosens a whisper, and the hush grows louder as she works. At closure, the hush is replaced by a hum of freed conversations, reweighting prior material. The concept is more than thematic—it directly alters the sanctuary's state and Mara's final perception.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Accumulates silence" is attributed to the net's threads and the sanctuary itself ("the sanctuary… accumulates"). The trait is functional: the net holds muffled voices, and releasing them creates the climax's burst of light. However, the accumulation does not impose a visible tradeoff or constrain Mara's method—she simply unravels knots in sequence. The attribute is present in setup and middle but does not force a tactical choice with felt cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Exhume" appears once in the opening: Mara is "told to exhume the truth buried here, to ground the restless spirits." The action frames her goal and the net's unraveling enacts it. However, the verb itself does not recur or shape tactics—Mara "unravels" rather than "exhumes." The fisherman's truth is delivered by Elias in exposition rather than unearthed by Mara's work. Present in setup and thematically linked to closure, but swappable with "uncover" or "reveal."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Unraveling knots in a centuries-old fisherman's net" is signaled early (the net is described in the opening paragraph), executed across the middle (Mara works the needle through knots, each loosening a whisper), and delivers the climax (the net gives way, releasing light). The method's mechanics matter: stubborn knots resist, rhythm builds, and the final knot's release produces the key. The method is causally essential—without the unraveling, no spirits are freed and no closure occurs.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The prism sanctuary under starlight is present in the opening line, its glass walls refracting light into shifting colors. The setting charges the final image: starlight is "brighter," prisms dance, and the stars "watched over her" as she leaves. The sanctuary's spatial logic (glass walls, cold floor, attic) grounds choreography. The starlight does not constrain a choice, but the sanctuary's "weight of the hush" pressures Mara's work and its transformation (hush → hum) is legible at closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Sharing a secret" appears once in Mara's reply to Elias: "Sharing secrets takes time." The phrase is thematic but does not function as a timeframe constraint. The story unfolds across "that night" with no ticking clock or deadline that alters tactics. The fisherman's secret (his lover's name, his choice of silence) is revealed by Elias rather than shared by Mara. Present in dialogue but does not tighten decisions or shape escalation.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"To ground restless spirits" is Mara's stated task in the opening paragraph and recurs when Elias confirms the fisherman "drowned himself" and "the sanctuary… accumulates." Her needle-work enacts the grounding: each loosened knot frees a whisper, and the net's release produces the key that symbolizes the spirits' freedom. However, the motivation is declared rather than conflicted—Mara fears "what I'll find" but proceeds without a visible tradeoff between competing wants. Present in setup, middle action, and ending.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Lucid unrest" is implicit in the sanctuary's "hum," the net's "restless spirits," and Mara's final state: "lucid… Not at peace, exactly. But awake. Alive." Tone modulates from the opening's eerie stillness (glass walls, salt and memory) through the middle's rising tension (whispers escaping, light bursting) to the ending's charged clarity (starlight brighter, hum of freed conversations). However, "lucid" appears only once, in the penultimate paragraph, as an abstract label rather than a sustained tonal texture.</comment>
