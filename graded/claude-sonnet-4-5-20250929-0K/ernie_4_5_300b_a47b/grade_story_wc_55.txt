<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lira's interiority is grounded in sensory particulars (oil, parchment, brass) and her micro-choices show internal contradiction—pausing work to seek the forecourt, touching quartz despite fear. The bear encounter generates embodied tension (throat tightening, trembling hand), but the final shift from "small" to "lighter" reads somewhat declared rather than earned through a visible forfeiture on the page. The choice to remain while opening to new listening is credible but lacks a sharp trade-off that would anchor higher bands.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors cleanly (Lira, workshop, dawn). The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: petrichor seeps, forecourt hums, bear appears, all building to Lira's reconfiguration of the keep as compass rather than prison. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant)—"silence between beats, where dreams breathe"—that reweights her stance with felt cost (years of constriction acknowledged). One deduction: the cost could be sharper; the shift from workshop to listening is named more than it forecloses a legible path with visible sacrifice.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful: brass pendulum, quartz forecourt that sings when touched, moss-patched flagstones. The forecourt constrains and enables—Lira must touch it to unlock the bear's response and her own insight. Petrichor anchors atmosphere across beats. Spatial choreography is clean (workshop → oak door → courtyard → archway). The quartz panel's warmth and hum charge the closure moment, satisfying the 9+ gate criterion for environment shaping the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: Lira's dream of wandering versus keep-bound safety. Pressure tightens when the bear appears, forcing her from observation to embodied choice (reaching toward the quartz). The forecourt's song acts as a reversal that reframes the keep from prison to compass. Cost is implied—years lost, self made small—but the final turn (deciding to "listen" while staying) lacks a visible forfeiture or tactical price paid on the page that would elevate to high 8s.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—listening beyond routine, reclaiming paused dreams—emerges through quartz hum, bear as wildness-messenger, and the "silence between beats" image. No overt moralizing; the ending resonates without stating a thesis. Petrichor and the forecourt's song are concrete anchors. One friction: "The keep was not a prison. It was a compass" borders on epiphany-statement; the prior image work (bear's glance, quartz warmth) carries more weight and nearly rescues it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV is stable; perceptual signature is consistent (Lira notices mechanical details, misses the forecourt's "language"). Diction fits her introverted, technical lens. Rare dialogue ("You're here to remind me") is character-apt and brief. One slip: "glacial hush deepened" and "hidden sunrise climbed higher" rely on elevated poetic register that occasionally floats above Lira's grounded voice, creating minor distance wobble in peak beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies; opening and closing lines anchor voice. Information density is good in the bear sequence. Two frictions lower the score: "She had come to make peace with her abandoned dream, but perhaps the dream had never been abandoned—only paused" is a paraphrase loop that restates interior content across two clauses without added pressure (−0.2). Template cadence in the final workshop paragraph ("She picked up… began to repair… The work was… But now, when she paused…") shows repetitive stem structure across three moves (−0.4). These artifacts touch the closure third, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8 per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The premise—clock scribe meets wild bear in silent sanctuary—offers a fresh juxtaposition. Execution avoids cliché in the bear encounter (it listens, harmonizes, departs without attack). One deduction: the transformation from "prison" to "compass" and the rhythm/silence dichotomy are familiar craft-wisdom metaphors not fully personalized through Lira's unique technical idiom. Swapping "clock scribe" for another artisan role would leave the emotional arc largely intact, signaling moderate swappability.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lira (introverted clock scribe) is present throughout and her choices drive key beats: venturing to the forecourt (setup), touching the quartz (middle choice enabling the bear's purr), and deciding to listen nightly while staying (closure). Early signal strong; causal pressure moderate—her profession colors perception but does not constrain tactics sharply. The trait "introverted" is shown (rarely ventures, silent boots) but "clock scribe" functions more as atmospheric detail than as a skill or limit that alters options under stress. Two gates (setup, payoff) met; middle development is observational rather than decisional until the touch. Band guidance and causal pressure place the score in mid-5s; closure linkage (she returns to scribing with new stance) lifts slightly.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Crystal whispering forecourt after rain appears in setup (shimmering courtyard), middle (Lira touches quartz, it hums warm), and closure (song fades, petrichor lingers; she will listen nightly). Three-gate presence; the touch enables the bear's response (causal pressure), and the nightly listening anchors her final stance (closure linkage). Irreplaceability is strong—quartz's resonance property is specific. One friction: after the initial touch and hum, the forecourt's role in the ending is referenced ("listen to the forecourt") rather than re-handled or shown with new cost, limiting score to upper 7s rather than 8+.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Glacial hush (core concept) is named three times and frames atmosphere, but does not constrain tactics or choices on the page. It deepens as mood marker ("glacial hush deepened") and informs theme (silence as language), yet remains ornamental—removing it would not break plot logic or alter Lira's decision to touch quartz or stay. Present by early middle (setup met), but middle development and closure participation are thematic echo rather than causal pressure. Caps: no clear middle constraint → cap 3.4 violated because closure participation is thematic; adjusting to band 4–5 for functional theme presence without plot necessity.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Excruciatingly gentle (attribute) appears in the opening beat (adjusting pendulum weight with gentle movements) and implicitly in the forecourt sequence (trembling hand, soft approach to bear). Setup met; the trait enables the bear encounter to remain non-threatening and aligns with Lira's decision to listen rather than flee (middle/closure). One on-page cost: her gentleness has kept her "small" and shackled, a tradeoff acknowledged at closure. Causal work is moderate—trait shown twice, informs stance—but the cost is more reflective summary than visible forfeiture in peak action. Two gates (setup, closure theme linkage); middle is inferential. Band ~6.0.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Bear (action/encounter) is the story's central turn: it forces Lira from workshop to courtyard choice, triggers the forecourt's song, and its departure ("looking back") crystallizes her new stance. Setup (appears mid-story but functions as the inciting reversal), middle (paw lift, harmonized growl, Lira touches quartz in response), and closure (vanishes, leaving imprint; she commits to listening for its "ghost"). Three gates; strong causal pressure (Lira's touch and final choice hinge on bear's presence); high irreplaceability (no generic "wild creature" would carry the same resonance weight). The bear shapes two distinct beats (arrival/song, departure/decision) and charges the ending image. Closure linkage and cost connection are clear.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>N/A</grade><comment>Method: None.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Soundless sanctuary (setting) frames the entire piece: Vellichor Keep's silence is both prison and resource. Setup immediate (opening line); middle development shows the forecourt as acoustic crucible (hum, song) that enables Lira's breakthrough; closure repositions the keep as "compass" whose walls no longer define her. The setting constrains (years of safety = smallness) and supplies the resonance that changes her stance. Three gates met; causal pressure strong (silence and stone enable the song that reweights her choice). One friction: the keep's transformation is somewhat declared ("not a prison… a compass") rather than shown through a new spatial move, limiting irreplaceability slightly.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Hidden sunrise (timeframe) bookends the story ("hush of a hidden sunrise" opens; "climbed higher" closes) and marks a single dawn window, but does not tighten decisions or create tactical urgency. Time is atmospheric rather than a live constraint—no clock pressure, no narrowing window that forces faster choice. Setup met (early signal); middle and closure participation are lyric reprise without causal work. The dawn light "spilling through windows" at the end recharges the opening image (lyric allowance), but removing precise timeframe would not alter Lira's agency or cost. Band ~4.0 for functional lyric presence without pressure mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Motivation (to make peace with an abandoned dream) is explicit in the reflection beat ("she wondered if silence could be a kind of violence") and implicit in the courtyard choice and final decision to listen. Setup strong (dream mentioned early, contextualized by keep choice); middle shows friction (fear vs. curiosity when bear appears); closure delivers peace as redefinition (dream "paused," not dead; listening replaces wandering). Two gates clearly met (setup, closure); middle friction is present but not a sharp on-page collision of wants. The desire is told and shown, but peak choice lacks visible cost—peace comes through insight rather than forfeiture. Band ~6.5–6.9.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Petrichor nostalgia (tone) is vivid and coherent: earthy rain-smell, moss, memory of lost dream, bear as ghost. Setup immediate (petrichor in opening); tone modulates across beats (wonder during song, wistfulness at closure: "petrichor lingered, thick and sweet"). The tone charges the final image ("dreams breathe" in silence between beats). Three gates met; coherence strong. One friction: "petrichor nostalgia" as a named tone is somewhat self-conscious, and the nostalgic register stays steady rather than sharpening under peak pressure (touch, bear departure). Tone supports closure but does not intensify with cost in the climax beat, capping upper range slightly below 8.</comment>
