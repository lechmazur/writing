<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and his astonishment at ghosts is embodied, but his interior life remains generalized. The decades-long silence and sudden speech at the end lack contradictory impulses acting in scene; the shift reads as linear enlightenment rather than genuine internal conflict. His "tranquilly perceptive" stance never creates a visible mistake or friction. The final choice to speak feels declarative rather than earned through prior micro-choices that reveal competing desires.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes who/where/when adequately and delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration at closure: Elias speaks, the box shatters, and the covenant is "untangled." However, the cost is asserted rather than felt—what does Elias lose by breaking his silence? The ghosts simply fade, the oasis "sighs," and he feels "light," which reads like convenience rather than foreclosed options. The accumulative lens is legible but the ending skips the price required for 7+ entry.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The scorched wasteland and beekeeping oasis are vividly anchored with strong sensory detail ("dried to brittle yellow," "wind carried the shards"). The stained glass box is described across multiple beats and its glow pressures Elias's final choice. However, the setting never constrains a tactic—Elias sits, gazes, and speaks without the environment limiting or complicating his path, preventing 9-band eligibility.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving the weight of unspoken words—is signaled early and tightens through the box's glow and the ghosts' message. Yet the escalation is passive: Elias observes the box morning after morning until it pulses and instructs him to speak. No reversal narrows his options; coincidence (the box lighting up) resolves the pressure. The lack of visible trade-off or foreclosed path at closure caps the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The theme of unspoken words and tangled covenants emerges organically through the box, ghosts, and Elias's silence. The final image—shards scattering like stars—offers a resonant visual answer without stating a moral. However, "the weight of unspoken words" is repeated almost verbatim, and the line "some words were too heavy to carry alone" skirts platitude. The theme is coherent but lacks the non-obvious inflection required for higher scores.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with appropriate psychic distance. The opening diction ("sun that had forgotten mercy") and narrative texture are consistent and controlled. However, several lines drift into elevated abstraction incongruent with a recluse's interior: "tangled covenant," "tranquilly perceptive," "surge of understanding." Filter verbs ("seemed to pulse," "felt a surge") are acceptable but cluster in the climax, dulling immediacy when urgency peaks.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and the prose is largely clean. However, paraphrase loops weaken pressure: "preserve the weight of unspoken words" and "unspoken words were not lost; they were waiting" restate the same concept. Template stems appear in adjacent lines ("He spoke of love, of loss, of regret. He spoke of the beekeepers..."). Stock metaphor ("shards glinting like a star") and the phrase "heart light for the first time in years" are generic. Cumulative minor slips prevent high-band entry.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The premise—ghosts become visible and guide a recluse to speak—follows a familiar redemptive-epiphany arc. The stained glass box as vessel for trapped words is a workable conceit, but the beekeeping oasis and scorched wasteland remain ornamental postcard details rather than integral to the moral calculus. The ending's message ("Speak") is transparent and on-the-nose. No fresh inflection transforms the template; the story could run unchanged with a different artifact and setting.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elias is present throughout and his decision to speak is the climax, but he spends most beats passively observing. His astonishment is noted early but does not constrain a choice. The recluse trait is functional setup but swappable with "hermit" or "solitary keeper."</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The stained glass box appears in setup, middle (glow and images), and closure (shatters). It is handled across three beats and its transformation drives Elias's final act. The box's color-shift and warmth are specific details that matter. Strong integration; edges toward indispensable but the shatter feels partly ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The "tangled covenant" is named twice but never dramatized as a constraint or enacted through conflicting obligations. It operates as thematic shorthand rather than shaping on-page stakes or tactics. Present and logically consistent, but replaceable with "forgotten promise" or "broken bond."</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Tranquilly perceptive" is asserted in paragraph three but never enacted. Elias's gazing and contextual inference are quiet observation, not a visible tradeoff where calm perception costs him speed or skepticism. The trait is ornamental label.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Gazing appears in setup (daily ritual), middle (leaning closer to the box), and closure (he sees images, then acts). The gaze enables the ghosts' message and primes his speech. Two beats with clear function, but easily swappable with "listening" or "waiting." Strong lyric presence; not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Through contextual clues" is noted once in paragraph four—dust settling, light filtering—but the method is told, not shown shaping an attempt. The box later pulses and delivers a direct command, bypassing inference. Present but not developed across beats.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The abandoned beekeeping oasis is anchored early with vivid detail (silent hives, brittle honeycombs) and the stone hut supplies the table and artifact. The scorched wasteland frames tone. The setting participates in closure (oasis sighs, shards scatter) but never constrains a choice or tactic. Strong atmospheric work; one step below essential.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"After ghosts became visible" is signaled in paragraph three and the ghosts are active in setup, middle, and closure. The timeframe is functional and not swappable, but it does not tighten pressure—no live clock alters Elias's moves. The shift is a premise marker rather than a tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The motivation to "preserve the weight of unspoken words" is stated early and drives Elias's daily ritual and final act. It appears in all three gates. However, the want is never dramatized in friction with a cost or competing desire; he simply enacts it when instructed. Functional across beats but not irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Mute eloquence" is coherent: silent protagonist, vivid setting, restrained diction. The tone modulates slightly (opening gravity, climactic warmth) and charges the final image (shards like stars, lightness). However, the tone is consistent rather than dynamic under pressure. Solid integration; does not reach indispensable.</comment>
