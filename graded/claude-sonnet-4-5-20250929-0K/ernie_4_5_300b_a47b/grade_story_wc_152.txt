<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Zara's motivation to "listen for unheard stories" and her embroidery work are established, but her internal contradiction remains largely decorative—the "disguising wisdom as foolishness" trait is asserted rather than tested through genuine micro-choices with visible cost. Jaxon's presence feels functional but his arc is minimal; he moves from thinking her foolish to seeing wisdom, yet this shift is told ("Now he saw the wisdom") rather than dramatized through a conflicted choice. The candle-synchronization moment is intriguing but Zara's agency reads more as demonstration than decision under pressure. No clear path is foreclosed with felt cost on the page; the ending gestures toward revelation without anchoring what Zara risks or renounces.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land early and remain stable. The piece attempts a Hybrid lens—causal in the candle-revelation beat, accumulative in the cosmic-embroidery motif—but the closure unit lacks decisive on-page cost: the silk "changes" under flame, yet no tactical option narrows and no visible price is paid. The coup timeframe creates ambient tension but does not tighten choices on the page; Jaxon's telescope news and the "messenger star" complicate atmosphere without altering Zara's available moves. The final image ("truth is never what it seems… hidden in the seams") offers conceptual repricing, but the conceptual cost remains oblique—no social, relational, or opportunity price is legible in the ending lines.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The cobalt observatory, autumn winds, frosted windows, and eternal candle are vivid and purpose-driven; the candle constrains Zara's demonstration and charges the final beat. Spatial choreography (sconce placement, telescope, embroidery hoop) is clear and anchored. However, the observatory's larger layout and the "council" remain abstract; we do not see how the space limits or enables evasion, access, or discovery beyond atmospheric detail. The flame and silk together function as micro-setting that charges the closure image, lifting the score into the mid-6s.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving celestial truth before the coup—is signaled early, and the council's telescope-moving announcement introduces urgency. Yet the escalation reads as ambient rather than causal: Jaxon brings news, Zara performs a candle demonstration, but no live choice narrows her options or forces a visible trade-off. The "synchronizer" moment hints at a method, yet we do not see Zara act on it with cost—does she risk exposure, lose time, forfeit safety? The ending reweights meaning conceptually but does not articulate what price she pays or what path she forecloses on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme—truth hidden in seams, observation versus action, wisdom disguised—emerges through the embroidery motif and the candle-flame synchronization without overt moralizing. The spiral-to-line transformation and "adjacent possibilities" offer conceptual resonance, and the "truth is never a straight line" pays off the opening stitching image. However, the thematic answer remains declarative rather than embodied: the ending tells us "the truth is hidden in the spaces between" without a concrete choice or renunciation that charges that insight with felt cost. The piece invites reflection but does not fully earn its conceptual repricing through dramatized pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Zara with brief internal access to Jaxon; no head-hopping. Voice carries a distinct lyric-cosmic register ("comets," "galaxy-chart embroiderer," "echoed silence") that fits the observatory setting. Dialogue is sparse but functional; Zara's lines ("A stitch out of place, and the whole pattern unravels") feel slightly aphoristic yet remain in character. Free-indirect style is clean. However, the narration occasionally slips into exposition ("her work a blend of artistry and astronomy," "Disguising wisdom as foolishness was her method") that tells rather than shows the perceptual signature under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and figurative language (needles "darted like comets," flame as "star's last breath") is vivid but occasionally dense without clear causal propulsion. Two paraphrase loops appear: "her charts were blueprints of rebellion" restates the earlier "decorative / message" distinction, and the "truth is never what it seems… hidden in the seams" pair reiterates the same concept without added pressure. Filter-verb stack in paragraph 5 ("thought her foolish… saw the wisdom") and template cadence in paragraph 6 ("Zara stood… walked… adjusted… murmured") mildly dull immediacy. No major artifacts touch the closure beat, so cumulative deduction remains modest (−0.6 in-band for loops and template stems).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The galaxy-chart embroiderer premise offers a fresh occupational synthesis of artistry and astronomy, and "synchronize through adjacent possibilities" hints at a non-obvious method. However, the emotional and plot arc—observant artisan hides truth from authoritarian council on the eve of upheaval—follows a familiar template without transforming it through a risky, non-obvious choice. The candle-flame demonstration and silk transformation are memorable images, yet the closure does not hinge on a lived-in detail or moral calculus that feels inevitable in hindsight. The piece reads as imaginative setup more than daring execution.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Zara is present throughout and her embroidery work is described in multiple beats. However, her key "decision" in the ending is to demonstrate the synchronization rather than pursue a choice with stakes—she lifts the candle, the silk shimmers, and she delivers an aphorism. This is observation-demonstration, not a turn that alters tactics or forecloses a path. The character is functional but replaceable in the conflict's mechanics; another scholar or astronomer could perform the same role with minor edits. Early signal (+0.5), two beats (+0.9), but weak causal pressure (−0.6) and no clear cost (−0.5).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The eternal candle is introduced early (paragraph 2), handled twice (Jaxon moves the sconce, Zara lifts it to illuminate the chart), and returns in the ending to charge the synchronization image. The flame's symbolic weight ("star's last breath," "synchronizer") is asserted but its mechanical function—how it enables or constrains Zara's choices—remains abstract. The object participates in closure but does not impose a visible cost or narrow options; the demonstration could occur with another light source. Early signal (+0.6), two beats (+0.9), lyric reprise (+0.4), but swappability (−0.5) and ornamental use (−0.6).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Unraveling conspiracies" appears as backdrop (the council's veil of lies, the coup) but does not drive on-page choices. Zara's work is preservation and observation, not active unraveling; the "messenger star" and Jaxon's telescope news complicate atmosphere without altering Zara's tactics. The concept is thematically echoed but does not shape stakes on the page. Present but ornamental (−0.7), late functional involvement (−0.4), swappable with "preserving hidden truth" (−0.6).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Disguises wisdom as foolishness" is asserted in paragraph 3 ("a necessity… curiosity could be mistaken for treason") and Jaxon's realization in paragraph 6 ("He'd always thought her foolish… Now he saw the wisdom"). However, the trait is told rather than shown through a visible tradeoff on the page—no scene demonstrates Zara choosing to appear foolish at a cost or enabling an action that would fail without the disguise. Early signal (+0.5), thematic presence (+0.3), but label-only (−0.6), no on-page cost (−0.5), summary-only (−0.4). Cap at 4.6 for missing setup demonstration.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Synchronize" is named in paragraph 8 ("The flame… is a synchronizer. Of possibilities. Adjacent ones") and demonstrated in paragraph 9 (the silk shimmers, the spiral unravels into a line). The action appears in the ending and reweights meaning, but it does not enable a prior beat or narrow options under pressure—it is revelation without tactical cost. The mechanics are vague: what does synchronization achieve that observation alone cannot? Late signal (−0.6), one beat (+0.4), closure linkage (+0.8), but swappability with "reveal" or "illuminate" (−0.5) and no visible cost (−0.4).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"Through adjacent possibilities" is introduced late (paragraph 8) as Zara's explanation ("The ones the council can't see") and invoked again in the closing lines. The method is label-only—no scene shows how adjacent-possibility mechanics differ from ordinary observation or constrain Zara's approach. The phrase is intriguing but remains ornamental without demonstrated mechanics. Late signal (−0.6), summary-only (−0.6), swappable with "hidden dimensions" (−0.7), no middle development (−0.5). Cap at 3.4 for missing middle-beat involvement.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The cobalt observatory is established in the opening line and anchors all action; autumn winds, frosted windows, the domed ceiling, and the candle sconce create vivid atmosphere. The setting supplies the candle (central object) and the telescope (Jaxon's discovery beat). However, the observatory's spatial constraints do not force a tactical choice—Zara could perform her work elsewhere. The setting functions as charged backdrop more than active pressure. Early signal (+0.7), three beats (+1.4), closure linkage (+0.9), but tactical swappability (−0.6).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Before the coup" is signaled in paragraph 2 ("the coup was coming") and invoked in Jaxon's news ("They're moving the telescopes tonight"). The timeframe creates ambient urgency but does not tighten on-page decisions—no clock forces Zara to choose between finishing the chart, hiding it, or confronting the council. The coup remains offstage setup. Early signal (+0.6), two beats (+0.9), but no live clock altering tactics (−0.7), vague tracking (−0.4).</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"To listen for unheard stories" is stated in paragraph 1 ("a deeper purpose: to listen for unheard stories, whispered through the static of the cosmos") and echoed in the synchronization reveal (adjacent possibilities "the council can't see"). The desire frames Zara's work but is not dramatized through a conflicted choice—we do not see her weigh listening against safety, speed, or another goal with visible cost. Early signal (+0.6), thematic presence (+0.5), closure linkage (+0.5), but told-only (−0.6), no friction dramatized (−0.5).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Echoed silence" appears in the opening ("silence more pronounced"), paragraph 6 ("only the echoed silence of revelation"), and pervades the atmospheric tone (wind rattling windows, scholars whispering, Zara's pauses). Tone is coherent and modulates subtly with the candle demonstration, but "echoed" as a descriptor remains more poetic assertion than charged final image—the ending emphasizes revelation over silence. Early signal (+0.6), three beats (+1.4), closure presence (+0.5), but static mood across turns (−0.4), ornamental descriptor (−0.4).</comment>
