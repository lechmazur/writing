<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lirael's interiority is heavily abstracted through concept-labels ("esoteric realist," "transiently rooted existence") rather than embodied contradiction. The work of knotting silk is concrete, but her motives remain philosophical summary—"honor the overlooked histories"—never tested by competing wants or genuine cost. The moth's death and the monarch's arrival prompt emotional declaration ("chest tight," "heart full") without micro-choices that foreclose paths. No meaningful internal conflict or trade-off shapes the closure; she simply continues her self-assigned mission without alteration or renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors arrive early. The piece structures as one extended scene but delivers no decisive change or felt cost at closure—Lirael exits affirming the same purpose she entered with. The monarch's visit is framed as transformative ("its visit had changed her") yet no prior option is foreclosed and no tactic shifts on the page. The final image recycles her opening stance without reweighting it. Closure reads as restatement, not reconfiguration, and cost remains asserted rather than legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The grotto is vividly rendered with moss, mist, peach-and-lavender clouds. Sensory detail (spider silk texture, moth wing shimmer) is purposeful and filtered through Lirael's focus. However, the environment never constrains a choice or alters tactics—she kneels, weaves, and departs without spatial friction. The lattice dissolves off-page by morning, mentioned but not shown to pressure the ending. Strong descriptive specificity, but the setting remains backdrop rather than crucible.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake: to honor the moth's overlooked history by signaling the monarch. No meaningful tightening occurs—Lirael completes her lattice without obstruction, the monarch arrives on cue, and she resumes her practice. The interrupted cadence of her breathing and knotting is described but never escalates or forces a trade-off. Agency is present (she acts), but the work yields no reversal, no cost, and no narrowing of options. Pressure is steady ambient rather than accumulating with consequence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Theme—bearing witness to the unseen—emerges from image and action rather than statement until the final paragraphs, which over-explain ("her purpose: to bear witness, to remember, to honor"). The moth wing and monarch juxtaposition carries symbolic weight, but the lattice's dissolution is told, not shown, blunting the transiency motif. The ending offers philosophizing ("transiently rooted beauty of existence") instead of a non-literal answer rooted in scene particulars. Complexity is gestured toward but resolved into tidy affirmation without counter-pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Narrative voice is consistent, lyric-descriptive, with controlled diction ("spun sugar," "blushing stillness") that matches the reflective focalizer. No head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present but not deeply character-specific—descriptions trend toward the aestheticized universal rather than idiosyncratic filtering. Free indirect style is clean. The final paragraphs shift into expository summary ("she had found her purpose") that flattens psychic distance just as closure should crystallize. Rhythmic control under pressure is steady but not dynamic.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout ("hymn," "ghost of its former life," "geometric shadow, a map of loss and hope") without pattern-teaching or escalation logic; metaphors pile in descriptive rather than propulsive service. Paraphrase loops appear: "She had honored… with humility" echoes "the chance to honor" from paragraph two; "bear witness, to remember, to honor" is synonym churn. Template cadence in the penultimate paragraph: "She would return… She would continue… She had found…" Final section over-explains rather than trusts image. Information density is moderate; several beats restate the same conceptual ground. Clarity is intact but momentum drags under decorative weight.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Premise—artist honors ephemeral creatures through temporary structures—fits familiar templates (solitary creative witness, nature-as-teacher, symbolic object). The grotto-above-clouds setting and "last monarch butterfly" add lyric specificity, but the arc is generic affirmation without transformation or risk. The moth/monarch pairing is symbolic but predictable. No turn surprises; the ending confirms the opening stance. Emotional truth is present but wrapped in aesthetic abstraction rather than lived friction. Lacks a non-obvious synthesis or pressure-driven inflection that would make this telling indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Lirael ("esoteric realist") is present throughout but her label functions as theme-carrier rather than trait that shapes choices. She observes, weaves, and reflects; no decision alters tactics or forecloses a path. The character is the vehicle for the concept but does not drive a turn.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Moth wing appears in paragraph one (held, trembling), tucked into the lattice in paragraph five, touched by the monarch in paragraph six, and reflected upon in the closing. Four beats, but its role is symbolic anchor rather than tool that constrains or enables choice. It charges the final image moderately by linking fragility and endurance. Setup, development (lattice placement), and closure reprise all present; causal pressure is light.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Interrupted cadence" is mentioned explicitly in paragraph four (breathing rhythm) and paragraph seven (knots, pauses, waiting as prayer), but remains descriptive metaphor rather than stake-shaping constraint. It echoes thematically without altering options or tactics. Present in two beats but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Transiently rooted" is named in paragraph two and restated in the final line ("transiently rooted beauty of existence"). It describes Lirael's belief system but does not constrain or enable an action with visible cost. Label-only presence; no on-page trade-off tied to this attribute.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Knotting (spider silk into lattice) structures paragraphs three through five: learning the skill, executing with precision, tucking the moth wing. The work is meticulous and embodied, and the lattice is the object the monarch lands on, driving the story's central image. Removal would collapse the mechanism. Early signal, middle beats, closure participation. Causal and specific.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Building temporary structures as signals" is introduced in paragraph three (months of learning), executed in paragraphs four-five (lattice construction), and mentioned again in closing (she will continue the work). Mechanics matter moderately—precision and ephemeral nature are noted—and the method enables the monarch encounter. Present across setup, middle, and ending; causal role is functional but the method could be swapped for another ritualized craft with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Verdant grotto above the clouds is vividly described in paragraph one and supplies the moss Lirael kneels on. It frames the scene but never constrains choice or alters outcome. Postcard lyricism without tactical pressure. Early setup, present in the action, but replaceable with any quiet sanctuary setting.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Last monarch butterfly's migration" is introduced in paragraph two and fulfilled in paragraphs six-seven when the butterfly arrives and departs. The timeframe motivates Lirael's urgency ("waited years for this moment") but does not tighten decisions—she completes her work and the monarch appears as expected. Functional bracket without a live clock that alters tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"To honor overlooked histories" is stated in paragraph two, drives the lattice construction (paragraphs three-five), and is restated in paragraphs seven and nine ("she had honored the moth's overlooked history"). The desire is present but never conflicted—no competing want or cost tests it. Told motivation with dramatized action, but no friction between wants and price.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>"Blushing stillness" appears in paragraph seven and closing ("the grotto's stillness lingered"). Tone is coherent—quiet, reverent, lyric—throughout, and the phrase charges the final image with atmospheric weight. Static mood rather than modulating with pressure; it names rather than enacts the emotional temperature. Present in closure with moderate resonance.</comment>
