<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The coachman's interiority is filtered through vivid physical work and his soldier-to-gardener arc, but remains somewhat distant—we see his actions and hear his beliefs stated rather than experiencing contradictory impulses in real time. The smile at the end ("a rare gesture") is told rather than embodied through micro-choices that reveal what he's renouncing or gaining. The bird-language skill and grandmother backstory feel more like résumé lines than lived constraints that force a difficult choice on the page. The final whisper carries thematic weight but doesn't foreclose a path with visible cost; we don't see what he's traded or what he now cannot do.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece operates in Accumulative/Textural mode: the coachman's ritual scattering of seeds and mixing of fertilizer accumulates meaning toward the final image of flowers swaying like flames. However, no decisive tightening or deepening occurs—he begins planting, continues planting, and rides away with "heart light." The Orientation Test is satisfied (coachman, jetty, twilight established early), but the closure lacks visible cost: the garden "will" bloom tomorrow, the battlefield "is becoming" a garden, yet no on-page price is paid or option foreclosed. The storm gathering on the horizon offers atmospheric charge but doesn't reweight the stakes or force a renunciation. The piece reads as a meditation on hope rather than a story with legible before/after pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The blooming jetty is vividly realized—saltwater/freshwater collision, damp sand, shell fragments, flowers in violet and gold—and the setting pressures the coachman's choice of this "narrow strip of land where life struggled to take root." Sensory details (salt and decay, gull cries, tern's wing brushing his shoulder) are filtered through his attentiveness to soil and rhythm. The final image of flowers "flickering like tiny flames" charges the closure, though the storm remains atmospheric rather than altering tactics. Spatial choreography is clean; the jetty functions as both literal ground and thematic fulcrum.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—letting a garden reclaim the battlefield—is signaled early and remains coherent, but pressure never tightens. The coachman encounters no obstacles: the seed pods crack open, roots seek purchase, bird calls guide him, and he rides away with a light heart. No reversal or deepening forces a trade-off; the storm "gathering on the horizon" is spatial backdrop, not a complication that alters his tactics or costs him something on the page. The piece offers accumulative texture but lacks the meaningful tightening or felt cost required for higher escalation scores under any lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the seed pods, fertilizer from the reef's "final gasp," and the coachman's shift from soldier to gardener. "Submerged concord" and the dead-language term *Khalis* ("the space between breaths") enrich rather than announce the thematic question of harmony beneath chaos. The final whisper—"The earth remembers"—and the image of flowers "flickering like tiny flames" offer a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. However, the piece trends meditative rather than dramatically earned; the thematic weight rests on stated belief ("he believed the garden… could stitch them back together") more than on-page struggle that transforms understanding.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with strong perceptual filtering: the coachman's attention to bird calls, soil rhythms, and the "narrow vastness of hope" anchors the voice. Diction is elevated but controlled ("gull's language was a dialect of loss"), and the grandmother backstory anchors his bird-deciphering skill without exposition dump. However, the voice occasionally drifts into essay register ("a concept that mirrored his own," "the idea that even in ruin, there was room to grow") that abstracts rather than dramatizes. Free indirect thought is mostly clean; no dialogue to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and rhythmically controlled, with strong images (hooves sinking into damp sand, petals "flickering like tiny flames"). However, template cadence appears in the middle section: "He'd chosen it… He'd learned… He mixed… He stood…" across consecutive beats. Paraphrase loops surface ("the battlefield was becoming a garden" restates the motivation without added pressure). Several filter verbs ("he believed," "he heard") dull immediacy in peak moments. Metaphoric density is high ("jetty's flowers defied the gloom," "sky bled from orange to indigo") but remains coherent. Minor scaffold and synonym churn lower the score within band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The combination—soldier-turned-coachman gardening with bird-language and dead tongues—offers fresh synthesis, and the "narrow vastness" framing is memorable. However, the emotional arc (war → gardening as healing) follows a familiar template, and the piece resists complication: no setback, no renunciation, no tactical shift. The specific details (dried seed pods, crushed bone fertilizer, *Khalis*) elevate texture, but the story could function with generic substitutions (veteran, grief, hope) without structural loss. Risk-taking is moderate; the lyric mode is handled competently but doesn't heighten stakes or force an unconventional turn.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The coachman frames the story and his actions—scattering seeds, mixing fertilizer, surveying his work—anchor every beat. However, his choices are procedural rather than conflicted; he encounters no obstacle that forces a tactical shift or trade-off. The final decision to ride away with "heart light" and return tomorrow is continuation, not turn. Present in setup, middle, and closure, but causally passive.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The seed pods appear in the opening (setup), are scattered mid-story (development: "their brittle shells cracking open to release tiny, pale roots"), and are referenced at closure ("lay half-buried, their roots already seeking purchase"). They enable the planting action and carry symbolic weight (relics from before the reef died). However, they do not constrain a choice or force a cost; they could be replaced with generic seeds without breaking story logic. Two-beat involvement with lyric reprise, but swappable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Submerged concord" is named once mid-story ("the idea that harmony could exist beneath chaos") and echoed thematically in the final image, but it does not shape on-page tactics or force a decision. The coachman's belief in stitching rhythms together is stated rather than tested. Present as theme layer, but not as causal pressure or constraint. Label-only use trends low under the rubric.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The coachman "spoke dead languages" and uses them to frame his bird-listening skill and to whisper the final phrase ("The earth remembers"). However, the trait does not constrain or enable a choice with visible cost; it functions as atmospheric detail rather than tactical lever. Present in setup (libraries, grandmother), middle (Khalis), and closure (whispered phrase), but ornamental. No on-page tradeoff tied to the skill.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Fertilizing is the coachman's central on-page action: he mixes crushed bone and ash from the reef, guided by bird calls, and works it into the sand. The action is prepared (pouch in satchel), executed mid-story ("mixed the fertilizer into the sand, his hands moving with practiced care"), and referenced at closure ("one fertilized patch of sand at a time"). It drives two beats and is causally necessary for the garden's survival. Not easily swappable; the reef-sourced fertilizer carries thematic weight. Strong integration, though no visible cost or obstacle complicates the act.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Bird-call understanding is signaled early (grandmother teaching, childhood skill), enables middle tactics (flicker's trill tells him to dig deeper, heron's cry warns him to water sparingly), and is present at closure (tern's cry with *Khalis*). The method matters: without it, he could not "coax life from death." However, no cost or tradeoff is tied to the listening; the birds always guide correctly. Three-beat involvement with causal pressure, but frictionless use lowers irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The blooming jetty at twilight anchors every beat: the coachman stops there, kneels in the sand, works as twilight shifts from orange to indigo, and glances back as storm clouds gather. The setting's collision of saltwater and freshwater explains his choice ("where life struggled to take root… if a garden could thrive here, it could thrive anywhere"). The twilight shift modulates tone, and the flowers' glow charges the final image. Setup, development (site choice pressures the attempt), and closure participation all present. Strong integration; the exact setting matters to stakes and final image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"After the reef dies" establishes the post-war frame and motivates the fertilizer source (crushed bone and ash from the reef's final gasp), but it functions as static backstory rather than live pressure. No tightening clock or evolving consequence; the story unfolds in one evening without time constraint altering tactics. Present as context and thematic anchor, but does not shape decisions or tactics on the page. Functional but replaceable timeframe.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The coachman's desire to let a garden reclaim the battlefield frames the story, explains his shift from soldier to coachman, and drives his planting actions. The motivation is stated clearly ("determined to let a garden reclaim the battlefield") and embodied in his careful, patient work. However, no friction or competing want tests the desire; he encounters no cost or obstacle that forces him to choose between reclamation and something else. Present across beats and at closure, but told and uncontested rather than dramatized through conflicted choice.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Narrow vastness" is explicitly named (*Khalis*: "the narrow vastness of hope, the idea that even in ruin, there was room to grow") and coheres across the piece: the coachman's quiet determination, the jetty as a "narrow strip," the flowers' fragile defiance, and the final image of petals "flickering like tiny flames" against gathering storm. Tone is elegiac yet hopeful, modulating from gloom to light without contradiction. It charges the final image but remains static—no tonal shift that deepens pressure or complicates the stance. Coherent and purposeful, but single-register throughout.</comment>
