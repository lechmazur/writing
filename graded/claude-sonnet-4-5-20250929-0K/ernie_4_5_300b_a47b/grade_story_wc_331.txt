<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Eleanor's internal life is present but relies on safe abstractions ("archivist of the unseen," "Mobius strip" metaphors) rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The midnight ritual shows some embodied searching, but the pivot to "finding the place where stories live" lacks the friction of a genuine internal conflict—she moves smoothly from restlessness to epiphany without visible cost or foreclosed paths. The choice to "continue" at the end feels declared rather than earned through prior causality that narrows options.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes a contemplative accumulative lens through Eleanor's catalog of sensory details and metaphors, but the closure—floating manuscripts in a circular room—arrives as a convenient payoff rather than a reconfiguration built from prior pressure. The scarf's whisper "Continue" offers poise but the cost remains abstract; no tangible path is foreclosed on the page. The midnight sequence introduces new rules (mirrors, floating papers) without prior constraint or friction, weakening causal coherence even under an accumulative reading.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The scientific poetry library is vividly rendered with Edison bulbs, leather-bound volumes, and the interplay of equations and sonnets on shared shelves. However, the environment functions primarily as atmospheric backdrop; it does not constrain Eleanor's choices or alter her tactics. The scarf (lavender, ink, aged parchment texture) is handled in multiple beats and the candlelit midnight setting charges the final sequence, but the spatial choreography in the mirror-corridor dissolves into abstraction without grounding the reader in lived physical limits.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"to find the place where stories live"—is signaled early and drives Eleanor's midnight ritual, but the escalation is smooth rather than pressured. No live option is tested or foreclosed; the circular room appears as a reward without prior obstacle or tactical trade-off. The young patron's skepticism softens instantly without resistance, and the final "transformation" of patrons lingering longer lacks a visible cost tied to Eleanor's earlier restlessness. One tightening (the midnight chime and shimmer) is present but does not narrow options under the inferred lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The theme of stories as living, tangible forces emerges through the scarf, hyperbolic geometry metaphors, and the poet's claim to "fold time like origami." The midnight sequence attempts a non-literal answer ("the space where light bends"), but the final insight—"analog memories… transform"—arrives as an articulated thesis rather than an image that reweights prior material. The patron's conversion and the library's "new vitality" feel asserted rather than dramatized, and the closing "Continue" whisper edges toward direct thematic statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Eleanor's voice is consistent and literate, with vocabulary ("hyperbolic surfaces," "Mobius strip") that fits her role. The dialogue with the young woman is natural and goal-driven, advancing the hyperbolic geometry motif. However, interiority occasionally drifts into expository reflection ("she needed to reawaken them—to find the place where stories lived") that explains rather than shows, and the midnight sequence's narration ("She'd found it—the place where stories lived") tells the epiphany instead of embodying it through perception and micro-choice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and the prose is generally clear, but the piece suffers from mild scaffold artifacts: "Eleanor smiled" / "Eleanor nodded" / "Eleanor whispered" template stems, and paraphrase loops around "stories as living things" and "the impossible." The midnight sequence accelerates well with short declaratives ("The candles flickered. Books began to shift"), but the floating-manuscript beat relies on stock phrasing ("the air hummed with energy") and the poem's italicized lines feel inserted rather than woven into Eleanor's perception. Proximity to closure (the final "Continue" whisper) keeps the impact moderate.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The premise—librarian uses hyperbolic geometry to access a metaphysical story-space—attempts a fresh synthesis, but the execution leans on familiar motifs: magical midnight ritual, floating manuscripts, a mystical mentor figure. The scarf and the poet's origami metaphor are specific touches, yet the core turn (Eleanor discovers a hidden room through visualization) follows a stock portal-fantasy template. The young patron's conversion and the next-morning vitality feel like satisfying but expected beats rather than a non-obvious inflection earned from prior particulars.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Eleanor is present throughout and makes the choice to perform the midnight ritual, but her decisions are smooth rather than pressured. She observes, reflects, and "focuses," but no visible cost attends these choices. The final "Continue" is a declared stance rather than a turn that forecloses a live option. Two gates (setup, payoff) are met; middle development is thin (she explains hyperbolic geometry but does not use it to overcome an obstacle). Swappability is moderate; another seeker could perform similar actions with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The scarf is introduced early (first scene), handled in the midnight sequence (draped over Eleanor's shoulders), and returns in the final paragraph (tied around her neck, whispering "Continue"). It accumulates meaning from poet-to-librarian and charges the closure image. However, its specific properties (lavender scent, raised threads) do not constrain a tactical choice; it functions more as talisman than tool. Three gates met; causal pressure is mild. The final reprise reweights the motif but does not impose a felt cost.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Analog memories" is discussed in Eleanor's opening reflection and echoed in the next-morning exchange ("They don't just inform—they transform"), but it remains a thematic label rather than a stake-shaping concept. The scarf and books are physical, but the text does not dramatize a moment where analog versus digital alters Eleanor's options or tactics. Setup and payoff present; middle development absent. Easily swappable with "material histories" or "embodied knowledge."</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Sanely eccentric" is declared twice (colleagues' nickname, Eleanor's Mobius-strip line) but not enacted through a choice that trades normalcy for insight. The trait is label-only; we do not see Eleanor constrained or enabled by it in a beat where a more conventional approach would have worked. Setup and payoff present as mentions; no middle beat where the attribute narrows options. Generic descriptor without visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Reawaken" is Eleanor's stated goal and the midnight ritual enacts it (books shift, stories "clamor"), but the action is smooth rather than contested. The next morning's "new vitality" is told, not shown in a beat where reawakening alters a patron's choice. Three gates met; the method (focusing on the scarf, visualizing curves) is present but does not overcome an obstacle or impose a tradeoff. Swappable with "unlock" or "commune with" without major structural change.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>Hyperbolic geometry is mentioned in the patron dialogue and visualized briefly in the midnight sequence ("traced a finger along the lines, imagining"), but its mechanics never constrain or enable a specific choice. Eleanor "realizes" it is "a key" and the text asserts she can "bridge the gap," but we do not see how the method's unique properties (curved space, spiraling infinity) shape her tactics differently than another metaphor would. Setup and partial payoff; no middle development. Replaceable with another abstract visualization technique.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The scientific poetry library is vivid (Edison bulbs, equations sharing shelves with sonnets) and frames every scene. It supplies the tome and scarf Eleanor uses in the midnight ritual, and the next morning's "pulse with new vitality" shows a change in the space. However, the setting does not pressure a choice—Eleanor moves freely through it without spatial constraint or resource limit. Three gates met; causal involvement is indirect (the library's books enable but do not constrain). Micro-setting (the candle, the tome) charges the midnight beat.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>The timeframe "while patrons browse" is anchored in the opening (10:47 PM) and the young woman's visit, but after midnight the patrons leave and the constraint disappears. The clock is checked once and does not tighten Eleanor's tactics; she has unlimited time for the ritual. Partial setup (opening scene); no middle or closure participation. The next morning is outside the specified window. Time does not alter moves or impose a live deadline.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Eleanor's desire "to find the place where stories live" is stated in the first third ("She needed to reawaken them") and drives the midnight sequence. The floating-manuscript room is the literal payoff. However, the want is smooth—no conflicting impulse (fear of failure, doubt, cost of neglecting duties) creates friction. The text tells us she feels restlessness but does not dramatize a choice where finding the place forecloses another path. Three gates met; mild causal pressure; cost is abstract.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Observed solitude" fits the midnight library setting and Eleanor's reflective interiority, but the tone flattens rather than modulating with pressure. The patron exchange and the mirror-corridor sequence carry the same contemplative register; no shift in cadence or emotional texture marks the escalation. The final image (scarf whispering "Continue") sustains the mood but does not charge it with new pressure or reweight prior beats. Coherent but static; does not shape the ending's emotional cost.</comment>
