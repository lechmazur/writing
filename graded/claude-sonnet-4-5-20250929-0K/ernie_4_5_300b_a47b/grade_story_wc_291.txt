<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Clara's face-blindness trait generates her professional method (texture/shadow reading) and her embodied perception is consistent. However, her epiphany about Lila arrives through assertion rather than earned struggle: "For the first time, she *saw* her—not as a victim, but as a person" reads as a declarative leap rather than a choice under pressure. The final "awakened something" exchange tells rather than shows transformation, and the ribbon's meaning ("a plea for *connection*") is interpreted without internal friction or visible cost to Clara's prior stance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Causal with light Accumulative texture. Orientation is clean (quarry, mist, Clara's purpose established early). The handprint discovery and locket emergence follow because/therefore logic, but both arrive via Voss's investigation rather than Clara's agency reshaping tactics. Closure offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (the portrait complete, empathy "awakened"), yet the cost remains conceptual and asserted: framing the ribbon feels commemorative rather than foreclosing a live option on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The quarry is vividly anchored (mist, granite, jagged pit, damp stone scent) and spatial choreography stays clear throughout. The lantern, charcoal, and ribbon fragment are handled across beats, and the pit's "abyssal mouth" recurs to charge the final image. The setting pressures mood and constrains discovery (unstable site, faint indentation), meeting the 9+ gate, but does not force a tactical pivot that alters Clara's or Voss's next move.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (solving the cold case via empathic insight) is signaled early. One meaningful tightening occurs when the handprint and locket surface, narrowing the victim's identity and motive. However, Clara's role is largely interpretive—she sketches and explains while Voss excavates physical evidence. The resolution (reopening the case) is Voss's procedural decision, not Clara's choice under competing pressures, and no live option is visibly foreclosed with felt cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Theme (empathy vs. numbness, presence vs. absence) emerges through the ribbon fragment and the act of sketching memory into stone. "Opposites unified" recurs in image and dialogue, but the final beat states the thesis overtly: "Empathy's never truly dormant. It just needs the right key" is a thematic summary rather than a resonant, non-literal image. The framed ribbon becomes a symbol asserted rather than one that reweights prior material through earned particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Clara; perceptual signature (texture/shadow focus, embodied face-blindness) is consistent and voice-specific. Dialogue carries subtext in the Voss exchange ("You think art can solve what logic can't?"), and register matches both characters. However, peak-beat interiority leans explanatory: "She knew no one would recognize her face. So she left something else" interprets the victim's motive with unearned certainty, and Clara's final smile and Voss's surprise feel staged rather than contradictory or embodied.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Opening line anchors voice and stakes cleanly; rhythm varies and sensory detail is vivid. However, several lines loop conceptually: "Not just feel it. *Understand* it" paraphrases the prior exchange, and "death and life, forgetting and remembering" lists opposites already shown in image. The phrase "furrowed hush" appears twice without reweighting. Figurative density is high but controlled; mixed metaphors are absent. Minor scaffold ("Her motivation had always been...") intrudes once but does not obscure causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The face-blind portrait artist premise offers a fresh synthesis, and the quarry setting is specific. However, the cold-case structure and the empathy-as-key resolution follow familiar arcs: the misunderstood clue (ribbon), the buried locket, the detective's procedural reopening. The victim's masquerade-love backstory and Clara's framing gesture trend toward symbolic tidiness. No bold structural or moral risk reshapes the template, though the sensory execution elevates the material above generic.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Clara is present throughout and her face-blindness shapes her method (texture reading). However, her key "decision"—interpreting the ribbon and sketching—does not alter tactics or foreclose options; Voss finds the handprint and locket. She observes and explains rather than choosing under competing pressures. The trait is functionally integrated but does not drive a pivotal turn.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The ribbon fragment appears in paragraph one (setup), Clara handles it in her pocket and uses it to guide Voss's tracing (development), and it is framed beside the portrait at closure (payoff). All three gates met. However, the ribbon's meaning is asserted ("a plea for *connection*") rather than discovered through Clara's constrained choice, and the framing is commemorative rather than causally necessary to the case reopening.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Cold cases frame the premise and Clara's professional role. The case is "reopened" at the end, but the concept does not tighten options or impose a live procedural constraint during the scene. The timeframe ("years after") and Voss's procedural authority matter more than cold-case mechanics. The concept is thematic backdrop rather than a driver of on-page tactics.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Methodical" is declared ("Clara's methodical nature demanded answers") and her sketching is deliberate, but the trait does not visibly constrain a choice or force a tradeoff. The handprint discovery arises from collaborative work, not from her method excluding faster or riskier moves. The attribute is label-present but does not enable or foreclose a key action with cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Lance" appears once in a metaphorical context: "to lance the numbness that had settled over the case, to revive the dormant ache." The action is described as Clara's motivation but not performed on the page as a discrete, physical, or tactical move. No scene turn traces to this verb as an irreplaceable act; it functions as a thematic claim rather than a plot driver.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Unifying opposites" is signaled early (Clara's belief, the quarry's geometry) and recurs in her sketching (hard/soft, light/dark). The method shapes her interpretive work: overlapping marks reveal the handprint. However, the handprint could emerge from any collaborative tracing; the "opposites" frame enriches theme but does not mechanically gate the discovery or final choice. Setup and development present; payoff is thematic.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The quarry is established early, pressures mood (unstable site, mist, silence), and supplies the pit, boulders, and faint indentation that guide discovery. The setting recurs in the final portrait and frames the closure image. All three gates met. The quarry does not force a tactical pivot (Clara and Voss could work elsewhere), but its specificity and recurring charge elevate integration above functional.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"After the evidence disappears" (ribbon found "years after") frames the cold-case premise and motivates Clara's visit. However, elapsed time does not tighten on-page decisions or impose a procedural clock. The scene unfolds in one continuous window without urgency tied to the timeframe. Setup present; development and closure participation absent.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Clara's motivation ("to awaken dormant empathy") is stated early and recurs in dialogue and the final exchange. Her sketching and interpretation dramatize the attempt. However, the motivation does not face on-page friction or force a trade-off: Clara never risks professional standing, relationship capital, or alternative closure paths. The desire shapes her role but lacks visible cost. Setup and development present; closure thematic rather than choice-driven.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Furrowed hush" appears twice and the tone (quiet, reverent, mist-laden) holds across the scene. Diction ("benediction," "lance," "yawned") sustains the register, and the tone modulates slightly when the locket surfaces (throat tightens). The final image ("hush following them like a benediction") charges closure. Coherent and functional; not indispensable to plot logic but thematically resonant.</comment>
