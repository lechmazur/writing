<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Lira's interiority relies heavily on abstract declaration ("wisely adventurous—a paradox forged by decades") rather than embodied contradiction in action. Her climb features declared fear ("Fear was a luxury she couldn't afford") but no visible cost or micro-choice that forecloses a path until the ending. The guardian encounter resolves through insight rather than dramatized internal conflict, and the final realization feels asserted rather than earned through prior micro-choices under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph, avoiding the penalty. However, the closure unit—Lira recognizing her face in the mural—lands as a conceptual repricing without legible cost on the page; the throne "was never unclaimed" reframes the quest but forecloses no visible path and exacts no felt price. The drive lens reads as causal through the middle (ruby flake → stairway) but shifts to thematic assertion at the end without dramatized consequence, failing the cost proof test. Apply −0.6 for closure without on-page cost and −0.3 for lens drift at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The orchard's bioluminescent trees and kaleidoscopic waterfall establish vivid texture early, and the hollow tree convergence constrains Lira's path. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout. However, the setting functions primarily as backdrop after the initial anchor; no environmental detail constrains the guardian confrontation or charges the final throne image, capping the score below 9+ eligibility.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—find the stairway before sunrise—is signaled early and drives the first two-thirds. The mural sequence offers one escalation (ruby flake unlocks the staircase), but the guardian trial resolves through a question rather than agency that forecloses options. The ending asserts metaphorical transformation without visible cost: Lira "didn't sit" and descends unchanged in capability or social position, undercutting closure pressure. No persistent constraint shapes the final image.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The throne-as-mirror theme is signaled through the murals and lands in the final revelation, offering a non-literal answer to self-realization. However, the closing paragraph ("The future wasn't a place to fear—it was a story to write") delivers an explicit thematic summary that replaces scene pressure, triggering a −0.6 penalty. The concept of "unclaimed throne" functions more as symbol than lived particulars that constrain Lira's tactics.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with consistent perceptual filtering through Lira's lore-keeper lens. The prose carries some register inflation ("eons," "cathedral of shadows") that edges toward elevated diction but remains legible. The guardian's dialogue ("Not blood, but truth. Not power, but purpose.") reads as stilted aphorism rather than goal-driven speech, but this is brief. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks harm clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Sentence openings vary and paragraph rhythm supports scene shifts. However, multiple paraphrase loops appear: "the stairway of ascension" recurs six times across adjacent paragraphs without reweighting, and "the throne was never unclaimed" / "It waited for the one who'd see herself" restates the same insight. The closing paragraph cycles through three reformulations of the lesson without adding pressure. Apply −0.6 for template cadence and paraphrase loops; no artifacts touch the closure beat directly, so cap at the stated range.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The core premise—hidden trials leading to self-realization via symbolic throne—closely matches quest-template structures without fresh particulars. The mural-peel mechanic offers a tactile detail but functions as setup rather than constraint. The "throne was never unclaimed" reversal is signaled but not transformed through lived cost; the ending's assertion that the journey was metaphorical reads as late reframing rather than earned synthesis. Apply −0.8 for derivative premise without transformation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lira frames the narrative and her decision to climb drives the middle escalation. Her question to the guardian ("What does the throne demand?") creates the final turn. However, her choice not to sit lacks visible cost or tactical consequence, and the descent is summarized rather than pressured. Present in setup, middle choice, and ending, but the ending participation is passive observation rather than causal action.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The ruby flake appears in four beats: initial pulse, mural keyhole unlock, guardian confrontation grip, and final pendant transformation. It unlocks the staircase (causal pressure) and reappears with reweighted meaning at closure. However, the pendant transformation is told rather than used to alter a final choice, limiting closure charge. Scores in the 6-band for multi-beat involvement with one strong causal moment but passive ending reprise.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The unclaimed throne is named early and frames the quest stakes. It appears in the chamber confrontation and the final revelation. However, it functions primarily as symbol rather than object that constrains tactics: Lira's choice not to sit is assertion without visible cost or foreclosed option. The concept reweights thematically but does not alter on-page options or tactics in the closure beat.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Wisely adventurous" is declared once in the opening as label-only exposition ("a paradox forged by decades of studying prophecies while refusing to let fear paralyze her") but never dramatized through on-page tradeoff or visible cost. No scene shows wisdom constraining adventure or vice versa. The climb proceeds without hesitation or tactical friction tied to this duality.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>0.0</grade><comment>"Sally" does not appear in the text. The story features a climb and a descent but no action labeled or matching the term "sally" (a sudden charge or venture forth). Absent.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The peel-of-paint-layers method is signaled in the opening third ("peel of paint layers" + riddle), used across three beats (first mural, map mural, keyhole mural), and its mechanics matter: each揭去 (peel) reveals a fragment that guides Lira's path. The method directly enables the staircase unlock. However, it does not reappear or shape the guardian trial or throne confrontation, limiting closure linkage. Scores in the 6-band for multi-beat causal involvement without ending reprise.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The hidden orchard behind the kaleidoscopic waterfall is anchored early and provides spatial staging throughout. The hollow tree convergence offers one micro-constraint (destination focus). However, the orchard does not pressure the guardian confrontation or alter the throne chamber choices; it functions as vivid backdrop rather than tactical environment. Present in setup and middle spatial moves but passive at closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Sunrise is declared as deadline in the opening ("before sunrise") and checked once in the middle ("sky had shifted from indigo to violet"), creating brief time pressure. However, elapsed time is not tracked in the climb or chamber confrontation, and the ending summary ("first rays of sunrise") confirms success without on-page tension tied to the clock. The timeframe complicates but does not drive tactics or choices.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>"Find the stairway of ascension" is declared in the opening and drives Lira's movement through the orchard and the climb. The mural sequence dramatizes pursuit of this goal across multiple beats. However, the motivation shifts at closure to self-realization without visible friction between the original goal and the revealed truth; the throne revelation is accepted rather than contested. Scores in the 6-band for multi-beat pursuit with passive acceptance at closure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Futuristic elements (bioluminescent fruit, spectral guardian "shifting between human and machine") and nostalgic tone (ancient journals, forgotten constellations, centuries-old throne) are present but operate as parallel textures rather than integrated modulation. The tone remains static across pressure beats; the guardian confrontation and throne revelation do not shift register or charge the nostalgic layer with future cost. Functional but does not modulate under pressure or charge the final image.</comment>
