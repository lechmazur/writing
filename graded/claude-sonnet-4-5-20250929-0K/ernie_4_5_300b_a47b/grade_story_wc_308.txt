<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Kael's interior life reads largely as abstraction: "resolve weathered but unbroken," "his mind attuned to the echoes." The final-morning turn lacks embodied stakes—he walks with measured steps but no on-page micro-choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. Internal contradiction is absent; the piece narrates adjustment without showing contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The closure unit is a realization ("understood") followed by a descriptive walk the next morning. Cost is asserted ("journey just beginning") but not dramatized—no option is foreclosed, no tactics altered on the page. The piece teaches an Accumulative lens through layered imagery (echoes, dust, birds) but the final image ("The pulse was with him") restates theme without reweighting prior material through a decisive action or renunciation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The bone towers and canyon echoes are vividly rendered and recur across beats. However, they function primarily as atmospheric anchors rather than tactical constraints—Kael's ascent, vigil, and descent are not shaped by environmental obstacles or resources. The arrowhead is handled twice (held, warmed) but does not alter a choice; it confirms rather than complicates.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—learning to navigate without moving—is declared but never tested through a trade-off or reversal. Kael observes birds, feels the pulse, and concludes alignment is the answer; no live option is narrowed, no price paid on the page. The figure-eight pattern serves as confirmation rather than complication, and the morning descent enacts the insight without friction.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the pulse/stillness paradox and the figure-eight motif. The final insight—alignment over capture—avoids overt moralizing. However, the piece leans on abstract phrasing ("harmony with the world," "trust in the pulse") rather than a concrete, non-literal image that reweights prior material. The arrowhead's mosaic and the birds' return are present but do not carry fresh ambiguity or felt consequence at closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with a consistent elevated register ("bruised sky," "chorus of voices"). Perceptual signature is present—Kael reads the world through patterns—but diction remains uniform across calm reflection and peak realization, missing the compression or rhythm shift that would match emotional intensity. No dialogue to judge. Filter verbs ("watched," "felt") appear frequently but remain voice-coherent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops appear: "The pulse wasn't something to be chased or captured; it was a guide" restates "to navigate without moving wasn't about stillness but about alignment" within two paragraphs. Template cadence runs through "He had been trained," "He had learned," "He had always believed" across the opening third. Stock metaphors—"skeletal fingers," "river" for pulse—recur without fresh vehicles. Rhythm is steady but lacks propulsion during the vigil and morning walk.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The core premise—mystical stillness achieved through observation—closely follows familiar contemplative-fantasy templates. The figure-eight pattern, bone towers, and wandering pulse are vivid details but do not transform the underlying arc: patient seeker observes sign, gains insight, walks forward with new understanding. Transformation test fails—swap "harmonic stone skimmer" and "pulse" for "monk" and "chi" and the emotional beats hold unchanged.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Kael is present across all beats and makes two on-page micro-choices: waiting for the flock and removing the arrowhead. Neither narrows options or alters tactics with visible cost. His "understanding" is narrated rather than enacted through a decision that forecloses a path. Swappable with any contemplative seeker.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The arrowhead is handled in two beats (traced in opening, held at night) and its warmth/vibration is noted three times. It confirms the pulse but does not enable or constrain a choice—Kael's insight would proceed without it. Present in closure paragraph but passive ("tucked safely"). Specific properties (worn smooth, mosaic surface) add texture but lack causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The pulse is named early and recurs as thematic shorthand ("force neither fully understood," "river," "guide"). It shapes the story's question but does not alter on-page tactics—Kael does not test conflicting methods or pay a cost to access it. The pulse's mechanics remain abstract; no scene demonstrates what happens when it is ignored or misread.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Historically reverent" appears as exposition in paragraph one ("Kael's people, historically reverent") and colors the carvings and echoes but does not constrain a choice. Kael's reverence is told, not tested—no moment where irreverence would solve a problem faster or where reverence exacts a visible price.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>"Appraise" is dramatized once: Kael closes his eyes and reads the birds' formation. The V/spiral/figure-eight taxonomy is established, and the figure-eight triggers his vigil. However, the act of appraisal does not redefine options mid-scene—it confirms rather than complicates. Swappable with "observe" or "interpret" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The flock's patterns are seeded early, detailed at the first arrival (V/spiral/scattered meanings, figure-eight execution), and return in the final paragraph. The method shapes Kael's vigil and validates his insight. However, the birds do not create a reversal—they affirm rather than challenge. Mechanics matter (pattern = clue) but lack friction or cost.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The bone towers and canyon echoes are present in opening, middle ledge, and closing descent. Kael ascends, sits, and descends without environmental obstacles or resources altering his choices. The setting charges atmosphere but does not pressure tactics. Micro-setting (the ledge, the arrowhead in hand) is concrete but passive.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Through centuries of layered dust" appears as descriptor (opening, closing) but does not function as a timeframe that tightens decisions. The vigil spans one night; the walk occurs "the next morning." No urgency, no clock. Centuries are told backdrop, not a constraint that alters Kael's moves on the page.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"To learn to navigate without moving" is stated early as ancestral goal and Kael's lifelong pursuit. The desire drives his vigil and fuels the realization. However, it is not dramatized through conflicting wants—Kael does not weigh leaving the canyon versus staying, speed versus patience. The friction is historical (ancestors failed) rather than present.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Weathered resolve" is named twice (paragraphs 4 and 8) and reflected in Kael's patient vigil and measured descent. Tone remains consistent—calm, reverent, determined—across reflection and realization. It does not modulate under pressure (no crisis to test resolve) but charges the final image: "his resolve weathered but unbroken" bookends the opening and closing, reweighting endurance as victory.</comment>
