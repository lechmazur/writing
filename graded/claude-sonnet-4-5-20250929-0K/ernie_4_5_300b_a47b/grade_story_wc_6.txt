<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is clear—firefighter as redemption for father's arson—but her interiority leans toward label-speak ("smothering guilt," "restlessness") rather than embodied contradiction. The bird-fixing scene shows competence but minimal internal struggle; her lie about the coin's protective power is the sharpest character move. The group's arrival feels externally imposed rather than organically complicating her stakes. Mara's choices drive more on-page tension than Lira's.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—scars-as-growth pattern established early and reprised at closure. Orientation is clear (lagoon, Lira alone, then group arrives). The closure image (grain of black sand vanishing, "scars sing" theme restated) offers Conceptual Repricing but the cost is asserted rather than dramatized—no visible forfeiture or tactical shift accompanies the realization. The bird's release is Mara's change, not Lira's; Lira remains observer. Missing a protagonist-driven tightening that narrows options or changes knowledge with felt cost on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The obsidian lagoon, volcanic sand, and dunes are vivid and purposefully selected. Sand's hiss and glint operate as micro-setting anchors. Spatial choreography is clean (edge, kneeling, dunes behind). The lagoon pressures the metaphor (fertile soil from ash) but does not constrain a tactical choice in scene; the coin and kelp are used, not the lagoon itself. Strong descriptive control without final-beat constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: proving scars can heal/sing. The bird repair offers one escalation beat but the pressure is diffused—Mara owns the emotional choice (letting go), Lira facilitates without personal cost or trade-off. The man's comment about her father is deflected cleanly with no friction. No reversal narrows Lira's options; the resolution (grain released) is contemplative summary rather than a decision under duress. Accumulative lens expects deepening; here the theme is restated without tightening prior material.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme of scars singing is seeded early (arsonist's daughter, grafting new roots) and returned at closure via the sand grain and final line. The bird's wing as scar-metaphor is apt. However, the final paragraph tells the theme ("Compassion…wasn't about erasing the past") rather than letting the image carry it. The specificity of volcanic sand and coin anchor the concept, but the ending shifts into abstract philosophizing ("all were scars. And all of them sang") instead of letting particulars resonate without gloss.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable; perceptual signature (firefighter's alertness, physical grounding) is present. Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven in the Mara exchange. Some diction slips: "gracefully alert" reads as imposed label, "kelp-drift peace" never lands as lived tone, and "scars don't forget…they learn to sing" edges into aphorism rather than Lira's interior idiom. Filter use is light. The voice is competent but not indelible; no syntactic signature under peak pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies; sentence openings are diverse. Some overwriting: "edges frayed by years of smothering guilt" stacks metaphors, "jingle like a warning" is generic, "a sound like wind chimes" is stock. Paraphrase loop: "She'd inherited her father's restlessness but channeled it into firefighting" then "to outrun the flames he'd once fed" restates the same causal link. Final paragraph tells theme rather than advancing image. Clarity is high; momentum sags in the reflective close. No loops severe enough to obscure closure but density could tighten.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Arsonist's-daughter-as-firefighter is a familiar redemption frame; the volcanic-sand-as-fertility metaphor is apt but well-trodden. The coin-as-talisman and bird-with-broken-wing are serviceable but not transformed. The "scars sing" motif is present throughout but announced rather than discovered. Mara's release of the bird offers the story's most specific emotional turn. The frame feels assembled from prompt elements rather than synthesized into an organic necessity; swapping lagoon for another symbolic landscape would not fundamentally alter stakes or arc.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Lira is present throughout and her backstory frames the theme, but she facilitates Mara's choice rather than making a key turn herself. Her decision to use the coin and kelp is practical, not conflicted. The grain release at the end is contemplative gesture, not a decision that alters tactics or forecloses a path. Setup and middle presence satisfied; closure participation is ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Black volcanic sand appears in three beats: scooped and examined (fertility metaphor seeded), implicit in the bird repair context, and released as final image. The grain's vanishing reweights the scars-as-growth theme. However, the sand does not constrain a choice or enable a tactic; it functions as symbol rather than agent. Setup, middle thematic use, and closure reprise present; causal pressure absent. Strong lyric resonance but not indispensable to plot logic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Unyielding compassion" shapes Lira's choice to help the bird despite no personal stake and her calm deflection of the man's comment. The concept is lived in the repair scene. However, the compassion is unopposed—no cost, friction, or competing want tests it. The final reflection tells the concept ("carrying the weight…turning it into something that could grow") rather than dramatizing a trade-off. Present and thematic, but not pressured into tactical stakes.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Gracefully alert" appears once as label ("Lira turned, gracefully alert, her firefighter's instincts humming") without constraining or enabling a visible action. The instinct does not alter her response—she simply crouches and listens. No on-page tradeoff or cost tied to the trait. Mentioned but not dramatized; could be cut with no structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Graft" appears in the opening paragraph ("come to graft new roots into the scarred earth") as thematic intent but does not recur as literal action. The bird wing repair could metaphorically count as grafting, but the text uses "splinted" instead. The concept seeds the premise but does not drive a major turn or redefine options at closure. Setup present; middle and closure participation are metaphorical only. Replaceable with minor edits ("heal," "mend").</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The foreign coin drilled and strung on red thread is introduced early (second paragraph), handled twice (looped around the bird's leg, touched at closure), and charged with backstory (mother's relic). It enables the bird repair and anchors Lira's final reflection. However, the coin's mechanics are irrelevant—Lira lies about its protective power, and any object could serve the same plot function. Present across beats but swappable; the red thread and foreign symbols are noted but never constrain tactics or matter to outcome.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The obsidian lagoon is vividly rendered (black water, volcanic sand, skeletal kelp) and frames every scene. It provides the sand Lira examines and receives the final grain. However, the lagoon does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome—characters could stand anywhere reflective. Setup strong, middle presence as backdrop, closure participation as receiving vessel. Atmospheric anchor but not tactical agent.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Migration of clouds" appears in opening and middle ("clouds continued their migration") as backdrop; the bird vanishes "into the migrating clouds" at closure. No time pressure or ticking clock; the migration does not tighten decisions or alter tactics. The timeframe is poetic atmosphere, not a constraint. Present but ornamental; easily removable.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"To prove that scars can sing" is stated in the opening paragraph and directly reprised in dialogue ("Scars don't forget…they just learn to sing") and final reflection. The bird repair dramatizes one instance of healing. The motivation drives Lira's presence at the lagoon and frames her help, but it is not tested by friction—no competing want or cost. Setup clear, middle action aligned, closure thematic. Told more than conflicted.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Kelp-drift peace" is signaled in the title phrase ("skeletal remains of drowned kelp") and closing description ("lagoon lapped at the shore, its rhythm steady as a heartbeat"). Tone is contemplative and calm throughout, modulating slightly during the bird repair (urgency) but returning to stasis. The tone supports the scars-as-growth theme but does not shift decisively under pressure or charge the final image with new tension. Coherent but static; no tonal escalation or break that reweights stakes.</comment>
