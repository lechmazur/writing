<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Jorin's core motivation (awakening Veyra's vitality) is clear and consistent, but his interiority remains abstract and label-driven ("quiet fire," "deliberate nature"). The cavern ordeal—enduring shard strikes—is told in declarative summary ("He didn't flinch") rather than embodied through contradictory impulse or visceral cost. The final smile and village reaction feel asserted rather than earned by on-page change; we see no micro-choice that forecloses a path with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece anchors who/where/when adequately and moves in a causal chain (silk → mines → Lira → orb → renewal). Closure lands as a Decisive Change with visible result (orchards bloom, arches steady), but the cost is entirely physical suffering narrated in summary; no tactical trade-off or renunciation constrains future options on the page. The lens reads Causal with a light Situational accent (spectral keeper confronts intruder), held through closure. One meaningful tightening occurs when Jorin chooses the center tunnel and Lira materializes, raising the stakes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Floating arches, crystalline deposits, and the cavern of shards provide vivid anchors and a coherent fantasy world. The silk's azure glow recurs across beats and charges the final image. However, spatial choreography in the tunnels (three passages, center choice, wall dissolution) lacks concrete sensory grounding—distances, temperature shifts, and the mechanics of "walls dissolved" remain vague. The orchard's withering and the arches' trembling are described but do not constrain Jorin's tactics in the mine.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake (Veyra's decay) is signaled early and sustained. Jorin's descent and Lira's challenge constitute one meaningful tightening. The shard-strike ordeal raises intensity, but the resolution—orb absorbed, planet healed—arrives without visible trade-off; Jorin emerges physically marked yet unchanged in options or stance. Cost is bodily (blood drawn) but does not foreclose a path or alter later tactics, keeping escalation functional but not charged.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Theme of resilience-through-endurance emerges from Jorin's actions and the orb-fusion image. However, the line "Resilience isn't born from safety, but from enduring the unendurable" is an explicit thematic summary mid-climax, lowering subtlety. The bartered-awakening concept and "coax resilience from rubble" remain largely metaphorical labels rather than dramatized tensions. The ending offers a visual answer (blooming orchards) but no resonant, non-literal reconfiguration of prior material.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Narrative distance is consistent, and perceptual signature (Jorin's measured, quiet observation) holds across beats. Dialogue with Lira is functional and advances plot, though diction ("trespass," "binds the planet's soul") leans slightly formal. The prose modulates rhythm appropriately (shorter beats in the cavern), but lacks a strong idiosyncratic texture; sentence openings and syntax remain serviceable rather than distinctive.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Clarity and grammar are clean. Sentences vary in length and propulsion is adequate. However, the piece carries mild scaffold: "His forge sat beneath one such arch, its shadow stretching…" is decorative setup; "His hands were calloused, his voice rarely raised, but his resolve was a quiet fire" is label-stacked interiority. The climax beat ("The first shard struck… He didn't flinch… 'Resilience isn't born…'") narrates ordeal in summary rather than concrete action, reducing information density. No loops or severe artifacts, but figurative language ("like ancient ribcages," "essence of awakened magic") leans stock in early paragraphs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The orchard-planet premise and floating arches offer fresh visual detail. However, the core arc—humble craftsman ventures into forbidden place, meets spectral guardian, endures trial, gains magical artifact, restores land—follows a familiar hero's-journey template without transformation through lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The silk and mines are present but their mechanics feel generic (glow intensifies, orb fuses). Emotional specificity is limited; Jorin's internal experience remains abstracted, and the ending's blooming orchards resolve stakes tidily without ambiguity or fresh inflection.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Jorin is on-page throughout and makes key choices: packing tools, choosing the center tunnel, stepping into the shard field. His meek/quiet trait is mentioned but does not constrain actions with visible cost—he endures pain without flinching, which aligns with determination but does not create a dilemma. The final smile observes rather than decides; the restoration happens to him via orb absorption. Present in all three gates (setup, middle, ending) and drives two beats, but swappable with "determined farmer" or similar without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The silk appears early (bartered for a horseshoe), Jorin studies it, carries it into the mine, and it glows/absorbs shard strikes in the climax, then the orb settles into his palm (implied transfer). Spans setup, middle, and closure. Its azure glow recurs and intensifies under pressure, charging the final image. However, the silk's mechanics—how it "absorbs strikes" or "binds the planet's soul"—are told rather than shown through Jorin's handling. Visible across three beats with closure linkage, but the exact properties feel abstract; a glowing talisman of similar description could substitute with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Bartered awakening" is named early ("bartered by a wanderer for a horseshoe" and "The bartered awakening wasn't just about magic") and echoed at the end ("bartered awakening with his own quiet defiance"). It frames the premise thematically but does not constrain on-page choices or tactics—Jorin does not negotiate, trade stamina, or forfeit another resource in a dramatized exchange. The concept remains a thematic label rather than a mechanical stake that narrows options.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Quietly determined" and "deliberate" are asserted multiple times ("quiet fire," "deliberate nature," "moved deliberately," "his silence louder than words") but function as labels rather than constraining action. No on-page moment shows Jorin's quietness forcing a trade-off—he speaks when needed, endures pain without visible internal conflict between caution and boldness. The trait colors narration but does not enable or foreclose a choice with cost. Present across beats but ornamental; swappable with "steadfast" or "resolute."</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Deliberate" recurs as descriptor and Jorin's measured pace ("each step measured," "moved deliberately") defines his approach in the tunnels. The junction choice (center passage) is attributed to deliberation, and his decision to step into the shard field is framed as purposeful endurance. However, the action itself—being deliberate—does not create a unique mechanic; a cautious or brave character could make identical moves. Present in setup and middle, shapes one turn (tunnel choice), but the final restoration is passive (orb absorbed). Functional but not irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The abandoned mines are introduced early (whispers, half-buried entrance), Jorin descends and navigates branching tunnels, and the cavern of shards—sealed to contain Veyra's pain—is the climax arena. The method shapes two beats (descent, confrontation with Lira) and provides the spatial frame for closure. However, the mines' mechanics—how they "contain agony" or why Jorin's entry triggers awakening—are told by Lira rather than discovered through environmental interaction. Signaled, used, and closure-linked, but the means feel generic (ancient tunnels with spectral keeper); a temple or vault could substitute with modest edits.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Floating arches and orchards are visually distinct and anchor the opening and ending images (arches steady, orchards bloom). The arches cast shadows Jorin follows, and the orchard's decay motivates his quest. However, the setting does not constrain tactics—Jorin's mine descent and shard ordeal occur independently of orchard or arch mechanics. The environment provides vivid postcard detail and thematic frame but does not alter on-page choices. Present in setup and closure reprise with reweighted imagery (withering → blooming), eligible for mid-band but not causal driver.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Between understanding and confusion" is named once in the opening paragraph ("shifted between understanding and confusion") and never operationalized. No on-page moment dramatizes Jorin oscillating between clarity and bewilderment; his knowledge state progresses linearly (silk arrives → studies it → descends → Lira explains → ordeal → success). Time is not tracked or tightened; dawn descent and emergence time are unspecified. The phrase functions as a thematic flourish rather than a stake or pressure mechanic.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"To coax resilience from rubble" is stated early ("He needed the silk to coax resilience from the rubble") and echoed at the end ("coax resilience from rubble"). The cavern of floating shards—planet's fractured core—literalizes "rubble," and Jorin's ordeal (enduring strikes) dramatizes the attempt. The desire drives descent and confrontation, shaping two beats and closure participation. However, "coax" implies negotiation or gradual work; Jorin's actual tactic is endurance until the orb fuses, not a process of coaxing. The motivation is visible and pursued but the verb choice slightly mismatches the dramatized action.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Azure defiance" is partially embodied: the silk's azure glow intensifies under pressure and "turned to a fierce, defiant blue" during the shard ordeal, charging the climax. Defiance appears in Jorin's refusal to flinch and the closing phrase "quiet defiance." However, tone does not modulate—Jorin remains calm and measured throughout; no ironic contrast or tonal shift under stress. The azure recurs visually but "defiance" is asserted rather than felt in voice or rhythm. Present in setup and closure with one charged moment, but static mood and label-reliance trend mid-low.</comment>
