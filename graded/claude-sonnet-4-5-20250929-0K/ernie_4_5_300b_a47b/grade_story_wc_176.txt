<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is clear and embodied through scarred hands and his history of casting bells, but interiority leans heavily on retrospective summary rather than contradictory impulses acting in the present scene. The final moment with Lira materializing feels unmotivated—no prior dramatized cost or internal friction foreclosed a path to earn this reunion. "Technically gentle" appears twice as a label without constraining a choice. Emotional progression from grief to resolution lacks visible struggle; the rope simply works.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when clearly within the opening paragraph. The closure—Lira's appearance and the glowing names—reads as Decisive Change, but the cost is asserted rather than felt: Kael's "raw but steady" hands do not foreclose a live option or trade-off on the page. The drive lens is Causal with motivational ellipsis (years of casting bells → this ritual), but the final beat's mechanics (rope shudders, light coalesces, figure materializes) bypass protagonist agency; luck or artifact power resolves rather than Kael's choice under pressure. One meaningful tightening occurs when the rope begins to glow, but no persistent constraint shapes the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The icebound sanctum, aurora, and glacial stone are vividly anchored early and create coherent atmosphere. The ceremonial rope and punched card function as micro-setting elements that constrain Kael's task (braid alignment, precision weaving). Sensory detail—snowmelt, iron, fogged breath—is selective and purposeful. The mosaic of names etched in stone charges the final image by tying the rope's light to forgotten voices, lifting the setting beyond backdrop into thematic resonance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving his mother's voice—is signaled early and pursued through the rope ritual. Pressure tightens when the braids resist, then glow, but escalation is primarily mechanical (rope responding to card) rather than driven by Kael's agency or a trade-off that narrows options. The resolution (Lira's appearance, names glowing) is triggered by the rope's mechanism, not a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. No credible loss or omission alters tactics; Kael's hands tremble but complete the task without friction.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme—memory as "a braid of light and shadow," the sound of forgotten names—emerges organically from the rope ritual and the mosaic of names without overt moralizing. The punched card and rope reconfigure memory through specific, non-obvious means (threading pattern, perforations as melody). The final image (names burning brighter, a chorus of wind and chimes) offers resonant reconfiguration without stating a moral. However, the ending leans toward symbolic convenience: the rope simply works, and Lira's voice becomes "a chorus" without conceptual friction or ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with consistent psychic distance. Kael's perceptual signature—attention to texture, precision, and memory—is clear. "Technically gentle" repeats identically in two locations, a minor tic. Register occasionally drifts into elevated diction ("the void between stars," "dissolved into the wind like smoke") during high-pressure beats, slightly above a wax caster's working lexicon. Dialogue with Lira is minimal and on-task. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping. Purposeful compression in the final beat (light coalescing, aurora fracturing) maintains clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and syntax supports scene needs. Information density is high in the opening; the rope ritual slows slightly with scaffold ("The braids shifted, reweaving themselves") that restates what the prior sentence shows. "Technically gentle" appears twice identically, a paraphrase loop. Figurative language is dense in the opening ("serpent," "ghost of a melody," "breathing") but coherent. The final beat stacks metaphor ("chorus of wind and chimes," "song that refused to die") without muddle. No clarity loss at closure, but minor template cadence ("he'd come," "he'd found," "he'd studied," "he'd spent") in backstory paragraphs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of wax casting, punched card melody, and rope ritual is specific and non-obvious; the premise avoids stock ghost-story beats. Emotional truth (grief, the drive to recover erased names) grounds the fantastical mechanism. The transformation of sensory memory (lullaby) into light via braided rope is fresh. However, the resolution lacks friction: the rope works as hoped, and Lira appears without cost or surprise. Risk-taking (the ceremonial rope as memory device) heightens stakes but the closure effect is legible without ambiguity, trending toward a safe endpoint.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Kael's choices (unwrapping the rope, weaving threads, sliding the card) drive the middle beats and the final turn when the rope shudders and the light coalesces. Introduced in the opening paragraph. His agency is present across beats but the rope's mechanism does most of the causal work; he executes a procedure rather than making a trade-off that forecloses a path. Early signal, beat involvement (three distinct touches), but swappability is moderate—any skilled artisan could perform the ritual.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The punched card appears in beat one (market stall memory), beat two (traced perforations, ghost melody), and beat three (slid into rope core, triggering the glow). Its holes mirror the rope's braid pattern and encode the lullaby, making it causally essential to the ritual. Early signal, reweighted meaning (from trash to memory key), closure linkage (card triggers the light). However, the card's mechanics are told in summary ("slid...into a slot") rather than shown in tactile detail at the peak beat.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Transcribed memory" shapes the stakes (preserving Lira's voice) and the tactic (rope ritual mirrors punched card). The concept is signaled in the opening ("preserve the sound of forgotten names") and paid off when the rope's light "illuminates the memory encoded within." It alters Kael's options (bells failed, rope succeeds) and is present at closure (names burning, chorus of wind). Early signal, beat involvement, closure linkage. Cost is implied (raw hands, years of failure) but not sharply dramatized in the final beat.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Technically gentle" is mentioned twice identically ("his fingers, technically gentle despite their scars" and "his touch technically gentle, as if afraid to disturb the dead") but does not constrain or enable a choice with visible cost. It labels Kael's manner without altering tactics or creating friction. The trait is ornamental; a synonym (careful, precise) could replace it with no structural change. Late middle mention (second occurrence after 50%), no closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Illuminate" drives the climax: the rope's braids "began to glow," the "light pulsed," the "light spilled onto the floor, illuminating a mosaic of names," and "the names...burned brighter." The action is signaled early ("illuminate the memory"), recurs across three distinct beats, and charges the final image (light as memory made visible). It redefines Kael's tactic (from casting bells to weaving light) and is causally essential. Removing it would break the story's logic. Early signal, beat involvement, closure linkage, high irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The method is signaled explicitly in the manuscript line: "Reconfigure the threads to mirror the punched card's pattern, and the rope will illuminate the memory." Kael weaves the braids across two beats (threads yielding, braids snapping and reknitting) and the rope's mechanics trigger the climax (light coalesces, aurora fractures). Early signal, beat involvement (two distinct uses), closure participation (rope shudders, beam pierces ceiling). However, the mechanics are summarized ("slid the card into a slot...hidden beneath frost") rather than shown in tactile detail, reducing irreplaceability slightly.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The icebound sanctum is anchored early (opening line) and provides atmosphere (humming walls, ice creaking, aurora casting shadows). It pressures Kael's task slightly (frost on the rope's core, cold fogging his breath) and charges the final image (sanctum's ceiling pierced by light, ice responding). Early signal, closure participation (light pierces ceiling, aurora fractures). However, the setting does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters tactics; it functions primarily as backdrop. Lyric reprise (aurora green-gold veils → vortex) reweights the opening image with undeniable pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"After forgiving himself for the fire" is mentioned once in the opening and does not recur or constrain choices. The timeframe (post-forgiveness) sets a starting point but does not tighten decisions; no friction between past guilt and present action appears on the page. The phrase is ornamental; the story would function identically if Kael simply "left his workshop." No middle development, no closure participation, swappable.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The motivation "to preserve the sound of forgotten names" is dramatized through Kael's actions (tracing the card, weaving the rope, whispering "Lira") and conflicted with prior failure (years casting bells, voices "dissolved into the wind"). It shapes the dominant stake, drives two beats (card discovery, rope ritual), and is present at closure (Lira's voice as "chorus," names burning). Early signal, beat involvement, closure linkage. Cost is visible (raw hands, years of failure) though not sharply foregrounded in the final beat.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Snowmelt ardor" is reflected in diction ("snowmelt and iron," "aching" melody, "raw but steady" hands) and modulates from grief (mother's erased name) to tentative hope (rope glowing) to fulfillment (Lira's appearance). Tone coheres through turns and charges the final image (names burning, song refusing to die). However, the ending resolves cleanly without friction; ardor becomes satisfaction rather than bittersweet cost. Coherent but trends toward a single upward arc without tonal complexity at closure.</comment>
