<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Kael's motivation ("defeat the emotional numbness") is declared but never embodied through contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. The clone confrontation unfolds as external spectacle—energy surges, platform groaning—while interiority remains abstract ("emotions flaring to life like a dormant volcano"). The final choice to merge energies lacks prior causal grounding in character contradiction; we're told he's "whole and unbroken" without witnessing the cost of that integration on the page. Therapy-speak ("ego death," "emotional numbness") substitutes for embodied stakes throughout.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land by the second paragraph, satisfying the test. The closure unit—Kael merging energies with the brain, destroying the clone, and descending with the jar—reads as a Decisive Change, but the causal chain is murky: why does channeling "complementary opposites" into the jar destroy only the clone and leave Kael intact? The mechanics are asserted rather than dramatized, and the brain's role as "catalyst" is told without prior setup. The inferred lens is Causal, but the because/therefore linkage breaks at the climax, leaving the resolution feeling convenient rather than earned.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The floating rock dojo, vortex sky, and brain in a jar offer vivid anchors. However, spatial choreography becomes vague during the fight: where exactly are Kael and the clone positioned relative to each other and the jar? The "invisible paths" Kael descends on at the end contradict the established peril of the chasm below without teaching a new rule. The brain's blue light "intensifying" does minor atmospheric work but doesn't constrain a choice until the very end, when it suddenly becomes a merge-point without prior mechanical grounding.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—custody of the brain/existence—is signaled early but remains abstract. The clone's challenge ("You're obsolete") and Kael's energy-channeling response lack a visible trade-off or cost until the explosion. The "complementary opposites" method is invoked but not dramatized as a constraint that narrows options; Kael simply "presses harder" and wins. The ending declares victory ("whole and unbroken") without showing what Kael sacrificed or risked to achieve the merge, flattening the escalation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The theme of self versus shadow-self emerges through the clone confrontation, and the brain as "choice" offers a potentially resonant final image. However, the piece leans on prompt labels ("ego death," "pretense," "vivify") rather than letting theme arise from particulars. The clone's claim "I'm you" and Kael's rebuttal "you're what I could've been if I'd given in to fear" state the theme rather than dramatizing it through conflicting choices. The final murmur "You're not a duplicate, you're a choice" reads as a thematic echo that tells rather than shows.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. However, diction drifts into elevated register during peak beats: "channeling energy through complementary opposites," "catalyst," "fractals"—vocabulary that feels imposed rather than voice-motivated. Dialogue carries subtext in the clone's sneer ("primitive") but lacks naturalism; both voices converge in their articulation. The final paragraph's poetic compression ("not falling but *descending*") shifts tone abruptly without earning the lyricism through prior rhythmic patterning.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Pervasive scaffold and loops: "howling through the cracks," "liquid as history rewrote," "like sugar in tea" stack metaphors without coherence. Paraphrase loops abound: "The clone had rebelled, refusing to be erased" repeats the rebellion claim in adjacent clauses. Template cadence: "He'd survived... Now, he clung..." / "The clone mimicked... 'You think...'" runs across multiple beats. The explosion/dust-settling sequence is stock action-movie phrasing. Filter-verb stacks ("felt the numbness retreating") dull immediacy in the climax. Artifacts touch closure (the final "murmured" tag and poetic descent), triggering the −1.7 deduction and disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The clone-custody-battle premise is a recognizable template (doppelgänger confrontation + metaphysical stakes). The "complementary opposites" method and brain-in-a-jar object offer quirky details but aren't transformed through lived specificity—they function as set dressing. The emotional arc (numbness → wholeness) and the clone-as-fear twist are familiar genre moves executed without a non-obvious synthesis. The swirling vortex/floating dojo/history-rewriting timeframe stacks high-concept elements that remain ornamental rather than integrated into a singular vision.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Kael is labeled an ego death survivor in the opening, and the trait is invoked again at the climax ("he'd survived ego death once; he could survive this"), but it does not constrain or enable a specific on-page choice with visible cost. The trait is present and thematically consistent but functionally replaceable; setup and closure participation are met, but no middle beat causally depends on the ego death history.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The brain in a jar appears in three beats: introduced at the dojo center, flickers during the energy clash, and is cradled by Kael at the end. It is present across setup, middle, and closure, and the final line ("You're not a duplicate, you're a choice") reweights its meaning. However, Kael does not handle or use it until the very end; its causal role in the merge is asserted rather than dramatized, limiting the score to mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>The clone custody battle frames the confrontation and Kael's final possession of the brain reads as custody won, satisfying setup and closure. However, the "custody" stakes remain abstract—no legal, social, or tactical consequence of losing custody is dramatized. The concept shapes the premise but does not alter tactics mid-scene; it functions as thematic backdrop rather than driving on-page choices with cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"Slices through pretense" is declared twice: Kael "spent years slicing through pretense" and later "his mind slicing through the clone's pretense like a knife through butter." Both instances are metaphorical assertions without a concrete on-page action where the trait constrains or enables a choice. The attribute is ornamental, not causal.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Vivify" appears once in Kael's challenge ("let's see which of us can vivify this rock") and is immediately followed by him slamming his palm to channel energy, cracking the platform. The action is present in setup and loosely tied to the climax (energy channeling continues), but the vivification itself is not causally essential—the merge and clone destruction could occur without that specific verb or its mechanical implication. Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Complementary opposites" is named in the text ("fire and ice, light and shadow") and invoked at the climax ("the complementary opposites tore at its seams"). The method appears in setup and closure, but its mechanics are never demonstrated—how does channeling opposites destroy the clone while sparing Kael? The method is present but not causally legible; we are told it works rather than shown how it constrains tactics.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The floating rock dojo is anchored early, the platform cracks under energy (middle), and stones rain into the abyss during the explosion (closure). The setting is present across all three gates and the cracking platform provides minor tactical pressure. However, the dojo does not meaningfully constrain Kael's choices—he could wage this energy battle on solid ground with minimal plot adjustment. Functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"History rewrites itself" is mentioned in the opening sky description and again at the end ("history settling into a new, uncertain shape"). The timeframe is atmospheric but does not tighten decisions or alter tactics—no on-page choice is forced by the rewriting clock. Present in setup and closure as lyric reprise, but purely ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Kael's motivation to defeat emotional numbness is declared in the opening and invoked at the climax ("the numbness retreating, his emotions flaring to life"). It frames the stakes and returns at closure ("alive in a way it hadn't been in years"), satisfying setup and payoff. However, the motivation is never dramatized as a friction—no on-page moment shows Kael choosing between numbness and feeling with visible cost. Told across beats but not enacted with causal pressure.</comment>
