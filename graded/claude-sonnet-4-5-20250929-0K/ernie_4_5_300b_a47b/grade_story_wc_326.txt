<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivations are present but remain largely abstract—he counts heartbeats and carries a porcelain shard as compulsions tied to an error, yet the interior tension between living/dead feels performed rather than embodied with contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The woman's presence is told through objects and exposition rather than dramatized friction that forces Elias into a choice with visible cost. Interiority leans toward label-speak ("rebellion against the machine's lie," "digital ghost") without the messy irrationality or hierarchy of values a true crisis would surface. The final smile and declaration feel like a pivot without the earned causality of prior struggle narrowing options.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors emerge slowly—"opal observatory under snow" and "Elias Voss" appear early, but the causal chain linking the death-certificate error, the woman's apartment artifacts, and the current defragmentation remains murky until late. The closure gesture ("I hear the future... it's mine") and the digital ghost as guide offer a Resonant Reconfiguration, but the cost is asserted rather than legible on the page; we don't see what Elias forecloses or pays. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural (ink patterns, heartbeat count, porcelain shard recurrence), yet the final image restates the premise without a decisive reweighting or cadence shift that makes the before/after felt. Orientation debt is mild but present; applying −0.3 here and capping Q3 at 7.0 per the test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The opal observatory, frost-laced windows, and snow establish atmospheric specificity, and the control panel with spilled ink serves as a micro-setting that Elias manipulates. Sensory detail is vivid ("gears grinding like old bones," "porcelain shard clinking like a metronome") but leans decorative; the environment does not materially constrain a choice or alter tactics. The ink patterns and the shard are handled on the page, yet their use reads symbolic rather than consequential—removing the observatory's materiality would not break the logic of Elias's internal arc. Spatial choreography is clear; no cap from orientation debt applies because the waiver threshold was not met in Q2.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Elias's struggle to reconcile the death-certificate error and claim agency—is signaled early but remains abstract throughout. Pressure does not escalate through causal tightening; instead, the story loops through description of the ink, the shard, and OBS-7's prompts without a reversal that narrows options or forces a trade-off. The final defragmentation is announced ("Defragmenting," he said) rather than dramatized as a choice with visible cost; we don't see what Elias risks or loses by letting the error linger. Coincidence does not resolve, but protagonist agency is dilute—Elias observes, traces, and declares without a decision that forecloses a live path on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Theme—wisdom fetched from failure, the digital ghost as compass—emerges from the ink patterns and the woman's "I'm not ready" refrain, avoiding overt thesis statements until the final exchange. The porcelain shard and heartbeat count recur with shifting associations (fragility, proof of life, rebellion), and the closing line ("it's messy. But it's mine") offers a non-literal answer to the stake. However, thematic resonance is weakened by abstraction: "digital ghost," "bridge," "compass" function as metaphors without concrete particulars that reweight prior material. The ending reiterates the premise rather than repricing it through a surprising image or realization rooted in scene work.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>POV remains stable in close third around Elias; no head-hopping. Distance is consistent, though the narration occasionally drifts into elevated register ("ephemeral patterns," "midnight solace") that feels imposed rather than voice-specific. OBS-7's dialogue carries distinct mechanical flatness, and Elias's interior idiom is consistent if slightly generic. Purposeful compression in lyric fragments ("A way to carry...") is acceptable, but filter verbs ("He'd seen," "He felt") stack without tonal necessity. The perceptual signature is present—Elias notices ink, heartbeat, shard—but the prose reads as consistent rather than character-particular under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and sensory detail is vivid, but several patterns weaken momentum: paraphrase loops ("The error wasn't a contradiction—it was a bridge" / "The digital ghost wasn't a curse. It was a compass") restate concepts without advancing pressure; template cadence runs ("He'd tried... He'd carried... He'd seen...") flatten propulsion across multiple beats. Figurative density is high ("ghost of starlight," "digital ghost," "shadow in the code," "whisper in the static") without pattern-teaching or payoff, risking metaphor muddle. Stock phrases like "tattoo," "lullaby," and "compass" appear in climactic moments. Information density is moderate; several beats could be condensed. Applying −0.8 for paraphrase loops and template runs; −0.4 for figurative density in peak beats; total −1.2 in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The premise—death-certificate error survivor defragmenting a digital ghost—offers surface novelty, but execution leans on familiar tech-metaphor tropes (ghost in the machine, defragmentation as healing) without a fresh angle grounded in specific lived detail or moral calculus. The ink patterns and porcelain shard are symbolic conveniences introduced to harvest thematic points rather than causal engines. Emotional arc (isolation → acceptance of messiness) follows a template path without contradictory impulses or a non-obvious synthesis. The observatory and AI dialogue evoke genre expectations without subversion or high-level execution. Transformation test: swapping names and setting would leave the emotional core unchanged.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elias's status as death-certificate error survivor is present throughout and frames his heartbeat compulsion, but his choices do not create key turns; he observes, traces ink, and declares rather than deciding under pressure. The attribute is setup and closure-adjacent (final smile, "I felt alive") but does not constrain middle action with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The porcelain shard appears in multiple beats (pocket, palm, dipped in ink, dragged across panel, warm in pocket at closure) and carries shifting associations (fragility, method, anchor). However, its use is largely symbolic; removing it would not break plot logic—Elias could interact with the ink directly. It does not constrain a choice with visible cost, and its "reweighted meaning" at closure is asserted rather than dramatized through causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The digital ghost is mentioned frequently as metaphor and theme (error in databases, shadow in code, OBS-7's monitoring) but does not change on-page tactics or narrow options. Elias's defragmentation gesture is announced, not dramatized as a choice with stakes. The concept shapes atmosphere and interiority but remains abstract; it does not drive a turn that alters consequences.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The heartbeat-counting compulsion is signaled early, recurs across beats, and bookends the story ("counted heartbeats," "counted his heartbeat again"). It functions as thematic proof-of-life and anchors Elias's interiority, but it does not constrain an on-page action with visible cost—Elias could proceed without the count. The trait is setup and closure-present but not causally active in middle pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"Defragment" appears as Elias's stated goal, OBS-7's repeated prompt, and his final declaration, but the action itself is not dramatized with mechanics or consequence—he traces ink and announces "Defragmenting" without a visible change in system state or cost paid. The major turn (acceptance of the digital ghost as guide) is internal and told; defragmentation could be swapped for "reconcile" or "resolve" with minor edits. Missing middle development as causal beat.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Spilled ink on the control panel is introduced early, Elias dips the shard and drags it across the panel in the middle act, and the ink patterns "glowed faintly, as if alive" at closure. The method is signaled and its mechanics—pooling, swirling, fracturing into constellations—are described, but the patterns do not enable or constrain a choice with visible cost; they remain decorative. The ephemeral quality is asserted but not leveraged to shape attempts or escalate pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The opal observatory under snow is anchored early and recurs (dome whirring, gears grinding, frost-laced windows, lights dimming). It supplies the control panel with ink, the AI OBS-7, and the atmospheric "midnight solace," but does not pressure Elias's choices or alter tactics—he could conduct the same internal arc elsewhere. The setting is vivid and stable but functions as backdrop rather than causal agent. Present across setup, middle, and closure; micro-setting (control panel, shard) shapes one key moment (ink tracing) but not with irreplaceable consequence.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"After the radio static cleared" appears in the opening paragraph as a temporal anchor, but the timeframe does not tighten decisions or track elapsed pressure—Elias's actions unfold in a vague, untimed sequence. The clearing static is mentioned again at closure ("The radio static is clearing") but functions as metaphor rather than a live clock that alters moves. Missing middle development and causal pressure; the phrase is ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The motivation "to fetch wisdom from failure" is stated explicitly ("Elias had come here to fetch wisdom...") and echoed at closure ("fetch wisdom from failure, not by erasing it, but by letting it linger"). It frames Elias's interior stance and is present in setup and ending, but the desire is not dramatized through conflicted choices with visible cost—Elias does not face a moment where fetching wisdom competes with another want or fear. The motivation is told and thematically coherent but not tested under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Midnight solace" is not named on the page but the tone—quiet, contemplative, tinged with melancholy and defiant warmth—is coherent throughout and modulates subtly (from trembling uncertainty to final smile). Diction ("frost-laced," "whirring dome," "lingering ghost," "messy future") sustains the atmosphere, and the closing image (Elias smiling into snow, feeling alive) charges the tone with acceptance. The tone does not shift dramatically under pressure, trending toward a single sustained mood, but it supports the Resonant Reconfiguration at closure without breaking.</comment>
