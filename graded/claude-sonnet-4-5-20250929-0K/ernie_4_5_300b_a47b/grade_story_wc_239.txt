<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The Witness remains an abstract cipher throughout, defined by cosmic labels rather than embodied contradiction. Interiority consists of philosophical summary ("understanding that truth was not a destination") without concrete micro-choices under pressure. The "journey inward while walking out" is told rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. No visible cost forecloses a path; the protagonist achieves peace without struggle or trade-off.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The piece lacks a legible closure unit with felt cost. The Witness moves from seeking truth to "profound peace" via vision rather than causal linkage or stakes-driven choice. Orientation debt is heavy: who, where, and when remain vague past 120 words (the Witness is a title, not a name; the temple's relationship to any world is unclear). The ending declares understanding achieved but offers no on-page reversal, renunciation, or price paid. Drive lens is ambiguous—neither causal progression nor accumulative density creates meaningful tightening.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The library setting offers vivid sensory detail (aged paper, candlelight, shifting shelves) but remains a backdrop rather than a constraint. The dictionary is handled twice (pressed against mural, later open on pedestal) but does not limit tactical choices. Spatial choreography is coherent within the single location, and the "resounding hush" recurs, but no environmental element forces a decision or charges the final image with cost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—unraveling cosmic illusions—is declared but never tested by opposing pressure. No reversal narrows options; the Witness wanders, sees a vision, and emerges enlightened without sacrifice. The mural figures speak in riddles that do not complicate the goal. Agency is observation, not decision; the protagonist's "understanding" costs nothing on the page and alters no tactic.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Theme is overtly stated ("truth was not a destination but a continuous process of unification") rather than earned through particulars. The dictionary's shifting definitions and the mural's awakening gesture toward cosmic paradox, but no specific event dramatizes the clash between illusion and truth. The final image—dictionary pages blank, Witness stepping into the unknown—offers a quiet conceptual reprise, but the cost remains abstract.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Diction drifts into elevated cosmic register ("spiral arbitration," "singularity where all opposing forces converged") that fits the premise but lacks perceptual signature or character-specific texture. The Witness narrates philosophical insight rather than revealing a distinct way of noticing under pressure. The mural figures' riddles are the only dialogue; they feel functional rather than goal-driven.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "resounding hush" appears four times; "cosmic illusions" and variants recur without pressure shift. Template cadence in exposition ("The Witness's motivation was clear," "The softcover dictionary was more than a book") stalls momentum. Figurative language in peak beats ("star-strewn expanse where thoughts drifted like clouds") blurs concrete action. Sentence openings vary, but density is low—many lines restate theme without advancing situation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>The premise—mystical librarian seeks cosmic truth via paradoxical method—follows a familiar template (seeker archetype, ancient repository, internal/external journey mirror). The dictionary's shifting definitions and the mural's animation gesture toward specificity, but the emotional arc (confusion → enlightenment) is generic. No turn feels inevitable in hindsight; the protagonist's peace is granted rather than earned through lived friction.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>The "End of History Witness" character is present throughout and frames the journey, but makes no key decision. Observation and vision replace choice; the protagonist achieves peace without foreclosing a path. Late setup (title given in opening, but agency only claimed, not tested). Ornamental use: the title labels rather than constrains.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The softcover dictionary appears in three beats: carried under arm, pressed against mural (triggering vision), then open on pedestal with blank pages. It enables one turn (mural awakening) and recurs with reweighted meaning (blank pages signal new potential), but does not constrain a choice with cost. Swappable with any symbolic book. Lyric reprise without causal pressure places it mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>1.7</grade><comment>"Spiral arbitration" is named twice but never shapes stakes or tactics. The Witness defines it ("the process of resolving disputes") and later declares it "a reflection of their own inner conflicts," but no on-page dispute is arbitrated, no spiral pattern governs action. Label-only mention; easily removed without altering the plot.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Wanderingly exact" describes the dictionary's definitions once ("never static but always evolving") without constraining action. The attribute is asserted, not demonstrated through a visible tradeoff. No cost tied to the trait; it exists as thematic decoration.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Unify" / "unification" appears three times as theme claim ("deliberate act of unification," "continuous process of unification") but does not drive a major turn. The Witness merges internal and external landscapes via vision, but the action is summarized, not causal. Swappable with "integrate" or "reconcile" without structural impact.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"Journeying inward while walking out" is stated as method in the opening third and referenced once more ("the journey inward was not about escaping reality"). It frames the protagonist's approach but does not shape attempts or constrain tactics. The vision sequence illustrates the concept, but mechanics remain abstract. Functional mention, limited beat involvement.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The ancient temple library is established early, recurs across beats (corridors, chambers, pedestal), and supplies the mural that triggers the protagonist's vision. Spatial detail (shelves, stairs, mirrors) is vivid, and the Witness walks out at closure. However, the environment does not pressure a choice; it enables exploration without cost. Two-gate presence (setup, closure), one beat involvement (mural), no causal constraint.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>1.2</grade><comment>"Across a universe's hiccup" is mentioned in the opening and closing brackets but does not tighten decisions. The "brief, inexplicable shift in reality" summons the Witness and bookends the tale, yet no ticking clock alters tactics. Ornamental framing device.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"To unravel cosmic illusions" is stated as motivation in the opening third and reiterated at closure ("had unraveled the cosmic illusion"). The desire drives the journey, but no friction tests commitment—no cost, no conflicting want. Told rather than dramatized through choice under pressure. Functional but replaceable with any mystical goal.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Resounding hush" recurs four times (opening, mural chamber, twice near closure) and modulates from oppressive ("thick with scent") to companionable ("followed them"). Tone is coherent and purposeful, but the repetition becomes loop rather than escalation. It charges the final image lightly (reminder that mysteries are lived), yet the effect is decorative rather than indispensable. Mid-band integration.</comment>
