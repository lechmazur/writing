<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias's dominant motive (discovering the color of sound tied to Lila's death) is established early and drives the descent into the ship. Interior reflection is extensive but anchored to present stimuli (the key tag, the books). The climactic moment—placing the key tag on the desk and whispering "I see you now"—lacks embodied contradiction or visible cost; the renunciation reads as therapeutic epiphany rather than a choice that forecloses a live option. Emotional progression tilts toward label-only insight ("the vow he'd kept locked away had always been luminous") without sufficient on-page struggle at the peak beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first paragraph. The piece teaches a pattern of lyric imagery and reflective deepening that culminates in the library discovery. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant: Elias accepts his grief and no longer fears the dark), but the cost is conceptual rather than viscerally felt on the page—he places the key tag down and walks away, yet no live option is visibly foreclosed. The water parting "like a cathedral" and his steady flame at the end supply resonance, but the decisive shift lacks the sharp before/after that would elevate the closure effect.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Sensory detail is vivid and layered (salt-bitten wind, groaning planks, brine and decay inside the ship). The sunken library as micro-setting constrains Elias's approach and charges the final image; the pristine shelves and etched desk phrase anchor the thematic turn. Spatial choreography is clear across the dock, the water, and the ship's interior. The sky lanterns frame the timeframe and provide atmospheric contrast but do not directly alter tactics, keeping the setting contribution solidly mid-high rather than indispensable.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (discovering the color of sound to process Lila's death) is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates through the physical descent and the library discovery; the humming book and swirling light deepen the thematic question. Agency at closure is limited: Elias places the key tag and whispers insight, but the act is acceptance rather than a choice that narrows tactical options or exacts visible cost. The water parting and lanterns winking out supply atmospheric closure but do not constitute a turn driven by protagonist decision under the inferred lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme (grief as luminous vow, sound as memory's color) emerges through concrete images: the key tag, the library desk inscription, the humming book's color-shifting light. The final image—Elias lighting his lantern and walking home with "the color of sound humming in his veins"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without overt moralizing. The piece resists tidy resolution by leaving the vow's content ambiguous, yet the phrase "he'd just needed the right key to open it" edges toward stated moral. Subtext in gesture (placing the key tag, the water parting) supports thematic weight without full transformation of prior stakes.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable; psychic distance shifts purposefully between action and reflection. Perceptual signature is consistent (Elias notices light, sound textures, and the physical traces of loss). Diction in peak beats occasionally tilts toward elevated register ("luminous vows made flesh," "symphony of silence") that, while voice-motivated for a reflective lamplighter, risks distancing the reader from embodied immediacy under stress. No head-hopping; filter verbs ("He understood now") are present but not excessive. Prose rhythm supports the accumulative design, though sentence stems in the library sequence show minor repetition ("He reached," "He pulled," "He lit").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout: "groaned like old bones," "meteor hush," "grotesque smiles," "oil-shimmer leather," "cerulean for joy, crimson for grief." In the climactic library beat, metaphor stacks without clear propulsion—"swirl of light," "luminous vow made flesh," "language of the heart, written in hues"—creating mild overwriting that slows momentum. Two paraphrase loops: "the color of sound" recurs without added nuance across paragraphs, and "he'd always hidden behind truth" / "afraid to admit what he'd lost" restate the same internal block. Sentence openings vary, and grammar is clean. Information density is moderate; the closure paragraph compresses insight efficiently, but earlier beats carry descriptive weight that does not always advance pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The sunken-library-as-emotional-repository premise is familiar (secret archive holding the key to grief). Elias's occupation (lamplighter) and the sky lantern release frame provide specific texture, and "the color of sound" as a metaphor for memory offers a fresh inflection. The key tag's hotel origin and the number "13" recurrence feel purposeful. However, the emotional arc—bereaved spouse seeks symbolic closure in a magical space—follows a well-worn template, and the resolution (epiphany plus acceptance) does not transform the trope through non-obvious moral calculus or lived detail that would make it indispensable. The piece commits to its premise but plays safely within established parameters.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elias (late-shift pier lamplighter) is present throughout and his occupation motivates the nightly walks and familiarity with the dock. His choices drive two beats: deciding to enter the ship during the lantern release and placing the key tag on the desk at closure. The role itself (lighting lamps) does not constrain tactics or create a trade-off; he could be any bereaved spouse without structural loss. Setup clear, middle choice minimal, payoff present but weak causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The hotel skeleton key tag appears in three beats: carried in his pocket early with backstory anchor (first meeting Lila), fits the door marked "13" inside the ship, and is placed on the desk at closure with charged meaning. The object's brass tarnish and number "13" are specific; its hotel origin ties to the relationship origin. Removing it would require a different unlock mechanism and weaken the closure gesture. Setup strong, middle functional (unlocks door), payoff solid (charged reprise). Causal role present but not indispensable—another keyed object could substitute with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Luminous vows" is named early ("latched onto his ribs like a second heartbeat") and recurs in the library when the light "coalesces into a swirl of light—a luminous vow made flesh." It frames the thematic question but does not constrain an on-page choice or alter tactics; the concept remains metaphorical decoration rather than a stake that narrows options. Setup present as theme label, no middle pressure, payoff ornamental. Swappable with "unspoken promises" or similar.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Hides behind truth" is stated once: "He'd always hidden behind truth, telling himself his nightly walks were merely to check the lamps, not to chase ghosts." The trait is labeled but not dramatized through contradictory impulses acting in scene; no on-page moment where truthfulness creates a visible trade-off or enables a tactic. Setup as label only, no middle or closure development. Easily removed without structural impact.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Signify" appears at closure: "here, in the meteor hush of the sunken library, he could finally signify his grief, his love, his hope." The word names the resolution but does not drive a turn—Elias's act of placing the key tag and lighting his lantern could be described without "signify" and retain the same effect. Setup absent, middle absent, payoff present as thematic label. Functional but replaceable with "acknowledge," "honor," or similar verbs.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Wandering purposefully" is signaled early ("wandered purposefully along the docks") and echoed inside the ship ("He wandered purposefully, his boots squelching"). The method characterizes Elias's approach (not aimless, not rushed) and supports the accumulative pacing. It does not constrain a tactical choice or create friction; the manner could be swapped for "walking steadily" without loss. Setup clear as diction, middle repeated, payoff absent. Lyric reprise without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The "forgotten library inside a sunken ship" is rumored early, becomes the goal, and supplies the climactic setting where Elias finds the desk inscription and humming book. The pristine, water-immune interior defies logic but establishes a magical space that enables the thematic discovery. The setting's specific properties (untouched by water, dome ceiling, etched desk) constrain the scene's choreography and charge the closure image. Removing it would collapse the plot. Setup strong, middle essential (discovery site), payoff decisive. High irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"During a sky lantern release" is signaled early and mentioned at closure ("the last lanterns winked out"). The timeframe provides atmospheric framing and tonal contrast (light above, darkness below) but does not tighten decisions—Elias's descent and library exploration are not time-pressured by the lantern event. Setup present, middle absent, payoff ornamental. Swappable with any single-night event.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"To discover the color of sound" is established early as Elias's quest, tied to Lila's vivid last words. The library delivers a literal answer (the humming book emits color-shifting light), which satisfies the stated desire. The motivation drives his descent and frames the closure insight. However, the goal is more thematic riddle than lived friction—no on-page moment where pursuing it costs him another option. Setup strong, middle shapes scene, payoff resolves the riddle. Causal role solid but the discovery feels granted rather than earned through sacrifice.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Meteor hush" is named early ("a silence so thick it seemed to hum") and recurs at closure ("in the meteor hush of the sunken library"). The tone—hushed, charged stillness—is maintained throughout; pressure modulates via sensory intensity (groaning planks, brine, humming books) without breaking the contemplative register. The phrase is specific and charges the final image by echoing the opening. Tone coherence strong, modulation present, final reprise effective. Removing the exact phrase would weaken lyric unity but the tonal effect could survive with a synonym.</comment>
