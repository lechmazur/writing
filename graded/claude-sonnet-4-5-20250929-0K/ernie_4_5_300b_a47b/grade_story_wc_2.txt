<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias is motivated by obsession with the compass and driven by a desire to impose order, then discovers acceptance of uncertainty. The arc from "fixing clocks, imposing order" to "let the gears turn freely" is present but feels more stated than earned through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final workshop choice (planting clockwork flowers) arrives abruptly without prior struggle between control and release that would make the shift inevitable. Interiority leans toward summary ("He'd expected answers") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (Elias, cave, pocket watch) land within the opening paragraph. The compass quest provides a throughline, and the fall/retrieval sequence offers a physical reversal, but the closure pivot—from seeking answers to embracing questions—relies heavily on reflection rather than a final on-page choice with visible cost. The workshop scene plants seeds but doesn't dramatize what Elias sacrifices or forecloses by shifting stance. Lens reads Causal-Hybrid but wobbles toward thematic summary at the end, weakening the cost-proof test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The subterranean waterfall, greenhouse debris, and moss-slick cave supply vivid sensory grounding. The compass's barnacled edges and the oak's uprooted hatch anchor discovery beats with tactile detail. The workshop return and clockwork-flower plan feel less spatially embodied; the final image of winding a cuckoo clock doesn't leverage the environment to constrain or charge the choice as strongly as the waterfall plunge did earlier.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding the compass to gain truth/certainty—is signaled early and tested in the fall sequence. Pressure tightens when Elias digs and tumbles, but the compass's spinning needle deflates urgency rather than escalating it; the protagonist laughs and interprets rather than faces a trade-off. The workshop return plants new action (clockwork garden) but the story doesn't dramatize what live option Elias forecloses or what cost he pays on the page for embracing uncertainty.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme of control vs. uncertainty emerges through the compass-as-mirror motif and the recurring "uncertainly certain" phrase. The subterranean waterfall as motion beneath failure is a strong particular, and "let the leaves swirl" ties the greenhouse to the thematic question. However, the final journal entry ("To befriend uncertainty in planning, is to let the leaves swirl") edges toward explicit thesis statement, and the clockwork-flower idea feels more symbolic gesture than earned answer rooted in prior struggle.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited focalization remains stable; Elias's perceptual signature (clock-tinkerer lens, precise tool inventory) is consistent. Diction is controlled with occasional poetic compression ("Swirling leaves danced...sharp as knives") that fits the reflective mode. Some filter verbs ("he saw it now," "he realized") soften immediacy at peak beats, and the phrase "Uncertainly certain, he'd packed his tools" reads as narration imposing theme rather than organic thought under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and sensory detail is concrete. Minor scaffold: "He'd come here to escape...But today, he needed more" and "He'd expected answers, but the compass offered only questions" are near-paraphrases. The phrase "Uncertainly certain" recurs three times as a thematic anchor but risks becoming a token label. The workshop paragraph compresses transit efficiently, and the final image ("Let it chime. Let it falter. Let it be.") lands with rhythmic control, though some lines lean toward elevated register ("ghost of fertilizer and neglect") that wobbles against Elias's voice.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The broken-clock tinkerer discovering a compass that "points to truth" offers a fresh synthesis, and the spinning needle that refuses direction is a memorable inversion. The subterranean-waterfall/greenhouse vertical architecture is specific. However, the core arc (obsessive seeker learns to embrace uncertainty) follows a familiar self-help template, and the clockwork-flower garden idea arrives late without groundwork, reading more as symbolic flourish than inevitable outcome. The "beneath the ashes" literal-then-metaphorical realization is clever but not deeply transformed.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias drives beats: interprets the journal, follows the copper map, digs in the greenhouse, survives the fall, repairs the compass, journals insights, and plants the garden. His choices (packing tools, climbing the staircase, soldering the compass) create forward motion and the final workshop action demonstrates his shift. However, the key closure turn—deciding to plant clockwork flowers—arrives without prior on-page friction between control and release that would make this decision a costly, stakes-altering choice. Setup early, beat involvement across multiple scenes, but limited causal pressure at closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The compass is set up in paragraph one, sought through the cave and greenhouse, handled when Elias digs it from the pool, roughly repaired with copper wire in the workshop, and placed on the workbench where its spinning needle charges the realization. It appears in at least four distinct beats and its spinning state (refusing to point north) directly enables the thematic pivot. Strong closure linkage and specificity (barnacles, cracked gear, soldered repair), though the final workshop placement feels slightly static rather than dynamically reweighted.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The phrase "beneath the ashes" appears in the admiral's journal quote and Elias interprets it literally (digging rubble) then metaphorically (failed plans, crumbling doubt). The realization that ashes are "remnants of failed plans" shifts his search tactics, and the final workshop memory ("beneath the ashes of failure, there was always motion") ties the concept to closure. The concept shapes interpretation and Elias's late acceptance, but it doesn't constrain a live on-page choice with immediate cost—more thematic echo than tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The attribute "uncertainly certain" is named three times: once when Elias packs tools, again after the waterfall laugh, and implicitly in the journal note. It functions as thematic label rather than dramatized trait that constrains action. The story tells us Elias embodies this paradox but doesn't show him making an on-page choice where uncertainty and certainty pull against each other with visible consequence. Ornamental recurrence without causal teeth.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Elias improvises when the ground gives way (he falls and grabs the compass), and he improvises the compass repair ("soldering a cracked gear with copper wire. It wasn't perfect"). The journal line "To improvise is to trust the current" explicitly ties the action to theme. Setup in the cave ("Improvise, he told himself"), development in the fall/repair, and thematic payoff in the journal. However, the improvisation beats are reactive survival rather than proactive tactical choices that redefine the conflict's options—functional but somewhat interchangeable with "adapt" or "persist."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The greenhouse appears in paragraph four; Elias climbs the spiral staircase, sweeps debris, and finds the compass outline beneath soil. The "swirling leaves danced in the draft" offers vivid imagery that echoes the journal's "let the leaves swirl." Setup and one beat of use (digging triggers the fall), plus thematic reprise at the end. However, the greenhouse mechanics (ivy, cracked panes, terracotta pots) don't meaningfully constrain Elias's approach; any neglected structure could serve the same function. The leaves motif elevates it slightly but the method itself is replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The waterfall roars throughout, its mist blurs Elias's spectacles in the cave, and he plunges into its pool where the current drags him under—forcing the physical struggle that yields the compass. The waterfall's spray and mossy rock anchor the retrieval beat, and its "thrummed" memory in the workshop charges the final reflection. Strong sensory presence, beat involvement (cave work, fall/retrieval, memory), and the pool's current acts as physical pressure. Closure linkage via remembered motion. Nears essential but doesn't quite achieve irreplaceability since the compass could have been retrieved from another hazard.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The timeframe phrase "when coincidence becomes pattern" is thought once in paragraph three when Elias grinds his teeth after the storm uproots the oak and reveals the hatch. The moment signals causality (map converging at waterfall), but the timeframe itself doesn't tighten decisions or create a deadline. Elias reflects on three days prior, but no live clock pressures his moves. The phrase is used as observation rather than constraint—functional nod without tactical bite.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Elias's desire "to befriend uncertainty" emerges explicitly in the workshop journal entry and is dramatized through his laughter at the spinning compass and his decision to let clocks "chime, falter, be." The motivation is seeded early (escape chaos, impose order) and tested in the fall (uncertainty of the current), then resolved in the clockwork-flower plan. However, the shift from control to acceptance happens largely in reflection rather than through on-page friction between competing wants with visible cost. Setup, thematic development, and closure mention, but limited dramatized conflict.</comment>
