<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to understand fractured timelines is established and her zen-potter profile is maintained through "mind like still water" and steady hands. However, the revelation that she planted the sunflowers decades ago arrives late and feels more like a narrative convenience than an earned recognition. The internal arc—from seeking understanding to recognizing her own past action—lacks sufficient contradictory impulses in scene; she moves through discovery smoothly without genuine struggle or cost that forecloses a path. The final choice to leave and set up her wheel elsewhere feels like continuation rather than transformation earned by on-page pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: visions and sensory intensifications accumulate toward a final reweighting. Orientation anchors (Mara, wasteland, abandoned oasis) arrive early. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Mara understands the oasis's nature and carries the lesson forward—but the cost remains abstract; the story does not show what she forfeits or what path she forecloses by leaving. The vision of her younger self planting sunflowers is a late reveal that reconfigures the premise, yet it bypasses on-page causal work: we never see her wrestle with this memory or make a choice that this knowledge alters. The ending "her work here was done" asserts completion without dramatizing a visible or felt price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The scorched wasteland, skeletal hives, and stagnant well create vivid, purposeful atmosphere filtered through Mara's zen-potter lens. The sunflowers at the oasis edge are specific and charged, anchoring the thematic and causal pivot. Spatial choreography is clean (well, sunflowers, edges of sand), and the lantern glass functions as micro-setting that constrains and enables action. Minor slip: "chimney smoke flattens against the horizon" as a dusk marker is evocative but slightly ornamental—no chimney is dramatized or integrated into the oasis's spatial logic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding why the oasis resists entropy—is signaled early and sustained. The lantern glass thrums and the vision arrives as a tightening moment, but these are largely passive revelations rather than protagonist choices that narrow options. Mara kneels, places the glass, traces sunlight, and receives insight; her agency is observational. The story lacks a second on-page reversal or a moment where Mara must trade one path for another with visible cost. The ending "her work here was done" implies resolution, but we do not see what she sacrificed or what competing desire she renounced.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme—care and kindness anchor timelines against decay—emerges organically from the phototropic sunflowers, the lantern glass, and Mara's past well-digging. The final image of Mara setting up her wheel at a new settlement offers a resonant, non-literal answer: to shape time, tend the light. The piece avoids overt moralizing, though "to shape time, one must first tend to the light within it" in the penultimate paragraph skirts explicit statement. The sunflowers' recurrence charges the ending without forced symbolism, and the fractured-timelines concept integrates thematically rather than mechanically.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Single-POV third-person limited holds stable throughout. Diction is controlled—"mind like still water," "breath steadied," "steps light"—reflecting Mara's zen discipline. Distance remains consistent; no head-hopping. Minor register drift: "phototropic to kindness" and "anchoring a sliver of the past" edge toward lyric abstraction that occasionally floats above Mara's immediate sensory frame. The prose modulates well under pressure (the thrumming, the vision), and perceptual signature (tracing sun patterns, noting how light skips stones) is character-specific.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Line-level clarity is generally strong, with vivid images ("skeleton of a rusted pump," "jagged shadows that danced like ghosts"). However, multiple passages loop or paraphrase: "The oasis wasn't resisting change; it was holding onto a memory" repeats the resistance/choice idea established earlier. "Phototropic to kindness" is asserted twice without dramatized proof. Template cadence appears in summary beats: "She'd come here... to help... That version of her had planted..." Figurative density is high ("horizon bled orange," "time bent like clay," "yellow petals a beacon") but remains legible. The ending paragraph summarizes rather than enacting: "her heart quiet" and "its glow a silent promise" tell closure instead of showing cost.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The synthesis—fractured timelines + phototropic trait + zen-potter protagonist + wasteland oasis—is specific and purposeful, avoiding pure template. The phototropic-to-kindness mechanic is fresh, and the reveal that Mara planted the sunflowers decades ago offers a satisfying structural loop. However, the core emotional arc (seeker receives vision, departs with lesson) is familiar, and the story does not take bold structural or moral risks. The wasteland-and-memory premise echoes post-apocalyptic tropes without a sharp, non-obvious inflection that makes the outcome feel inevitable rather than thematically convenient.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mara is present throughout and her zen discipline colors perception. She kneels, places the lantern glass, traces sun patterns, and walks east—all on-page actions. However, her choices are largely observational and accommodative; she does not face a dilemma where her potter identity or zen mindset constrains or enables a key turn. The ending decision to set up her wheel at the new settlement is continuation, not a pivot driven by internal conflict. The character is necessary but does not drive a major reversal through a difficult choice with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The lantern glass appears early (paragraph 1), is used in the central beat (placed among sunflowers, thrums, casts shadows), and reappears in the final paragraph ("rested beside her, its glow a silent promise"). Three beats with evolving use. The glass enables the vision and charges the ending image. However, its phototropic-to-kindness trait is asserted rather than demonstrated through on-page constraint or cost; Mara never faces a trade-off tied to the glass's presence or absence. Swappability is moderate: another resonant object could serve a similar role with edits.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Fractured timelines frame Mara's inquiry and the vision sequence dramatizes multiple timeline shards (oasis in prime, storm fracture, fortress future, vanished future). The concept shapes the vision's structure and the thematic lesson. However, it does not constrain on-page tactics or force a choice; Mara observes fractured moments but does not navigate or alter them. The concept functions as atmospheric premise and thematic lens rather than a stake-altering mechanic. Early signal and closure participation are present; causal pressure is low.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Phototropic to kindness" is asserted twice—once as the lantern glass's trait, again as the sunflowers' trait—but never tested through on-page action with cost. We are told the glass "glowed in her presence during a meditation" (backstory) and that it thrums among the sunflowers, but no scene shows Mara making a choice enabled or constrained by this trait. The attribute is label-only; removing it would require minimal rewording. No visible trade-off or price tied to phototropism appears on the page.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The thrumming is signaled early (the glass "thrummed"), intensifies at the central beat ("The sound grew, harmonizing... until the air itself seemed to ripple"), and triggers the vision that reframes the oasis. The action is specific and non-generic. However, it does not drive a protagonist decision with cost; it is a catalyst for revelation rather than an action Mara chooses and pays for. Present in three beats (placement, thrumming, vision), but the major turn—Mara's understanding—results from passive reception rather than active struggle.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Following sun patterns" is introduced in paragraph 5 ("her method: following sun patterns. She traced the arc of sunlight...") and leads to the discovery of the sunflowers. The method is signaled, executed on the page, and yields a key find. However, it is used once and does not recur or constrain later tactics. The sunflowers' discovery could have been achieved through other means (exploring the oasis edge, noticing color). The method shapes one beat but is not indispensable to multiple turns or the closure image.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The abandoned beekeeping oasis in a scorched wasteland is established immediately, supplies vivid sensory anchors (skeletal hives, barbed wire, stagnant well, black sand), and houses the sunflowers that become the causal and thematic pivot. The setting's dual nature—wasteland entropy versus oasis persistence—frames the central question and provides the specific resources (sunflowers, soil that "still cling[s] to life") that enable the vision. The oasis is present in setup, pressures Mara's inquiry, and charges the final understanding. The setting is essential and irreplaceable; the story's logic depends on this exact location.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"As chimney smoke flattens against the horizon" appears once in paragraph 5 as a dusk marker. It provides atmospheric color but does not tighten decisions or create a live clock. No chimney is dramatized; the phrase is ornamental. Time remains vague throughout (Mara arrives, kneels, traces, sees vision, walks, reaches settlement "by dawn"), and no urgency tied to elapsed time pressures her choices. The timeframe is mentioned but does not constrain tactics or escalate stakes.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Mara's motivation "to understand why some places resist change" is stated explicitly in paragraph 2 and drives her method (following sun patterns) and her use of the lantern glass. The motivation is present and legible but not dramatized through internal conflict or competing desires. We do not see Mara tempted to abandon the inquiry, nor does she pay a visible cost to pursue it. The understanding she gains does not foreclose another path on the page. The motivation is functional and shapes two beats (inquiry setup, vision payoff) but lacks friction or trade-off that would elevate it.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Sharp gentleness" coheres through Mara's zen discipline, the harsh wasteland contrasted with her "still water" mind, and diction choices like "calloused hands," "jagged shadows," and "steps light." The tone modulates under pressure (the thrumming intensifies, vision strikes, air splits) without losing the gentle observational frame. The final image—Mara spinning clay, "heart quiet," lantern glass glowing—charges the ending with restrained warmth. The tone is consistent and purposeful, but it does not undergo a decisive shift that reweights the closure; it remains stable rather than transforming with the protagonist's arc.</comment>
