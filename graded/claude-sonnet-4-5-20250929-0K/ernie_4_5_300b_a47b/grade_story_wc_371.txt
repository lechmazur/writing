<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias is established through his perceptual lens and "creeping normality" noticing, but his interior remains largely label-driven ("the sacred in the ordinary," "heuristically gentle") rather than embodied through contradictory impulses acting in scene. The courtyard work shows micro-choices, yet the woman's arrival and cryptic exchange feel more like a thematic stamp than genuine pressure testing his stance. The final shift—from fear to acceptance—lacks visible cost; he "softened" but no on-page choice forecloses a live path. The embodied detail (trembling hands, calloused palms) is present but doesn't offset the therapy-speak undertow at peak moments.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: images (bread, seed, saplings) layer toward a quiet resonance. Orientation anchors late—tea house interior arrives ~250 words in, courtyard geography remains vague—but the pattern is legible by closure. The ending offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis: Elias commits to tending), yet cost is asserted ("tenuous absolution," "process") rather than shown through a specific forfeited option or visible price. The bread's vanishing and seed substitution gesture at mystery but don't narrow tactics or change what Elias can do next. One meaningful deepening occurs (discovery to commitment), sufficient for length, but the cost proof test falters: no exact sentence makes the trade-off undeniable on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The tea house and courtyard supply atmospheric texture (moss-speckled floors, ivy, dark soil) and the planting action is concrete. However, spatial choreography drifts—where exactly the tea house sits relative to the courtyard, how the woman appears—and the setting functions more as backdrop than constraint. The seed and soil enable the gardening choice but don't limit it; Elias could plant anywhere. The palace foundations and "forgotten secrets" hum remains ornamental. Micro-setting allowance met (tea house interior), but no environment detail charges the final image or narrows options at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: find the sacred / resist creeping normality. One tightening: Elias moves from passive observation (bread) to active intervention (planting). The woman's validation crystallizes his stance, but this arrives via external confirmation rather than protagonist-driven escalation. No visible price paid—he gains a garden and a sense of purpose without foreclosing another path or risking social/physical cost. Agency is present (he plants daily), yet the stakes remain abstract; what does he lose if he stops? The ending deepens his commitment but doesn't test it under pressure or show a trade-off that alters later tactics.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Creeping normality" and "sacred in the ordinary" are repeated as labels rather than dramatized through image reweighting. The bread-to-seed substitution gestures at transformation, but its meaning is explicated ("understanding," "tenuous absolution") instead of left to resonate. The woman's dialogue—"The cracks. The places where light seeps through"—veers into Thematic Echo territory, restating the thesis in prompt-like language. The final paragraph moralizes: "The sacred wasn't hidden; it was waiting… for someone to notice." This direct statement replaces scene pressure and undercuts the accumulative work. Theme is coherent but over-articulated, preventing reflection beyond the immediate assertion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Elias; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present (noticing flickers, pale roses) and voice carries a distinct, slightly archaic register ("liminal space," "heuristically gentle"). However, diction drifts into elevated abstraction under pressure ("tenuous absolution," "fragile thread between past and present") where concreteness would sharpen. The woman's dialogue feels interchangeable with narration—both employ the same metaphoric register. No major filter-verb stacks, but "he realized," "he understood," "he smiled, understanding" cluster in key beats, dulling immediacy. Rhythmic control is adequate; no template cadence runs.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Clarity is generally maintained, but paraphrase loops appear: "creeping normality" is defined in the opening and then re-explained via Elias's quest. Several beats restate rather than advance: the bread paragraph ends with "thread he'd spent years trying to unravel," then the next beat opens with courtyard changes—ellipsis, but the bread's import is never leveraged. "Heuristically gentle" appears twice in identical phrasing without variation. Stock metaphors cluster: "green flames," "bleed into," "seeps through." The final paragraph's "ever the creeping normality noticer" recycles the opening label. Information density is moderate; some sentences do double work (hands trembling + planting), but others loop ("The sacred wasn't hidden; it was waiting"). No major syntax runs, but rhythm feels uniform across emotional peaks.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The core premise—urban gardener finds meaning in a hidden ruin—is familiar; the piece does not transform it through non-obvious stakes or a surprising cost structure. "Creeping normality" as a concept is fresh, but its application here (noticing slow change, then planting) feels generic. The bread from the vanished bakery promises mystery but resolves ornamentally (it vanishes, replaced by a seed, without causal consequence). The woman's arrival and gnomic wisdom echo mentor-figure tropes without surprise. The ending—"he had finally learned to see it"—is tidy and expected. Emotional honesty is present, but the arc (lost → found) follows a well-worn path. No bold risk; the piece chooses safety over synthesis.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elias as "creeping normality noticer" is established early (opening paragraph) and frames his perceptual lens throughout. His noticing informs his choice to visit the tea house and later to plant, but observation itself doesn't create key turns—the bread and woman's arrival do. He makes two on-page decisions (reach for bread / pause; plant seed), but the pausing has no downstream cost and the planting feels inevitable rather than a narrowing choice. Present across all three gates (setup, middle, ending), yet swappable for any sensitive observer without structural loss. Functional but replaceable; the noticing trait colors voice but doesn't constrain tactics.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The bread appears mid-story (~one-third in), recognized as impossible, and Elias pauses before touching it—this beat has potential but no follow-through cost. It vanishes off-page, replaced by a seed. Two beats (discovery, disappearance), but the object doesn't enable or constrain a later choice; the planting would proceed with or without it. The bread signals mystery and primes the sacred theme, yet its mechanics (why it's there, why it vanishes) remain ornamental. Setup present, middle touch (vanishing), closure absent (seed substitution is new, not a reweighted bread). Lyric reprise path not taken; the bread is mentioned once and gone. Meets two gates but lacks causal pressure or closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Tenuous absolution" is named once in narration ("not forgiveness, but the fragile hope") but never dramatized as a stake or choice. Elias seeks meaning, not absolution; the concept appears as a thematic gloss rather than shaping his tactics. He doesn't struggle with guilt or forgiveness on the page—his arc is discovery, not atonement. The absolution language charges the seed moment slightly (he "understood"), but this is told summary, not a felt reweighting of prior cost. Present in middle (seed moment), absent from setup and closure in functional terms. The concept could be swapped for "renewal" or "hope" with no structural change. Ornamental theme claim.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Heuristically gentle" is label-applied twice ("heuristically gentle, he always approached…"; "heuristically gentle, his hands steady") but never tested or traded off. His caution (pausing before touching bread) aligns with the trait, yet no on-page moment shows a cost—does gentleness slow him, prevent a bolder move, or shape the woman's response? The trait colors voice but doesn't narrow options. Setup present (early definition), middle echo (courtyard work), closure mention (final paragraph)—all three gates touched, but purely as descriptive label. No visible friction or tactical constraint. Functional label, not a lever.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Uncloak" is invoked once in narration ("to uncloak the hidden, to reveal the sacred") during the planting beat. The planting itself is concrete and drives the second half—he returns daily, the garden grows—but "uncloak" as a specific action (revealing, exposing) isn't distinct from "plant" or "tend." The verb appears as thematic decoration rather than a unique tactic. Major turn (passive to active) traces to planting, but uncloak-qua-uncloak doesn't redefine options; he could "cultivate" or "nurture" with identical effect. Setup absent, middle invocation, closure implicit (garden thriving). Swappable synonym for the core gardening action; mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Guerrilla gardening is named and explained mid-story ("a quiet rebellion against creeping normality") and becomes Elias's method: he plants in the abandoned courtyard, tends saplings daily, works without permission. The mechanics matter—soil quality noted, seeds planted, growth tracked—and the method shapes all his second-half beats. Setup ~40% in (late but paid off), middle dominance (planting, tending), closure present (garden thriving as evidence). The method is irreplaceable: remove guerrilla gardening and the ending's "life thrived" image collapses. However, the "guerrilla" aspect (covert, unsanctioned) isn't tested or constrained—no authority challenges him, so the rebellion is declared, not dramatized. Strong integration minus visible friction or cost tied to the method's risk.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The tea house and courtyard are introduced early (end of first paragraph) and anchor all middle action (bread discovery, planting). The setting supplies resources (soil, space) and atmosphere (moss, ivy, "humming walls"), but doesn't pressure choices—Elias can plant freely, no access constraint or rival claim tested. The courtyard's transformation (saplings, rose) reflects his work, not a setting-driven complication. Setup strong, middle sustained, closure implicit (garden as final image). The palace foundations and "forgotten secrets" remain vague. Micro-setting test met (tea house interior handled), but the setting enables rather than constrains. Essential for atmosphere and continuity; doesn't alter tactics under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"After the birds fly south" opens and closes the piece as a seasonal marker (autumn/winter onset) but never tightens decisions or tracks elapsed days. The timeframe colors tone (hush, skeletal city) yet imposes no deadline—Elias could visit weekly or daily with no stated cost. No clock shapes his choices; "one afternoon" the woman appears, timing arbitrary. Setup clear (opening line), middle absent (no time pressure), closure echo (final paragraph) without functional reweighting. The marker is atmospheric and signals change, but doesn't constrain tactics or escalate stakes. Ornamental lyric frame.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Elias's quest "to find the sacred in the ordinary" is established early, recalled mid-story, and resolved in the ending ("he had finally learned to see it"). His choices—visiting the tea house, pausing at the bread, planting—trace to this desire. However, the motivation is declared more than conflicted; no on-page moment shows him torn between sacred-seeking and a competing want (safety, reputation, ease). He's a "laughingstock" per backstory, but this social cost never surfaces in scene. Setup strong, middle sustained (planting as sacred work), closure affirmed. The want drives action but lacks friction or trade-off; he gains meaning without visible sacrifice. Solid causal role, minimal dramatized cost.</comment>
