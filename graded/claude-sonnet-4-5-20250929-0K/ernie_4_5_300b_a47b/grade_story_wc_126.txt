<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is clear and her acoustic sensitivity shapes perception, but her interior life relies heavily on abstract labels ("chronic hush," "unbinding") rather than embodied contradiction. The final choice to share the bowl feels more thematic gesture than earned renunciation with visible cost. Relationships exist (crowd, grandmother's memory) but apply no immediate pressure that forces a difficult trade-off. The piece avoids diagnostic therapy-speak but doesn't dramatize internal conflict acting simultaneously in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands on the page as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the bowl's transformation from holding silence to holding potential, crystallized through community participation, reweights prior material with felt pressure. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural; the pattern of sound-versus-silence deepens through density increase (music → bowl resonance → community offering → renewed music). Orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words. One meaningful tightening occurs when Lira realizes the bowl holds space rather than silence, shifting her understanding and altering the crowd's subsequent action. Cost is conceptual—the chronic grief acknowledged and transformed—but legible in the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The greenhouse, shipwrecks, and bonfire anchor the scene with vivid, purposeful detail. The bowl's copper surface and the violin's positioning over it create micro-setting that constrains Lira's technique and charges the closure. Spatial choreography is clear (greenhouse interior, bonfire outside, crowd movement). The post-burn atmosphere filters through Lira's acoustic perception, shaping what she notices. The greenhouse's acoustics—glass amplification, condensation drip—directly enable the music's transformation and thus constrain her method.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (transform grief through music) is signaled early and tightens once when Lira discovers the bowl holds space, not silence, narrowing her tactic from solo performance to communal ritual. Agency reads through decision (positioning violin over bowl) and attention (acoustic sensitivity guiding placement). The crowd's shift from silence-as-wall to silence-as-threshold supplies one meaningful deepening under the Accumulative lens. Escalation is modest; no live option is foreclosed with sharp cost. The final act (carrying the bowl outside, inviting offerings) reweights the stake but feels more ceremonial than decision-under-fire.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme (beauty in the unfinished, sound in silence) emerges organically from the bowl's discovery and the music's effect without stated morals. The final image—objects placed into the vibrating bowl, music weaving through offerings—offers a non-literal answer to the central question with resonance. Subtext operates in the crowd's hesitant murmuring and the bowl's warmth. The piece resists tidy resolution; the ending is a threshold, not closure of all grief. One minor slip: "magnificent simplicity of the moment" in the final paragraph edges toward thematic summary rather than letting the image speak.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Lira; perceptual signature is acoustic-biased and character-specific. Diction generally fits the contemplative register, though "chronic hush" and "unbinding" lean slightly elevated for the moment's immediacy. Dialogue is minimal (one line at the bonfire) but purposeful and advances plot. Psychic distance modulates appropriately (close during violin playing, slightly wider for crowd observation). Minor rhythm flattening in the opening paragraph ("the air hummed...a scent that clung...") where participle openers stack without variation. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose is mostly clear with purposeful sensory detail and good propulsion through the music sequence. Two artifacts lower the score: paraphrase loop in paragraph one ("scent...after the rainforest burned" immediately followed by "After the rainforest burned, the world had grown quieter") and template cadence in paragraph four ("She was acoustically perceptive, able to hear...This sensitivity had always made her restless, but now it guided her"). Stock metaphor "glass cathedral" and "pool in the hollows" lack freshness. Figurative density is controlled; no mixed metaphors. Information density is generally high, though the grandmother's tune "mend the cracks in the world" adds decorative folksy touch without prior grounding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The combination of post-apocalyptic setting, acoustic sensitivity, and communal ritual offers a fresh angle, and the bowl's acoustic function (amplifying through copper resonance) is specific. The emotional arc (individual grief → communal transformation) follows a familiar template but executes it with grounded detail (violin positioning, condensation acoustics). The "sunken orchard greenhouse ringed by shipwrecks" is memorable and particular. Risk-taking is moderate; the structure and resolution remain safely within lyric-accumulative conventions without bold formal choices. Transformation test: the core arc could transfer to other post-disaster settings with minor edits, suggesting mid-band originality.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lira makes two key decisions: positioning the violin over the bowl (enabling the resonance discovery) and carrying the bowl outside to invite offerings (shifting from solo to communal ritual). Both choices create turns under the Accumulative lens. Present by paragraph two, active in the middle discovery beat, and central to closure. Her observation of acoustic properties enables rather than merely describes. Swappability is low; removing "violinist" would break the music mechanism.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The bowl appears in beat one (mendicant's backstory), beat two (positioned under violin), beat three (vibrates and glows during playing), and beat four (carried outside, holds offerings). Its function evolves from metaphor ("hold the weight of silence") to acoustic amplifier to communal vessel. The realization "holding space for sound to expand" is the story's pivot. Causally essential to the resonance discovery and closure ritual. Irreplaceability is high; the copper curve and hollow are mechanically specific. Early setup, middle development, and closure payoff all present.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Chronic hush" frames the post-burn atmosphere and Lira's artistic challenge; it shapes her motivation (to "loosen the knot of grief") and the crowd's initial state. The concept shifts meaning at closure when silence becomes "a threshold" rather than "a wall," reweighting the stake. However, it operates more as thematic backdrop than a force that alters tactics on the page. The phrase appears three times (paragraphs 1, 3, 11) but remains somewhat abstract. Middle-band because it primes the transformation without mechanically constraining choices.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Lira's acoustic perception enables her to hear "the way the greenhouse's glass amplified the drip of condensation, the creak of shipwreck hulls" and guides her placement of the violin over the bowl. This trait constrains her method (she chooses the greenhouse for its acoustics) and enables the resonance discovery. Mentioned explicitly in paragraph four, then demonstrated in paragraphs 8–9. The trait is necessary for the plot mechanism but could be compressed to "musician's ear" with minor edits, limiting irreplaceability. Two beats (setup, application), present in closure indirectly through the amplified music.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Unbind" is named as Lira's artistic goal ("a way to loosen the knot of grief that tied the harbor's people") and the music functions as unbinding agent. The term recurs in the climax ("all of it was being transformed, unbound by the music"). However, the action itself—playing music—is generic; "unbind" serves more as thematic label than irreplaceable mechanism. The story would function with "transform" or "release" with minimal structural change. Middle-band for thematic presence and closure participation but high swappability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The bonfire tradition is introduced in paragraph five as annual ritual honoring the burned rainforest, provides spatial anchor (outside the greenhouse), and motivates the gathered crowd. At closure, the bonfire still burns and the crowd's offerings occur in its presence, linking communal memory to the new ritual. The tradition primes the crowd's readiness for collective action. However, storytelling itself does not shape tactics; the bonfire is atmospheric frame rather than active method. Two-of-three gates (setup, closure presence) but minimal middle development. Lyric reprise without causal pressure caps it at mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The greenhouse's arched windows, glass acoustics, condensation drip, and salt-crusted orchard trees provide the micro-environment that enables Lira's resonance discovery. The stone floor anchors the bowl placement. The greenhouse's amplification properties ("the note swelled, resonating in the bowl's hollow, amplifying") are mechanically essential to the plot turn. Shipwrecks appear in visual frame but apply less direct pressure. The greenhouse is signaled in the opening line, shapes the middle discovery beat, and remains the locus of closure. Irreplaceable; removing the acoustic properties breaks the mechanism. Three gates, high causal pressure, closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"After the rainforest burned" establishes the post-catastrophe context and motivates the annual bonfire tradition, but the timeframe does not tighten decisions or create urgency. The story unfolds in a single evening without a live clock. The burn is backstory that primes emotional weight but does not constrain present tactics. Setup gate is met (paragraph one), but middle development and closure participation are thematic rather than mechanical. Swappable with other disaster contexts (flood, plague) without structural change.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Lira's desire "to find beauty in the unfinished" is stated in paragraph three and demonstrated through her choice to play despite the "unfinished" grief of the harbor. The final image (music weaving through memory and hope, "beauty in the unfinished, sound in the silence") directly answers this motivation. However, the friction between want and cost is low; no competing desire or fear complicates her pursuit. The motivation is told more than dramatized through conflicted micro-choices. Three gates (early signal, shapes attempt, closure payoff) but lacks on-page friction, capping it in mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Tone balances lyric contemplation with concrete sensory detail (fogged windows, damp strings, tarnished copper) to achieve "magnificent simplicity." The register remains elevated but grounded through the music sequence. Tone modulates subtly: reflective in setup, focused during the violin playing, expansive at closure when the crowd participates. The phrase "magnificent simplicity" appears explicitly in the final paragraph, slightly undermining the tonal achievement by naming it. The tone charges the final image (objects placed into the warm, vibrating bowl) without fracturing under pressure. Coherent through turns, purposeful modulation, closure charge.</comment>
