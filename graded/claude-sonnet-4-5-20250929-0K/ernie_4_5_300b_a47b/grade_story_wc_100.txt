<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's interiority is visible and his stubbornness operates on the page—he resists Marisol's stories, scoffs at the task—but many beats tell us his evolution rather than dramatize it through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final choice to stay reads as declared rather than wrestled with in scene; we're told "his stubbornness softening into purpose" instead of watching the cost of that shift. Embodied emotion appears intermittently but key transitions lean on summary: "Years later, when explorers rediscovered the city..." compresses the arc's payoff. The weary-to-purposeful arc is legible but the decisive renunciation lacks visible on-page friction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Causal with accumulative shading. Orientation anchors arrive by ~word 40 (Elias, his doorstep, the crate). The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Elias finds "his permanent address" by staying), but cost is asserted in retrospect—"traded his shovel for a quill"—rather than shown in a decisive scene. The lens-activation beat is vivid, yet the climactic choice to remain is summarized across "Years later" without dramatizing the foreclosed option or the friction of letting go. Causality holds through the middle (dream → descent → lens repair) but the ending compresses the final turn into exposition, weakening closure legibility.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The underwater library is specific and charged: kelp forests, silt-buried dome, floating books with bioluminescent ink. Spatial choreography remains clear across the descent and interior moves, and the lens housing at the dome's apex anchors the climax. The library supplies both resource (salvaged parts) and pressure (fading magic sustains Marisol), elevating it beyond postcard. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered—"air tasted of brine and old paper"—and the final image of two figures with lantern and quill recharges the setting with thematic weight.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—reviving the city's distress signals—is signaled early and drives the middle repair sequence. Pressure tightens once: Elias resists, then commits after Marisol's appeal. The lens activation is a vivid turn, but the aftermath ("Ships above altered course") tells rather than tests consequences. The final choice to stay is summarized without showing what Elias gives up or wrestles with on the page. One meaningful tightening is present, but the cost at closure remains declared rather than dramatized, keeping the score mid-band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme—rest as beginning, belonging vs. permanence—emerges from Elias's arc and the lens-as-bridge motif. The goldfish memory and "occupy impossible spaces" thread through the narrative, and the final image reweights prior material without overt moralizing. Yet key insights are told: "rest wasn't an end. It was a beginning" states the theme rather than letting the image carry it. The lens's new message—"not just of survival, but of belonging"—edges toward explanation. Thematic coherence is strong, but the ending leans on articulation where silence would sharpen resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>POV remains stable in close third on Elias; perceptual signature is present—"his inadvertently stubborn nature flaring," "air tasted of brine"—and Marisol's dialogue carries distinct idiom ("You're late," "You occupy impossible spaces already"). Filter verbs ("He saw," "He'd buried") appear but fit the reflective cadence. The issue is rhythmic template: multiple paragraphs open with "Elias [verb]" or "The [noun]," creating a drumbeat that flattens sentence variety. Register holds, but syntactic monotony in the middle third dulls immediacy. Dialogue advances goals cleanly; voice is controlled but not exceptional under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Clarity is high and no major loops appear, but several patterns accumulate: "His hands, calloused and stained" front-loads modifiers; "each coffin a promise," "each volume a relic" repeats stem structure; "the lens's shard," "the lens's missing pieces," "the lens took shape" cycles the same noun anchor. The climactic paragraph ("The activation was a spectacle") tells the outcome rather than showing moment-by-moment sensory unfolding. Figurative density is controlled—no mixed metaphors—but the final third leans on summary ("Years later...") where scene would charge the closure. Information density is adequate but propulsion flags at key beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The underwater-library premise and undertaker-as-restorer synthesis show craft, and the lens-repair plot avoids pure template. Yet the arc—reluctant specialist persuaded to fix a magical object, stays to find purpose—follows a familiar structure without a sharp inflection. Marisol as centuries-old keeper and the coral-city imagery are vivid but not unfamiliar; the goldfish memory adds specificity but doesn't redefine the arc. The ending's "rest wasn't an end" epiphany is earnest but predictable. The piece demonstrates competence and warmth but lacks a non-obvious turn or a risk that heightens stakes in an unexpected direction.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Elias makes two key choices: booking passage (setup), committing to the repair after Marisol's appeal (development), and staying (closure). All three gates are met. The middle choice is pivotal—"You occupy impossible spaces already"—but the final decision is summarized across "Years later" without on-page friction. Causal pressure is present; the weary-undertaker trait shapes his resistance and eventual acceptance. Cost is implied (he trades his former life) but not dramatized in the closure scene, capping the score.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The lens appears in beat one (crate arrival), drives the descent and repair sequence (middle), and the activation/reinstallation anchors the climax. Three gates met. Its fractured state creates the stakes; welding it with gold leaf is specific and charged; the final beam "piercing the surface like a silver sword" reweights the opening distress-signal motif. Cost is tied to the repair labor and Elias's transformation. The lens is indispensable to plot and theme, though its closure presence is slightly diluted by summary framing ("Years later") rather than a direct final image.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Distress signals frame the premise (note in the crate), define the stakes (city's signals became noise), and the lens broadcasts them clearly at climax. Setup and payoff are strong; middle development is thematic (Marisol explains the signal failure) rather than tactical—Elias doesn't navigate failed signals or decode them on the page. The concept shapes the dominant stake and the ending image ("Here lies knowledge. Here lies hope."), but its mechanics remain exposition. Two-plus gates with causal linkage; mid-to-upper band, but not irreplaceable—another communication failure could substitute with edits.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Inadvertently stubborn" is named early and shown twice: Elias scoffs at resurrection, resists Marisol's tales ("History's dead"). Setup and development gates met. The trait constrains his initial refusal and enables the later "softening into purpose," but that shift is told in summary rather than dramatized with visible cost. Closure participation is weak—stubbornness isn't present in the final image. Functional constraint in the middle; replaceable with "reluctant" or "skeptical" without major loss. Mid-band: present across beats but not charged at the end.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Revitalization is the plot's spine: Elias descends to revive the city, repairs the lens, and the activation beam revives the signals. All three gates met. The action is specific—welding glass with molten resin, scavenging parts—and the climax depends on successful reinstallation. The piece ends with a thriving library, so revitalization succeeds on multiple scales (signals, city, Elias's purpose). Causal pressure is strong; cost (labor, Elias's life change) is present but somewhat softened by summary framing. Essential to structure and stakes; swapping for "repair" would weaken thematic charge but not break logic.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Occupy the impossible spaces" is seeded in the dream-voice and echoed by Marisol ("You occupy impossible spaces already"). Setup present; it's invoked at the decision beat. But the method itself—how one *occupies* an impossible space—is never dramatized or made concrete. Elias descends and repairs the lens, yet those acts don't enact the phrase's mechanics; it functions as motivational metaphor rather than a legible tactic. Closure doesn't hinge on it. Functional as theme but ornamental as method; the story could replace it with "embrace the forgotten" without structural loss. Mid-low band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The underwater library is specific, constrains the plot (entry half-buried, air pressurized, salvage required), and supplies resources (floating lens pieces, clocks, compasses). Setup, development, and payoff all met. The dome's apex houses the lens; the library's fading magic sustains Marisol and defines the stakes. The final image of two figures cataloging books charges the setting with earned permanence. Spatial details—kelp, silt, spiraling shelves—are filtered through Elias's perception. Irreplaceable: the setting's properties (underwater pressure, preserved relics, magical decay) drive tactics and theme. High integration.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The frame begins clearly—"that night, dreams dragged him"—and the story unfolds after package arrival as required. The descent, repair days, lens activation, and epilogue ("Years later") track forward. But time is loose: "For days, Elias worked" and "Years later" compress without tightening decisions. No live clock shapes tactics; the repair could take two days or ten without altering pressure. Setup and rough development met; payoff exists but diffuse. Time orients rather than constrains. Functional frame, mid-band ceiling due to lack of urgency tied to duration.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"To give rest a permanent address" is named in Marisol's climactic appeal and echoed in the epilogue: "Elias found his permanent address." Setup is late (past midpoint) but development and payoff are clear. The desire drives Elias's final choice to stay, and the lens's restoration literalizes it (signals find a home, Elias finds rest). Yet the motivation is more explained than conflicted—Elias resists, then accepts, without visible friction between wanting permanence and fearing stasis. Cost is implied (he abandons his undertaker life) but not dramatized. Two-plus gates; causal role at closure; swappable with "find belonging" without major loss. Upper-mid band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Tone aims for elegiac calm—"chased stillness"—and the prose maintains a measured, lyric cadence throughout. The underwater setting and Elias's reflective interiority support it. Tone modulates slightly (pressure during descent, warmth with Marisol, spectacle at activation) but never breaks into urgency or sharp discord. The final image of lantern and quill recharges the stillness with earned peace. Coherent across beats; charges the ending without overt statement. Yet the tone is somewhat static—gentle melancholy holds from start to finish without a sharp shift that reconfigures pressure. Upper-mid: present and purposeful, but not dynamic enough for high band.</comment>
