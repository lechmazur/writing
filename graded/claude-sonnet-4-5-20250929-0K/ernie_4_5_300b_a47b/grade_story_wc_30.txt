<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The librarian automaton's fluctuating identity is asserted but never dramatized through contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. The woman's transformation is told rather than embodied—"I'm… lighter" replaces concrete sensory experience. The child visitor at the end appears as a convenience echo rather than a character with distinct motives. Interior life remains abstract ("fear is a tide") without embodied contradiction or stakes-driven choices that foreclose paths with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Orientation debt: who, where, and when remain unclear past 120 words; "after tomorrow disappeared" is atmospheric but non-anchoring, and the atrium's physical reality never grounds. The woman's transformation sequence has no causal linkage—she plunges, then emerges changed without on-page agency or visible cost that narrows options. The child's arrival at the end is a soft reset that deflates rather than charges closure. No meaningful tightening or deepening occurs; the librarian's role remains static observation rather than driven choice.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The tidal atrium and bamboo creel establish a vivid micro-setting with sensory detail (brackish pools, glass dome, kelp). However, spatial choreography is vague—the woman's dive into a bamboo creel and emergence lack physical coherence. The creel constrains the woman's transformation choice, meeting the 9+ gate, but the atrium itself remains postcard description without altering tactics. Sensory selection is consistent but ornamental in peak beats.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving wonder through identity transformation—is declared but never tested by a concrete on-page obstacle. The woman's hesitation ("routine is a cage") dissolves instantly without escalation or trade-off. The librarian guides but does not face pressure; the child's starfish smelting at the end loops back without raising cost. No reversal or tightening narrows options; coincidence (visitors arrive) drives movement rather than protagonist agency.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The theme of embracing contradiction emerges clearly but is stated rather than earned: "By accepting contradictions, you'll preserve the wonder in routine" is authorial thesis, not dramatic insight. The creel as smelting pot is a functional metaphor but shifts meaning only through declaration. The final image (starfish dissolving, fish takes flight) recurs as poetic closure but does not reweigh prior material with new cost—it restates the premise. The piece edges into thematic echo rather than resonant reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>POV distance is stable third-person limited on the librarian, but the voice lacks perceptual signature—diction is generically lyric rather than character-specific ("voice like a conch shell's echo"). Dialogue feels expository and interchangeable: the librarian and woman speak identical thesis statements without subtext or goal pursuit. The child's speech at the end mirrors the woman's cadence, flattening voice distinction. Free indirect style is clean, but the prose lacks rhythmic control under pressure—every beat sounds the same.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Pervasive paraphrase loops and template cadence: "The librarian nodded… gestured… replied… said" runs across multiple beats without variation. Stock metaphors ("fear is a tide," "voice like a conch shell") appear in peak beats without fresh inflection. Mixed metaphor: a bamboo creel cannot smelt, yet "the bamboo flared, and the water boiled" conflates fire and water logic. Filter-verb stacks dull immediacy ("seemed to hold its breath"). Information density is low—many lines restate mood without advancing situation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>The core premise—identities smelted in a tidal sanctuary—is imaginative but undercut by template execution: the wise guide, the hesitant seeker, the transformative plunge. The woman's scales-to-feathers shift and the child's fish-to-bird story are near-identical beats that loop without escalation. The "after tomorrow disappears" frame is intriguing but ornamental—it does not constrain choice. No fresh inflection earned in hindsight; the emotional arc could be transplanted to any magical sanctuary with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The librarian is present across all three gates but makes no key choices—it observes, guides, and accepts trinkets without agency that alters tactics or forecloses paths. Its fluctuating identity is told but never dramatized through contradictory impulses. The creel placement and final gesture are facilitator moves, not protagonist turns. Swappable with any wise guide archetype.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The creel appears early, is used in the woman's transformation mid-story, and returns in the child's starfish beat at the end, meeting all three gates. It functions as the mechanism for identity smelting, constraining the woman's choice to dive. However, its physical properties are incoherent (bamboo cannot smelt), and its reprise in the final beat is a loop rather than a reweighted charge. Strong causal role but moderate irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Migrating identities frame the premise and are discussed throughout, but the concept is told rather than dramatized—the woman and child arrive, transform, and leave without on-page friction or cost tied to migration itself. The librarian's identity fluctuates via moon phase (a separate attribute) but does not pressure choices. The concept shapes theme but does not alter tactics or narrow options in key beats.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>The librarian's moon-phase fluctuation is mentioned in the opening ("tonight, under the waxing gibbous, it was a keeper of stories") but never constrains or enables an on-page action. By the ending, it shifts roles again via assertion without visible cost or trade-off. The attribute is ornamental—removal would not break story logic. Label-only trait.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Smelting is signaled early, executed in the woman's transformation, and reprised in the child's starfish beat, meeting all three gates. The action drives the woman's plunge and emergence, shaping one key turn. However, its mechanics are vague (heat imagery without physical coherence), and the child's smelting at the end is a loop rather than escalation. Functional but somewhat swappable with any transformation ritual.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Accepting contradictions is named as the method and echoed in the woman's scales/feathers duality and the child's fish/bird story. It shapes the woman's hesitation ("I've always feared losing myself") and resolution. However, the method is more theme statement than on-page mechanics—the contradictions dissolve via declared transformation rather than dramatized friction. Present in closure participation but told, not shown.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The tidal atrium is anchored early, provides the creel and pools as transformation resources, and appears in the final beat ("the atrium seemed to hold its breath"). The setting supplies the mechanism for smelting and charges the "wintersun" mood at closure. However, spatial choreography is vague (how does one dive into a small bamboo basket?), and the atrium does not pressure choices—it is backdrop. Meets all three gates with moderate causal role.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"After tomorrow disappears" is seeded early and echoed in the closing line ("we build new tomorrows from the ashes of the old"), but the timeframe imposes no urgency or constraint on decisions. The tidal flow mentioned throughout is atmospheric rather than a clock that alters tactics. The attribute is ornamental and could be removed without breaking story logic.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Preserving wonder in routine is stated explicitly by the librarian and echoed in the woman's transformation ("Your transformation preserves the wonder in *my* routine"). The motivation frames the dominant stake and appears in the final beat. However, it is told rather than dramatized—no on-page friction tests the librarian's commitment or forces a trade-off between wonder and routine. The desire is present but not conflicted through choices with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Wintersun serenity is seeded early ("pale wintersun") and reprised at closure ("A wintersun serenity settled over the space, soft and eternal"). The tone is coherent and modulates subtly with the woman's transformation tension, then resolves into calm. However, the tone remains static—every beat sounds equally serene, lacking tonal escalation under pressure. The final image charges the tone but does not reweight it. Purposeful reprise with moderate closure linkage.</comment>
