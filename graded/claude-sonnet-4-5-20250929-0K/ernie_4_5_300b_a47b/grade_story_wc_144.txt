<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lira's sensory perception through touch and heat signatures is well-embodied, and her repair methodology shows character-specific expertise. However, her internal conflict remains muted—the stakes of HB-7's failure never force a difficult choice or visible cost; she proceeds methodically without genuine struggle or foreclosed paths. The "embarrassed" reaction to Marlow's praise offers a micro-character note, but no contradictory impulses create pressure during the repair itself. Marlow functions primarily as exposition vessel rather than applying relational pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes clear orientation (who/where/when) within the first paragraph. Drive lens reads as Causal: drone malfunction → diagnosis via water basin → patch and recalibration → successful flight. However, closure lacks felt cost—Lira completes the repair without sacrifice, and the final image ("another drone awaited repair") offers Stasis without visible foreclosure or price. The launch of *Horizon's Breath* functions as backdrop rather than a pressure point that alters Lira's options. One tightening (servo discovery) occurs, but resolution arrives through competence alone.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The mist-coated rail depot, anchor lift, and water basin are vividly rendered with purposeful sensory detail (prismatic hues, condensation drip, iridescent drones). The water basin constrains Lira's diagnostic method and charges the repair sequence. Spatial choreography remains clear (workbench, doorway, skylight, tracks). The mist and depot atmosphere modulate appropriately with the story's calm tone, and the basin's light refraction becomes a micro-setting that enables the solution.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—ensuring HB-7 is flawless for the maiden voyage—is signaled early. However, escalation is minimal: Marlow immediately provides the correct diagnosis ("misaligned servo"), and Lira's repair proceeds without setback or forced trade-off. No on-page reversal narrows her options; the drone's successful hover validates her method but costs her nothing. The timeframe (dawn launch) creates theoretical urgency but never visibly pressures her tactics or forces a compromise.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the water-light method as a metaphor for perception and repair—"magnetic calm that turned chaos into clarity" and "mending the invisible." The final image of another awaiting drone and the lesson that "listening's a kind of seeing" resonates without stating a moral. However, the thematic echo in Marlow's closing line ("You've got a gift...for seeing what's broken") treads close to articulating the premise directly. The piece avoids sentimentality and earns its quiet ending through established particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization remains stable and controlled; Lira's perceptual signature (touch, heat, vibration) is distinct and voice-specific. Free indirect style is clean, and psychic distance modulates appropriately. Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven; Marlow's "Problem's deeper than a patch" and Lira's "It's overcorrecting, like a person walking with a limp" carry subtext and advance the repair logic. Diction remains consistent within Lira's artisan register. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks weaken the narrative stance under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high—most lines advance character, setting, or repair logic. However, minor scaffold appears: "Today was the maiden voyage" and "Her task was to ensure" read slightly expository. The phrase "liquid sunlight" in the penultimate paragraph and "magnetic calm" recur without adding pressure. One paraphrase loop: "He'd taught her to trust the basin's whispers" echoes the earlier setup without deepening it. Prose remains clear and propulsive with no major artifacts touching closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The combination of blindness, artisan expertise, and light-refraction diagnostics offers a fresh synthesis, and the hummingbird drones as hull inspectors avoid cliché. However, the core arc—skilled technician completes repair under time pressure—follows a familiar template without transformation through risk or moral calculus. The water basin method is specific and memorable, but Lira's success arrives without surprise or cost, limiting the premise's ingenuity. Emotional truth in the quiet ending partially compensates.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lira is present throughout and her repair choices drive all beats. She diagnoses the servo, solders the patch, recalibrates, and validates the fix—agency is clear. However, her decisions never face friction or force a trade-off; competence proceeds unimpeded. The character is essential to the repair but does not create a turn through conflicted choice. Two gates (setup, development, payoff) are met; causal pressure is moderate; no visible cost tied to her as character.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>HB-7 appears in the opening diagnosis, is submerged twice in the water basin (distinct beats), and successfully hovers at closure—three functional touches. The drone's fracture and servo misalignment drive the plot, and its final flight validates Lira's method. However, the object could be swapped for any damaged tool requiring repair without altering story logic; specificity of "artificial hummingbird" matters less than "broken drone." All three gates met; causal pressure and closure linkage elevate the score, but replaceability caps high-band entry.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The repair shop is present from the opening and frames the entire action—Lira's workbench, tools, and basin define the setting. It shapes her role and tactics (she cannot leave to find parts; she uses on-hand methods). The concept appears in setup, middle work, and the final line ("another drone awaited repair"). However, the shop could be a lab, workshop, or hangar without changing the logic; it provides location but does not constrain a key choice. All three gates; functional but swappable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Lira's blindness is established early ("adjusted her braille tool belt") and shown through her reliance on touch, heat signatures, and Marlow's verbal cues. It enables her water-light method—she traces warmth of refracted colors. However, the trait never forces a visible trade-off or mistake; competence eclipses constraint. The story signals her adaptation but does not dramatize cost. Setup and development gates met; closure participation is indirect (her method succeeds). Functional constraint without on-page friction.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Patching the wing is the central on-page action: Lira solders a titanium patch, then recalibrates the servo. The patch is shown in two beats (soldering, submersion test) and directly enables the drone's successful hover at closure. Removing "patch" would break the repair logic. However, the action could be "weld," "bond," or "splice" with minimal edits; the verb is less specific than the mechanical result. All three gates; strong causal role; moderate replaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The water basin and light refraction appear in setup (Marlow's backstory, Lira's reliance), are used twice in the middle (submerge to diagnose, submerge to validate), and the basin is refilled at closure. The method enables the servo diagnosis and success confirmation—two functional beats. However, the mechanics remain abstract: "patterns...pointed to solutions" and "traced the colors with her fingertips, their warmth guiding her" tell rather than show the diagnostic process. All three gates; purposeful but underdramatized causality.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The rail depot, mist, anchor lift, and tracks are vividly rendered and frame every beat. The mist creates atmosphere, and the lift's ascent marks the story's timeframe. However, the setting does not constrain Lira's choices—she could repair the drone anywhere. The depot supplies ambiance and context but does not alter tactics or provide decisive resources. Setup, development (continuous presence), and payoff (lift ascent, final workbench image) are met; postcard tendency limited by strong sensory detail.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The maiden voyage and dawn launch are signaled in the first paragraph and the lift ascent occurs near closure, bracketing the repair sequence. However, the clock is never tracked on the page—no mention of remaining time, urgency felt in Lira's pace, or risk of missing the launch. The timeframe provides a nominal deadline but does not tighten Lira's decisions or force a shortcut. Setup and payoff gates met; development (pressure) gate weak. Functional backdrop without tactical impact.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Lira's goal—"to decode the feedback embedded in the drone's malfunction"—is stated early and drives her use of the water basin. She seeks to translate the drone's data into course corrections, a desire enacted on the page through her diagnostic method. However, the motivation never conflicts with another want or cost; she pursues it methodically without friction. Setup, development (diagnosis), and payoff (successful flight) gates met; told desire without dramatized want/fear tension. Functional but uncontested.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Tone is established through "mist clung," "rhythmic clatter," Lira's humming lullaby, and the "magnetic calm" that recurs at closure. The prose maintains a steady, meditative register even under nominal time pressure—appropriately reflecting Lira's expertise. However, the tone does not modulate with urgency or setback; it remains static across beats. The final image ("water's surface catching the faint glow of dawn") charges the ending with continuity rather than shift. Coherent throughout; minimal range; purposeful stasis rather than dynamic recalibration.</comment>
