<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Veyra's motivation is declared but never tested by internal conflict or meaningful choice. She moves through the library and chamber with competent ease, encountering no mistakes, hesitation, or genuine friction between want and cost. The pretender and courtiers remain stock figures without pressure or distinct voice. The ending grants her recognition without visible sacrifice or alteration—she was already the heir, and the story delivers symmetric satisfaction without foreclosing any option.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed: who, where, and when remain vague past 120 words, earning a −0.4 penalty and triggering the Q3 cap at 7.0. The closure—Veyra throws the pellet, the illusion dissolves, courtiers bow—lacks felt cost; she exits with the pellet still in hand and a smile, suffering no visible loss or alteration. The drive lens appears Causal but major turns occur off-stage (the pretender's usurpation, ancestors' encoding) and the ink pellet resolves a problem it did not help create. No meaningful tightening or deepening occurs on the page before the final act.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The ancient temple library is described with vivid phrases ("air hummed with forgotten prayers," "leather that had outlasted empires") but functions as backdrop rather than constraint. The mosaic trapdoor and hidden chamber appear when needed without prior spatial setup. The setting does not pressure Veyra's choices—she knows the temple's secrets and slips through walls with ease. The ink pellet is the lone object that charges the final image, lifting the score slightly above pure decoration.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—unmask the pretender—is signaled early but never narrows Veyra's options or forces a trade-off. She possesses the solution from the outset and encounters no meaningful resistance: guards patrol "beyond the doors" but she bypasses them off-page. The celestial convergence ticks in the background but does not tighten tactics. The pretender's dissolution is spectacle without cost to Veyra, and the courtiers' instant recognition completes a frictionless arc.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Theme of truth versus illusion is declared rather than explored through choice. The ink pellet "sunders" deceit in a single stroke without ambiguity or moral cost, collapsing to a simple binary. The "graceful collapse" and "realm's true path reclaimed" read as stated victory rather than resonant reconfiguration. Veyra's smile at the end signals triumph without lingering tension or counter-reading, and the constellations resuming their journey offers symbolic closure that the scene work has not earned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains elevated register ("regally unpretentious," "sundered the illusion") but diction often drifts into abstract or stock phrasing ("her motivation burned like a star," "the walls crumbled to reveal a sky alive with stars"). POV is stable third-limited with no head-hopping. Dialogue—Veyra's single line and the pretender's scream—lacks subtext or character-specific idiom. Psychic distance remains constant without modulation under pressure, and filter verbs ("she recalled," "she knew") occasionally dull immediacy without voice justification.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Multiple paraphrase loops and template cadence runs: "The library was a labyrinth…each page whispering"; "She moved through…her steps echoing like a heartbeat"; "The pretender's form wavered, his skin peeling away…a construct of magic." Stock metaphors ("burned like a star trapped in her chest," "lies had seeped…like a slow poison") accumulate in peak beats without fresh specificity. Figurative density in the final paragraph ("collapsed gracefully," "sky alive with stars") obscures concrete action. Scaffold phrasing and synonym churn trigger −0.8 in Q7, and the artifact spread disallows 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The core premise—titan heir uses ancestor-encoded clues and a magical relic during a celestial convergence to unmask a pretender—combines familiar fantasy template elements without fresh synthesis. "Regally unpretentious" and "diminutive titan" gesture toward subversion but remain label-only. The cryptic messages and celestial timing add decoration rather than constraint. The ending's instant courtier conversion and Veyra's unaltered exit mirror template resolution. No single turn or inflection feels inevitable in hindsight or grounds the fantastical in lived particulars.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>Veyra is introduced early and present throughout, but her choices do not create key turns. She retrieves a volume, recalls messages, and throws the pellet—actions that execute a pre-formed plan without on-page decision friction. The "diminutive titan" descriptor appears twice but does not constrain or enable any tactic. She exits with no visible alteration, placing her role as observer-actor rather than decision-driver.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The iron gall ink pellet appears in four distinct beats: withdrawal from pouch, pressing into mosaic recess, the throw, and "cold in her hand" at exit. Early signal by second paragraph and closure participation are strong. The rune glows and flares, activating the sundering. However, it resolves a problem it did not help create—Veyra possessed it from the start and the pretender's vulnerability was never established on the page—capping the score and reducing causal pressure credit.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>The "rune of drift" is named and described ("etched…its surface," "glowed faintly," "flared") but its mechanics remain opaque. What "drift" means or why it sunders illusions is never shown through prior constraint or failed attempt. It appears functional at closure but swappable with any "rune of truth-revealing" without altering story logic. No middle development or cost tied specifically to drift versus another magical property.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"Regally unpretentious" is assigned early ("a regally unpretentious figure in a tattered robe") and repeated at closure ("her regally unpretentious presence commanding the room"), but it does not constrain or enable any choice. The trait is label-only; Veyra's actions—climbing, recalling, throwing—would read identically without this descriptor. No visible trade-off or cost stems from being unpretentious versus any other bearing.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Sunder" appears in three key moments: the ancestral message, the ink pellet's activation, and the pretender's dissolution. The action is named early and drives the climax when the illusion is broken. However, the mechanics are told rather than shown—we do not see what sundering requires or costs Veyra—and the term could be replaced with "dispel" or "shatter" with minor edits. Closure participation and early signal elevate it into mid-band, but swappability and lack of on-page cost prevent higher scoring.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Cryptic messages in library books are signaled early (treatise, poetry margin, Chronicles volume) and shape Veyra's interpretation across multiple beats. The method provides her with the map and timing, making it essential to the middle sequence. However, the mechanics remain vague—how ancestors encoded these messages, why the pretender never found them—and the messages do not constrain Veyra's choices or impose cost. She deciphers them "eons" before the story opens, so the method shapes setup but not live tactics.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The ancient temple library is introduced in the opening line and frames all action. The shelves, ladder, mosaic trapdoor, and hidden chamber provide spatial structure and the library's secrets enable Veyra to "slip through walls" and reach the chamber. However, the setting does not pressure her choices—she already knows its secrets—and the labyrinth quality is declared but not dramatized through navigation friction. The library participates in closure (the chamber scene) but functions more as backdrop than constraint, placing it at the lower edge of "shapes one key turn."</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The Silent Convergence is named early and stated as the necessary timing ("Tonight was that night"). The constellations "pause" and later "resume," bookending the story. However, the timeframe does not tighten Veyra's decisions—she has eons to prepare and acts without visible clock pressure during the infiltration and throw. The pause is asserted but not felt as constraint. Setup and closure participation are present; middle development and cost linkage are absent.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Unmask the pretender is declared in paragraph two and drives the goal throughout. Veyra's method (deciphering messages, timing the convergence, using the pellet) is motivated by this desire, and the climax delivers the unmasking. However, the motivation is told ("her motivation burned like a star") rather than tested by friction between want and cost. She never doubts, hesitates, or sacrifices anything to achieve it. Functional across beats but lacks the conflicted choice that would lift it higher.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"Graceful collapse" is named in the penultimate paragraph and reprised in the final line. The tone attempts elevated, controlled dissolution ("collapsed gracefully—not in ruin, but in release") but this register is not sustained or modulated under pressure earlier. The courtiers gasp and bow, the pretender screams, yet the prose maintains static elevation without tonal shift to charge these moments. The tone is asserted at closure rather than built through scene rhythm, and it does not reweight prior material with pressure.</comment>
