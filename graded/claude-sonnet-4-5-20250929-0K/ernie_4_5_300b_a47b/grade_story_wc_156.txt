<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Marisol's interior is present but leans toward generic artisan-dreamer phrasing ("colors held memories," "methodically playful soul"). Her motivation to "awaken" the mural feels more told than dramatized through contradictory impulses. The grandfather backstory fragment anchors her curiosity but doesn't create visible internal friction. The final choice to "keep dancing" arrives without a felt trade-off on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors cleanly. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the garden hum, nickel placement, and mural activation build density toward the final image of Marisol "dancing" to awakening as rhythm. However, the closure effect—"awakening was not a destination, but a rhythm"—is stated rather than shown through a decisive image that reweights prior material with cost. The woman in the flapper dress and the lullaby are intriguing beats but dissolve without altering Marisol's options or crystallizing a visible price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The sound wave garden is vivid and specific: fractal wind chimes, concave dish, nodes that make petals tremble. The nickel's rough surface bending sound into harmonics is purposeful detail. The garden constrains Marisol's approach (positioning the dish, aligning frequencies) and charges the final image of her walking away with the hum "lingering in her bones." Minor: the mural's spatial relation to the lab and Dr. Lysander's sudden appearance lack clear choreography.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—unveiling the mural's secrets—is signaled early. The nickel placement and frequency alignment create one meaningful tightening when the mural splits and dancers flicker. However, the escalation relies on Dr. Lysander's exposition rather than Marisol's agency under pressure. The flapper woman's wink and the lullaby are atmospheric but don't narrow options or force a trade-off. No visible cost forecloses a path at closure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The theme of nested awakenings and curiosity over certainty emerges through the nickel, mural, and lullaby pattern. "Curiosity begets curiosity. Certainty is a cage" and the final assertion that "awakening was not a destination, but a rhythm" tip into direct statement. The flapper woman holding an identical nickel offers a resonant mirror, but the ending paragraph moralizes rather than trusting the image to carry thematic weight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV is stable single-character close third with purposeful compression ("vivid mural restorer," "methodically playful in her approach"). Diction is consistent and slightly elevated but fits Marisol's artistic sensibility. Dr. Lysander's dialogue ("Nested awakenings," "ghost in the machine? Or a mirror") reads distinct. Minor: "her grandfather had been methodically playful too" edges toward summary that could anchor more concretely in a recalled gesture or phrase.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and most lines advance. "The sound wave garden thrived in the hush between noon and dusk" is a strong anchor. However, paraphrase loops appear: "She positioned the nickel… The coin's surface caught… Marisol adjusted the dish's angle" restates setup across three sentences. "Methodically playful" recurs as a label without fresh embodiment. The final paragraph stacks summary ("she realized," "all were tools," "a reminder") where a single image would tighten closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of acoustics, mural restoration, and the hobo nickel as a sound prism is specific and non-obvious. The nested awakenings frame offers a fresh angle on memory and perception. The flapper woman mirror and grandfather's lullaby emerging from the garden hum are original touches. Risk: the piece leans into the conceptual without fully dramatizing cost, and "methodically playful" as a character tag reads slightly generic despite the unusual premise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Marisol is present early, handles the nickel and dish in the activation beat, and anchors the final image walking away. However, her key choices (positioning the dish, whispering to the mural) feel more exploratory than stakes-altering. The decision to "return to the mural, nickel in hand, and listen again" is future intent, not on-page action with cost. Setup and payoff present; middle development is observational.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The hobo nickel appears in the opening paragraph, is positioned in the dish to activate the mural (middle beat), and is pocketed at closure with the commitment to return. Its rough surface and etchings enable the sound-bending mechanics. The flapper woman holding an identical nickel reweights its meaning. Strong integration across beats, though the cost tied to the nickel itself is conceptual rather than visible.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Nested awakenings" is named by Dr. Lysander and enacted through the mural revealing dancers, the flapper woman, the lullaby, and Marisol's memory of her grandfather. The concept shapes the story's structure and theme. However, it functions more as a thematic frame than a tactical constraint that narrows Marisol's choices under pressure. Setup and payoff clear; middle constraint weak.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Methodically playful" is applied to Marisol twice and to her grandfather once. The label describes her experimental approach (mapping nodes, testing frequencies) but doesn't constrain an on-page choice with visible cost. It reads more as character summary than a trait that creates friction or trade-offs in a key beat. Ornamental presence without decisive pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Bewitch" appears once in Marisol's intention ("to bewitch the mural into revealing its secrets") and Dr. Lysander confirms "the bewitchment" through reflected sound. The activation beat—nickel in dish, sound bouncing, mural splitting—enacts the bewitchment. However, the action could be described as "activate" or "awaken" with minor edits. It drives one major turn but feels somewhat swappable in phrasing.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Through reflected sound" is signaled early (ambient hum, concave dish, sound waves bouncing off the nickel) and Dr. Lysander explains the mechanics mid-story. The method enables the mural activation and is referenced in the closure insight about "listening instead of looking." It shapes the central beat and aligns with Marisol's experimental process. Functionally essential but could be streamlined without changing the core logic.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The sound wave garden is introduced in the opening line, provides the ambient hum and fractal wind chime that drive the nickel experiment, and its hum "lingers in her bones" at closure. The garden's nodes and frequencies constrain Marisol's weeks of alignment work. It supplies both resource (sound) and conceptual frame (a state of mind). Strong setup, middle involvement, and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"In the pause between question and reply" is named twice: once during the activation beat ("that liminal space where curiosity outweighs certainty") and again at closure ("We wait for the next pause"). It frames the moment of bewitchment and the story's rhythm. However, it functions more as a conceptual marker than a tightening clock that alters tactics. Lyric reprise with moderate reweighting.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"To exchange certainty for curiosity" is stated explicitly by Dr. Lysander ("You exchanged certainty for curiosity when you chose to listen instead of look"). Marisol's experimental weeks and whispered question enact curiosity, and the ending commits her to ongoing listening. The motivation is clear but told more than dramatized through conflicting impulses. Setup and payoff present; friction between want and cost is conceptual rather than on-page choice with visible price.</comment>
