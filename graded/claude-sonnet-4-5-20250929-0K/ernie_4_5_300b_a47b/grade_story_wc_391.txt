<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kael's interiority shows purpose-driven focus ("sculpt patience from impatience"), but internal contradiction is thin—he mutters mantras without embodied struggle between competing impulses. The shift from haste to patience is told via a single failed attempt and a self-correction rather than dramatized through layered, contradictory wants acting simultaneously. Embodiment is selective (breath puffs, aching back) yet emotional states lean toward label-only serenity. The acolyte exchange at the end gestures toward earned wisdom but lacks visible cost that forecloses a live path for Kael himself.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with mild situational pressure. Orientation anchors (Kael, basalt sanctuary, frozen lake, post-freeze timeframe) land early. The piece accumulates texture through repeated moon-mapping beats and viaduct adjustments, building toward the dawn resonance and the elders' approval. However, closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the viaduct hums, elders approve, Kael continues his work) without a decisive on-page choice or visible cost that forecloses a path—Kael's stance at the end is identical to his stance at the start, and the weeks-long coda dilutes the closure moment. The cost (aching back, tiredness) is fleeting and does not reweight options or meaning at the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Basalt sanctuary, frozen lake, moss, iron filings, and the viaduct surface create vivid, purpose-driven anchors. The filings' behavior (trembling, coiling, locking into grids) constrains Kael's adjustments and charges multiple beats. Spatial choreography is clear (perimeter pacing, kneeling between pillars, lake's edge). The frozen lake returns in the final paragraph with thawed water, reweighting the viaduct's hum as a lasting legacy. Setting details are filtered through Kael's professional focus (magnetic nodes, fractal refractions) without postcard excess.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: align the viaduct's magnetic field with the moon's path to "unyoke" its power. One meaningful tightening occurs when the first attempt fails and Kael resets the filings; the moon's higher beam illuminates a node, narrowing his task. The dawn resonance shows success, but it is not a choice under pressure—Kael simply completes the work he set out to do, and no live option is foreclosed. The elders' approval and the weeks-long continuation flatten the stakes rather than sharpening them. Agency reads as patient execution rather than a decisive act with visible trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme of patience versus impatience emerges through Kael's methodical work and the elders' "patient revolution" mantra. The concept of unyoking power "not by force, but by tracking moon paths" is integrated into the plot but borders on thesis statement ("To unyoke the world, one must first unyoke oneself"). The final image of the thawed lake and persistent hum offers a resonant answer to the central question without overt moralizing, yet the acolyte exchange ("When the impatience stops screaming") edges toward articulating the theme rather than embodying it. Subtext operates in the filings' coiling debate and the viaduct's "restless hum," but the didactic framing in the coda lowers the score.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable and character-particular; Kael's perceptual signature filters setting through professional focus (magnetic nodes, fractal patterns, iron filings). Diction is controlled and purposeful ("softly purposeful," "pocked with lichen"), though "sculpting patience from impatience" and "patient revolution" recur as prompt-adjacent phrases without fresh inflection. Brief dialogue with the acolyte is goal-driven and carries subtext ("Listen. The viaduct doesn't rush. Neither should we."). Psychic distance narrows appropriately during the alignment work. Rhythm modulates with pressure (short bursts during the failed attempt, longer cadences during the night's work), and no head-hopping occurs.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies naturally; no algorithmic stems or loops. Information density is high in the alignment beats (filings coiling, moon beam through fissure, nodes etched in stone). Minor scaffold appears: "The revolution wasn't in grand gestures, but in the quiet persistence" and "The revolution wasn't over; it had just begun" recycle the same prompt-adjacent phrasing without added pressure. Figurative language is controlled (filings "debating their purpose," ice as "glassy sheet"), though "dance: the moon's cold grace against the viaduct's restless hum" leans purple without sensory grounding. No paraphrase loops or filter-verb stacks. The coda's summary mode ("In the weeks that followed…") compresses transit efficiently but dilutes closure momentum slightly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The premise—aligning a magnetic viaduct by tracking moon paths—offers a specific synthesis of ancient relic, lunar geometry, and patient craft. However, the core pattern (frustrated expert achieves breakthrough through perseverance) is familiar, and the "sculpt patience from impatience" frame echoes workshop-prompt logic without fresh lived complication. The filings' coiling/straightening debate and the fractal refraction through ice provide textural specificity. The elders' approval and the acolyte's question are genre-conventional validation beats. Risk-taking is moderate; the piece commits to its quiet, textural mode without bold structural or perspectival choices that heighten stakes beyond the established template.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kael's role as "vigilant horizon mapper" is signaled early and drives the plot: he kneels to trace the viaduct's arc, paces the sanctuary's perimeter, maps lunar trajectories nightly, and adjusts the viaduct's alignment by fractions of a degree. His decision to reset the filings after the first failure and his persistent realignment work shape the middle beats and the dawn resonance. By the coda, his choices (continuing to map horizons by day and moon paths by night) frame the thematic payoff. The trait of vigilance and mapping is irreplaceable to the plot's causal chain and the ending image of the wider horizon.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The "magnetic viaduct" is central but never described "after rain"—the prompt element specifies "after rain," yet the story anchors the viaduct's activity "after the lake froze over" and never mentions rain. Kael traces the viaduct's arc, adjusts its alignment, and watches its field surge at dawn; it returns in the coda as a persistent hum. The viaduct is causally indispensable, but the specific "after rain" condition is absent, creating a substitution (frost/freeze for rain). This deviation from the exact element caps the score despite strong integration of the viaduct itself.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"A patient revolution" is named explicitly by the elders and shapes Kael's tactics: he works slowly, resets the filings without haste, and mutters "Patience" as a mantra. The concept recurs in the narrative voice ("The revolution wasn't in grand gestures, but in the quiet persistence of realignment") and the ending ("The revolution wasn't over; it had just begun"). However, it reads more as thematic overlay than a live stake that narrows options—Kael never faces a choice where patience and revolution conflict or cost him something. The concept is front-loaded and echoed but does not change tactics at the ending; it remains a descriptor rather than a driver of choice under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Softly purposeful" is awarded to Kael by the elders in the coda and appears once in the narrative voice ("his movements softly purposeful"). It describes his manner during the realignment work (resetting filings with care, adjusting by fractions) but does not constrain or enable a specific on-page action with visible cost. The trait is label-only; we see purposeful movements, but "softly" does not trade off against speed or force in a moment of pressure. It arrives late (coda title) and functions as thematic confirmation rather than a tactical attribute that shapes a key choice.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Unyoke" is signaled early ("Kael's task was to unyoke that power"), drives the plot through the alignment work, and lands at the closure beat ("He had unyoked it—not by breaking chains, but by guiding the moon's light into the viaduct's heart"). The action is specific (unyoking as gentle realignment rather than forceful release) and its method (moon-path tracking) is irreplaceable. The ending image of the thawed lake and persistent hum confirms the unyoking's success. The verb is thematically charged and causally central, though the stakes of unyoking (what changes for Kael or the sanctuary) remain abstract, keeping the score below 8.5.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"By tracking moon paths" is signaled early ("by tracking moon paths. Each night, he mapped the lunar trajectory") and used across multiple beats: Kael notes how moonlight refracts through ice, watches the moon rise higher to illuminate a node, and works through the night adjusting alignment. The method is specific and causally necessary—without the moon's beam, the viaduct's nodes cannot be aligned. It shapes his attempts and is indispensable to the dawn success. The coda confirms he continues "mapping horizons by day and moon paths by night," reweighting the method as an ongoing discipline.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The "basalt sanctuary by a frozen lake" is established in the opening line and returns in every major beat: Kael kneels between pillars, paces the perimeter, pauses at the lake's edge, and watches ice ripple into concentric circles. The frozen lake's thickening and the viaduct's louder hum "after the lake froze over" anchor the timeframe and pressure the work. The sanctuary's fissured roof allows the moon beam to illuminate a node, directly enabling the alignment. The thawed lake in the final paragraph reweights the setting as a lasting witness to the "cold, clear night." Micro-setting (moss, basalt walls, ice sheet) constrains and charges multiple choices.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"After the lake freezes over" is signaled early and frames the timeframe: the viaduct's energy "hummed louder" post-freeze, and Kael begins his work. The freeze is a causal anchor (cold sharpens the viaduct's focus), but the timeframe does not tighten decisions—Kael works "through the night" and "in the weeks that followed" without a live clock or deadline. The thaw in the final paragraph marks passage of time but does not alter tactics. The freeze is setup rather than a constraint that narrows options at the ending.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"To sculpt patience from impatience" is named by the elders and echoed in Kael's self-correction ("Patience," he muttered) and the narrative voice ("sculpting patience from impatience"). It drives the plot—Kael's first hurried adjustment fails, prompting slower, more deliberate work. However, the motivation is told more than dramatized through internal friction; Kael's impatience is shown once (the failed attempt), then resolved via mantra repetition. No on-page moment reveals him torn between haste and patience at the ending, so the friction is front-loaded rather than sustained. The thematic payoff ("To unyoke the world, one must first unyoke oneself") restates the motivation but does not charge it with fresh cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Restrained wildness" is not named but is evoked through contrasts: the viaduct's "restless hum" versus Kael's patient adjustments, the frozen lake's stillness versus churning currents below, the filings' coiling debate versus their final locked grid. Tone is coherent and modulates with pressure (terse beats during the failed attempt, longer cadences during the night's work, serene summary in the coda). The final image of the thawed lake and persistent hum balances stillness and motion. However, "wildness" is understated—no moment of uncontrolled surge or risk that threatens to break the restraint. Tone supports the theme but does not charge the ending with visceral tension.</comment>
