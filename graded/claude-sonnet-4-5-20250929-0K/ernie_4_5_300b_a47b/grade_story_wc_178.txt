<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's frugality is asserted repeatedly but rarely constrains an on-page choice with visible cost—she bartered wages off-screen, then operates without material friction. Internal life leans on stock phrasing: "her pulse quickened," "breath catching," "voice steadier than she felt." The tile-acceptance moment ("I'll honor it") arrives without dramatized conflict between competing wants; the mentor's death and her grief are told, not tested under present pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when adequately by the second paragraph. The drive lens reads Situational-Accumulative hybrid: pressure accumulates through discovery beats (reliefs → recessed panel → chamber → merging tiles) without strong because/therefore links. Closure offers Resonant Reconfiguration via internal stance shift ("covenant with herself"), but cost remains abstract—no on-page forfeiture of coin, safety, or alternate path is dramatized. The voice intones cosmic patience yet resolves with a smile and lightened steps, undercutting felt price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The reimagined Babylonian palace supplies vivid sensory anchors: "dust-caked stone," "sandstone arches," "bioluminescent light," "desert wind carried jasmine." Spatial choreography tracks clearly across corridor → panel → chamber → pedestal. The tile functions as micro-setting object and constrains one choice (placement in the groove opens the wall), meeting the 9+ gate marginally. Scope and economy are sound; no occupational over-detail.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("seeking answers / bridging empirical and unknown") is signaled early. One meaningful tightening occurs when the wall opens and the voice challenges her, but her reply ("I seek to seal a pact") is assertion without visible trade-off. The tiles merge via cosmetic alignment rather than agonistic choice. Cost is declared ("curiosity") but not felt: Elara emerges with "steps lighter," no forfeited path or live option closed on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Theme (devotion encoded in math, curiosity as covenant) emerges from image and action, not sermon. The tile-as-mirror conceit offers fresh inflection. Yet the ending articulates theme overtly: "some truths were too vast for telescopes" and the translated word *"Asharu"* function as thesis statements rather than resonant particulars. The mentor's scoffing and Elara's smile feel hedged against real renunciation. No plausible counter-reading lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Voice carries consistent diction ("armor," "dusky harmony") and perceptual filters (astronomical/mathematical bias). Dialogue with the disembodied voice lands naturally and advances plot. Minor filter-verb reliance ("her breath catching," "she gasped") dulls immediacy in peak beats without wholesale collapse. Psychic distance modulates purposefully when the tile shows her face superimposed on starfield.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Syntax varies; rhythm breathes. Information density is high in discovery beats. Paraphrase loops appear: "The tile wasn't magic—it was a lens" echoes prior "mirror" metaphor without added pressure (−0.2). Stock metaphors cluster: "shield against the void's indifference," "wind through reeds," "star waiting for its orbit." Template cadence in action beats ("She knelt, brushing... placed it... clutched the tile") recurs but stays legible. No clarity breaks at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Premise (magic-realist Babylonian ruin with holographic math tiles) blends familiar treasure-hunt structure with fresh astronomical/devotional angle. The tile-as-lens reveal offers modest ingenuity, though the "covenant with self" resolution is well-worn in quest narratives. Frugal-astronomer pairing is specific yet underused in causal pressure. Derivative guardrail applies moderately: structure echoes Indiana Jones meets metaphysical self-discovery without strong transformation through lived occupational or cultural detail.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Frugality is asserted across beats (bartered wages, "armor," coin-counting) but never constrains an on-page tactical choice with visible cost—she operates freely once inside. Astronomer trait colors perception (star-chart reliefs, equations) yet does not enable or block a key turn. Present in setup and ending; minimal middle development.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Magic square tile appears in setup (recessed panel), middle (second tile on pedestal, alignment triggers chamber reveal), and closure (ordinary tile in palm, word *Asharu* shown). Drives two beats (wall opening, holographic projection) and shapes ending image. Swappable with generic "relic" or "key" without major structural collapse; specificity of "magic square" math grid underused causally.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Encrypted devotion" is narrated once as interpretive label ("priesthood encode devotion in mathematics") and echoed thematically at closure ("devotion... in numbers"). Does not constrain on-page choices or create tactical friction. Functions as thematic gloss rather than stake-shaping mechanic. Late thematic echo in final paragraph; no middle development.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Empirically ironic" appears as narrator summary ("irony wasn't lost on her," "bridged the empirical and the ironic") without enabling or blocking action. Elara's empirical skepticism and ironic self-awareness are told, not dramatized through contradictory choice under pressure. Label-only trait; no visible cost tied to this exact attribute.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Uncloak" is invoked by the disembodied voice ("You've come to uncloak the covenant") and shapes one beat (verbal challenge prompts Elara's reply and tile arrangement). Does not drive major turns; easily replaceable with "reveal" or "discover." Present in middle beat only; absent from setup and not causally active at closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Schematic representations" (reliefs as cipher, tile grids, holographic constellations) appear across beats and enable the wall-opening sequence. Mechanics matter: alignment of grids triggers projection. Yet the how is summary ("she arranged them side by side, their grids aligning") rather than problem-solved tactically. Functional but underspecified; could be swapped for "ancient symbols" or "codes."</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Ancient Babylonian palace reimagined supplies discovery structure (labyrinthine corridors, recessed panel, hidden chamber), resources (tiles in panel/pedestal), and atmospheric pressure (rumble, dust, sealing wall). Directly shapes two turns (panel discovery, wall opening). "Between regimes" history (tomb/library/forge) colors tone but does not constrain present tactics. Strong setup and middle; present at closure (palace silhouette, "secrets safe between regimes").</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Between regimes" is exposition (palace repurposed across eras) with no live clock or temporal pressure on Elara's present choices. Timeframe does not tighten decisions, alter tactics, or create urgency. Static historical context; no ticking constraint dramatized on the page.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"To seal a covenant with the unknown" is spoken aloud by Elara in the chamber beat and echoed at closure ("The covenant was sealed"). Desire is declared but not visibly conflicted—no on-page friction between sealing the pact and another want (safety, wealth, mentor's approval). Functions as thematic anchor rather than dramatized tension. Present in middle and ending; setup alludes indirectly.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Dusky harmony" appears in setup ("palace hummed with a dusky harmony"), recurs as realization ("she felt the dusky harmony... balance between order and chaos"), and colors closure mood (twilight, jasmine wind). Tone is coherent and modulates from discovery-urgency to contemplative resolution. Does not sharply charge the final image with new pressure; functions as atmospheric through-line rather than active reconfiguration.</comment>
