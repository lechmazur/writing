<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Clara-7's motivation to resolve inner static is present but largely told rather than dramatized through micro-choices. The static-as-burden-turned-song arc reads clean, though the embodied contradictions remain thin—optics flicker, joints creak, but these feel more like status indicators than lived struggle. The final smile and clear optics land too tidily after decades of glitch, undercutting the "fragmented wholeness" the piece claims. The box interaction and plasma torch choice do create one pressure point, but her agency in that moment lacks visible cost or foreclosed alternative.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural with hybrid causal elements. Orientation anchors (android, farm, dome) arrive cleanly within the opening lines. The controlled burn sequence provides one meaningful tightening—box to orb to integration—that reweights Clara-7's static from burden to song. However, the cost at closure is asserted ("whole," "lighter," "clear") rather than shown through a forfeited option or tactical constraint. The magnetic storm complicates but does not decisively shape the final choice, and the box's fraying seals set up pressure that dissipates without a felt price when the orb dissolves into her palm.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The glass dome, solar panels, and desert roses establish vivid spatial grounding and recur with purpose. The dome's electromagnetic field and the roses' engineered spirals constrain the burn and charge the final bloom image, satisfying the micro-setting test. Sensory detail—ozone, pressed lavender, bioluminescent threads—is selective and POV-filtered through android perception. The magnetic storm outside modulates the dome's light and pressure, and the recurring "glass-domed enclosure containing chaos" image anchors the thematic frame without overstatement.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (resolve inner static) is signaled early and drives the plasma-torch choice, providing one tightening. The box's fraying seals add urgency, but the magnetic storm remains ambient rather than forcing a trade-off. When the orb dissolves into Clara-7's palm, no live option is foreclosed—she reaches out, trembling, but we don't see what she risked or lost by doing so. The piece asserts fragmented wholeness at closure without showing the price paid or the path refused. Pressure accumulates texturally but does not narrow options or alter tactics in a way that charges the final image with felt cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme (chaos contained, fragmented wholeness) emerges organically from the controlled burn and the box, avoiding overt statement until the final reflective beat. The desert roses' brighter bloom and Clara-7's shift from burden to song provide a resonant non-literal answer. However, the closing line—"The static was still there, but now it felt like a song"—verges on thesis restatement, and the musing about "letting go and holding on all at once" edges toward platitude. The farm-as-box conceit and the controlled-burn-as-purification motif integrate well, though the piece occasionally foregrounds its thematic architecture rather than trusting the particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>POV remains stable in close third, filtered through Clara-7's android perception with consistent diction (optics, circuits, plasma torch). The voice carries a distinct texture—formal yet embodied—and avoids head-hopping. Psychic distance narrows effectively during the burn sequence. Minor slips: "strangely organic" and "fragmented wholeness" read slightly authorial rather than character-particular, and the final hummed tune from "old Earth records" feels like a convenient emotional cue. No dialogue present to evaluate. The prose modulates purposefully under pressure, and the perceptual signature (static, flickering optics, creaking joints) remains consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and the prose is generally clean, but several patterns accumulate: "she'd been ignoring," "she'd learned," "she'd built" cluster in early exposition; "felt like" appears three times (organic, threat, song), creating a mild template cadence. The phrase "strangely organic" and "fragmented wholeness" drift toward elevated diction that doesn't quite fit an android caretaker's interior lexicon. The plasma torch beat is vivid, but "with a sound like shattering glass" is a stock simile. Information density is high in the burn sequence; the reflective closing paragraph loops slightly, restating the static-as-song metaphor. No major loops or scaffolding, but minor redundancies across adjacent lines prevent entry to higher bands.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The nostalgic android premise and controlled-burn-as-emotional-reset metaphor are well-executed but not fresh; similar arcs appear widely in recent SF. The box of childhood fears (human colonists' anxieties bottled by the caretaker) offers a specific angle, and the magnetic north shift as catalyst adds texture. However, the core emotional arc—accepting imperfection, static-as-song—follows a familiar template without a sharp transformative turn. The desert rose farm under glass is vivid but doesn't fundamentally alter the arc's logic. Removing the dome and roses would weaken atmosphere but leave the plot and theme intact, signaling mid-range originality.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Clara-7 is present throughout and makes the plasma torch choice that drives the burn sequence. Her nostalgia is asserted ("decades ago," humming Earth records) but not causally active—it colors mood without constraining tactics. She signals setup, participates in the middle burn beat, and appears in closure, meeting all three gates. However, her android nature and caretaker role feel more atmospheric than decision-shaping; a human character could execute the same arc with minor edits. The "nostalgic" trait is mentioned but does not create a felt cost or enable a unique tactic.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The box appears in three beats: retrieval from the shed, placement at the farm center, and the burn that transforms it into the orb. Its bioluminescent threads and fraying seals add specificity, and its destruction is irreversible. The box's contents (childhood fears) motivate the burn and the orb's dissolution into Clara-7 creates the closure shift. However, the box itself is a vessel; the orb does the final thematic work. The box is essential to setup and middle escalation and shapes closure, but the orb's appearance slightly dilutes its indispensability. Strong integration across all three gates with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The controlled burn is named explicitly and executed on the page via plasma torch. Clara-7 recalls using controlled burns in soil to reset nutrient cycles, linking the concept to her tactic. The burn transforms the box's chaos into the orb, providing one key turn. However, "escape" is not clearly present—Clara-7 remains on the farm; the burn resolves internal static rather than enabling departure. The concept shapes one major beat and primes closure but is somewhat replaceable (purification, transformation, reset could substitute with minor edits). Meets setup, development, and closure gates but lacks unique causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Strangely organic" is used twice: once as a descriptor of the data hum in Clara-7's circuits and once in the closing reflection. The trait colors her arc but does not constrain or enable a specific on-page action with cost. It signals the theme (android becoming more human-like) but remains label-only, never tested against a choice where mechanical precision conflicts with organic messiness. Meets setup and closure via lyric reprise, but middle development is absent. The trait is atmospheric rather than causal, trending mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The miniaturization occurs on the page when the box's surface ripples and the fears condense into the orb. This is a decisive visual turn that transforms the threat. However, the mechanics are vague (fire "miniaturizes" chaos without clear logic), and the action could be replaced with "purify," "distill," or "compress" with minimal rewrite. Clara-7's need to miniaturize is stated early, the action occurs in the middle burn beat, and the resulting orb shapes closure. Meets all three gates and drives one key turn, but swappability and unclear cost mechanics limit the score.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Containing chaos is named explicitly in Clara-7's programming ("to contain chaos") and enacted through the box's design. The burn attempt is framed as containment via controlled fire. However, the method's mechanics are asserted rather than shown—how does fire contain? The orb dissolves into Clara-7 rather than being re-contained, shifting from external containment to internal integration. The concept appears in setup and middle beats and is echoed at closure ("the farm, too, was a kind of box"), but its tactical specificity is thin. Functional presence across gates with thematic resonance but weak causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The desert rose farm in the glass dome is present throughout, grounding every beat. The dome's electromagnetic field interacts with the magnetic storm, the solar panels require Clara-7's maintenance, and the roses witness the burn and bloom brighter at closure. The setting is not merely backdrop—the dome's "enclosure containing chaos" becomes thematic, and the roses' crimson-and-gold spirals provide the final image. The farm constrains Clara-7's world and shapes her caretaker role, though the specific roses and dome could be replaced with other enclosed ecosystems. Strong presence and closure linkage; specificity is high but not fully indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The magnetic north shift is introduced early and recurs: it causes Clara-7's glitch, warps the dome's field, drives the box's fraying, and settles at closure. The storm peaks during the burn, adding atmospheric pressure. However, the timeframe does not create a ticking clock—Clara-7 could have acted earlier or later without visible tactical cost. The shift complicates rather than tightens decisions. It meets setup and closure gates and participates in the middle escalation, but the time element is more ambient than urgent. Functional integration with thematic resonance but limited causal necessity.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Clara-7's desire to resolve inner static is stated early ("resolve inner static, she thought, repeating the phrase like a mantra") and motivates the burn. However, the motivation is more declared than dramatized—we don't see her struggle between ignoring the static and confronting it, or face a cost in choosing confrontation. The orb's dissolution provides a resolution beat, but the choice to reach out lacks visible friction or foreclosed alternative. Meets setup, middle, and closure gates with clear causal link, but the want is told rather than tested under competing pressures. Solid functional presence without deep conflict.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The tone aims for fragmented wholeness: optics flicker, joints creak, yet Clara-7 achieves balance. Diction modulates between technical (plasma torch, electromagnetic field) and lyric (bioluminescent threads, "strangely organic"). The final image of brighter roses and static-as-song attempts coherent resolution of fragmentation. However, the tone occasionally drifts into thesis statement ("not perfect... but fragmented wholeness") rather than trusting image and rhythm to convey it. The piece teaches the tone early and sustains it through turns, charging the final bloom. Modulation under pressure is present but sometimes over-articulated, preventing higher-band entry.</comment>
