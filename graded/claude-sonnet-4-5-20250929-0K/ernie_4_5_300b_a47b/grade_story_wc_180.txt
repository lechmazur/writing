<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Lira's motivation to persist and mend is stated clearly but her interior contradictions remain abstract. The hair ribbon is handled repeatedly, yet her micro-choices under pressure feel pre-determined rather than forced by conflicting impulses acting simultaneously. The "feisty" trait is asserted ("You're endearingly feisty") but never dramatized through a specific trade-off or mistake that compounds. Mara exists only in reflection and summary, flattening the relational crucible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive clearly in the opening paragraph. The breach provides backstory context, but the present-tense climb and mending sequence feels more like a demonstration than a causal chain with narrowing options. The quartz-eye repair succeeds without meaningful resistance, and the orchard's blooming response reads as reward rather than a reversal or deepening that changes Lira's tactics. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis: she has stayed and will continue), but the cost—years of persistence—is told rather than dramatized in this single scene's choices.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The orchard-in-rafters setting is vivid and signals early, but it functions primarily as atmosphere rather than constraining Lira's choices. The quartz eye, copper wire, and liquid starlight are handled concretely in the repair beat, which charges the moment. However, the spatial choreography of the climb and the cathedral's dimensions remain vague, and the orchard's transformation at the end does not alter her tactics or impose a fresh obstacle.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—keeping the orchard alive—is signaled early, but no on-page reversal tests it. Lira finds the cracked eye, mends it without complication, and the orchard blooms in response; success arrives without a tightening that forecloses an option or forces a trade-off. The breach of contract is backstory; within this scene, no escalation or deepening occurs. The micro turn (catching the ribbon mid-air) is gestural and does not narrow options or change knowledge under pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Theme of persistence and using forgotten things emerges from events, but the ending summarizes ("She'd mended more than quartz. She'd mended a promise, a legacy, a way forward") rather than offering a resonant image that reweights prior material. The deciduous-vow concept is mentioned twice but remains a label without dramatized friction between adaptation and cost. No counter-reading is invited; the piece affirms its premise without complication.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Lira's perceptual signature—humming, tucking the ribbon, noting the squirrels—offers texture, but diction drifts into elevated abstractions ("bridge generational wisdom," "accidental wisdom") that sit awkwardly against the concrete repair work. The single line of dialogue from Mara feels inserted to assert a trait rather than pursuing a goal. POV remains stable, though the final paragraphs shift into summary that distances the reader from Lira's embodied experience.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and clarity is generally high, but the piece loops conceptually: "mend not just quartz eyes but the fractures between past and present" is echoed by "She'd mended more than quartz. She'd mended a promise, a legacy, a way forward." Template cadence appears in the final third ("She'd done it. She'd mended..." / "And she'd done it using..."). No figurative muddle, but the closing paragraphs stack summary statements that flatten momentum rather than propelling through image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The orchard-in-rafters setup offers a striking visual, but the core arc—solitary artisan persists in abandoned place, mends object, finds renewal—follows a familiar template without transformation. The quartz-eye mechanic and liquid starlight suggest a secondary-world setting, yet the emotional beats (mother's love, perseverance, legacy) are generic. No risk or complication upends the premise; the story executes its concept without surprising itself.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Present throughout; Lira climbs, unwraps, heats wire, seals the crack. Her role as mender frames the scene but her choices do not create a meaningful turn—she encounters no obstacle during the repair that forces a tactical shift or trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The hair ribbon is knotted on her wrist in the opening, flutters in the breeze mid-scene, slips and is caught, then tucked into her pocket with a plan to weave it into the next eye. Three beats with evolving handling, but it does not constrain a choice or visibly alter the outcome; it charges the emotional tone without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>Mentioned twice: once in the opening paragraph as backstory motivation and once mid-scene ("The deciduous vows—vows that changed with the seasons..."). It remains a thematic label rather than a rule or constraint that shapes on-page tactics or creates friction in Lira's choices.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Asserted in dialogue ("You're endearingly feisty") and summary ("Feisty, yes. Endearing? Maybe to Mara"). No on-page action demonstrates the trait with cost or enables a specific tactic; it exists as characterization summary.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Persistence is the story's spine: Lira stayed after the breach, climbs again, mends the eye, will climb tomorrow. The action recurs across beats and defines the closure's Earned Stasis. However, within this single scene, persistence is demonstrated rather than tested; no moment forces her to choose to persist against a live obstacle.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The rusted key, copper wire, and liquid starlight are listed early as "forgotten bag contents." The wire and starlight are used concretely in the mending beat. However, the key is never touched again, and the method does not shape a prior attempt or create a complication that the protagonist must overcome; it appears as the solution without prior struggle.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The orchard-in-rafters is signaled in the opening line and provides vivid spatial texture (highest branch, moss nest, fallen fruit). The setting supplies the quartz eye and the trees bloom in response to the repair, participating in the closure image. However, it does not impose a meaningful constraint or force a tactical adjustment during the climb or repair.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The breach is backstory context; within this scene, no ticking clock or temporal pressure tightens Lira's decisions. The phrase "after the breach" anchors the premise but does not create urgency or alter her tactics on the page.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Stated early ("bridge generational wisdom—her daughter's laughter, her own stubbornness, the cathedral's silent grief") and repeated near the end. The motivation frames her persistence and the ribbon's symbolic role, but no on-page friction tests it—no moment where bridging wisdom costs her another goal or forces a renunciation.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The phrase "accidental wisdom" appears twice (once mid-scene, once near the end). Tone remains steady and gently affirming throughout; no tonal modulation under pressure or charged shift at the closure. The "accidental" quality is asserted rather than dramatized through unexpected discovery or cost.</comment>
