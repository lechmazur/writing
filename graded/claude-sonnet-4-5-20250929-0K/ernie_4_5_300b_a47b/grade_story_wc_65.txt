<question>1</question>
<grade>5.8</grade>
<comment>Lira's obsession with mapping possibility is established through backstory and labeled repeatedly ("To dive is to know," "Data without imagination is a corpse"), but her moment-to-moment choices lack internal contradiction or embodied struggle. The predictive modeling work is summarized rather than dramatized in micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. The Elders' dismissal arrives as static opposition without forcing a visible tradeoff, and the final smile after the thaw reads as satisfaction without renunciation or visible cost that forecloses a path. Emotional progression is clean and ascending without the contradictory impulses required for high-band entry.</comment>

<comment>The piece anchors who/where/when early and tracks a single continuous project from blank page to thaw. Closure lands as a Decisive Change (the ice breaks, the village adapts), but the cost is collective and environmental rather than personal; Lira's final act is to smile and burn journals—a symbolic gesture without visible forfeiture of a live option. The lens reads Causal (predictive modeling → thaw), yet the pivotal beat (equinox observation) happens off-page in a "weeks passed" summary, weakening the because/therefore chain at the moment of highest stakes. One meaningful tightening is present but the cost is diffuse.</comment>

<grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>The obsidian spire, frozen lake, and kingfisher quill are vividly rendered with specific sensory detail (iron-rich ink, iridescent blue, ice groaning like ancient bones). The spire's thermal shifts and the lake's freeze cycles are tracked as data sources, lending purposeful atmosphere. However, the environment does not constrain a key choice—Lira's work proceeds indoors at her desk, and the lake's thaw is observed rather than navigated. The quill nib dulls and splinters but this change does not alter her tactics or charge the final image, capping the setting's role as backdrop rather than pressure.</comment>

<grade>6.2</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—proving the thaw and vindicating predictive modeling—is signaled early and sustained. Escalation occurs through the Elders' derision and the equinox test, but the reversal (ice cracks) is observational rather than driven by Lira's on-page agency at that beat. The "weeks passed" summary compresses the labor that should dramatize her persistence under mounting doubt. Cost is implied (cramped hands, bloodshot eyes) but remains atmospheric; no live option is visibly foreclosed in the resolution. The agency test for high-band entry is not met.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>6.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of possibility within constraint emerges through Lira's modeling and the repeated claim "innovation thrives in constraint, not in freedom." The kingfisher's dive and the quill's splintering offer symbolic recurrence, but the piece leans on abstract statements ("The future is not written, but it can be sketched") rather than letting the final image speak. The thaw serves as literal validation rather than a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. Burning the journals gestures toward release but does not reweight prior material with ambiguity or cost.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>6.3</grade>
<comment>Lira's third-person limited POV is stable, and the narrative voice carries a consistent lyric-fantasy register (e.g., "a monument to the past's tyranny"). Dialogue is minimal but functional when present. However, diction occasionally drifts into expository abstraction ("alchemy of data and intuition," "groundedly imaginative approach") that feels authorial rather than character-bound. The spire-as-clock metaphor and the repeated philosophical asides ("Data without imagination is a corpse") read as thematic signposts rather than urgent thought under pressure. Perceptual signature is present but somewhat generic.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>6.0</grade>
<comment>Sentence variety and rhythm are generally controlled, with some vivid images (kingfisher diving, spiderwebbing ice). However, multiple beats recycle abstract phrasing: "groundedly imaginative," "seed innovation within constraint," "celestial ledger." The "weeks passed" summary compresses the climactic labor without propulsion, and the final paragraph's declarative tone ("Its job was done," "She smiled") flattens the closure beat. Minor template cadence appears in the list-like exposition of Lira's methods. Information density is moderate but paragraphs sometimes restate rather than advance.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>5.4</grade>
<comment>The Ignorance Cartographer title and predictive-modeling frame offer a fresh angle on prophecy, and the kingfisher quill's origin is specific. However, the core arc—skeptical innovator vindicated by nature's shift—follows a familiar template, and the story does not transform it through moral ambiguity or unexpected cost. The Elders are stock antagonists, and the thaw's arrival is straightforward wish-fulfillment. Lira's methods are described but not dramatized in unique tactical choices that reveal her worldview under pressure. The synthesis feels competent but not inevitable in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question>
<grade>4.8</grade>
<comment>Lira is present throughout and her project drives the narrative, but her key turn (writing the prediction) happens in summary and the climax (observing the thaw) is passive. Her decision to burn journals is late and symbolic rather than causal. Present and functional but replaceable with a more active protagonist.</comment>

<question>9 B</question>
<grade>5.2</grade>
<comment>The quill appears early (setup), is used to write the future (middle beat), and is noted as "splintered" at the end (closure participation). However, its use is largely static description; the dulling and splintering do not alter Lira's tactics or choices on the page. The backstory of tracking the kingfisher adds specificity but the quill's properties do not constrain action.</comment>

<question>9 C</question>
<grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>"Writing the future" frames the entire project and shapes Lira's stake: her written prediction must match the thaw. It appears early, drives the middle labor (weeks of modeling), and is validated at closure. The concept is causal but somewhat abstract—removing it would require only minor reframing to "testing a prediction." It shapes but does not uniquely define the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 D</question>
<grade>3.6</grade>
<comment>"Groundedly imaginative" is introduced as a label in paragraph five and repeated as "groundedly imaginative approach" in paragraph seven, but it does not constrain or enable a specific on-page choice. It describes Lira's method in the abstract without visible tradeoff or tactical friction. The concept is present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question>
<grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>"Prevail" shapes the ending (Lira's model is proven correct, the villagers and Elders witness the thaw) and is signaled early through the Elders' opposition. The thaw is the major turn. However, the action is passive observation rather than active struggle at the closure beat. Removing "prevail" for "attempt" or "test" would require minimal edits. Essential to the ending but somewhat generic.</comment>

<question>9 F</question>
<grade>5.9</grade>
<comment>Predictive modeling is named early, detailed through cataloging freeze cycles and star positions, and validated by the thaw. It appears in setup, middle (cross-referencing data), and payoff (forecast met). However, the mechanics are summarized rather than dramatized in tactical choices—we are told she adjusts models but do not see a specific recalibration that narrows options. Functional across beats but could be swapped for "study" or "calculation" with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 G</question>
<grade>4.2</grade>
<comment>The obsidian spire and frozen lake are vividly described in the opening and provide the data Lira tracks (thermal shifts, freeze cycles). However, the setting does not constrain her choices—her work occurs indoors at a desk, and the lake is observed rather than navigated. The spire's "trapped heat" is mentioned as part of her prediction but does not alter tactics. Present and atmospheric but does not pressure the protagonist.</comment>

<question>9 H</question>
<grade>2.1</grade>
<comment>The title timeframe "before the pen meets the blank page" is contradicted immediately: the story opens with Lira kneeling before her desk, unscrewing the inkwell, and then writing. The quill meets the page in paragraph five ("The quill nib scraped the parchment"). The timeframe is ornamental and does not govern the narrative clock or tighten decisions.</comment>

<question>9 I</question>
<grade>5.7</grade>
<comment>"To seed innovation within a constraint" is stated in paragraph four and shapes Lira's thesis that "innovation thrives in constraint." It drives her project across beats (choosing the frozen setting, refusing to "outthink winter"). However, the motivation is told more than dramatized in conflicted choices; we do not see her sacrifice freedom for constraint in a visible tradeoff. Functional but abstract.</comment>

<question>9 J</question>
<grade>5.5</grade>
<comment>The tone is lyric-mythic throughout (e.g., "shadow of the obsidian spire," "monument to the past's tyranny") and modulates slightly at the climax (gasps, groans, children tossing stones). It coheres across turns and supports the transformation theme. However, the final image (smiling, burning journals) does not charge or reweight the tone; it maintains the same declarative register. Coherent but static, not elevated by the ending.</comment>
