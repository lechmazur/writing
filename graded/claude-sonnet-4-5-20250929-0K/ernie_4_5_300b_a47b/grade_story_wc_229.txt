<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to prove whispers over shouts is dramatized through concrete action (humming, exhaling intent), and her fear/uncertainty is embodied in trembling hands and tears. The backstory about her parents' grief versus rage is efficiently conveyed and tilts her present choice. However, Thalos's sudden shift from threatening "what in the name of the tides" to grinning mentor feels unmotivated, and the fisherman/wife reaction at the end lacks specificity—we see them pause and feel warmth, but no distinct cost or trade-off emerges from their response.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece anchors who/where/when efficiently (Elara, lighthouse, dawn post-heatwave) and delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara's whispered intent reaches the village, proving her theory with felt emotional cost (tears, vulnerability). The lens is Accumulative/Textural—scent, hum, and vibration build density until the final image reweights the premise. One meaningful tightening occurs when Thalos validates her method, narrowing her isolation into shared knowledge. The fisherman/wife beat offers closure participation, but the cost remains atmospheric rather than a visible forfeiture or decision that alters their options on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The cobalt lighthouse, salt-streaked and dawn-lit, anchors the scene vividly. The vial cork on the windowsill and Thalos's rooftop garden supply tactile, scent-driven micro-settings that constrain Elara's ritual. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (damp stone, oil, lavender, jasmine), and the garden's night-blooming jasmine directly shapes Thalos's lesson. Spatial choreography is clear throughout. The lighthouse itself does not constrain a choice as directly as the garden does, keeping this shy of the 8+ band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—proving whispers travel farther than shouts—is signaled early and tested on the page. Elara's humming and exhalation create one meaningful tightening when the cork glows and the sea churns, narrowing her doubt into action. Thalos's validation adds a micro turn that deepens rather than reverses. The fisherman/wife pause registers the outcome but does not escalate further or present a visible trade-off. No persistent constraint (time, stamina, social cost) shapes tactics after the initial attempt, and the ending delivers proof without a felt price paid by Elara—her tears mix with rain, but no path is foreclosed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from Elara's humming ritual and the contrast between shout and whisper, embodied in the vial cork's glow and the garden's teaching. The final line—"The proof was in the silence"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without stating a moral. Thalos's "intent isn't loud. It's a current, not a wave" deepens the premise without becoming a thesis statement. The story resists easy binaries, leaving the fisherman/wife response ambiguous (warmth, pressure, but no spoken consequence). Minor thematic echo in Thalos's "flowers know things we don't" trends toward abstraction but stays grounded in jasmine's scent.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Single POV, third-person limited, with stable distance and a distinct perceptual signature: Elara notices scent (lavender, moonflower, salt, jasmine) and vibration, filtering the world through her herbalist lens. Dialogue is minimal but purposeful—Thalos's "Girl, what in the name of the tides" and his lesson on vibrations advance plot and reveal his character. Diction remains consistent (oilskin, cot, fisherman, nets), though "vibrations of intent" risks abstraction in peak beats. No head-hopping; free indirect style is clean. Under stress, Elara's interior compresses appropriately ("I'm sorry. I'm afraid. I love you").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and propulsion is generally strong. However, the phrase "vibrations of intent" recurs five times without evolving meaning, creating a minor loop. "The scent of the garden, the salt of the sea, the ache in her chest" stacks parallel constructions in a peak beat, trending toward list-like cadence. "A silent scream of tenderness" mixes metaphors (scream vs. tenderness; silent vs. scream). "The air hung thick with the promise of rain" and "dawn bled gold" are vivid but slightly stock. Information density is high; no scaffolding or paraphrase loops elsewhere. Proofreading is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The premise—proving whispers travel farther than shouts via scent-lured vibrations—synthesizes herbalism, lighthouse solitude, and emotional resonance in a specific way. The vial cork and night-garden scent are particular, not generic. However, the fisherman/wife closure beat echoes familiar "ripple reaches distant hearts" tropes without a fresh consequence, and the "intent as vibration" conceit borders on New Age template without full transformation. Thalos's sudden mentor role and the glowing cork trend toward convenience. The emotional truth in Elara's unspoken words ("I'm sorry. I'm afraid. I love you") anchors the piece, but the final image does not surprise in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara (assistant lighthouse keeper) makes the key choices: stealing the vial cork, climbing to the lantern room, humming, and exhaling intent. Her agency drives the escalation and the closure—her tears and smile in the rain crystallize her proof. She is present in all three integration gates (setup, middle hum/glow, ending tears) and her choices narrow options on the page.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The vial cork appears in three beats: Elara clutches it at dawn, places it on the windowsill, and watches it glow. Thalos taps it during his lesson, and it glows steady at the end. Its purifying property is claimed but not tested with visible cost—it glows when Elara exhales, but we see no moment where the cork fails or where Elara must trade something to make it work. The cork is present across beats and charges the final image, but its mechanics remain decorative (glowing = success) rather than constraining a choice.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Vibrations of intent" is named repeatedly and shapes Elara's tactic: she hums at a practiced frequency, exhales unspoken words, and imagines the sound rippling outward. Thalos validates the concept ("intent isn't loud. It's a current"), and the fisherman/wife feel "a pressure behind their eyes." The concept structures the escalation and is present at closure. However, it is articulated more than dramatized—no scene shows Elara learning the frequency or failing with a shout first. The concept enables the ritual but does not constrain it with a visible trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The vial cork is "said to purify intentions when exposed to the vibrations of intent," but this attribute is claimed in backstory and never tested on the page. Elara uses the cork as a vessel for her breath, and it glows, but we do not see impure intent fail or a moment where purification costs her something. The attribute is ornamental; the story would function identically if the cork were simply a conduit. Introduced early but not causally active.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Beckon" is enacted twice: Elara "learned to beckon the unseen with such scents" and later exhales into the vial to beckon her whispers outward. The beckoning is the method that drives the ritual's success, and the fisherman/wife pause is the result. The action is central to escalation and closure, though the beckoning itself is not shown to fail or require a trade-off first. Present in setup, middle, and ending, and integral to the premise.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"The scent of a garden at night" (lavender, moonflower, sweat; later jasmine) is Elara's method for luring vibrations. She concocts the perfume, carries it into the chamber, and Thalos reinforces it with his rooftop garden and jasmine lesson. The scent method is signaled early, shapes Elara's tactics (humming + scent = beckoning), and is present in the final beat when she merges scent with her hum. The mechanics are taught and paid off, though the scent does not impose a cost—it simply works. Strong integration across all three gates.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The cobalt lighthouse at dawn anchors the story's geography and timing. The lantern room windowsill holds the vial cork, and the tower's eastern wall houses Thalos's garden, which supplies the jasmine that teaches Elara. The lighthouse setting is vividly described and participates in the ritual (dawn light kisses the cork). However, the lighthouse itself does not constrain Elara's choice—she could perform the ritual elsewhere. The setting provides atmosphere and a plausible space for the garden, but it is not indispensable to the story logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"After the heat wave broke" situates the story temporally and creates atmospheric tension (rain coming, storm ghost on the horizon). However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions—Elara's ritual is not racing a clock, and the broken heat wave does not alter her options on the page. The dawn timing matters for the light that kisses the cork, but "after the heat wave" is scenic rather than causal. Mentioned in the opening but not developed or paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elara's motivation—to prove whispers travel farther than shouts—is established early ("a mad urge," rooted in her mother's quiet grief versus her father's rage) and dramatized through her humming ritual and tears. The proof arrives on the page when the fisherman/wife feel her intent. The motivation is tested under pressure (Thalos interrupts, she braces for a lecture) and validated at closure. Friction exists between her fear and her desire to be heard, and the cost is emotional vulnerability (tears, sweat in the perfume). Strong integration across all three gates.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Screaming tenderness" is enacted in Elara's paradoxical ritual: a "silent scream of tenderness," her breath laced with unspoken love and fear, the hum that carries vulnerability. The tone is coherent—quiet intensity, yearning, and validation—and it modulates from Elara's isolation to Thalos's warmth to the fisherman/wife's pause. However, the phrase "silent scream of tenderness" is stated rather than fully embodied, and the fisherman/wife reaction (warmth, pressure) is softer than "screaming" implies. The tone charges the final image (tears, rain, proof in silence) but does not fully resolve the scream/tenderness paradox with sharp cost.</comment>
