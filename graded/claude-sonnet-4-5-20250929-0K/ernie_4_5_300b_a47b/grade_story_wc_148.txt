<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elias's interior is often label-heavy ("throat tightened," "breath hitched") without embodied particulars. The father's ghost and the doppelgänger appear as plot devices rather than pressures that force Elias into contradictory impulses; his final decision to "write" feels declared rather than earned through prior micro-choices with visible cost. The lattice functions as a magic wand that sustains him without constraining his agency or revealing a hierarchy of values through trade-offs.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: copperlight, lattice blooms, and recursive imagery build toward the ending. Closure attempts Charged Poise ("I'm writing" stance, hovering above stones, father watching), but the cost is asserted rather than dramatically legible—Elias's renunciation or endurance forecloses no live option on the page. The bodies-to-be-found frame is set up early but never tightens his present choices; it remains atmospheric rather than a pressure that narrows tactics. Orientation is clear by ~80 words (Elias, lighthouse prison, reef).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The lighthouse prison off a jagged reef, the lattice's ironwork, and the copperlight repose provide vivid sensory anchors filtered through Elias's perspective. The labyrinth's shifting stones and confessional lattices create a micro-setting that charges the ending image. However, spatial choreography blurs when Elias "hovers" and the walls dissolve; the reef's jagged maw is described but never constrains a choice or alters tactics in the present scene.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: Elias must "thread a labyrinth with his own story" to differentiate himself from his father's lies. One meaningful turn occurs when the doppelgänger reveals the lattice as pen and labyrinth as page, reframing Elias's task. Yet the escalation is conceptual rather than narrowing live options—Elias encounters no visible trade-off or loss that alters his tactics. The ending stance ("I'm writing") crystallizes his intent but forecloses no path with on-page cost; the hush remains a prelude without consequence paid in scene.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the lattice/pen metaphor and the contrast between the father's lies and Elias's truth-writing, avoiding overt moralizing. The copperlight repose and the scuffs-as-map recur purposefully. However, the final image offers symbolic resonance ("hovering…letting copperlight repose wash over him") without a non-literal answer that reweights prior material with conceptual cost; Elias's self-discovery is asserted rather than earned through specific experience that contradicts or complicates the premise.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV remains stable; psychic distance is controlled, and the prose carries a distinct lyric register ("skeleton of stone and regret," "sound like shattering glass"). Diction occasionally drifts into elevated metaphor during peak beats ("bloom, vines of light"), but the voice stays character-particular. The ghost's dialogue and the doppelgänger's voice are thinly distinguished from Elias's interior cadence; both speak in similar cryptic fragments ("You're chasing hush," "Just keep chasing the hush").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Overwriting clusters in high-pressure beats: "a swirl of brine and regret," "mosaic of memory and myth," "sound like wind through a keyhole." Several paraphrase loops appear ("he'd already found himself" echoes the prior self-discovery claim; "thread a labyrinth" recurs without added pressure). Template cadence is visible in action chains: "He traced…wondered…stepped…clutched…said." The final third is thick with figurative language that slows momentum rather than sharpening the closure image. Minor pronoun ambiguity when the figure and Elias face each other.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The lattice-as-pen and labyrinth-as-page conceit offers a fresh angle on the inherited-guilt premise. The doppelgänger with mismatched eyes and the copperlight repose are specific, non-generic choices. However, the "boy who cried wolf's son seeks redemption" frame is a widely used template, and the transformation relies on symbolic layering rather than lived tactical detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The ending's self-discovery arc feels abstractly poetic rather than rooted in a choice that could not have occurred without these exact prior events.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Elias is identified as the "boy who cried wolf's son" in the opening line and the father's legacy of lies frames his motivation. However, Elias makes no on-page decision that turns on his inherited reputation; the "cry wolf" attribute remains thematic rather than a constraint that alters his tactics or forecloses a path. Present in setup and closure framing, but swappable with "son of a liar" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The lattice appears in setup (traced from confessional, ironwork twisted), mid-story (rattles, hums, blooms with vines of light, functions as pen), and ending (placed beside father's lattice, grows heavy, settles into bones). It enables Elias's hover and threads the labyrinth. Causal role across three beats and charged at closure. Deduct for late rule reveal (lattice-as-pen is disclosed by the doppelgänger rather than discovered through Elias's use) and some ornamental description ("edges biting into his palm").</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Chasing hush" is named in the opening and repeated by the ghost and in narration. It frames Elias's goal as seeking "that quiet before the storm, before they found the bodies." However, the concept remains metaphorical; on the page, Elias pursues the labyrinth's heart and writes his story without tactical pressure from the hush itself. The hush does not narrow his options or change his tactics; it is a thematic echo rather than a stake that alters scene choices.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Sustains impossibilities" is tied to the lattice's magic: Elias hovers above the floor and threads the labyrinth. The attribute enables the hover action and the final stance. However, it is not presented with a visible trade-off or cost—Elias's impossible levitation never drains him, forces a choice, or limits another ability. The trait functions as a convenience power rather than a constraint that pressures decisions. Present across beats but swappable with generic "magic grants flight."</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Hover" appears in three beats: Elias hovers feet above floor mid-labyrinth, soars toward the heart, and at the ending hovers above stones at the lighthouse peak. The action is specific and recurs with reweighted meaning (physical levitation → metaphorical ascent over inherited guilt). However, it is enabled by the lattice's magic without cost or constraint; removing "hover" and substituting "walk" or "climb" would require only minor phrasing changes. The action charges the final image but does not redefine live options in the middle beats.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>The "scuffs on a narrow door left ajar for decades" appear in the opening description and again as "a map left by time" that guides the labyrinth's shifting stones. The method is poetic but mechanically vague—Elias does not trace or interpret the scuffs in scene; the walls simply rearrange. The scuffs do not shape his attempts or constrain his choices; they are mentioned setup and metaphorically referenced once, then absent from closure. Ornamental rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The lighthouse prison off a jagged reef is established in the opening and returns at closure when Elias climbs to the peak and looks out at the sea. The reef's "jagged maw" is described vividly, and the prison's narrow door, confessional lattices, and spiral stairs supply the physical space. The setting provides atmosphere and a charged final image but does not pressure Elias's choices in the middle beats—he moves through the labyrinth without the reef's danger altering his tactics. Present setup and closure; atmospheric rather than constraint-driven.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Before they find the bodies" is named in the opening and closing paragraphs, framing the story's window. The timeframe creates a conceptual boundary but never tightens Elias's present decisions—no on-page moment shows the clock running out or bodies about to be discovered. Elias's final realization ("Before they found the bodies, he'd already found himself") reweights the frame thematically but does not demonstrate that the impending discovery altered his tactics. Conceptual rather than tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"To thread a labyrinth with your own story" is stated in the opening and dramatized when the doppelgänger reveals the lattice as pen and labyrinth as page. Elias's desire to differentiate his story from his father's lies drives the journey and the ending stance ("I'm not running. I'm writing"). The motivation is conflicted (father's ghost challenges him, Elias admits "I don't know the ending") and shapes two key beats. However, the final choice lacks a visible cost—Elias's writing act forecloses no live alternative on the page. Present across setup, middle, and closure; causal but not fully charged with trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Copperlight repose" appears in five beats: thick copperlight air, intensified copperlight painting shadow, copperlight dimming to silver, and the ending's "copperlight repose wash over him." The tone is coherent and lyric, modulating from thick/intense to soft/restorative. It charges the final image and creates a distinct texture. However, the tone remains a static atmospheric layer rather than one that shifts under pressure—Elias's emotional arc does not bend the copperlight's quality. Consistent and closure-linked, but not dynamically responsive to stakes.</comment>
