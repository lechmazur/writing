<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lira's motivation—to honor overlooked histories—is declared rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. The weaver appears only to dispense exposition; their exchange lacks genuine pressure or status friction. Interior life relies on stock phrasing: "chest tightened," "comfort, a reminder," "thought half-formed." The final choice to retrieve the fragment arrives without visible cost or a decision that forecloses an alternative path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors arrive promptly (alchemist's market, Lira, translator role). The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens through atmospheric layering, but the closure—Lira carrying the fragment and reflecting on translation—offers no decisive change, visible cost, or reconfigured stance. The weaver's exposition ("This lens held the memory...") substitutes for on-page pressure. The ending summarizes theme rather than landing a resonant image that reweights prior material.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The market's silk stalls, iron lattices, and floating lanterns create vivid atmospheric texture. Sensory detail is plentiful but leans heavily visual; the mural's shifting crack offers one moment where setting constrains action. Spatial choreography remains clear across the climb and descent. The recurring lighthouse motif charges the final paragraph, though it does not alter a choice at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—retrieving the lens fragment—is signaled early but never encounters meaningful opposition or a trade-off. The fragment "demands intuition," yet Lira's method (tracing breath rhythm, palm scars) unfolds without friction or a narrowed choice. No visible cost accompanies the retrieval; the weaver's acceptance is frictionless. The piece deepens atmosphere but does not escalate pressure under the accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Theme—honoring overlooked histories, translation as connection—is articulated directly in the final paragraph rather than earned through scene particulars. The lighthouse and fragment recur but do not constrain choice or charge closure with undeniable cost. The weaver's line "Anchors of intuition aren't just for holding on. Sometimes, they're for letting go" reads as a thematic placeholder. The ending offers a stated moral instead of a resonant, non-literal answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>POV remains stable in third-limited. The prose carries a consistent elevated register—"tapestry of smoke," "between-worlds translator," "eternal instant"—that suits the fantastical frame. Perceptual signature is generic rather than character-particular; the weaver's voice does not distinguish from Lira's narration. Dialogue is minimal and expository. No head-hopping, but the voice lacks a singular idiom under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout ("tapestry of smoke," "anchors of intuition," "woven from translucent silk and iron lattices") without pattern-teaching or payoff at closure. Mixed metaphors appear: "fragments anchor memories" conflates spatial and conceptual vehicles. Template stems recur: "The market's X," "She [verb]," "The fragment X." Paraphrase loops in the final paragraph ("translation wasn't just about words—it was about seeing the threads") restate theme without advancing pressure. Information density is moderate; many lines carry atmosphere but do not propel.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The core premise—mystical market, translator seeking enchanted object, hidden clues in art—combines familiar fantasy elements without a non-obvious synthesis. The fragment retrieval follows a fetch-quest template: receive task, follow clues, retrieve object, return. Emotional specificity is low; the protagonist's internal life relies on stock phrasing. The lighthouse motif and "between worlds" framing are present but do not transform tropes through grounded choice or surprising inflection.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Lira appears throughout and retrieves the fragment, but her translator role does not shape tactics or create key turns. The title "between-worlds translator" functions as atmospheric flavor; parsing runes and drinking ink are mentioned but do not constrain her method. She observes, follows clues, and completes the task without a decision that alters options.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The lens fragment is introduced in paragraph two via the weaver's exposition, handled in paragraph four when Lira traces the mural and retrieves it, and carried in the final paragraph as a "comfort." It appears in setup, middle, and closure but does not constrain a choice or charge the final image with visible cost; its weight is metaphorical rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Anchors of intuition" is named in paragraph one and the weaver's dialogue ("Sometimes, they're for letting go") but does not shape on-page tactics. The concept remains abstract; Lira's method (tracing breath, palm scars) is not dramatized as intuitive pressure. The phrase reappears thematically at closure without altering options.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Elusively tangible" describes the fragment's visual quality in the tapestry ("as if it might dissolve if stared at too long") and again when retrieved ("edges sharp yet soft, like a thought half-formed"). The trait is atmospheric rather than mechanically constraining; it does not enable or prevent an action with cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Unfasten" is signaled in paragraph two ("unfasten one such fragment"), executed in paragraph four when Lira presses her hand to the crack, and the fragment "slipped free." The action appears in setup, middle, and closure. However, the mechanics are vague; the fragment yields without friction, making the action swappable with "retrieve" or "claim."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The method—hidden details in paintings—is signaled in paragraph two ("Paintings in the market's underbelly hold the method"), pursued in paragraph three (mural clues), and executed in paragraph four (tracing waves, star alignment). It drives one key beat but the mechanics ("the way the waves...mirrored the rhythm of her own breath") are told rather than dramatized with visible friction.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The alchemist's market is established in paragraph one, provides the stall and mural in the middle, and frames the departure in the final paragraph. The vertical staging (spiral staircase, highest platform, city lights below) creates spatial texture. The market does not pressure a choice; it functions as atmospheric backdrop rather than a constraint that alters tactics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"Between childhood and now" appears in paragraph four (Lira's memory of a lighthouse) and the final paragraph ("Between childhood and now, she'd learned..."). The timeframe is thematic rather than causal; it does not tighten decisions or create a live clock. The phrasing is lyric but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The motivation "to honor overlooked histories" is declared in the weaver's dialogue (paragraph two) and restated in the final paragraph. It frames Lira's task but is never tested by friction or a competing desire. The motivation is present and consistent but not dramatized through a choice with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The tone "eternal instant" is named in the final paragraph ("to anchor oneself in the eternal instant") and evoked through lyric phrasing ("every fragment, every detail, mattered"). The elevated, meditative register is consistent but does not modulate with pressure or charge the final image with a distinct cadence shift. The tone remains static rather than reweighting stakes at closure.</comment>
