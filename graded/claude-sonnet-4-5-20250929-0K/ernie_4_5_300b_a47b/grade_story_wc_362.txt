<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear—validation from her mentor—but her interior life relies heavily on abstract mystic framing ("commune with the earth," "read the silence") rather than embodied contradiction. The pivot from "prove objects absorb emotions" to "they mirror them" arrives as sudden insight without prior dramatized doubt or micro-choices showing her wrestling with evidence. The final laugh and peace feel unearned; no visible cost forecloses a path. Interiority leans on label-speak ("sickening lurch," "bitter and free") instead of contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening lines. The piece follows a single continuous scene with one POV and signals a causal lens: Mara's method (prism + frost) triggers the arbor's glow, then the frost shatters, forcing realization. However, the closure—"the quartz didn't absorb emotions, it mirrored them"—lands as told epiphany rather than a choice or image that forecloses options with visible cost. The prism is tucked away and Mara stands "at peace," but no on-page price reshapes her stance or tactics. Closure form reads as Conceptual Repricing, yet the conceptual cost remains abstract ("secrets safe") rather than undeniable.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The quartz arbor, mist, frost patterns, and car window anchor the scene with vivid sensory detail filtered through Mara's mystic lens. Spatial choreography is clear (arbor edge, car nearby, Mara moving between). The arbor's crystalline branches and amber pulse constrain Mara's method and charge the atmosphere. However, the setting does not meaningfully alter her final choice; she could reach the same realization in any reflective structure. The micro-setting (prism, frost) participates in beats but does not force the closure turn.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—proving her theory to validate herself against her mentor—is signaled early and sustained. Mara's method escalates pressure: prism glows, arbor pulses, frost shatters. Yet the shattering glass acts as external accident rather than a consequence of her prior choices, and her response is passive realization ("I need clarity" → epiphany) rather than a decision that forecloses a path. No visible cost alters her tactics; she tucks the prism away and finds peace. The stakes remain abstract throughout, never tested by a trade-off or loss on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Theme—projection versus absorption, the mirror of yearning—emerges through the prism and arbor imagery. The final realization attempts resonance: "The arbor's hush wasn't a mystery to solve, but a mirror to her own yearning." However, this lands as explicit meta-statement rather than arising from particulars, and the lesson is articulated rather than shown. The prism's shift from "tool for discovery" to "lens for distortion" has potential but is told, not dramatized. "Truthful lies" as tone feels imposed rather than organic to events.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV is stable; no head-hopping. Diction occasionally reaches for elevated mystic register ("attentive mystic," "shifted hush," "truthful lies") that feels imposed rather than organically character-specific. The prose modulates adequately under pressure (short bursts when the frost shatters), but Mara's perceptual signature lacks specificity—her observations could belong to any contemplative protagonist. Filter verbs ("she realized," "she felt") appear frequently in peak beats, dulling immediacy. No dialogue present. Free indirect thought is clean.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is adequate; no obvious loops or scaffold. However, several figurative phrases cluster without payoff: "crystalline branches piercing...like frozen lightning," "mist swirled, responding," "repository, a living archive." Mixed metaphor: "sponge" for emotions, then "seeping into stone" creates vehicle confusion. Stock mystic diction ("commune," "channeled," "talisman") recurs without fresh grounding. The line "The quartz didn't absorb emotions—it mirrored them" is clean exposition but lacks image charge. Propulsion is steady but not tight; beats could compress.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The mystic-seeks-proof frame is familiar; the twist (objects mirror rather than absorb) offers mild subversion but feels like a preset conceptual pivot rather than inevitable from prior particulars. "Attentive mystic," "firmly grounded," and "quartz arbor" gesture toward specificity without transforming the template. The frost-on-window method is vivid yet ornamental—swappable with any reflective surface. Proximity check: "mirror to her own yearning" echoes countless self-discovery arcs. No bold risk heightens stakes; the piece plays safely within mystic-quest conventions.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Mara is present throughout and her goal (prove the theory) frames all beats. She kneels, presses palm to frost, channels emotion into the prism, steps into the arbor, and tucks the prism away at the end. However, her choices do not create key turns—events happen to her (frost shatters, arbor pulses) and she reacts with realization. Her "attentive" quality is label-only; observation does not drive decisive action. Setup and closure participation present, but middle beats are reactive rather than agentic. Functional but replaceable arc.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The glass prism appears early (pocket clink, polished with intention), is used mid-scene (channels emotions, glows faintly), and returns at closure (tucked away, "cold in her hand"). Three distinct beats. The prism's shift from tool to "lens for distortion" reweights its meaning. However, the prism does not constrain a choice—Mara could reach her epiphany without it. Its glow and the final coldness are described but do not alter tactics. Strong setup and reprise; moderate causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Shifted hush" is named early ("a shifted hush hung in the air") and returns at closure ("The arbor's hush wasn't a mystery to solve"). Present in setup and payoff. However, it functions as atmospheric label rather than shaping stakes or tactics—Mara's actions would proceed identically if the air were simply "still" or "quiet." The concept is ornamental, not causal. Lyric reprise without middle development or pressure contribution.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Firmly grounded" is stated early ("Mara had always been firmly grounded") but remains abstract. No on-page action demonstrates this trait constraining or enabling a choice. The narrative tells us her connection is "steady as the roots beneath her," yet she floats into mystic visions without friction. Label-only; no visible tradeoff or cost tied to groundedness. Setup present, no middle or closure work.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Commune" appears in the opening ("come here for years to commune with the earth") and frames her project. She kneels before the arbor, presses palm to frost, channels emotions—all gestures of communion. However, the major turn (frost shattering, realization) does not trace causally to communion; it happens when she projects onto the quartz. The action is thematic backdrop rather than driver of escalation. Present across beats but not indispensable; "observe" or "meditate" could substitute with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The frost patterns on the car window are signaled early, occupy the middle beat (Mara traces veins, sees images), and precipitate the turn (frost shatters). The method matters: she reads emotion through frost's fractals. However, the mechanics are vague—why does tracing frost cause the arbor to pulse or the glass to shatter? The method enables vision but does not constrain tactics or shape the final realization in a specific way. Two-gate presence (middle and turn); causal role moderate.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The quartz arbor anchors every beat: Mara kneels before it, the mist responds, the arbor pulses amber, she steps inside, and it remains at closure. The arbor's quartz walls reflect memory and provide the "living archive" that reframes Mara's theory. Its structure enables her method and its "silent sentinel" image charges the ending. Three gates; strong causal and closure linkage. The arbor is indispensable—story logic would collapse without this exact setting. Irreplaceability and beat involvement justify high score.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"When assumptions shatter" is the framing timeframe; it names the moment of realization. The literal shattering of frost coincides with Mara's conceptual shift. Present in setup (expectations set) and payoff (assumptions literally and figuratively break). However, time does not tighten decisions or create urgency—no clock pressures her. The timeframe is thematic rather than tactical. Two-gate lyric reprise; moderate resonance but no pressure contribution.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Mara's desire "to prove that objects absorb emotions" is stated early, drives her method (prism + arbor test), and is overturned at closure ("the quartz didn't absorb emotions—it mirrored them"). The motivation is present in all three gates. However, the friction between wanting proof and confronting contrary evidence is told rather than dramatized through on-page micro-choices. She declares "I need clarity," then receives it via epiphany. The motivation frames stakes but does not force a choice with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Truthful lies" as tone is named once ("The truthful lies of her method surfaced") but never dramatized. The phrase gestures toward paradox—her projection creates false results—yet the prose does not embody contradictory truth/falsehood in voice or image. Tone remains earnest mystic-quest throughout; no ironic tension or modulation charges the final image. Label-only; setup mention without middle or closure resonance. Forced thematic tag.</comment>
