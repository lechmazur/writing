<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lira's obsession with the yearning algorithm and the bell is established early, but her interior life leans heavily on label-only descriptors ("steadily curious," "irreverent awe") rather than embodied contradictions acting in scene. The climactic dive and arrow-throw feel more conceptual than character-earned; we don't see her wrestle with genuine doubt or cost that would foreclose an alternate path. Minor positive: her "gears with feet" dismissal and whooping ascent carry distinct voice texture.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: kaleidoscope images layer until the final hum reweights the quest. Closure lands on the page (the bell hums, the algorithm works), but the cost is asserted rather than felt—no visible price paid or path foreclosed in the ending beat. The workshop-to-tower leap compresses causality; the tower's sudden appearance and the arrow's transformation into "conductor's baton" arrive without prior setup, weakening the because/therefore chain at the climax.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The acid sea, floating workshop, and sulfurous wind are vivid and consistent; the gears-and-cogs setting anchors early and the *Skein*'s braces/sails function as tools that Lira adjusts under pressure. The kaleidoscope's projections onto mist and the bell tower rising from the sea charge the final image with sensory particularity. Micro-deduction: spatial choreography at the climax (dive trajectory, tower distance) remains abstract, but the overall setting constrains and enables Lira's choices throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (ring the unheard bell) is signaled early and pressure accumulates through the kaleidoscope sequence. One meaningful tightening occurs when Lira aligns the arrow tip with the glass, causing the workshop to shudder and unlocking the glider's surge. However, the final dive and collision feel more like execution of a revealed path than a choice under conflicting pressure; no visible trade-off or loss alters her tactics in the ending beat, and the bell's appearance is coincidental rather than earned by prior agency.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The yearning-algorithm-as-dance and "seen, not solved" idea threads through action, avoiding overt thesis statements. The final hum rather than ring offers a non-literal answer that reweights the quest. Weakness: Old Thrum's ghost chuckling in the closing line edges toward nudge-wink commentary that slightly deflates the resonance, and the algorithm's conceptual cost (what Lira gave up to achieve this) remains unspoken, limiting thematic charge.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Voice is vivid and consistent—Lira's "gears with feet" jab, her muttered self-talk, and the kinetic diction ("whooped," "slammed," "transliterated wildly") maintain a distinct perceptual signature under pressure. Dialog (Old Thrum's rasped riddle, Lira's hissed "No") feels natural and goal-driven. Minor slip: the final sentence's past-tense omniscient aside ("And somewhere, Old Thrum's ghost chuckled") shifts out of Lira's tight focalization without clear purpose, loosening psychic distance at the closure beat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is high in the kaleidoscope sequence; sensory detail (acid mist, clacking gears, prismatic sky) propels rather than stalls. Template-cadence issue: multiple beats open with "The [noun]" or "She [verb]" stems in rapid succession, creating mechanical rhythm in the middle third. Figurative language ("metronome to her restlessness," "collision of gears and light") reads vivid but occasionally stacks without deepening the image. No major loops or scaffolding detected; clarity remains high.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The yearning-algorithm premise and kaleidoscope-as-translator mechanics offer a fresh synthesis, and the acid-sea workshop setting particularizes the fantastical frame. Risk: the irreverent tone and lyric compression in the climax elevate ambition. Weakness: the "ring a bell no one hears yet" stakes and Old Thrum's riddle echo mentor-quest tropes without full transformation; the final hum resolves as told rather than shown with conceptual surprise, and the tower's arrival feels convenient rather than inevitable in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Lira's title appears early and her glider adjustments anchor the opening; her decision to mount the *Skein* and dive constitutes one key turn. Middle development is thin—most of her pioneering work is backstory rather than on-page problem-solving. Closure participation: she executes the dive, but the choice feels more like following a revealed map than a forked decision under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Arrow tip seeded in paragraph two; handled multiple times (traced with stylus, pressed to kaleidoscope glass, strapped as "conductor's baton," hurled into bell). Its spirals align the kaleidoscope patterns, unlocking the workshop shudder—clear causal pressure. Closure linkage strong: the tip embeds in the bell and produces the hum. Slight deduction: its transformation into a baton metaphor at the climax is asserted rather than mechanically demonstrated.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Concept introduced early ("yearning algorithm") and Lira theorizes it lives in the gaps between desire and action. Middle development: she applies it by transliterating kaleidoscope images into sail tweaks, giving it one functional beat. Weakness: the algorithm's mechanics remain abstract—told as "a dance" rather than shown as a constraint or cost that alters her tactics. Closure participation is thematic echo rather than plot engine.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Steadily curious" appears twice as a label (Lira mutters it, parroting Old Thrum; the text states "her curiosity a low, persistent thrum"). No on-page action where this trait enables or forecloses a choice with visible cost—her persistence is narrated rather than tested under competing pressure. Swappable with "determined" or "obsessed" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Transliterate action seeded early (Old Thrum's instruction) and executed in two key beats: Lira presses the arrow to the kaleidoscope glass (triggers the shudder), then transliterates wildly during the dive (converts flickers into sail tweaks). Major turn depends on this action. Closure: she "transliterated the final image" before hurling the tip. Deduction: the mechanics of transliteration remain metaphorical; we don't see the specific sail adjustments or choices the images dictate, limiting felt constraint.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Kaleidoscope introduced early (Old Thrum's parting gift); its mechanics matter across three beats (three image twists, alignment with arrow tip, projections onto mist during the dive). Method shapes attempts: each image prompts Lira's reaction and the alignment unlocks the workshop shudder. Closure: the kaleidoscope projects the final collision image. Minor deduction: the projections onto mist during flight are vivid but their causal role in guiding the *Skein* is asserted ("transliterated wildly") rather than shown as specific navigational choices.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Workshop setting anchored early with vivid particulars (acid sea, gears clacking, mist seeping through cracks). It supplies the *Skein* and constrains Lira's timeline ("She'd have to work faster"). The workshop shudders when she aligns the tip, providing one causal beat. Closure participation: the hum ripples "into the workshop's bones." Deduction: the workshop remains mostly backdrop after the first third; the acid sea and floating aspect don't alter tactics in the climactic dive, and the tower rising from the sea is a separate element rather than workshop pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Throughout the evolution" is interpreted as the duration of Lira's years-long quest and the on-page kaleidoscope sequence. Backstory mentions "years" of study; present action spans "today" with urgency markers ("faster," "have to work") but no tracked clock or deadline that tightens decisions. The evolution pays off at closure (algorithm realized), but time itself doesn't constrain her moves in scene—she completes each step without visible temporal cost or racing counterpressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Motivation ("ring a bell no one hears yet") introduced early and repeated across beats; Lira's grin and whoop at the tower dramatize desire in action. Friction: colleagues call her mad, and the workshop's decay adds urgency. Closure: she achieves the bell-ringing, producing the hum. Deduction: the want itself isn't shown in conflict with a competing fear or need on the page—Lira never hesitates or faces a choice between the bell and another path, so the desire reads linear rather than conflicted. Cost of pursuit is implied (years spent, isolation) but not foregrounded in the ending beat.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Tone established early with "colleagues called her mad. She called them 'gears with feet,'" and sustained through "irreverent awe blooming in her chest" at closure. The whoop and the ghost's chuckle maintain irreverence; the final hum and ripple charge the image with awe. Modulation: Lira's hiss and slam ("Not helpful") layer frustration without losing the irreverent texture. Minor slip: the ghost's chuckle in the final line tilts slightly toward whimsy, diluting the awe's charge rather than deepening it.</comment>
