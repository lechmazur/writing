<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lila's suicidal ideation and rescue action form a clear arc, but the protagonist's motivations remain largely told rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses in scene. The parasol-tip detail and "changed" numbness are concrete anchors, yet the interiority leans toward abstract summary ("detachment so profound") rather than embodied perception under pressure. The rescue itself feels convenient—no visceral struggle with her own death-wish when confronted with another's peril—missing the chance to stage internal conflict through action. The final "flicker of something like peace" reads as a modest shift but lacks the contradictory cost that would elevate it to Earned Stasis.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation is clear by the opening paragraph (who, where, when). The drive lens reads Situational-Accumulative hybrid: Lila's volunteer work accumulates pressure toward a clinic visit, then the rescue forces a stance shift. However, the closure unit—"flicker of something like peace"—lacks legible cost on the page; we're told she feels peace but not what path or option she has foreclosed or what price she's paid. The rescue itself is driven by coincidence (the sound, the fissure) rather than Lila's prior choices narrowing options. The "fold in patience" concept appears twice but doesn't constrain tactics or reweight the ending image with visible cost, remaining thematic decoration.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The drift-ice marina is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (cold through boots, keening sound, faintly blue fissure) and constrains the rescue action—the parasol tip hooks the railing because of the ice-crack's geometry. The "fold in patience" image and the frozen bay's "loosened grip on reality" charge the atmospheric frame. However, the clinic in the "nearby town" remains abstract, never anchoring Lila's stated purpose in physical space, and the disaster-relief mechanics (picks, shovels, canned goods) are sketched rather than integrated into her moment-to-moment choices. The marina qualifies as micro-setting that shapes one key turn (the rescue) but doesn't recur at closure to charge the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Lila's choice between clinic visit and continued existence—is signaled early but never tested on the page. The rescue provides a surface reversal (she saves rather than seeks death) yet the turn isn't driven by Lila's agency; she hears a sound, follows it, and acts without visible internal conflict or cost. The "fold in patience" as "the moment when action became inevitable" is told in reflection rather than dramatized as a narrowing of options. No credible loss or trade-off (time, stamina, social credit) alters her tactics. The ending's "flicker of peace" suggests a stance shift but the price—what path she's now foreclosed—remains offstage.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The theme of finding purpose through unexpected action emerges organically from the rescue sequence, and the "fold in patience" concept recurs with shifting emphasis (waiting vs. acting). The parasol tip's return in the final beat offers a purposeful reprise that reweights sentimentality as rootedness. However, the thematic question—whether Lila will choose life—receives only the vague answer "flicker of something like peace," avoiding a resonant, non-literal final image that would reconfigure prior material. The scientist's whispered "I was looking for something" / "We all are" exchange skirts platitude, though it stops short of overt moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited; perceptual signature is consistent (Lila filters cold as welcome pain, sound as "approaching endings"). The "changed" coinage and parasol-tip focus create character-specific texture. Dialogue is spare and functional; the foreman's "poke someone's eye out" and the scientist's whisper feel natural. However, diction occasionally drifts toward elevated register ("euthanasia tourist," "subconscious need," "the fold in patience") that reads more authorial than Lila's lived idiom under stress. Free indirect style is clean, with no head-hopping. Minor filter-verb clusters ("she'd come to think of it") are voice-motivated and don't dull immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is generally high. The keening-sound sequence and rescue choreography are clear and propulsive. However, repetitive stems appear: "She'd arrived," "She'd come," "She didn't know why she'd brought it," "She'd done nothing," "She closed her eyes"—a template cadence of past-perfect subject-verb openers that flattens momentum across paragraphs. The phrase "fold in patience" is repeated verbatim twice without deepening on the page, reading as thematic placeholder. "Grips reality loosely" in the opening is vivid but never operationalized in action. No loops or mixed metaphors touch the closure beat, limiting penalty scope.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The drift-ice marina and heirloom parasol tip are specific, non-generic choices. The rescue sequence transforms the "euthanasia tourist" premise through the irony of Lila saving a life. However, the core arc—suicidal character finds unexpected purpose—follows a widely used template without decisive transformation; the emotional and thematic resolution ("flicker of peace") remains mid-range and predictable. The "fold in patience" concept and "grips reality loosely" attribute are fresh phrasings but function more as ornament than structural engine. No bold structural risk or unconventional perspectival choice elevates the familiar trajectory.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The "euthanasia tourist" identity frames Lila's presence at the marina but does not drive key turns. She volunteers for disaster relief and performs a rescue; the clinic visit never materializes on the page, so the tourist motive remains setup without payoff. The rescue decision is reactive (hears sound, acts) rather than a choice that tests or alters her death-seeking intent. Present in setup and referenced at closure reflection, but no middle development or causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The parasol tip appears in three beats: Lila clutches it, the foreman jokes about it, she hooks the boat railing with it, and it rests in her lap at closure. The rescue use is functional and specific (the filigree hooks the railing), but the object could be replaced with any small hook or tool without altering story logic. The final reprise reweights sentimentality as anchor, a purposeful lyric move, yet the object's unique properties (heirloom lace, grandmother's attic) don't constrain choice or impose cost. Setup + middle + closure present; moderate causal work; swappable core.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"A fold in patience" is named twice in reflection ("the space between action and acceptance," "the moment when action became inevitable") but never constrains an on-page choice or alters Lila's tactics. It functions as thematic annotation rather than a concept that shapes stakes. No scene tests the distinction between waiting and acting with visible cost. Present in setup and closure reflection; missing middle development; ornamental use.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Grips reality loosely" is declared in the opening ("a place where the world seemed to grip reality loosely") but never operationalized as a trait that enables or constrains Lila's actions. No on-page moment shows her perceiving or acting differently because of this loosened grip. Label-only mention in setup; absent from development and closure; no visible cost or tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Trawl" is the method Lila uses throughout: she trawls for supplies, trawls the perimeter, trawls "a particularly thick patch of ice" when she hears the sound that leads to the rescue. The action drives the inciting incident (discovery of the fissure) and shapes the middle beat (team hauls the boat). The verb recurs in her closing reflection ("just trawled, listened, and acted"). Essential to setup and climax; present at closure; causal pressure clear; some swappability (e.g., "search," "scan") but the maritime idiom fits the setting and recurs purposefully.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Disaster relief volunteering is signaled early, supplies the rescue context (team with ropes, harnesses), and shapes Lila's tactical presence at the marina. The method matters: she's on the ice because of the relief work, and the team enables the boat extraction. However, the mechanics are sketched (picks, shovels, blankets) rather than detailed, and the method doesn't impose a visible cost or constrain her final choice. Present in setup and middle; enables one major turn; moderate irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The drift-ice marina is established in the opening line, recurs as the site of the rescue (fissure, frozen bay, ice-encrusted boats), and returns in the final beat ("marina's edge"). The frozen environment constrains the rescue (parasol tip used because of ice-crack geometry) and charges the atmospheric frame ("skeletal network," "frost and silence"). The setting drives spatial tactics and reappears at closure with sensory reprise (salt, frost, distant waves). Setup + development + closure; causal and atmospheric pressure; high specificity.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"After waking up changed" appears once in the opening as backstory context for Lila's numbness but imposes no live timetable or decision pressure on the page. The marina events unfold over "one afternoon" and "that night," yet no clock or urgency tracks her choices. The timeframe is ornamental setup without development or closure participation. Present in setup only; no tactical constraint or payoff.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"To learn the sound of approaching endings" is stated directly ("she'd come here to learn the sound") and tested once when Lila hears the keening and declares "this, she was certain, was it." However, the motive is told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants (e.g., fear vs. curiosity, relief vs. dread). The rescue doesn't stage friction between this death-seeking desire and the life-saving action; she simply acts. Present in setup and one middle beat; thematic echo at closure ("sound of the ice and distant waves"); minimal on-page cost or contradiction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Windborne solace" as tone is embodied in the sensory frame (wind through cracked bell, salt and frost scent, distant waves) and modulates from cold welcome-pain to the final "flicker of peace." The keening sound and the closing wind sequence charge key beats. However, the tone remains largely atmospheric rather than pressuring Lila's stance; the solace is declared ("something like peace") rather than earned through image. Present across beats; coherent through turns; modest charge at closure; mid-range intensity.</comment>
