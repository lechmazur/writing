<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Cedric's motivation crystallizes partway through ("capture the shape of possibility"), but his interior texture relies heavily on abstract mysticism and borrowed phrases rather than embodied contradiction. The shift from trauma-silent knight to laughing, glowing figure lacks intermediate micro-choices showing how unsnapping strings changes his relationship to control or loss. Emotions are often labeled ("shivering bliss," "dread and euphoria") rather than enacted through contradictory impulses in scene. The final laugh feels declared rather than earned by prior causality.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes a hybrid lens (situational pressure accumulating toward conceptual repricing) but shifts register multiple times—mystical catalog, action sequence, lyric field transformation—without teaching the pattern early. Closure arrives as conceptual repricing: "The shape of possibility was not a thing to be captured...a pattern to be felt," reweighting the alchemists' error. However, the cost is asserted ("footsteps leaving no prints," greenhouse crumbling) rather than felt in a choice that forecloses a live path. The orientation anchor (greenhouse, endless night, Cedric) arrives promptly, so no penalty is applied there.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The greenhouse is vividly rendered (moon-petals, arcane machinery, luminescent vines) and the orbs chamber supplies a concrete discovery. The program and marionette constrain Cedric's moves at the stage. However, spatial choreography weakens after the staircase descent—the chamber, field, and ruins sequence compresses geography without clear transitions, and the final wheat field's relationship to the greenhouse is unclear. The rusted bench, stage, and strings anchor key beats, meeting the micro-setting test for the 7.0 threshold.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—escape stasis and capture the greenhouse's essence—is signaled early and tightens when Cedric unsnaps the marionette strings, triggering the staircase descent. The orb-shattering moment is a reversal, but it arrives as passive discovery rather than a choice with visible tradeoff. Agency is diffuse: the vines pulse, machinery screams, reality shifts around him rather than because of his decisions. The final wheat-field transformation is a granted state change without prior cost that would foreclose another path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The theme—patterns as lived dance versus captured essence—emerges through the alchemists' hubris, the marionette's strings, and Cedric's realization. The final line ("The strings were never meant to hold you") lands as thematic summary rather than resonant non-literal image, lowering the score. The orbs and stage serve as concrete anchors, and the shift from capture to participation is clear. However, the wheat field and glowing skin veer toward symbolic convenience, and "shivering bliss" is asserted more than dramatized.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV remains stable, and the opening silence establishes Cedric's distance. However, diction drifts between elevated mysticism ("factually mystical," "murmured allegiance") and plain action ("He tugged. The strings resisted"). The phrase "Through forgotten patterns, we rise" recurs but never clarifies whose voice or why Cedric adopts it. Filter verbs ("seemed to shift," "seemed to follow") cluster in the program and marionette beats without purpose. Perceptual signature is generic—what a withdrawn knight notices is not distinct from any other observer.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Multiple paraphrase loops appear: "The greenhouse shuddered. The vines outside writhed..." repeats the same event, and "murmured allegiance" is restated three times without added pressure. Template cadence runs through the orchard paragraph ("bark like twisted rope," "blossoms that glowed"). The marionette's "sneer" and "hollow sockets filled with shards of mirror" are vivid, but "shivering bliss—a paradoxical mix of dread and euphoria" immediately explains itself, flattening the effect. The final third condenses heavily (stage → staircase → chamber → field) without transitions, and the inscription mechanic (program pages changing text) is convenient rather than causal. Line-level artifacts touch the closure beat (wheat field summary), lowering the score and disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The marionette-program-alchemist triangle offers a fresh synthesis, and the greenhouse's glass-and-vine enclosure is specific. However, the "capture versus become" arc follows a familiar template (control → surrender), and the strings-as-stasis metaphor is transparent rather than discovered. The orbs-containing-moments image is visually inventive but introduces a late rule without groundwork. Cedric's transformation (unarmored, glowing, leaving no prints) grants symbolic resolution without the earned friction that would make it feel inevitable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Cedric is present throughout but his silence is setup-only; his key choices (gripping the program, tugging strings, reaching for the orb) are reactive rather than driven by internal contradiction. The withdrawn trait does not constrain a beat—he acts freely once motivated. Present in closure (walking from the field) but not causally active there.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The program appears early (rusted bench), drives the middle choice (underlined line: "unsnap the strings"), and returns at closure with new inscription. However, its mechanics (text changing) are convenient rather than earned, and it is held/read rather than used with cost. Three beats (discovery, stage, final inscription) with closure linkage, but swappable with any mystical manuscript.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>The murmured allegiance ("Through forgotten patterns, we rise") recurs three times but remains ornamental—a borrowed phrase that Cedric repeats without it shaping his tactics or constraining a choice. It functions as thematic echo, not lived pressure. Present but does not alter options.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Factually mystical" appears once as interior label ("Factually mystical, he thought—the orchard's alchemists had once believed..."). It does not constrain or enable an action; the exposition continues regardless. Label-only, no cost, no beat involvement.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Unsnap" is signaled early (program line), executed at the stage (Cedric tugs, strings snap), and triggers the major turn (staircase descent, orb chamber). The action is specific and its consequence (machinery screaming, vines blazing) is immediate. Present in three beats with clear causal pressure, though the final field transformation dilutes its centrality.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Through forgotten patterns, we rise" is seeded early (dying alchemist's phrase) and recurs, but the method's mechanics are never dramatized—how does one rise through patterns? The orbs, strings, and program all gesture toward pattern, but none show a cost or tactical constraint tied to this exact phrasing. Lyric resonance without causal work.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The greenhouse (glass corridors, moon-petals, arcane machinery, endless night) is established early and pressures every beat: cold that crystallizes breath, vines that pulse violet, the stage at its heart. The orbs chamber and the ruins at closure anchor the transformation. The night and glass constrain visibility and mood. Three-gate clear, multiple beats, closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"As reality shifts" recurs three times as a transition cue (program face shifts, glass walls ripple, greenhouse dissolves). The shifts mark escalation but do not create a ticking clock or force a tactical choice. Time is atmospheric rather than a pressure mechanism. Present across beats, but does not tighten decisions.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Cedric's motivation ("capture the shape of possibility") crystallizes mid-story and drives the descent and orb-shattering. The final realization (not capture, but dance) reweights it. However, the friction between capturing and living is told rather than dramatized in a choice with visible cost. Two-gate (middle, closure), causal involvement, but swappable with "understand" or "master."</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Shivering bliss" appears once as a label ("Shivering bliss prickled his skin—a paradoxical mix of dread and euphoria") but the tone across the piece is somber mysticism and action tension, not bliss. The laugh at the end gestures toward release, but the overall texture does not modulate into bliss. Single mention, does not charge closure, ornamental.</comment>
