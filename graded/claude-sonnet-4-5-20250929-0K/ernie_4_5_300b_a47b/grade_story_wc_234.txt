<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is legible—"The palette of resolve isn't a tool—it's a philosophy"—but her realization arrives via declaration rather than a dramatized micro-choice under pressure. The interiority leans on abstract metaphor ("scientifically romantic," "density of presence") without embodied contradiction; she moves from forcing the shell's resonance to "letting it guide the process" without showing competing impulses acting simultaneously in scene. Jorin serves as mirror and messenger but exerts no independent pressure that forces Elara to trade off values. The final choice feels narrated rather than earned through visible internal conflict at the pivot.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who and where quickly; the drive lens reads as Causal with accumulative dressing (shell → ledger → realization → engine success). The closure unit—Elara aligning the shell atop the engine and achieving resonance—lands on the page, but the conceptual cost ("by returning differently") is asserted in dialogue and theme rather than demonstrated through a forfeited option or visible price. The ledger's arrival feels convenient: Jorin produces it mid-scene without prior setup, and its "palette of resolve" phrase is echoed verbatim by Elara's epiphany, flattening causality into prompt fulfillment. One meaningful tightening occurs (the realization that she must let the shell guide rather than force), but the stakes-test remains abstract.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The ember nexus is vivid—"glowing cracks in the cobblestones weaving gold through the air," "shards of cooled lava"—and the fading embers supply urgency ("the city above grew colder"). The shell and sun engine constrain the climactic choice: Elara places the shell atop the core, and its alignment with gears becomes the pivot. Spatial choreography is clean (workbench, doorframe, nexus floor). However, the pocket-sun engine's mechanics remain vague; "prismatic lens," "sun engine's core," and "gears" are named but their function and failure modes are not grounded enough to make the final success feel materially earned rather than thematic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—revive the nexus's fading embers—is signaled early. Pressure tightens when Jorin presents the ledger, offering a conceptual method ("palette of resolve") that reframes Elara's approach. The climax hinges on her letting the shell guide the engine rather than forcing resonance, which narrows her tactical options. Yet the escalation reads more as theme application than agency under duress: the ledger arrives by coincidence, and Elara's shift from "force" to "let" is a declared insight rather than a trade-off with visible cost (no tool destroyed, no ally alienated, no time penalty paid). The three prior engine explosions are summarized backstory, not on-page reversals that test commitment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The theme—transformation through perspective shift, "revalue by returning differently"—emerges from the shell and engine motifs. However, the final paragraph moralizes: "The palette of resolve wasn't a tool—it was a philosophy." The ledger's phrase "palette of resolve" is echoed verbatim in Elara's epiphany, creating thematic echo rather than resonant particulars. The columella curl's "density of presence" and "scientifically romantic" idiom gesture toward a fusion of precision and awe, but these remain label-level rather than enacted through contradictory choices or images that reweight prior material without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization is stable; Elara's perceptual signature favors alchemical metaphor ("palette she mixed daily," "language of light"). Dialogue feels functional but occasionally expository: "The columella's density—it's a map of time itself" delivers world logic rather than pursuing a goal or carrying subtext. Jorin's line "You're still chasing that columella curl" and Elara's response read as mutual briefing. The prose modulates with pressure—short fragments during the engine hum—but under peak stress the diction elevates ("directed spontaneity," "density of presence") rather than compressing to the character's immediate idiom. No head-hopping; psychic distance is consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Figurative density is high: "ember nexus pulsed like a living heart," "suspended like a moth in amber," "light bending into a spectrum…swirling like a nebula." Three similes cluster in the opening and climax without pattern-teaching; the mixed vehicle "palette of resolve" and "density of presence" operate as abstract labels rather than concrete images. Template cadence appears: "She believed…," "She'd already lost…," "She picked up…," "She placed…" across adjacent paragraphs. Paraphrase loop: "To revalue wasn't to discard, but to see anew. To return differently meant confronting the same problem with fresh eyes, unburdened by past failures"—two sentences restate the ledger's method without added pressure. Clarity remains high, but the artifact load in the climax and final beat triggers line-level penalty.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The pocket-sun alchemist and ember nexus forge offer specificity, but the plot arc—repeated failure, mentor's cryptic wisdom, epiphany, success—follows a familiar template. "Palette of resolve" and "density of presence" read as prompt fulfillment rather than organic idiom; the ledger's phrase is echoed verbatim by the protagonist's insight. The columella curl's logarithmic spiral as "map of time" is an intriguing seed, yet its payoff is thematic alignment rather than a non-obvious causal twist. The emotional core—learning to guide rather than force—lacks the lived detail or moral calculus that would transform the template into a singular vision.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her choice to place the shell atop the engine drives the climax. However, her prior "mistakes" (forcing resonance) are told rather than shown, and the pivot—"letting it guide the process"—is a declared insight rather than a dramatized decision with competing costs. She observes, adjusts the lens, picks up the shell, and places it; these are actions, but they lack visible trade-offs that would elevate the character's causal pressure. Present in setup, middle, and ending; one key turn (shift from force to guide); moderate causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The nautilus shell columella curl appears early ("resting on a velvet cloth"), is discussed in the middle ("its density—it's a map of time itself"), and returns at climax when Elara places it atop the sun engine. The shell's "logarithmic curl" and "iridescent surface" are described, and its "density resonating with the engine's newfound harmony" drives success. However, the shell's specific properties (density, spiral geometry) do not constrain Elara's choice beyond requiring alignment; the ledger's method does the conceptual work. Present across three beats; closure participation is structural but not irreplaceable in mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Palette of resolve" is introduced via the ledger and becomes the epiphany: "The palette isn't just for mixing light. It's for mixing *perspective*." The concept shapes Elara's realization (revalue by returning differently) and is restated in the final paragraph as philosophy. Yet it does not constrain a prior choice or alter tactics on the page; it arrives late (past midpoint) and functions as theme label. Mentioned in middle and ending; summarized rather than enacted; low causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Scientifically romantic" appears as a descriptor: "her voice scientifically romantic, a blend of awe and precision." The trait is labeled but not tested. Elara's speech mixes technical idiom ("prismatic lens," "density," "resonance") with metaphor ("language of light," "palette of resolve"), yet the story does not stage a beat where precision conflicts with intuition or where this dual stance exacts a cost. Present as label; no on-page action constrained or enabled by the attribute.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Revalue" is the ledger's term: "a method to revalue what's lost by returning differently." Elara applies it conceptually—"letting the shell guide the process" rather than forcing—and the final image ("transformed failure into a kind of alchemy itself") echoes the action. The revaluation shifts her approach and enables the engine's success. However, the ledger introduces the term late, and the mechanics of revaluation (what is concretely reweighted) remain abstract. Present in middle and ending; one key turn; moderate causal linkage; swappable with "reconsider" or "re-approach" with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"By returning differently" is the ledger's method, paraphrased by Elara: "To return differently meant confronting the same problem with fresh eyes, unburdened by past failures." She enacts it by placing the shell atop the engine in a new configuration. The method is signaled (ledger) and shapes the final attempt, but it does not constrain prior beats or force visible trade-offs; the story tells us she returns differently rather than showing multiple approaches with escalating costs. Present in middle and ending; one turn; moderate causal work.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The ember nexus is present throughout: "pulsed like a living heart," "glowing cracks in the cobblestones," "embers dimming as the city above grew colder." The fading embers supply urgency and the nexus's warmth stabilizing at the end confirms success. The setting pressures the timeline (city growing colder) and the final image ("light seeping into the cobblestones") charges the closure. However, the nexus does not constrain Elara's choices mid-scene; the workbench and tools do more tactical work. Present in setup, middle, ending; closure linkage strong; causal pressure moderate.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"The moment a secret is whispered between friends" points to Jorin's ledger reveal: "The moment hung, suspended like a moth in amber, until Jorin whispered, 'I found something.'" The ledger is "a secret" and Jorin is Elara's companion ("mirror"). However, the timeframe "in the moment" is not pressurized; the scene unfolds across multiple beats (adjustment, discussion, ledger, epiphany, engine test) without a ticking clock. The whisper is dramatized in one line; the friendship is asserted ("companion," "mirror") but not tested. Present in middle; ornamental timeframe; no tactical pressure from elapsed seconds.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"To capture the density of presence" is Elara's obsession, stated mid-scene: "The density of presence… If I can align its resonance with the sun engine…" and echoed at closure: "She'd captured the density of presence not by conquering the shell, but by letting it revalue her approach." The motivation explains her shell fixation and drive to revive the nexus. However, "density of presence" remains abstract—never embodied as a sensory or tactical cost (what does she forfeit to chase it?). Present in middle and ending; drives one turn; told more than shown; low friction between want and cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Directed spontaneity" is not named on the page but the tone mixes purposeful action (Elara adjusting the lens, placing the shell) with improvisational risk ("she welcomed the uncertainty, the directed spontaneity of the moment"). The prose modulates: measured in setup, compressed during the engine hum ("a thousand crickets waking"), elevated at climax ("swirling like a nebula"). However, the final paragraph returns to declarative summation, flattening the spontaneous charge. Tone is coherent and purposeful; one modulation during climax; does not fully charge the final image due to moralizing close.</comment>
