<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kael's motivation to find his mother drives choices across beats, and his final decision to hurl the shard away demonstrates agency with cost. However, interiority often relies on stock phrasing ("breath hitched," "chest tightened") and the visor device functions more as exposition tool than embodied constraint. The encounter with the mother-figure lacks genuine internal contradiction—Kael processes the revelation cleanly rather than wrestling with competing impulses in the moment. The ending shift reads earned but the path there smooths over psychological friction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The piece establishes a clear causal-hybrid lens: Kael's compulsion drives portal entry, the parallel universe reveals his mother's knowledge, and his choice to throw the shard closes one possibility with visible cost. Orientation anchors arrive within the opening beat (visor, bay, shard in belt). The closure unit—hurling the shard and waking without it—functions as Earned Stasis with felt cost ("The weight was gone"). One substantive tightening occurs when the woman's line "some doors need to stay closed" reframes the premise, narrowing Kael's options to either keep pursuing or release the search.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport repair bay is vividly rendered with skeletal gantries, rust, emergency lights, and dust motes catching visor projections. Sensory details are selective and support atmosphere. However, the setting functions primarily as backdrop—no tool, spatial constraint, or environmental feature meaningfully shapes Kael's choices or charges the final image. The parallel bay's gleaming alloy is noted but not used. The shard's physical properties (sharp edges, warming surface) anchor touch but do not alter tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake—discovering the truth about his mother's disappearance—is signaled early and tightens when the woman confirms the shard is "a choice." Kael's agency drives escalation: he climbs the platform despite caution, demands "Show me," then chooses to throw the shard, forfeiting further pursuit. The cost is legible on the page: "the shard gone," "trembled," and the acknowledgment he's learned "to let it go." One clear reversal—the woman's refusal to simply explain shifts Kael from seeker to renouncer. No coincidence resolves; the portal responds to his action.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through image and action: doors, keys, weights, threads weaving through choices. The shard as both key and burden crystallizes the cost of pursuit versus release. The final image—"the murmur of half-remembered dreams faded, replaced by the quiet hum of possibility"—offers a resonant answer without moralizing. The woman's line "some doors need to stay closed" risks thematic echo but is delivered in dialogue and immediately tested by Kael's choice. Subtext operates in the woman's smile that "didn't reach her eyes" and Kael's bodily recognition. Minor slip: "cyclically spontaneous" in the closing beat reads as authorial summary rather than earned insight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable in close third; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present—visor projections filter experience, the tang of ozone marks transitions—but diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("ripe with the scent of ozone and something older, sharper") that sits uneasily with Kael's embodied panic. Dialogue is minimal but functional; the woman's lines carry subtext. Filter verbs ("felt," "could still smell") appear frequently but remain voice-consistent. The phrase "cyclically spontaneous" in the final beat breaks internal voice—Kael wouldn't label his own smile with the prompt's attribute.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and propulsion is strong through the portal sequence. Information density is high in the opening paragraph, anchoring visor, bay, shard, and backstory efficiently. Minor loops: "The shard's pull" appears twice in adjacent paragraphs; "Show me" / "what happens now" dialogue feels template-adjacent. Stock metaphor: "truth was a knife that cut both ways." The phrase "weaving between worlds" and "cyclically spontaneous" in the closing paragraph read as prompt-echo insertions rather than organic thought. Proofreading is clean; no grammar breaks. Peak beats (portal fall, woman reveal) are vivid and clear.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The premise—map maker uses mysterious artifact to find lost mother across parallel universes—assembles familiar genre pieces (portal fantasy, parallel worlds, lost parent) without sharp transformation. The visor device and sensory map maker role add texture but remain underused; the bay and shard could be swapped for cave and talisman with minimal rewrites. The ending's choice to release rather than pursue adds a non-obvious emotional turn. Specificity in the woman's uniform insignia and the shard's shifting symbols provides grounding. Risk-taking is moderate; the piece executes competently within expectations but does not surprise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Kael, the sensory map maker, is present throughout. The visor device anchors his profession in the opening and flickers during the portal sequence, shaping his perception of the lattice lines. His profession enables the journey (he "weaved between worlds") and the final act—removing the visor—closes the arc. However, the map-making skill itself does not constrain a key choice under pressure; he acts on the shard's compulsion rather than professional calculation. Two beats: opening setup, final removal. Causal work is moderate; swappable with "portal navigator" or similar role.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The green glass shard appears in five beats: tucked in belt (setup), throbbing compulsion (inciting action), gripped on platform, flaring during portal entry, and hurled into the portal (climax). Its physical properties—sharp edges, cool-then-warm surface, shifting symbols—are handled on the page. It drives two major turns: compelling Kael to the platform and being thrown to close pursuit. The shard's symbolic weight ("key," "choice") converges with its physical use. Cost is tied directly to its loss. Strong integration; removal would collapse the plot. Minor friction: symbols "shifted when he looked away" is noted early but never returns.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Weaving between worlds shapes Kael's profession and frames the premise—he plots jumps through fractures of reality. The lattice of portals and parallel universe mechanics are signaled early and constrain the mid-beat (portal opens, he falls). However, the concept operates more as setting than active stake-shaper; Kael's choice to throw the shard would work in any magic-portal frame. The phrase "weaving between worlds" is mentioned twice but does not alter tactics or create a unique trade-off at closure. Functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Cyclically spontaneous" is applied twice: once to the shard's pull ("cyclically spontaneous, a compulsion that came in waves") and once to Kael's smile in the final line. The label describes rather than constrains. No on-page action demonstrates how cyclical spontaneity creates cost or alters a choice. The trait could be removed and the shard's compulsion would function identically. Ornamental; late echo in closing beat reads as prompt fulfillment rather than organic voice.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Redirect" appears three times: once in the woman's line ("You redirect. Again"), implicitly when Kael throws the shard into the portal (redirecting its path/purpose), and retrospectively in his reflection that he's "learned to let it go." The woman's use introduces the concept as Kael's habitual response; his throw enacts it physically. The action shapes the climax and closure—without the redirect, the shard remains and the pursuit continues. However, "redirect" could be replaced with "release" or "choose" with minor edits. Strong but not fully irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Parallel universes are signaled early (visor overlays portals "each leading to a parallel universe") and the method structures the middle beat: portal opens, Kael falls, bay transforms, woman appears from the alternate timeline. The mechanics matter—rust vanishes, the woman aged differently—and shape Kael's realization that "she'd known about the shard. She'd used it." The method enables the truth reveal and constrains the resolution (he cannot stay; the portal reopens). Present in all three gates; drives one major turn and participates in closure when the shard is thrown back into the portal.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport repair bay is established in the opening with skeletal gantries, rust, emergency lights, dust motes, and central platform. Spatial choreography is clear (Kael climbs to platform, stands at edge). The bay returns in the parallel universe with gleaming alloy, contrasting states. However, no feature of the bay constrains a choice or supplies a resource that alters outcome—the platform is staging, not active pressure. Early setup and closure return (waking in "his own bay") but the setting remains backdrop. Lyric reprise present but without tactical weight.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"In the murmur of half-remembered dreams" opens and closes the piece as atmospheric frame. It signals a liminal, memory-adjacent timeframe but does not function as clock or constraint—no urgency, no ticking deadline. Kael's actions unfold without time pressure; the phrase describes mood rather than shaping tactics. The reprise in the final paragraph ("The murmur of half-remembered dreams faded") reweights slightly but introduces no cost. Present in setup and closure; absent from development. Ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Discovering "the weight of a withheld truth" drives Kael's compulsion from the opening (mother's vanishing, hologram warning) through the climax (woman confirms the shard is a choice, truth "was a knife"). The motivation is dramatized in his climb, his whisper "Show me," and his physical reaction (chest tightened, grip loosened). Friction appears when the woman refuses simple explanation, forcing Kael to choose between continued pursuit and release. The final cost—throwing the shard—demonstrates the weight of acceptance. Strong setup and development; closure participation is clear. Minor friction: "weight" is named rather than shown in the final beat.</comment>
