<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation crystallizes clearly ("discover meaning in it"), and her socially perceptive trait manifests in reading the grotto's "undercurrents." However, interiority leans heavily on abstraction—"lilac unease," "emergent hush," "whispering gallery"—rather than embodied contradiction. The final choice to draw feels asserted more than earned by conflicting impulses acting simultaneously in scene. Phrases like "quiet determination" replace visceral stakes with label-only emotion.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: pattern-discovery and density increase reweight the dominant stake. Orientation is anchored early (grotto, mist, Mara), satisfying the test. However, closure lacks visible cost—Mara's realization ("It's a language") and the bell tolling feel like conceptual arrival without foreclosing a live option or imposing a felt price on the page. The sand mandala's shift and holographic vortex read as spectacle rather than a trade-off that alters her stance with undeniable consequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The grotto's acoustics, mist, and tile mosaic anchor space and constrain Mara's actions (she presses the flake into a depression, the mandala rearranges). Sensory details—"damp moss," "lilac-hued glow," "low, resonant hum"—filter through Mara's perception. The tile flake as micro-setting charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate. Minor slips: spatial choreography between wall, sand, and Mara's position could be tighter; "whispering gallery tile flake" remains somewhat generic in texture.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode the grotto's message) is signaled early and Mara's choice to draw the mandala tightens options. Yet escalation is muted—no credible opposition or trade-off forces a high-stakes decision. The tile's directive ("Interject") and the mandala's autonomous rearrangement externalize agency; Mara observes more than she risks. The closure image (holographic vortex, bell tolling) suggests resolution by discovery rather than a choice that forecloses a path with cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Theme—"Unlearning isn't the same as forgetting," collective silence as emergent message—emerges from concrete images (sand mandala, tile mosaic, grotto acoustics). However, the ending leans toward direct statement: "The unlearning… wasn't about shedding knowledge. It was about making space for new truths to emerge." This thematic echo in the final paragraph replaces resonant implication with assertion. The holographic vortex and bell risk symbolic convenience, introduced late to harvest thematic points.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-person limited; Mara's perceptual signature (socially perceptive, whimsical) colors narration with phrases like "ephemeral galaxies" and "silent alarm." However, register drifts under pressure—"collective truth waiting to be decoded," "holographic image," "cognitive smoothness"—into abstraction that doesn't match a chalk artist's lexicon. The single line of dialogue ("Unlearning isn't the same as forgetting") feels thematic rather than goal-driven. Psychic distance is controlled, no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and sentences advance setting or character. However, minor scaffold persists: "She realized, with a start" and "to her surprise" are filter-heavy; "lilac-hued glow," "lilac unease," and "emergent hush" recur without reweighting. Paraphrase loops appear: "The grotto's whispers grew louder, not in volume but in clarity" unpacks itself unnecessarily. Figurative density ("mist clung… like a second skin," "swirling like tiny dancers") is high but controlled. No major loops or template cadence that obscure closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The sand mandala as translation device and the grotto's acoustics as message medium offer a fresh synthesis. However, the core premise—mystic discovers ancient pattern through art—closely matches widely used templates (artist decodes esoteric symbols). Transformation is partial: Mara's whimsical occupation and the "emergent hush" concept add specificity, but the holographic vortex and bell tolling resolve via spectacle rather than non-obvious moral calculus or lived detail.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Mara is present throughout and makes two key choices: drawing the mandala and pressing the tile. These choices shape middle and ending beats, satisfying setup, development, and payoff. However, her occupation (chalk artist) remains ornamental—drawing could be performed by any visual artist with minor edits. The whimsical trait colors voice but does not constrain tactics under pressure. Two-beat involvement and closure linkage push into mid-band; swappability and lack of causal pressure limit upward movement.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The tile flake appears early ("hours earlier, embedded"), drives three beats (found, floated, pressed into depression), and is causally active at closure (projects holographic image). Its glow synchronizes with Mara's chalk, narrowing her options. Specificity is high—"lilac-hued," fits a hidden depression—making it irreplaceable. Cost is implied (pressing it triggers the grotto's shudder and silence shift). Strong setup, development, and payoff with causal pressure and closure linkage justify high band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Emergent hush" is named early and shapes Mara's motivation (she comes to document it). However, it functions primarily as thematic backdrop rather than a constraint that alters tactics or options on the page. The hush "breathes" after Mara presses the tile, but this is effect, not causal pressure from the concept itself. Ornamental use and lack of middle-beat constraint cap the score; setup and lyric reprise offer modest lift.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Socially perceptive" is labeled early ("she'd always sensed undercurrents") and enables Mara to interpret the grotto's whispers as coherent rather than fragmented. However, this trait does not visibly constrain a choice or impose a trade-off—it simply allows her to proceed. No on-page cost tied to the attribute. Present across setup and development but swappable with "intuitive" or "sensitive" without structural change.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Interject" appears mid-story as a whispered directive. Mara hesitates, fearing disruption of the "emergent hush," but then proceeds to press the tile—a choice that could be described as "intervene" or "act" with minor edits. The action does not uniquely redefine options; her prior drawing and tile discovery drive the turn more than this verb. Setup is late (second third), development is brief, and swappability limits score despite closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The sand mandala is introduced early (Mara begins drawing in the first third), its patterns align with the grotto's tiles to unlock the vortex, and it autonomously rearranges at closure. Mechanics matter: the mandala is a "map" and "key," shaping Mara's tactics. However, the method could be replaced with any visual pattern (chalk symbols, carved runes) without breaking logic. Two-beat involvement, causal pressure, and closure linkage justify mid-high band; swappability prevents entry to ≥7.0.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The grotto pressures Mara's choices throughout: its acoustics guide her, the mist thickens as urgency rises, the wall's hidden depression accepts the tile, and the ceiling projects the vortex. Micro-setting (tile mosaic, sand floor) alters tactics. Setup, development, and payoff are clear; causal pressure and closure linkage are strong. Specificity (whispering gallery acoustics, labyrinth of echoing chambers) makes the location irreplaceable. Cost is implied in the grotto's shudder and silence shift.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"During the unlearning" is named early and frames context (the world "began shedding its certainties"). However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions or impose a clock—Mara works at her own pace with no visible deadline or urgency tied to "the unlearning" itself. The mist thickening and tile pulsing create micro-tension, but these are setting cues, not time pressure. Thematic setup without development or payoff as constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Mara's motivation ("to discover meaning in the mess") is stated explicitly mid-story and crystallizes in the final paragraph. It drives her choice to draw the mandala and press the tile, satisfying development and payoff. However, the desire is more asserted than dramatized through conflicting wants—there is no friction between this goal and a competing fear or cost on the page. Setup is present (she comes to document), and closure linkage is clear, but lack of embodied conflict limits upward movement.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Lilac unease" is named early (the tile's "lilac-hued glow," "lilac unease in her chest") and modulates: it "tightened" mid-story, then "faded, replaced by quiet determination" at closure. Tone shifts purposefully with pressure and charges the final image (the bell tolling, Mara's new truth). However, "lilac" as a tonal descriptor feels ornamental—removing it would not break the unease's coherence. Setup, development, and payoff present; specificity and causal pressure modest.</comment>
