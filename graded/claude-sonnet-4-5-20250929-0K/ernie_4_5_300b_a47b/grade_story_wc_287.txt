<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to "reflect light into dark corners" is clear and his fire escape gardener identity is concrete, but his interior life lacks contradiction—he moves through the story with steady resolve rather than competing impulses. The gesture of giving Mara the bitting gauge feels willed by theme rather than earned through prior friction between his desire to help and the cost of persistence. Mara's acceptance and softening arrive too quickly; her resistance dissolves without dramatized struggle. The final choice lacks visible foreclosure—what path does opening the window close for her?</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation is anchored early (who, where, when by the opening paragraph). The piece follows a causal sequence: Elias decides to visit Mara, brings the gauge, she hesitates then accepts, window opens. However, the closure lacks felt cost—Mara "let[s] the light in" without on-page forfeit or visible change in her circumstances beyond the symbolic gesture. The Decisive Change is asserted rather than demonstrated through a concrete action that narrows her options. Under a Causal lens, the linkage is present but the cost at closure remains abstract.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The harbor setting is vivid and sensory: salt and diesel, moonlight casting silver paths, the wrought-iron fire escape. Spatial choreography is clear throughout the dock and bait shop scenes. The bitting gauge functions as a recurring small object, but it does not constrain a choice—it serves as symbolic talisman rather than tactical pressure. The opened window at the end charges the final image with light, lifting the score slightly, but the environment itself (harbor, dock, shop interior) does not alter Elias's or Mara's tactical options.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Elias's mission to bring beauty and light to dark corners—is signaled early. The visit to Mara provides one tightening: his decision to try again after the geranium. However, the escalation is modest; Mara's hesitation dissolves in a single beat without forcing a trade-off or visible price. The window-opening moment reweights the space but doesn't foreclose a path or demonstrate cost—it reads as symbolic resolution rather than a choice that alters tactics or narrows options. Agency is present but the final act lacks the friction or loss that would charge it.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The theme of persistence and beauty in decay emerges organically from Elias's gardening and the rosebush frame. The bitting gauge as a tool "for measuring light" carries subtext, and the line "after the final petal drops, you still have to water the stem" offers a resonant image without heavy-handed moralizing. However, the final window-opening moment edges toward overt symbolism—"let the light in" articulates the thesis a bit too directly. The piece avoids outright sermonizing but the thematic machinery is visible, limiting the sense of discovery.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Single third-person POV anchored to Elias throughout; distance is stable and clean. The perceptual signature—"fire escape gardener," noticing jasmine, rosebush, moonlight—is consistent and character-specific. Dialogue is sparse but purposeful: Mara's "Why?" and Elias's reply carry subtext without overexplaining. The phrase "wistfully pragmatic understanding" drifts slightly into elevated register for Elias's interior voice, and "protected vulnerability" as a final-beat label reads as thematic tell. Otherwise, voice remains controlled and the prose reflects Elias's patient, observant stance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally good. However, several phrases loop or lean on stock metaphor: "quivering hush" appears twice, "with the rhythm of oars in water" is repeated, and "the moon casting a silver path" / "moonlight sharpened the edges" recycle the same visual. The phrase "protected vulnerability hanging in the air like mist" in the penultimate paragraph is abstract and tonally elevated, blurring the concrete image. No major scaffolding or template cadence, but the symbolic language clusters in the closure third, dulling immediacy slightly. Modest −0.6 for pattern repetition and elevated abstraction near the end.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The fire escape gardener pursuing light in a harbor town offers a specific, grounded premise. The bitting gauge as talisman and the geranium gesture add particular detail. However, the emotional arc—lonely widow softened by persistent kindness—follows a familiar template, and the window-opening closure is a well-worn symbol for emotional breakthrough. The piece does not transform the trope through unexpected complication or a non-obvious moral cost. Competent synthesis but lacks the fresh inflection or risk-taking that would elevate originality into the high 7s.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elias is present throughout and his decision to visit Mara drives the middle and ending beats. His choices (taking the gauge, knocking, opening the window, humming) create the key turns. He is active rather than merely observant, and his persistence shapes the closure. Setup is immediate, development occurs in the dock reflection and the visit, and payoff is the window-opening moment. Causal pressure is present but modest; the element is functional across all three gates and drives at least two beats (dock decision, bait shop arrival and window), earning mid-6s for solid integration without indispensability.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The bitting gauge appears early (Elias pulls it out on the fire escape), is used at the dock (tapping rhythm), offered to Mara (dialogue beat), and tapped again at the window sill in the closure. Four distinct touches across setup, middle, and ending. However, its role is primarily symbolic—it does not constrain or enable a tactical choice beyond serving as conversation catalyst. Swappable with another small tool (key, coin, carved stone) without structural loss. Solid presence and recurrence lift it to mid-5s, but lack of mechanical necessity or irreplaceability caps it below 7.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Quivering hush" appears twice as atmospheric description: once in paragraph two ("The quivering hush of the night amplified his resolve") and once near the end ("the quivering hush between them was almost audible"). It labels mood rather than shaping stakes or altering tactics. The concept does not constrain Elias's choices or change Mara's options—it is ornamental tone-setting. Present and thematically consistent, but replaceable and not causally active, earning low 3s.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Wistfully pragmatic" appears once in paragraph two as a descriptor for Elias's understanding. It characterizes his motivation but does not constrain or enable a specific on-page action with visible cost. The attribute is told rather than demonstrated through a trade-off or difficult choice. Label-only mention without behavioral instantiation trends low-mid 4s.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Instill" is invoked once: Elias wants the gauge "to instill something else—a rhythm, a pulse, a reason to keep going." The action is internalized and abstract rather than a visible decision point. The tapping and humming that follow could be read as attempts to instill rhythm, but the verb itself does not drive a turn or redefine options—it describes intent more than enacted pressure. Functional but swappable, mid-4s.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"With the rhythm of oars in water" appears twice: Elias taps the gauge "with the rhythm of oars" at the dock and again hums "with the rhythm of oars in water" at the window. The method is signaled in the middle and reprised at closure, framing the ending image. However, the mechanics do not alter tactics or constrain choices—it is a recurring motif rather than a means that shapes outcome. Two-beat reprise with thematic coherence earns mid-5s, but lack of causal necessity prevents higher score.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The "luminous harbor by moonlight" is established in the opening and referenced throughout (docks, moon casting silver path, moonlight flooding the shop). The harbor provides spatial grounding and the moonlight charges the window-opening closure when it "flood[s] in." The setting does not pressure choices or supply tactical resources, but the moonlight motif reweights the final image, lifting the score. Setup, atmosphere, and closure linkage without tactical constraint earns low-6s.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"After the final petal drops from the old rosebush" opens the story and returns in Elias's line to Mara: "after the final petal drops, you still have to water the stem." The timeframe is metaphorical rather than a live clock that tightens decisions. It frames theme but does not impose urgency or alter tactics. Present at setup and reprised thematically at closure, but not a pressure mechanism, mid-4s.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elias's desire "to reflect light into dark corners" is stated in paragraph two and dramatized through his visit to Mara, the geranium memory, and the window-opening act. The motivation drives his choices across multiple beats and shapes the closure. However, there is minimal on-page friction between this want and competing costs—he pursues it steadily without visible trade-off or resistance that would raise the stakes. Motivation is clear and causal but lacks conflicted tension, earning mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Protected vulnerability" is named once in the penultimate paragraph ("protected vulnerability hanging in the air like mist") and coheres with the gentle, cautious tone throughout—Elias's soft knock, Mara's wary acceptance, the hesitant opening. Tone is consistent and modulates slightly as Mara softens, supporting the ending's quiet charge. However, the phrase itself is abstract and appears late as a label rather than being embodied earlier. Coherent mood with modest closure charge but label-reliant, mid-5s.</comment>
