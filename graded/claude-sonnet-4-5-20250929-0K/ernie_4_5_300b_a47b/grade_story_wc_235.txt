<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's interiority is dense and particular—"feral nostalgia," jealousy of past selves, jaded wonder—but the protagonist largely observes and reflects rather than making charged micro-choices under pressure. The scroll-reading and climb unfold as discovery beats, not genuine dilemmas that force contradictory impulses into collision. The final "bittersweet clarity" is asserted rather than earned through a dramatized trade-off with visible cost. Internal contradiction is promised but not sufficiently shown in a moment where competing desires force a genuine sacrifice on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation arrives promptly (mountain cabin, grave, Elias, present tense). The structure is causal in skeleton—grave leads to scroll, scroll to climb, climb to pedestal—but linkage reads more as mysterious discovery than because/therefore pressure. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration: the jealousy fades into "strange, bittersweet clarity" and the realization "I wasn't trapped in the past; I was building it." However, the cost is conceptual and abstract; no on-page action, forfeiture, or reweighted image makes the price undeniable. The final paragraph tells the shift rather than showing a choice or image that forecloses a prior path.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The mountain cabin, snow, weathered logs, pine resin, and ice-slick crevice are vivid and filtered through Elias's jaded lens. The birch bark scroll and the pedestal inside the fissure function as micro-settings that guide the sequence. The ledge and the blank scroll at the end charge the final image, pushing this toward the 7+ band. Spatial choreography is clean; sensory selection reflects urgency during the climb.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—reconciling "chronological confusion" and escaping the weight of past selves—is signaled early. Pressure accumulates through the scroll's discovery, the ritual instructions, and the arduous climb, but escalation reads more as mystical unveiling than agency-driven tightening. The protagonist follows clues rather than making a charged choice that narrows options. The ending dissolves jealousy into acceptance without an on-page act or visible price; the "feral nostalgia" reframes as compass, but no path is foreclosed with felt cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Theme—reconciling past and present, nostalgia as compass rather than trap—emerges from the grave, scroll, and jealousy of past selves. The birch bark and the blank scroll form a purposeful motif arc. However, the final insight is stated rather than imaged: "I wasn't trapped in the past; I was building it" reads as thesis summary, not a resonant reconfiguration arising from concrete particulars. The piece avoids overt moralizing but the closure leans explanatory, lowering thematic charge.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature—jaded wonder, feral nostalgia, the chronicler's curse of forgetting. Diction is controlled and literary ("specter of smoke and memory," "liminal space between breaths") without register breaks. No dialogue appears, so those bullets are N/A. Reflection is heavy but anchored to present stimuli (grave, scroll, climb) and does not obscure the present frame. Free indirect style is clean; psychic distance remains consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose is clear and rhythmic with strong imagery ("bruised purples and oranges," "green-eyed monster fed by the ghosts"). Figurative density is high but mostly coherent. Minor loop: "I'd always been chronologically confused" restates the premise without added pressure. Template cadence appears in the scroll-reading beats: "The scroll read...," "The note beside it read...," "it read..." across adjacent paragraphs. Information density is good; no major clarity loss, but the loops and stem repetition prevent entry to 7.5+.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The premise—lucid dream chronicler finds his own grave, follows ritual clues, reconciles with past selves—synthesizes familiar mystical-realism and self-confrontation tropes without a sharp angle. The birch bark scroll, the mountain ritual, and the jealousy of past selves are vivid particulars, but the arc (discovery → climb → realization) follows a recognizable template. Emotional honesty is present; the ending's acceptance feels earned in tone but not transformed by a non-obvious turn.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Lucid dream chronicler frames Elias's identity and "chronicler's curse" (forgetting his own acts). He reads the scroll, climbs, and places the blank scroll beside the birch bark, but these are discovery actions rather than charged choices. The profession colors perception but does not constrain a key turn with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Birch bark scroll appears in three beats: discovered under floorboard, carried during climb, placed beside blank scroll at pedestal. It delivers the ritual instructions and triggers the climb. The final placement enables the words to "flow," charging the closure moment. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage, but the scroll's unique properties (birch bark vs. paper) are ornamental; a generic scroll would function identically.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Feral nostalgia is named early and drives Elias's jealousy of past selves. The scroll describes it, the climb enacts it, and the ending reframes it as compass. It shapes the dominant stake but is more thematic motif than on-page constraint that alters tactics. The final realization turns on it, lifting it to mid-band, but the concept is told more than dramatized in choice-points.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Chronologically confused is stated ("memories a jumbled tapestry of past and present, dreams and reality") and explains the grave's presence, but it does not constrain an on-page action with visible cost. The trait colors perception but remains label-level; no moment shows the confusion forcing a tactical error or trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Soar" appears in the scroll's dream description, the ritual note ("To soar, you must first fall"), and the ledge backstory ("where you first learned to fly"). The ending shifts "soar" to metaphor: "every soaring, stumbling step." It seeds expectation and charges the final image but is not enacted on the page as a physical or decisive action. Reprise with reweighted meaning lands it in mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Jealousy of past selves is signaled early ("Jealous of the past selves I'd left behind"), drives the middle climb ("I hated them all...for their clarity"), and is resolved at the end ("the jealousy faded, replaced by...clarity"). It shapes the emotional arc and the scroll's content. The method is more internal state than enacted tactic, but it threads through all three gates and participates in closure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Mountain ranger cabin is the opening anchor and houses the birch bark scroll discovery. The ledge and ice-crevice force the arduous climb and frame the pedestal scene. The setting supplies obstacles (snow, climb, cold) that test Elias physically and shapes the ritual sequence. Strong setup and development; the cabin itself does not return at closure, capping the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The grave ("after seeing your own grave") is the inciting image and frames the story's opening irony. The timeframe is post-discovery but does not impose a ticking clock or tighten decisions during the climb. The grave triggers reflection but does not constrain tactics or escalate pressure; it is setup without development or payoff in later beats.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"To distill its fractured rhythms into something resembling narrative" is stated as Elias's reason for coming to the cabin. The scroll and blank scroll reprise the chronicler's task. The motivation is present in setup and closure image but not tested by a conflicted choice on the page; the climb is driven by curiosity and nostalgia, not narrative distillation under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Jaded wonder is consistent throughout: "hollow sound," "jaded wonder," "strange, bittersweet clarity." Tone modulates from ironic detachment (grave discovery) to physical struggle (climb) to reflective acceptance (ending). The final image—"soaring, stumbling step"—carries the tone's blend of weariness and renewed possibility. Coherent and purposeful, lifting it into the 6+ band; the tone charges the ending without being indispensable to plot logic.</comment>
