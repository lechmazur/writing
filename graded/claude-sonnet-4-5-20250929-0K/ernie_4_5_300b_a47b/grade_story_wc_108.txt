<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Lila's phobias are asserted but never constrain a meaningful choice on the page—she sidesteps the enforcer with agility despite claiming fear of contact, and the genetic hand-me-down framing reads as label-only backstory. The enforcer's "composure cracked" moment lacks embodied reaction, and Marisol's entrance at the café feels like a curtain-call rather than earned reconciliation. Therapy-speak ("vulnerability is power") saturates the dialogue and interiority without dramatized cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The closure attempt—Lila withholding the shell from Marisol—lands weakly because the prior causality (decrypting notes, reciting them aloud to the enforcer) does not establish why this move would "outwit" him or lead to his confession weeks later; the arrest happens off-page via summary. Orientation is delayed: who Lila is and why she's in the library aren't anchored until the third paragraph, and the DNA-test reveal competes with the immediate library stakes. One meaningful tightening (enforcer arrival) exists, but the resolution bypasses on-page agency.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The rusted library and child's cast provide concrete anchors, and the aisles labeled *ACTION*, *ROMANCE*, *TRAGEDY* offer a purposeful frame. However, spatial choreography during the confrontation is vague—where Lila stands, how close the enforcer is, and how she exits remain unclear. The café setting in the final scene does no work; it's interchangeable postcard space.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake (proving vulnerability is power) is declared but never tested by a genuine on-page trade-off; Lila's phobias don't hinder her escape, and the enforcer's threat deflates the moment she recites the notes without consequence. The tightening (enforcer arrival) generates local tension, but the escalation bypasses protagonist agency—the mob boss's arrest happens off-page, and Marisol's reappearance lacks earned friction. Cost is asserted ("first, you have to earn it") but not dramatized.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The theme ("vulnerability is power") is stated three times in dialogue and narration rather than emerging from action. The whispering shell functions as a symbolic convenience rather than a motif that constrains choice, and the final café exchange moralizes instead of landing a resonant image. The "trembling certainty" phrase recurs as a label without shifting meaning across beats.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The prose maintains stable third-person limited focalization, and Lila's voice carries a consistent texture ("firmly adaptive despite her fears"). However, dialogue at peak moments ("You think vulnerability is weakness? It's not. It's a language") reads as thesis statement rather than goal-driven speech, and Marisol's single line ("You outwitted him") feels expository. Filter verbs cluster in the enforcer confrontation ("she saw a shadow," "she recognized his gait"), dulling immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Multiple paraphrase loops: "phobia-ridden" → "her phobias weren't weaknesses" → "genetic hand-me-downs" restates the same content across three sentences without added pressure. Template cadence appears in the enforcer beat: "She slid… then shoved… The enforcer stepped… his gun glinting." Stock metaphors ("voice smooth as poison," "stars sharp above") and the therapy-label phrase "vulnerability is power" recur without transformation. Information density is uneven—backstory paragraphs summarize rather than advance present stakes.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The premise (stunt double with inherited phobias decrypts notes to outwit mob enforcer) combines multiple elements but does not transform them—the DNA reveal, whispering heirloom, and library archive feel stitched rather than synthesized. The "vulnerability is power" thesis echoes widely used writing-prompt framing without a fresh inflection, and the enforcer's off-page confession resolves the plot with convenience rather than earned ingenuity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Lila is present throughout but her phobias do not constrain a key choice—she evades the enforcer despite claimed fear of contact, and the final withholding of the shell from Marisol is asserted rather than earned by prior friction.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The shell appears in the opening paragraph, is held up during the confrontation, and sits on the café table at the end, but its "whispering" never alters tactics or shapes a decision on the page; it functions as atmospheric prop rather than causal pivot.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Transformative betrayal (mother's faked death, DNA reveal) is backstory context rather than present-tense pressure; it does not narrow Lila's options in the library beat or at closure, where the theme statement replaces dramatized transformation.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Firmly adaptive" is labeled twice ("firmly adaptive despite her fears," "trembling with certainty") but does not constrain or enable a visible action with cost; Lila's sidestepping and script-hurling are generic evasion moves unconnected to this trait.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Outwitting is declared ("You outwitted him") and mentioned in the news article, but the on-page confrontation—reciting notes aloud—does not demonstrate tactical superiority; the enforcer's confession happens off-page weeks later, severing cause from effect.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Decrypting smudged notes is signaled ("Lila… had learned to read chaos like a script") and executed in the middle beat, but the mechanics ("traced the smudges, her fingers decoding") remain opaque, and the decrypted content (three short phrases) does not visibly reshape her tactics or the enforcer's response in scene.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The rusted library under stars frames the opening and provides the child's cast as a discovery object, but it does not constrain Lila's choices or supply resources that alter the outcome; the café in the final scene is interchangeable space.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"After discovering you're not who you thought" is referenced in paragraph two but does not tighten present decisions; the DNA test result is backstory exposition, and the weeks-later café scene bypasses the immediate timeframe pressure entirely.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"To prove that vulnerability is power" is stated three times in dialogue and narration, but the desire is never dramatized through conflicted choice—Lila's actions (evading, reciting notes, withholding the shell) do not test the trade-off between vulnerability and self-protection on the page.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Trembling certainty" appears in the enforcer beat ("her legs trembling with certainty") and in the café ("a trembling certainty in her eyes"), maintaining coherence, but the tone does not modulate under pressure—Lila's inner voice remains declarative and thesis-driven rather than shifting between fear and resolve in the confrontation.</comment>
