<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lirael's motivation is clear—she pursues forbidden knowledge—but her interior voice is marred by abstract phrasing ("atoms of nostalgia clung to ruins like lichen") that reads ornamental rather than embodied. The confrontation with Kael offers a brief glimpse of contradiction (her sworn method versus the archive's pull), but the conflict dissolves without forcing a micro-choice that constrains her path. The final gesture of walking deeper is more declaration than earned renunciation; no visible cost forecloses an option on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation is adequate: who (Lirael), where (archive/pagoda), and when (twilight) anchor by the opening lines. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: density builds through sensory layering and the pagoda's glow. Closure reads as Charged Poise—Lirael embraces the unknown and walks deeper—but the cost remains asserted rather than dramatically visible; we are told she "found her purpose" without a prior constraint she visibly forfeits. One meaningful deepening occurs (the pagoda's hum and light bath), meeting the 600–800 requirement, but the because/therefore linkage between the light and her final choice is thin.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The bronze prism pagoda is vividly rendered (carvings, shimmer, glow) and anchors the scene spatially. Sensory detail is selective—dust motes, twilight slant, metallic taste of Kael's fear—and reflects Lirael's priorities. The pagoda's warmth under her palm offers a tactile micro-constraint, but the environment does not visibly alter her options or tactics; she kneels, traces, places her hand, then walks. The "atoms of nostalgia" phrase recurs but remains metaphorical rather than a concrete spatial element that constrains choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—pursuit of forbidden knowledge versus the elders' warning—is signaled early and coherent. The pagoda's hum and glow provide one tightening moment that deepens Lirael's resolve, meeting the minimal 600–800 escalation requirement. Agency appears in her decision to embrace the light and walk deeper, but the cost is not legible on the page; no live option is foreclosed, no resource spent, no relationship severed. Kael's departure is unexplained and feels like a convenience rather than a consequence of Lirael's choice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Theme—innocence versus curiosity, the archive as seed not tomb—emerges from image and action rather than explicit moralizing. The final image (walking deeper, saffron veil fluttering) offers a non-literal answer to the central question without a stated moral. "Atoms of nostalgia" recurs with shifting weight, though the metaphor remains abstract. The ending avoids the explain-everything trap, but the thematic resonance is muted by the lack of visible cost; Lirael's "purpose" is asserted rather than earned through prior sacrifice or trade-off.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-person limited on Lirael. Diction leans elevated ("anguished joy," "latent violence," "sour and metallic") and occasionally slips into prompt-echo phrasing ("steadily unpredictable nature of truth"). Dialogue with Kael is functional but generic; his lines ("You think you're immune?") lack subtext or distinct idiom. The narrative voice reads more like committee consensus than Lirael's singular perceptual filter; her professional historian lens does not shape what she notices under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Figurative language is dense without pattern-teaching: "atoms of nostalgia," "ghosts glow," "anguished joy" appear in quick succession, diluting impact. Paraphrase loops are present—"the pagoda's surface shimmered" and "the pagoda suddenly hummed" restate the object's aliveness without added pressure. Template cadence: "She had come… She had noticed… She had pursued…" across multiple paragraphs. The final beat ("She stood, her saffron veil fluttering…") uses stock imagery. Artifacts touch the closure, triggering the −1.7 baseline and global 9+ disqualification.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The premise—historian at forbidden archive, elder warnings, glowing artifact—follows a familiar template without transformation. "Atoms of nostalgia" and "bronze prism pagoda" offer surface novelty but function as ornamental labels rather than irreplaceable mechanics. The emotional arc (curiosity → confrontation → embrace of unknown) is generic; swapping names and setting would leave the structure unchanged. No bold risk heightens stakes; the middle-ground choice (walk deeper, no visible cost) avoids decisive transformation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Lirael is present throughout and makes the final choice to walk deeper. She appears in setup, traces carvings and converses with Kael (development), and walks into the archive (closure). However, her choices are more declarations than decisions that narrow options; she does not forfeit a live alternative or spend a resource. Two integration gates clear (setup, payoff), but middle development is thin—her palm-touch does not alter tactics. Causal pressure is modest.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The bronze prism pagoda at twilight anchors setup (opening lines), is handled twice (Lirael traces carvings, places palm), and the glow charges the ending. Three gates clear. The object's shifting carvings and warmth shape Lirael's resolve, though the mechanics remain abstract. Removing it would collapse the story's spatial and symbolic center, elevating irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Atoms of nostalgia" appears in setup and closure as a recurring image but remains ornamental metaphor—it does not constrain a choice or alter tactics. The phrase is told twice without dramatized pressure. Two gates (setup, closure reprise), but no middle development or causal work. Swappable with any poetic abstraction.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Steadily unpredictable" is attributed to "the nature of truth" in setup, but the trait never constrains or enables an on-page action. The pagoda's behavior (shifting carvings, hum) could reflect unpredictability, but the link is not made explicit on the page. One gate (setup mention), no development or closure participation. Label-only.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Purify" appears in setup ("to purify its secrets by avoiding patterns") and is echoed in dialogue ("purify the chaos"), but the action never manifests in a dramatized beat. Lirael does not perform purification; she traces, touches, and walks. The verb could be swapped for "understand" or "decode" without structural loss. Setup gate only; no development or closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"By avoiding patterns" is mentioned in setup as Lirael's method but never demonstrated. The carvings shift, resisting categorization, yet Lirael does not adjust her approach on the page. The method is told, not shown. One gate (setup mention), no middle use, no closure linkage. Easily replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The lost civilization archive frames the entire scene, anchors setup, provides the pagoda and carvings (development), and is the space Lirael walks deeper into (closure). Three gates clear. The setting supplies symbolic resources (glowing carvings, hum) that deepen her resolve, though it does not impose a hard constraint or alter tactics. Removing it would dismantle the story's frame.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>"The end of innocence" is mentioned mid-story in Lirael's dialogue and returned to in the penultimate paragraph ("behind her now"), but the timeframe does not tighten decisions or create urgency. The story unfolds in a single twilight scene; no clock pressures choices. Setup and closure reprise earn two gates, but no causal pressure or cost linkage. Thematic ornament.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Lirael's pursuit of forbidden knowledge drives setup (she comes to the archive despite warnings), is tested in dialogue with Kael (development), and culminates in walking deeper (closure). Three gates clear. The desire is dramatized through her actions, though the friction between want and cost is asserted more than felt—no visible price forfeits an alternative path. Moderate causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Anguished joy" is named twice (setup and mid-story) but not tonally embodied across beats. The prose alternates between declarative exposition and abstract lyricism without modulating under pressure. The final image ("open arms") leans toward resolution rather than the charged contradiction the phrase promises. Two gates (setup, thematic mention), but tonal coherence is weak and does not charge closure.</comment>
