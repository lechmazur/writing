<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's interiority is present but often conveyed through abstract statements ("restless energy that coiled in her chest") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final "smile" feels unmotivated after the compressed journey—no visible cost forecloses a path. Her obsession with the postcards drives the plot but her actual choices (climbing scaffolding, tracing patterns, painting shadows) lack genuine stakes or trade-offs that test commitment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The piece spans months ("across the melting of winter's last snow" through "By summer") via summary rather than a coherent scene or two-shard structure, violating scope defaults without teaching a mosaic pattern. Orientation is delayed: who Mara is and what she's restoring isn't anchored until after the postcards are introduced. The closure—Mara smiling as "the window's final layer remained etched but unbroken, a promise of mysteries yet to unfold"—offers no decisive change or felt cost; it's an open promise that defers resolution off-page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The amber pavilion, cathedral window, and autumn leaves are vividly rendered with strong sensory detail. However, the setting functions primarily as backdrop; the window's etchings don't constrain Mara's choices in any beat—she traces them freely without resistance or spatial consequence. The "violet glow" appears late and resolves conveniently without prior setup that it would matter.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding her grandmother's postcards and the window's language—is signaled early but never tightens into genuine pressure. Mara's investigation proceeds without obstacle, reversal, or cost: she climbs, traces, paints, and catalogs across months with no failure or trade-off. The inscription "The dark nourishes what the light scorches" arrives as convenient revelation rather than earned discovery that alters her options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The theme of light/dark communion and "reckoning with the hush" emerges through repeated images (night-blooming jasmine, bioluminescent murals, the moon's pull). However, the final paragraph states the theme overtly—"Flowers bloom at night not in defiance, but in communion"—rather than letting the ending image answer the question non-literally. The window as "a promise of mysteries yet to unfold" offers conceptual possibility but no resonant reconfiguration with felt cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>POV remains stable in third-person limited focused on Mara; voice is consistent with elevated diction ("umbral tenderness," "frosted lines...bold as veins"). Some filter verbs ("she felt," "she noticed") dull immediacy in peak moments. Dialogue with Sister Agatha is functional but lacks subtext or meaningful friction—Agatha simply provides exposition about Elias Thorn without resistance or complication.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Pervasive overwriting: "the amber pavilion...autumn leaves clung to the latticework like fiery confetti, their shadows stretching long"; "a hymn to the moon's pull, a confession from Elias Thorn about his own fear of being seen" stacks metaphors without clear propulsion. Template cadence in the middle: "She noticed...She'd started...She'd finally understood" across adjacent paragraphs. The summary compression ("Days passed. Mara returned...") and montage ("By summer, the pavilion's murals had transformed") replace dramatized beats with told progression, flattening momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The premise—artist deciphers ancestral mystery encoded in cathedral glass—follows a familiar template without strong transformation. The grandmother's cryptic note, the recluse designer Elias Thorn, and the glass etchings that shift meaning in different light are stock mystery elements assembled without fresh synthesis. Mara's final realization that "flowers bloom at night...in communion" restates the setup rather than offering a non-obvious inflection.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Mara (vivid mural artist) is present throughout and her painting connects to the closure theme, but her choices don't create key turns—she proceeds linearly from restoration to investigation to cataloging without reversals. Her decision to "paint not the jasmine, but the space around it" is told rather than shown altering tactics with cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The postcards appear in beats one (workbench), two (evening with Sister Agatha), and the final paragraph (cross-referencing with etchings). However, they function primarily as backstory anchor rather than active constraint—Mara doesn't handle them on-page or face friction from their content. The "cross-referencing" at the end is summary-only.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Dawning hush" (the liminal space between night and day) is named and used as Mara's "compass" but doesn't shape stakes or tactics—she visits the window at various times without the hush itself creating pressure or altering her approach. It remains thematic decoration rather than a functional constraint.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>"Quietly driven" is stated ("She was quietly driven, this much her peers knew") but not demonstrated through visible trade-offs or costs. The trait could be swapped for "obsessive" or "determined" without structural change; no on-page action shows her drive constraining another value or enabling a difficult choice.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Reckon" appears in the grandmother's note, Mara's reply to Sister Agatha ("I've only just begun to reckon"), and the final summary. It functions as thematic keyword rather than action that redefines options—Mara's actual investigation (tracing, cataloging, painting) could proceed identically without this verb.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The "hidden layers of etched glass" are signaled early (postcards depicting the window), examined in multiple beats (scaffolding climb, dawn/dusk visits, magnifying glass), and present at closure ("final layer remained etched but unbroken"). The mechanics matter—etchings shift in different light—but they don't create obstacle or cost, functioning more as puzzle to observe than means that alters tactics under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The amber pavilion frames the opening and closing images and houses Mara's restoration work. However, it doesn't pressure choices or supply resources that affect outcome—Mara's key investigation happens at the cathedral window on scaffolding, and the pavilion serves primarily as atmospheric anchor.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"Across the melting of winter's last snow" to "By summer" spans months via summary montage rather than a live clock that tightens decisions. Time passes without creating urgency or altering Mara's tactics; the seasonal progression is ornamental rather than functional constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The motivation—"to understand why flowers bloom at night"—is stated early, inherited from the grandmother, and revisited at closure. It drives Mara's investigation across beats but remains abstract: no on-page friction between this desire and competing costs (relationships, livelihood, safety) tests her commitment with visible trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Umbral tenderness" (honoring both light and dark) coheres through imagery (shadows, bioluminescence, night-blooming jasmine) and modulates somewhat with Mara's progression from trembling brush to confident cataloging. However, the tone remains static and elevated throughout rather than shifting under pressure; the final "Mara smiled" moment doesn't charge the tone with new cost or friction.</comment>
