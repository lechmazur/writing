<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Mara's interiority relies heavily on abstract labels ("precisely playful nature," "foresight matched only by hindsight") rather than embodied contradiction. The hologram sequence tells us she was "chosen" and explains her mind "dances between order and chaos," but we never see her make a micro-choice under conflicting impulses that costs her something on the page. The final walk outside feels declared rather than earned by prior causality; no visible cost forecloses a path. Therapy-speak and diagnostic self-awareness ("transcend," "integrate") flatten what should be crisis-driven embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation Test: who/where/when anchor by ~120 words (met). Drive lens appears Accumulative/Textural (storm energy, symbolic wafer seal, dream fragments) but never commits; the hologram exposition interrupts pattern-building and the ending toggles to a declarative epiphany rather than a charged image reweighting prior material. No on-page Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with legible cost; Mara "understood" and "smiled" but no path is foreclosed, no option narrowed, no felt price paid. The closure unit is an assertion ("to become its architect") not a dramatized shift. Cost proof test fails: I cannot point to a single sentence in the ending where a visible or felt cost lands.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The vine-draped bunker is vividly rendered (vines clawing through concrete, emerald glow in candlelight) and returns in the final image as ruins overgrown. However, the environment never constrains a choice or alters tactics; it remains atmospheric backdrop. The wafer seal is handled twice (heating, pocketing) but does not restrict options. Micro-setting and recurring object signal is present but neither charges the closure beat with unavoidable pressure. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered, but spatial choreography inside the bunker is underdeveloped (table, candle, no movement blocking).</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("why some paths choose their walkers") is signaled early but remains abstract and never tested by a concrete on-page dilemma. No meaningful tightening or deepening: the hologram explains the answer, Mara closes her eyes and "understood," then walks outside. No reversal, no trade-off, no visible price. Agency is passive reception (heating the seal, watching the hologram, inviting the storm) rather than a choice that forecloses a path. Under the attempted Accumulative lens, pressure does not cohere or escalate; the storm "broke" and "passed" without altering Mara's options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Theme (integration, paths choosing walkers, decay as renewal) emerges from recurring images but is over-articulated in the hologram's exposition and the final paragraph's meta-commentary ("a directive in motion, a hymn to the walkers who dare to listen"). The ending offers a stated moral rather than a resonant non-literal answer. Subtext in early sensory work (vines clawing concrete, bergamot and iron scent) is strong, but the closure beat abandons implication for explanation. Thematic Echo penalty: the hologram and final paragraphs articulate the thesis in prompt-like language ("transcend," "integrate," "precisely playful force"), especially egregious in the final paragraph (−0.7).</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present in early beats (candle flame trembling, rain on lashes like diamonds) but diction drifts into elevated, thesis-statement register during peak beats ("minds that dance between order and chaos," "a precisely playful force, reshaping the world one dream at a time"). Under peak stress (hologram revelation), narration shifts to abstract philosophizing rather than compressed, character-specific texture. The final paragraphs read as author commentary rather than Mara's lived perception. Free indirect style is mostly clean, but filter verbs ("she understood," "she saw") dull immediacy at closure without voice-motivated purpose.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and synonym churn are pervasive: "decay and renewal" / "decaying directive" / "bunker's decay mirrored the forest's growth" across adjacent paragraphs without pressure increase. Template cadence in the final section: "Somewhere, a directive decayed. And somewhere, a walker transcended..." is formulaic parallelism. Stock metaphors: "time was a river eroding," "cracks where light seeps through," "footsteps echoing in the rhythm of rebirth." Figurative density in most sentences of the hologram and closure beats (storm's fury, diamonds on lashes, path unfold, hymn to walkers) without pattern-teaching or payoff. Register drift into thesis-speak ("transcend," "integrate," "resonate") clashes with embodied detail. Patterned-artifact penalty pack: paraphrase loops, stock metaphor strings, register drift, touching closure beat (−1.7 in Q7; disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band entries at 8.8 per the artifact rule).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Core premise (protagonist decodes a sealed directive in a bunker during a storm via lucid dreaming) assembles multiple speculative/mystical tropes without a fresh synthesis. The hologram-as-exposition device and "paths choose their walkers" mysticism read as template philosophical fantasy. Emotional specifics (childhood decoding animal tracks, fleeing wildfire) are mentioned but not transformed into lived pressure. The ending's "woman who danced with storms" legend and wafer seal pressed into earth as promise are generic myth-making gestures. Transformation test fails: plot and arc could transfer to different names/places with minimal edits. Derivative Premise Guardrail: mystical directive + chosen-one revelation + symbolic integration journey matches widely used template; no lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus transforms it (−1.2 within Q8).</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Character: "foresight hindsight only" appears as a label ("foresight was matched only by her hindsight," "foresight and hindsight merging into a single, radiant point") but Mara's choices do not demonstrably hinge on this duality. She observes and receives exposition; no on-page decision traces causally to simultaneous foresight and hindsight. Ornamental use without action pressure. Missing middle development and closure participation; introduced early but does not constrain a beat. Cap 4.6 (missing setup of causal work), further reduced by ornamental/label-only use (−0.8) and swappability (−0.5).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Object: wafer seal is handled in two beats (heating to reveal hologram, pocketing as compass at dawn) and returns in the final image (pressed into earth). Early signal +0.5, two-beat involvement +0.9, closure linkage (final image) +0.9. However, the seal does not constrain a choice or enable a tactic under stress; its role is symbolic recurrence without causal pressure. Swappability moderate (could be a different relic) −0.5. Lyric resonance present (early symbol → final reprise reweights meaning) but lacks felt cost tied to the object itself. Gates: setup ✓, development (weak—only observed), payoff (cameo in legend, not causally active) ✗. Cap 2.8 for missing causal closure participation, but lyric-resonance allowance and two-beat handling lift to mid-5s. Additive: early +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure mention +0.4 (weak), specificity +0.3; subtractive: swappability −0.5, ornamental in middle −0.6.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Core Concept: "decaying directive" frames the quest (early signal +0.5) and is thematically echoed throughout ("the directive is not a command, but a question," "to become its architect," ruins overgrown). However, it does not change on-page options or constrain tactics; Mara heats the seal and the directive explains itself via hologram. Development beat (hologram revelation) is summary exposition, not a choice-altering constraint. Closure participation is thematic (ruins) but ornamental. Gates: setup ✓, development (thematic only) ✗, payoff (thematic cameo) weak. Swappability moderate (could be another mystery) −0.5, ornamental use −0.7, summary-only revelation −0.5. Base ~3.0 + early signal +0.5 + three thematic mentions +0.6 − ornamental/swap/summary −1.7 = ~2.4, but thematic coherence across beats lifts slightly to 4.1.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>Attribute: "precisely playful" is a label-only descriptor ("Her precisely playful nature made her both analyst and artist") without on-page embodiment. No action or micro-choice traces causally to this trait; it does not constrain or enable a move with visible cost. Missing all three gates: no setup dramatization, no middle beat shaped by it, no closure linkage. Label-only mention −0.8, swappability (could describe many puzzle-solvers) −0.6, ornamental −0.7. Base 3.0 − 2.1 cumulative = capped at ornamental band, ~2.6.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Action: "transcend" appears as a verb in narration ("to transcend was not to escape, but to integrate") and final summary ("a walker transcended"). The lucid-dreaming sequence (inviting the storm into her mind, surging images) gestures at transcendence, but the action itself is told rather than dramatized with a cost. No major turn traces causally to the moment of transcending; the hologram already provided the answer. Gates: setup (implied in directive) weak, development (dream sequence) summary, payoff (stated in ending) weak. Swappability high (could be "understand," "realize," "awaken") −0.7, summary-only −0.7, late thematic mention in final third −0.4. Base 3.0 + thematic presence +0.6 − 1.8 = ~1.8, but dream-sequence gesture lifts to 3.7.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Method: "through interpreted dreams" is signaled early ("transcended waking life through lucid dreaming") and returns in the storm-peak sequence where Mara closes her eyes and images surge (wolf, river, child). However, the mechanics never matter on the page; the hologram delivers the answer before the dream sequence, and the surging images are summarized symbol-catalog without affecting a choice. Gates: setup ✓, development (dream sequence is decorative) ✗, payoff (theme-only) ✗. Summary-only use −0.7, swappability (could be meditation or vision) −0.6, ornamental middle beat −0.6. Base 3.0 + early signal +0.5 − 1.9 = ~1.6, but thematic coherence and one beat of surging images lift to 3.2.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Setting: "vine-draped bunker hidden in a rewilded forest" is vividly present across the piece (opening, storm beats, final image as ruins). Early signal +0.7, three or more descriptive beats +1.4, closure linkage (ruins overgrown) +0.7. However, the setting never constrains a choice or alters tactics; it is atmospheric backdrop without causal pressure. Swappability moderate (could be another ruin) −0.5, ornamental use −0.8. Gates: setup ✓, development (descriptive only) weak, payoff (thematic image) weak. Base 3.0 + early +0.7 + beats +1.4 + closure +0.7 − ornamental/swap −1.3 = ~4.5, but vivid sensory specificity and recurring presence lift to 5.3.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Timeframe: "when the storm approaches" is signaled early ("storm approached," "storm's low growl") and the storm breaks mid-story, then passes by dawn. Two beats (approach, break/pass) +0.9, early signal +0.5. However, the storm does not tighten a decision or alter tactics; it amplifies Mara's connection (told, not shown constraining a choice) and then resolves off-page. No live clock that forces a trade-off. Gates: setup ✓, development (thematic intensifier) weak, payoff (dawn aftermath) weak. Ornamental middle use −0.6, swappability (any atmospheric event) −0.5. Base 3.0 + early +0.5 + two beats +0.9 − ornamental/swap −1.1 = ~3.3, but thematic coherence (storm as catalyst) and presence across three time-markers lift to 4.8.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Motivation: "to discover why some paths choose their walkers" is stated explicitly as Mara's directive and frames the quest. Early signal +0.7, thematic presence across beats +0.9. However, the desire is told rather than dramatized in conflicted choices; no on-page friction between this want and a competing cost. The hologram answers the question, and Mara accepts without struggle. Gates: setup ✓, development (received answer, no conflict) ✗, payoff (thematic acceptance) weak. Told-only trends −0.8, no friction between want and cost −0.7. Base 3.0 + early +0.7 + presence +0.9 − told/no-friction −1.5 = ~3.1, but thematic coherence and quest-framing lift to 4.3.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Tone: "ethereal grit" is present in the opening (vine-draped bunker, rewilded forest, dusty metal, storm's growl) and modulates with pressure (candle trembling, rain lashing, dawn filtered through vines). Early tonal anchors +0.7, coherence across turns +1.0, closure linkage (raindrops like diamonds, ruins softening into soil) +0.8. However, the final paragraphs shift to thesis-speak and lose grit; "ethereal" dominates without the grounded friction. Tonal drift in closure beat −0.6. Gates: setup ✓, development ✓, payoff (partial—drift) weak. Base 3.0 + early +0.7 + coherence +1.0 + closure +0.8 − drift −0.6 = ~4.9, but vivid sensory anchors and purposeful modulation in storm beats lift to 5.6.</comment>
