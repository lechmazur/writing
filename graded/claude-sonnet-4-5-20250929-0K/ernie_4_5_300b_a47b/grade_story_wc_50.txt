<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias demonstrates clear professional competence through methodical problem-solving, and his "peripherally focused" trait shows in concrete observation of light angles and micro-etchings. However, interiority remains largely in service of world-building rather than genuine contradiction—his wonder about "reason's cellar" being "another name for a grave" is acknowledged but never complicates a choice. The final smile and tool-packing feel satisfying but carry no visible cost or foreclosed path; he succeeds cleanly without renunciation or endurance that would earn Stasis.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first paragraph. The piece follows an accumulative lens: Elias maps the cavern's rhythms over repeated visits, discovers hidden etchings, and finally reassembles the timer in a tightening that restores the harvest. Yet closure—the timer humming, echoes captured, keepers waiting below—feels like mission-accomplished rather than a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration with felt cost. The "miracle" is declared rather than charged by a visible price or foreclosed option on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The marble cavern with quartz veins, light shifts at noon/midnight, and the mirror as a diagnostic tool all ground the setting concretely. The cavern functions as a living instrument whose acoustics shift with tidal rhythms, and light angles constrain Elias's method of revealing micro-etchings. The spiral staircase descent and "cellar of reason" motif appear at closure, lending spatial continuity, though the final image does not hinge on an environmental constraint in a way that would push the score higher.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—restoring the timer to preserve the harvest of echoes during the "wounded season"—is signaled early and remains coherent. Pressure accumulates through Elias's daily mapping and iterative discovery, culminating in the reassembly that succeeds. However, the climax presents no visible trade-off, renunciation, or complication; the last gear clicks into place and the device works. Under an accumulative lens one meaningful deepening suffices, but here success arrives without a felt price or narrowed option to elevate the band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The theme of capturing wonder versus imprisoning it emerges through concrete images: bottled echoes, the "cellar of reason," and Elias's question whether preservation is enough. The timer's surface—"cold, yet humming with latent energy"—and the final descent to the waiting keepers offer resonance without overt moralizing. Yet the ending does not reweight prior material; it confirms the premise rather than repricing it. The reflection "some doors open only when you stop looking directly at them" leans toward stated insight rather than earned image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable; perceptual signature (edges of things, sideways solutions) is character-specific and consistent. Diction is controlled, though phrases like "the lull of the wounded season" and "store wonder in the cellar of reason" occasionally drift toward elevated abstraction. The keepers' dialogue—"Wonder is a fragile thing… before it evaporates"—feels purposeful and thematic rather than strained. Psychic distance is steady, and the closing "he'd learned that some doors…" stays within Elias's idiom without head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high; the opening paragraph establishes cavern, character, and object efficiently. However, several lines loop or paraphrase: "He'd done it. Not by force, but by listening…" restates the peripherally-focused method already shown. Template cadence appears in sequences like "He worked methodically… The mirror was key… These etchings, he realized…" Stock phrasing—"a puzzle for a man," "a testament to the idea"—and the final clause "And in doing so, he'd learned…" flatten momentum slightly in non-closure beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The "harvest of echoes" concept and the locksmith-as-diagnostician angle offer a fresh synthesis, and the use of reflection angles and light-timing to decode a mechanism is specific. Yet the emotional arc—competent craftsman solves puzzle, restores ancient device—follows a familiar template without transformation: no moral calculus complicates success, and the keepers' waiting poses no dilemma. The "peripherally focused" trait and "wounded season" metaphor add texture but do not subvert or deepen the premise in a way that feels inevitable only in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias appears in setup, drives all middle problem-solving beats (mapping light, discovering etchings, reassembling gears), and completes the task at closure. His "reflective" and "peripherally focused" nature shapes his method—studying edges, using the mirror—and his interior musing about wonder versus reason colors tone. However, his choices do not create a reversal or cost; he succeeds linearly. Strong beat involvement and closure linkage, but no trade-off or foreclosed path drops the score from the 8+ band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The timer mechanism is discovered in the opening, examined repeatedly (scattered gears, hidden compartment, micro-etchings, reassembly), and activated at closure with the humming and echo-harvest payoff. Its evolving state—broken → mapped → whole—alters Elias's tactics across beats. The final image of crystalline vials and the keepers labeling them recharges the object's meaning. Strong causal and closure work, though the device itself does not impose a cost or constraint that would push higher.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Harvest of echoes" is defined early, frames the keepers' desperation, and the restored timer captures echoes in vials at closure—setup, development, payoff present. The concept shapes the dominant stake (restore the harvest) and the cavern's acoustics provide texture. However, the harvest functions more as mission objective than as a constraint that narrows Elias's options or forces a choice with cost. Its presence is purposeful but not indispensable to story logic.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Peripherally focused" is labeled in the opening and demonstrated through Elias's sideways problem-solving: noticing reflection angles, studying edges rather than centers, discovering the hidden etchings. It enables his success but does not constrain him or create a trade-off; the trait is purely advantageous. The final line—"some doors open only when you stop looking directly at them"—restates the attribute thematically. Present across beats with modest causal weight, but no visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Reverse-engineering is signaled early ("he'd reverse-engineered its design"), demonstrated through studying reflection angles and micro-etchings, and culminates in the reassembly that restores function. The action is specific to Elias's skill and drives the major turn (discovery of hidden instructions → successful restoration). Swapping it for generic "repair" would lose narrative texture. Strong integration, though the process itself does not impose a visible cost or dilemma.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Studying reflection angles at noon and midnight is introduced early, used to reveal the hidden compartment and micro-etchings, and the mirror technique recurs in middle beats to guide reassembly. The method is specific and shapes Elias's problem-solving tactics. It appears across setup, development, and payoff. However, the mechanics never impose a constraint or failure that forces adaptation, keeping the score below the 8+ band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The marble cavern with quartz veins and shifting light is established in the opening, provides the mechanism for revealing etchings (noon/midnight angles), and houses the closure event. Its acoustics—described as a "living instrument" with tidal shifts—texture the world and justify the harvest concept. The spiral staircase and cellar anchor the ending spatially. The setting is purposeful and integral, though it does not constrain a peak choice or force a trade-off in a way that would reach the 8.5+ band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"The wounded season" and "across the lull" are introduced early and frame the timeframe poetically. Elias returns "daily" over an unspecified span, and the season's wound "begins to scab over" as he nears completion. The passage of time is acknowledged but not tracked with urgency or deadlines; it functions as thematic texture rather than a live constraint that tightens tactics. Setup and closure presence, minimal development pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The keepers task Elias with restoring the timer "to store wonder in the cellar of reason, for later," and he muses whether the cellar is "another name for a grave." The motivation frames his work and recurs in the ending image of keepers labeling vials. However, Elias's interior friction—preservation versus entombment—does not complicate a choice or create visible cost. The desire is told and thematically present but not dramatized as a want-versus-cost conflict in action.</comment>
