<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Kael's core motivation—following light to understand time's texture—registers on the page, but his interiority leans heavily on abstract philosophizing ("every verse you abandon is a thread left loose") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The rope-untying sequence provides embodied action, yet the final realization feels delivered by the being's exposition rather than earned through Kael's own micro-choices under pressure. The "ethically playful" label appears once without constraining a single on-page decision with visible cost, reducing it to ornamental description.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors arrive late—who Kael is and why he's at the grotto emerge piecemeal across the first third, delaying stakes legibility (−0.4 per Orientation Test). The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: density builds through rope-unraveling and grotto-wall transformations toward a final spiral image that reweights the premise. However, the closure unit—"the texture of time is not in the choices you make, but in the patterns they leave"—is told rather than shown, and the conceptual cost remains oblique; no on-page forfeiture or constraint crystallizes (Cost proof test failure: −0.5). The piece teaches its lyric pattern early enough, but the ending rests on assertion.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The terra-cotta grotto is vividly anchored with sensory specificity ("baked by centuries of sun," "walls glowed like ancient skin"), and the rope's frayed texture recurs across beats. The grotto's transforming walls—clay peeling to reveal constellations—charge the final image by externalizing Kael's internal pattern, satisfying the Q3 9+ gate's requirement that setting constrain or charge closure. Spatial choreography remains coherent throughout the single location.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding time's texture—is signaled early and tightens once when Kael begins untying knots, narrowing his options from passive observation to active unraveling. Yet escalation depends heavily on the being's prompts rather than Kael's agency; the choice to untie versus cut is proposed but not forced by prior pressure. The final spiral offers a reweighting, but no live option is foreclosed on the page with felt cost—Kael gains insight without visible trade-off or renunciation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the rope's knots and the spiral pattern rather than direct statement, and the grotto's transformation mirrors Kael's internal search without overt allegory. The being's line "impossible choices are the loom of existence" echoes the prompt's "impossible choices" too closely (Thematic Echo: −0.5), and the final image—"the patterns they leave"—verges on platitude without a concrete, non-obvious synthesis. The piece resists tidy moralizing, yet the insight remains abstract rather than rooted in a specific human complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Kael's perceptual signature—ink-stained fingers, scribbling in dust—grounds voice early, and diction ("ethically playful," "molten gold") maintains a consistent lyric register. The being's dialogue, however, converges with narration's elevated syntax ("You are a weaver of maybes"), flattening voice distinction. Free indirect style is clean, and no head-hopping occurs. Psychic distance remains stable, though the being's disembodied warmth lacks a distinct idiom beyond wise-guide archetype.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Multiple prose artifacts cluster in high-pressure beats: paraphrase loops ("Each knot was a choice he didn't make" / "Each one released a memory—a failed poem, a lost friend, a road not taken"), template cadence in the being's speeches, and elevated diction clashing with urgency ("the gravity of his choices" during peak decision). Filter-verb stacks appear but remain voice-motivated. Figurative density is high without pattern-teaching payoff—"tapestry," "loom," "weaver," "threads" appear in most sentences of the climax beat without evolving (Overwriting density penalty: −0.5). Clarity holds, but momentum drags under repetitive metaphor.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Core premise—poet meets energy beings, unravels rope to understand time—closely follows template "metaphysical encounter → symbolic object → abstract epiphany" without transformation through lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus (Derivative Premise Guardrail: −0.8). The rope's prison-escape backstory offers specificity, yet remains ornamental; the thief/fugitive/father backstory is told, not dramatized. The grotto transformation and spiral finale feel inevitable only in their symbolic logic, not through character-specific causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Kael is present throughout and makes one key choice—untying the knots—but the decision is prompted by the being's challenge rather than arising from his own prior pressure. His "drifting roadside poet" identity shapes voice and sensory filter but does not constrain the central choice with visible cost. Setup and closure participation are present; middle development is passive observation. Causal pressure is weak.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The rope appears in beat one (satchel inventory), beat two (Kael wonders if it holds a pattern), climax (untying sequence), and finale (unraveled spiral on grotto floor). Each appearance advances understanding and the final spiral directly shapes the closure image, reweighting the rope's meaning from escape tool to life-pattern map. However, the rope does not constrain Kael's choice—he could have refused or cut it—so causal pressure remains moderate. Strong closure linkage elevates the score.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Impossible choices" is named by the being ("Impossible choices are the loom of existence") but never dramatized on the page as a forced dilemma with competing costs. Kael's choice to untie versus cut is proposed, not pressure-tested; no on-page consequence follows either path. The concept functions as thematic echo rather than stake-shaping constraint, making it swappable with "difficult choices" or "layered decisions" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Ethically playful" appears once as label ("a sound both ethically playful and tinged with desperation") but never constrains or enables an on-page action with cost. No micro-choice reflects the trait's friction; Kael's decisions read as earnest and contemplative throughout. The attribute remains ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>"Pattern" drives multiple beats: the being identifies Kael as "weaver of maybes," the grotto walls shift to reveal constellation symbols matching Kael's scribbles, and the finale reweights time as patterns rather than threads. The concept is seeded early and returns with accumulated meaning at closure, shaping the resolution's logic. However, the action of pattern-recognition itself is delivered by the being's exposition rather than Kael's dramatized discovery, limiting causal independence.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Uncovering layers" is signaled through the rope's knots and the grotto's peeling clay walls, and the untying sequence literalizes the method in the climax. The mechanics matter—each knot releases a memory—but the method is told rather than demonstrated through embodied struggle or tactical adjustment. It shapes one key beat (the untying) without altering earlier attempts or forcing mid-course correction.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The terra-cotta grotto is anchored early with vivid sensory detail, its humming air and pulsing light patterns create immediate atmosphere, and the transforming walls (clay peeling to reveal constellations) directly charge the closure image by externalizing Kael's internal search. The setting constrains the scene spatially and supplies the visual logic for the finale's spiral pattern on the floor. Essential across beats and ending.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the energy beings arrive" is present—Kael follows their light at dusk, encounters one being in the grotto—but exerts no pressure on decisions. No clock tightens tactics; the beings' presence functions as backdrop rather than urgent constraint. The arrival catalyzes Kael's journey but does not escalate or force tempo. Functional setup without development or payoff pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"To discover the texture of time" is stated explicitly by Kael ("show me how to read the pattern") and the being ("You seek the texture of time"), and the untying sequence dramatizes one choice in service of that desire. However, no conflicting want—fear of what he'll find, cost of knowledge, competing obligation—creates friction. The motivation shapes the dominant stake and appears in closure, but remains uncontested, reducing felt cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Tone blends lyric elevation ("streaks of violet and molten gold," "woven from starlight") with grounded action (untying knots, pressing palm to clay), maintaining coherence across beats. Passion registers in Kael's urgency and the being's charged pronouncements, yet subtlety is uneven—some exchanges veer toward overt philosophizing. The finale's quiet spiral image modulates effectively, offering restraint after buildup. Tone supports closure without dominating or flattening.</comment>
