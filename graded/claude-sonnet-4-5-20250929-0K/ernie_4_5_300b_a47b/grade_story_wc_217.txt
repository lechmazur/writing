<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lira's interior is present but largely static—she observes, gathers, arranges, hums—without contradictory impulses or stakes-driven micro-choices that foreclose options. Her "warmly attentive" handling of the feather and her belief in harmonizing discord remain label-level; no on-page friction tests commitment or generates visible cost. The fisherman's silent nod and her smile register as sentiment rather than embodied pressure. Motivation is declared but not dramatized through conflicting desires under stress.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors quickly (cobalt lagoon, Lira, post-rain). The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: debris gathered, kelp woven, feather placed, song hummed, tapestry completed. However, no decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing with visible cost lands on the page—the tapestry's planned dissolution by morning is told in reflection, not dramatized. The kite-string snap functions as atmospheric cue rather than causal catalyst; removing it would not break the sequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The lagoon is vivid and modulates—post-rain silver veins, cobalt warming to gold-flecked, sunset amber and violet. Sensory detail (moss-stained rock, cool water, rustle of reeds) is selective and POV-filtered. The gathered storm debris (kelp, shell, reeds) serves the weaving action and charges the final image. Setting constrains choice minimally but supplies resources that shape the central activity, pushing the score into the mid-7s.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"to discover beauty in the incomplete"—is signaled early but remains conceptual; no live option is foreclosed, no on-page trade-off or cost materializes. The kite-string snap offers potential pressure but deflates into metaphor rather than complicating Lira's work. The tapestry completes without obstacle; the fisherman's nod affirms rather than challenges. Accumulative texture is present, but escalation and felt consequence are absent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Theme—transience, beauty in the incomplete, harmonizing discord—emerges through imagery (frayed kite string, woven kelp, drake's feather) and the act of tending. However, the final paragraphs over-articulate: "beauty was not a fixed state but a process," "the act of creation mattered more than its permanence." These statements replace scene pressure with exposition. The feather's resonance and the lagoon's rhythms provide some non-literal charge, lifting the score above mid-range despite the moralizing drift.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Single-POV distance is stable; diction carries a consistent lyric-contemplative register ("woven dawns," "threads spun from memory and light," "burnished hush"). Perceptual signature is calm and attentive, matching Lira's poet persona. However, elevated phrasing occasionally drifts into abstractness ("resonance of the drake's song—a creature said to dwell in the borderlands") and late-paragraph exposition flattens voice. No dialogue to judge. Rhythmic control is steady but does not modulate under pressure since pressure remains low.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Prose is mostly clear and fluid with varied sentence rhythm. Minor paraphrase loops appear: "a willingness to see harmony where others saw only fracture" / "harmonized the discord" recurs without added pressure. The phrase "woven dawns" is repeated but not concretely defined, creating slight opacity. Figurative density is high in contemplative beats ("threads spun from memory and light," "voice a bridge between chaos and calm") but does not obscure action. Information density is moderate; some lines reiterate theme rather than advance story.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The poet-as-harmonizer frame and the drake's feather carry some specificity, but the core arc—solitary artist creates ephemeral beauty from found objects—follows a familiar template without fresh inflection. The kite-string snap and fisherman's nod offer potential turns but remain underused. The "woven dawns" concept is evocative in label but generic in execution. No bold structural or perspectival risk; the piece opts for lyric safety over narrative surprise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Lira is present throughout, but her choices (gathering debris, arranging kelp, humming) are procedural rather than stake-altering. No moment where her decision narrows options or costs her something. She observes the kite fall and the fisherman nod without those inputs changing her path. Functional but low-agency.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The drake's tail feather appears in beat one (handled, traced), beat three (placed atop the kelp circle as anchor), and beat five (removed from pouch, held to fading light). It seeds expectation, shapes the woven design, and returns with mild reweighting ("pulsed with the lagoon's energy"). However, no causal pressure or visible cost ties to the feather; it could be swapped for another talismanic object. Solid mid-range integration.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Woven dawns" is mentioned twice as a thematic label ("a tapestry of woven dawns, threads spun from memory and light"; "The woven dawns, she knew, would unravel by morning") but never concretely defined or shown to alter tactics. It functions as poetic decoration rather than a stake-shaping concept. Present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Warmly attentive" appears once in beat two ("her fingers warmly attentive to the feather's texture"). It describes manner rather than enabling or constraining action with cost. No on-page tradeoff or tactical shift linked to this attribute. Label-only mention.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Tending (gathering debris, arranging kelp, weaving) structures beats two through four and leads to the completed tapestry. The act is central but procedural; no obstacle tests it, no alternative path is foreclosed. Removing "tend" and substituting "create" or "assemble" would leave the plot intact. Functional but not irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Harmonizing discord" is stated in beat one ("harmonize the world's discord"), enacted in beat three (kelp lattice from storm debris), and reflected in beat five ("harmonized the discord of the storm's aftermath"). The method is signaled and its mechanics appear, but no competing approach is dramatized or ruled out. Mid-low functional use.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The cobalt lagoon after rain is established immediately, modulates (silver veins, gold flecks, amber/violet sunset), supplies resources (storm debris: kelp, shell, reeds), and grounds the final wading scene. Sensory detail (cool water, rustle of reeds, lap of waves) is woven through action. The setting pressures choices minimally but charges the closure image. Strong integration.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The kite-string snap occurs in beat two, noted as a "reminder" but not followed by time-driven urgency. Midday and afternoon waning mark passage, but no deadline or ticking clock alters Lira's work. The timeframe is present as atmosphere, not as causal pressure. Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"To discover beauty in the incomplete" is stated in beat one and reflected throughout (broken shell, tangled kelp, frayed kite string). However, it remains a told thesis rather than a desire tested by conflicting wants or costs. No on-page friction between this motivation and another impulse. Present and consistent but not dramatized under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Burnished hush" is not named until beat six but the tone—quiet, contemplative, softly lyric—is consistent from the opening ("breathed softly," "quiet shoreline poet") through the ending ("fading pinks and oranges," "quiet rhythms"). Tone modulates gently with the lagoon's light shifts and charges the final image (feather held to fading light). Coherent and purposeful, though static rather than dynamically tensioned.</comment>
