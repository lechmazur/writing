<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lirael's motivation to compile fragments is clear and consistent, but her interior life remains thin—we see method more than contradictory impulse. The fisherman and young girl function as information vessels rather than pressure sources; their interactions feel transactional, not crucible moments that force Lirael to choose between competing goods. Embodied emotion is scarce; her reflective stance stays steady across all three sites without meaningful internal friction or visible cost to her patience.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes a clear accumulative/textural lens: Lirael revisits sites, collects fragments, and the valve accrues meaning across three episodes. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first paragraph. However, the closure lacks felt cost—the trumpet is restored, the harbor thrives, but no path is foreclosed for Lirael; the final paragraph summarizes theme rather than crystallizing a choice or renunciation that reweights prior material with visible consequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The ivory harbor, rain-washed cobblestones, and sagging lighthouse cottage are vivid and consistent. Sensory detail (salt-sting, seagull's cry at noon, tidal pooling) is selective and filtered through the archivist's observational lens. The valve constrains her method—she must place it, wait, return—so the object functions as a micro-setting element that shapes her approach, meeting the 9+ gate's first threshold but not charging the final image with environmental cost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—compiling fractured history—is signaled early and pursued across three sites. Each visit yields a fragment (journal, fisherman's tale, locket), creating a pattern of accumulation rather than escalation. No reversal tightens options or forces a trade-off; the method succeeds without friction, and the trumpet's restoration feels inevitable rather than earned by a choice under pressure. The lack of visible cost at closure keeps this in mid-band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme—fractured histories mended through patience—emerges organically from the valve's journey and the staggered-interval method. The mosaic metaphor and symphony image in the final paragraph, however, tip into overt statement rather than letting the restored trumpet resonate without commentary. The piece invites reflection on absence and memory, but the ending explains rather than trusts the reader to infer, lowering thematic charge.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Lirael's perceptual signature—"ocean-spray archivist," attention to intervals and "ghosts" of memory—is distinct and consistent. The fisherman's and girl's dialogue carries age and regional texture ("rough as barnacles," grandmother's hidden trumpet), advancing plot without expository clutter. Distance remains stable; no head-hopping. Minor diction slips ("reactively visionary" feels abstract) and the final paragraph's elevated register ("mosaic, each fragment a note in a symphony") drift slightly from Lirael's embodied voice under prior pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high. The opening anchors voice and stakes cleanly. However, several phrases loop: "staggered intervals" appears six times, "exile" nine times, often in near-synonym constructions ("the exile had ended," "pre-exile," "during the exile's chaos"). The final paragraph stacks abstract nouns ("mosaic," "symphony," "note") in a way that dulls propulsion. Minimal scaffold, but the repetitive emphasis on method terms and the thematic summary at the end reduce line-level tightness.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The core premise—an archivist using a relic as a beacon to draw out fragmented memories—offers a fresh angle on post-conflict restoration. The staggered-interval method is specific and dramatized across three sites. However, the execution feels template-safe: each visit follows the same structure (place valve, wait, discover fragment), and the resolution is tidily positive with no ambiguity or cost. The transformation test flags moderate concern—swap "ivory harbor" for another setting and the emotional arc remains largely unchanged.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Lirael frames the piece and pursues the dominant stake across all three sites, but her choices are methodical rather than pivotal—she places the valve, waits, and receives information. No on-page decision alters her tactics or forecloses a path; the method succeeds without friction. Early setup and consistent presence across beats earn mid-band, but lack of causal pressure or closure-linked choice caps the score.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The trumpet valve is introduced in paragraph one, handled at each of three sites (lighthouse, quay, plaza), and its return to wholeness is the story's physical closure. Each placement draws a new fragment, and the final fitting with the locket reconfigures its meaning from salvaged part to bridge between eras. Strong beat involvement (three distinct uses), closure linkage, and specificity (only a valve would fit the locket mechanism) drive the score into high band, though the closure cost remains more symbolic than felt.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Navigated absences shapes Lirael's method—she seeks voids where memory might resurface—and is named explicitly in the final paragraph. The concept is present in each beat (empty lighthouse, abandoned quay, avoided plaza), but it functions more as thematic backdrop than a constraint that narrows options. The absences yield fragments without friction; no choice is forced by what is missing, keeping the concept functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Reactively visionary" is defined early (trusting patience over haste) and motivates the staggered-interval method, but it remains label-only—no on-page moment shows Lirael torn between reactive waiting and proactive searching, and no cost is paid for this trait. The attribute describes her approach without constraining a choice or enabling a turn that another trait would preclude, placing it in the ornamental-to-functional band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The act of heartening appears at closure when the restored trumpet "heartened the weary," and Lirael's work throughout the piece compiles fragments to restore communal memory, which fits the emotional tenor. However, the verb "hearten" itself is used only once, late, and the emotional effect is told rather than dramatized—we do not witness a character's spirits lifted on the page. Lyric reprise from absent to restored morale earns mid-band, but lack of dramatized agency caps the score.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Staggered intervals is signaled in paragraph two ("revisit sites… allowing time to pass"), demonstrated at all three locations (dawn/noon/dusk at lighthouse, seven days at quay, eight days at plaza), and its mechanics drive the plot—each interval yields a new fragment. The method shapes Lirael's tactics and is named in the final paragraph as the piece's core answer. Strong setup, beat involvement, and closure linkage push into high band; minor friction is the method's success without cost or complication.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The ivory harbor after rain is anchored early, supplies the three sites (lighthouse cottage, eastern quay, central plaza), and rain's aesthetic (polished stone, dampness) colors each beat. The setting enables Lirael's work—the docks are empty, allowing valve placement—but it does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome. Solid presence across beats and lyric contribution to tone, but missing the tactical pressure needed for higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"After the exile ends" is established in the opening (three moons prior) and frames the fractured history Lirael seeks to mend. The timeframe motivates her task and appears in each beat (pre-exile herald, exile's chaos, post-exile restoration), but it does not tighten decisions—Lirael's intervals unfold without deadline pressure, and the ending celebrates restoration rather than racing a clock. Functional framing with thematic weight but no tactical urgency.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lirael's desire to compile fragments into meaning is stated early, dramatized across three collection beats, and fulfilled at closure when the trumpet hangs whole in the museum. The motivation drives every scene and is tested by the need for patience, but no friction arises—no competing want (speed, recognition, personal cost) challenges her commitment. Consistent presence and closure payoff earn solid mid-high band; lack of internal conflict or visible sacrifice prevents higher scoring.</comment>
