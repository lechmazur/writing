<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is clear and embodied through her tactile work with copper and oak, but interiority tilts diagnostic at times ("She'd learned long ago that haste fractured more than stone"). The spirit interaction at dusk demonstrates contradictory impulses—her calm against its pain—but the terminal moment opts for serenity over earned struggle. The six-month timeline should impose visible physical decline or difficult micro-choices under duress; instead competence remains smooth. Internal contradiction exists but doesn't sufficiently complicate the final choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors early (temple orchard, living stone pillars, Lira's task). Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: copper-wrapping beats intensify until the golden-light climax and spirit acceptance, then the final dawn reprise. Closure reads as Charged Poise—Lira's final breath held by the orchard—with conceptual cost (her death seals the bridge). The lens holds and the RR lands on the page, but the cost feels thematic rather than tactilely paid in the closure beat itself.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The temple orchard and living stone pillars are vividly anchored through sensory detail (dappled gold, warm pulsing stone, copper's reddish gleam). The oak and copper wire constrain Lira's method across multiple beats, and the pillars' rumble introduces spatial pressure. Spatial choreography is clean. The copper-oak web charges the final image when the orchard "holds" her last breath, satisfying the 9+ gate mechanically, but the metaphoric leap ("soft as copper on oak") shifts into ornament rather than tactical constraint at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—remodel to foster interspecies respect—is signaled early and tightens through the copper-wrapping sequence. The ground rumble at noon and the spirit's materialization constitute one meaningful reversal under the Accumulative lens. Agency is present: Lira's choice to wrap the final wire triggers the light eruption and the spirit's acceptance. Cost is conceptual (her death cements the bridge) but not viscerally felt as a trade-off in the climactic beat; the ease of "acceptance" undercuts escalation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the copper-oak lattice as a "bridge" between stone and wood, spirits and humans. The spirit's question "Why?" and Lira's answer—"pain can be a language"—risk overt statement but are grounded in prior tactile work. The diary and copper recur with shifting weight, and the final image (orchard holding her breath) offers resonant CR. The piece resists tidy morals and embraces complexity, though "brazen calm" as character label borders on prompt echo. No final-paragraph moralizing; the seed-crack/wire-tighten coda reweights prior material without explaining.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and anchored in Lira's perceptual bias (botanical sketches, copper gleam, tactile earth-smudge). Psychic distance modulates purposefully at the dusk climax. The spirit's dialogue—"Why?" and "You could have left"—carries subtext and drives the thematic exchange. However, "brazen calm" appears as unearned descriptor rather than voice texture under pressure, and Lira's final interior serenity ("knowing the island would endure") smooths rather than complicates. Diction remains character-appropriate; no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and sentence openings are diverse. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent ("liquid sun," "copper on oak"). Two paraphrase loops detected: "The orchard's pillars weren't just stone; they were alive" restates setup already given, and the final paragraph's triple "Somewhere" structure is template-patterned. The copper-wrapping beats are clear and propulsive, but the closing metaphor ("Her last breath was a sigh, soft as copper on oak") mixes vehicle (breath-sigh) with an unearned tactile comparison. Momentum dips slightly in the "Days later" summary before the final scene. Total artifact load: −0.6 for loops and template cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The copper-wire symbiosis premise offers a fresh synthesis of botanical craft and spirit mediation, avoiding stock fantasy tropes. Lira's renunciation (spending her terminal months here) is specific and grounded. However, the "dying protagonist completes final gift" frame is widely familiar, and the story does not transform it through unexpected moral calculus or a non-obvious turn. The spirit's acceptance arrives without sustained resistance, reducing narrative risk. The botanical diary and architectural secrets remain ornamental rather than irreplaceable to the closure.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lira is present throughout and her choice to wrap the final wire triggers the golden-light climax. She refuses to leave the island (setup), chooses patience over haste (middle), and her death seals the bridge (closure). All three gates met. Causal pressure is moderate: her actions enable but do not sharply narrow options. Cost is conceptual (her life) but pre-decided; no on-page tactical trade-off. Score: setup +0.5, two beats +0.9, causal +0.8, closure linkage +1.2, cost +0.4 = base 6.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The botanical diary appears in paragraph one (setup), is referenced at noon ("diary's pages rustled," sketch labeled *Symbiosis*), and is closed in Lira's lap on her final morning (closure). Three beats. However, its mechanics—sketches of roots/wire—are described but never constrain a live choice or alter tactics under pressure. The diary "held centuries of knowledge, but the real secret was in the doing" undercuts its necessity. Setup +0.5, three beats +1.4, closure presence +0.4, swappability −0.8, ornamental −0.5 = 5.2.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Architectural secrets are named in paragraph one ("fostering interspecies respect through architectural secrets hidden in stone and soil") but remain abstract. The copper-wire lattice is the enacted method; "secrets" never take distinct mechanical form that shapes a turn. The concept is thematic backdrop rather than a causal lever. Setup +0.5, thematic presence +0.3, swappability −0.8, ornamental −0.7 = 4.1 (capped at 4.6 for no middle development).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Gently systematic" is introduced early ("Gentle and systematic," she murmured) and reprised in the final paragraph ("gentle and systematic, forever"). The trait colors her method (patient wrapping, step-by-step), but no on-page beat demonstrates a visible trade-off where haste would solve a problem faster at greater risk. The trait is label-consistent but does not constrain action under stress. Setup +0.5, lyric reprise +0.8, label-only −0.5, no cost −0.4 = 5.8 (lyric allowance applies).</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Remodel" is the action frame: Lira's task is to remodel the orchard by weaving old and new. It drives the copper-wrapping sequence (three beats: first branch, three by noon, final wire at dusk) and the golden-light climax. The spirit's acceptance is the remodel's outcome. Setup +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal +1.2, closure +1.4, specificity +0.5 = 7.9. Swapping "remodel" for "repair" or "harmonize" would require only minor edits; not fully indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Copper wire wrapped around oak branches is introduced early, demonstrated across three beats (first slender branch, three by noon, final arc to pillar), and triggers the golden-light eruption at closure. The method is specific and irreplaceable: the wire conducts "the earth's pulse," and its union with stone creates the bridge. Setup +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal +1.4, closure +1.6, specificity +0.8, cost +0.5 = 8.1. Only minor swappability prevents full indispensability.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The temple orchard within living stone pillars is anchored early and provides the spatial stage. The pillars "lean closer" and rumble at noon (pressure), and their light eruption at dusk is the climax. The orchard "holds" Lira's final breath. Setup +0.7, two beats +0.9, causal +0.9, closure +1.2, specificity +0.6 = 6.7. The setting pressures mood more than tactics; Lira's choices would proceed similarly in any analogous sacred grove.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The six-month timeline is stated in paragraph one and reprised ("She had six months left, but in this moment..."). However, the clock never tightens a decision on the page. Lira works at her own pace; no scene tests whether she will finish in time or forces a painful triage. The "final morning" arrives without time pressure. Setup +0.5, closure mention +0.4, no middle constraint −0.6, no cost −0.4 = 4.9 (capped at 4.6 for missing middle gate).</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"To foster interspecies respect" is stated early and drives Lira's dialogue with the spirit ("This is a bridge"). The motivation shapes her patience and final exchange. However, the want is never dramatized in friction with a competing need (e.g., personal comfort, fear of failure). The spirit's acceptance arrives without sustained resistance, muting conflict. Setup +0.6, two beats +0.9, causal +0.7, closure +1.0, told-more-than-shown −0.6, no friction −0.5 = 6.3.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Brazen calm" is named twice ("her tone brazen calm," "brazen calm" at the spirit's question) and colors Lira's steady voice. Tone modulates slightly at the ground rumble (fear) and the dusk climax (caught breath), then returns to serenity. The final image ("soft as copper on oak") sustains calm. However, "brazen calm" reads as descriptor rather than rhythmically embodied pressure; under duress the prose remains uniformly measured. Setup +0.5, closure +0.7, label-only −0.5, static mood −0.4 = 5.4.</comment>
