<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is clear and rooted in personal history (the grandmother reveal), but her emotional arc feels telescoped—she moves from puzzle-solver to tearful heir without meaningful internal contradiction or visible struggle on the page. The chipboard's kinetic-energy gimmick and the arcade AI's programmed approval read as ornamental world-building rather than constraints that force hard choices. Micro-choices exist (kneeling to trace chalk, descending the staircase) but they advance plot without embodying competing impulses or demonstrable cost until the final tears, which arrive without prior friction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Causal with Accumulative texture (chalk codes → clipboard analysis → fountain discovery → hologram). Orientation anchors who/where/when adequately by the second paragraph. The closure unit is a Decisive Change (Lira commits to her grandmother's resistance work), but the cost is asserted rather than dramatically foreclosed—she smiles and tucks the letter away without visible sacrifice or narrowed options. The grandmother's hologram solves mysteries Lira did not help create on the page, undercutting earned causality at the pivotal beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The golden arcade is vividly rendered (honeyed streaks, brass rails, solar-gel fountain) and the chalk drawings provide tangible texture. The fountain's hidden compartment constrains one choice (she must kneel, analyze light frequency, dip her hand), satisfying the 9+ gate partially. However, spatial choreography grows vague in the final sequence—vendors and customers are mentioned as the arcade "awoke," but their proximity and Lira's exact position relative to the fountain and balcony are unclear, weakening the micro-setting's pressure on her final stance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake (decode the margin messages, discover her grandmother's legacy) is signaled early and pursued across beats. One meaningful tightening occurs when the carrier arrives and Lira scans the new letter's margins, but the escalation is informational rather than driven by protagonist agency under pressure—each clue is a breadcrumb laid for her, not a choice she wrestles with cost. The hologram revelation delivers emotional intensity but no visible trade-off; Lira's decision to continue the work is declared ("She'd continue") without foregrounding what path she forecloses or what immediate price she pays.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Theme (futuristic nostalgia as resistance, encoding truth in margins) emerges organically from the chalk codes and surface mail. The final task ("Teach the children to code in chalk") reweights prior material, but it arrives as a clipboard prompt rather than Lira's earned insight, blunting the resonance. The grandmother's line "We encoded our truth in what endures" is an explicit thematic statement that replaces dramatization in the closure beat. The phoenix seal recurs but remains symbolic decoration—it does not constrain a choice or charge the final image with ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Single POV is stable; no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and consistent ("ebony clipboard," "kinetic energy," "prismatic patterns"), creating a distinct narrative texture. However, the prose occasionally drifts into exposition that explains rather than embodies: "Futuristic nostalgia wasn't about clinging to the past—it was about reinventing it" is authorial summary, not Lira's lived perception under pressure. Dialogue with the vendor and carrier is brief and functional, lacking subtext or character-specific idiom. Perceptual signature is present (she notices chalk spirals, light refraction) but the selection feels more thematic than psychology-driven.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and the opening anchors voice effectively. Information density is high in world-building passages (pre-digital clipboard, surface mail resurgence), but several beats loop conceptually: "before opening the letter, she scanned the margins" and "Using a stylus, she etched the margin's shape" restate the same investigative action without added pressure. The phrase "the arcade's heart" appears twice in quick succession, and "clipboard" is repeated across adjacent lines without functional variation. Minor filter-verb stacks ("she'd spent nights coding," "she'd reverse the process") dull immediacy in a high-stakes beat. No major artifacts touch closure, capping deduction at −0.6 for paraphrase loops and template cadence in the middle third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The premise (cryptographer grandmother encoding messages in post-Collapse surface mail and chalk) synthesizes familiar tropes (cyberpunk nostalgia, hidden-legacy plot) without a sharp fresh angle—the emotional arc and puzzle mechanics could transfer to any secret-society inheritance story with minimal edits. The clipboard's kinetic-energy detail and the arcade's solar-gel fountain are vivid but feel like quirky ornament rather than world logic that pressures choice. The transformation test fails: swap "chalk codes" for "musical notes" or "embroidered patterns" and the beats hold unchanged. No bold structural risk; the linear investigation unfolds predictably from clue to clue.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Lira is present throughout and her role as pseudonym creator frames the thematic concern (identity, resistance), but her pseudonym-creation skill does not constrain or enable a key on-page choice. She decodes messages using the clipboard, not by inventing new names under pressure. The trait is setup without payoff at closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The ebony clipboard appears in multiple beats (held on the balcony, used to translate chalk codes, analyzes light frequency at the fountain, displays the final task). It enables her investigative tactics and shapes two distinct problem-solving moments. However, it functions as a reliable tool without evolving meaning or imposing a cost—it never fails, runs out of power, or forces a trade-off. Present in closure ("clipboard humming") but not causally active there.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Surface mail is central to the plot (the carrier delivers the letter, the system's archaic nature is explained as post-Collapse resistance) and shapes Lira's dominant stake (decoding margin messages). It appears early and drives two beats (letter arrival, margin analysis). However, the surface mail itself does not impose a constraint or cost—letters arrive conveniently on schedule, and Lira's interaction with the system is passive receipt rather than tactical choice under its pressures (e.g., racing a deadline, bribing a carrier, choosing which letter to open first).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Carefully inventive" is spoken by the arcade AI as programmed approval, a label without visible enactment. Lira's methods (tracing chalk, using the stylus, analyzing light) read as competent puzzle-solving, but no on-page moment hinges on *careful* inventiveness versus reckless or clumsy inventiveness. The trait does not constrain a choice or carry a trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Juxtaposition structures the opening beat (vendors versus chalk drawings, digital versus analog) and recurs thematically ("juxtapose the old and new once more" in the final line). It enables Lira's investigative method (comparing chalk codes to clipboard data) and the thematic closure. However, the action itself is swappable—"decode," "compare," or "synthesize" could replace it with minor wording changes. Present in closure image but not causally indispensable there.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Chalk codes are seeded early (cyan and violet spiral in paragraph two), used in the middle beat (margin outline beneath the seal), and the final task references teaching children to code in chalk. The method shapes two investigative beats and ties to closure thematically. However, the mechanics are vague—Lira translates "geometric fragments" into "alphanumeric sequences" without visible constraint or cost (e.g., ambiguous patterns, failed translations). The method enables discovery but does not force a hard choice.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The golden arcade at dawn is vividly established (honeyed light, brass rails, cobblestone, central fountain) and one location detail (the fountain's hidden compartment) directly enables the climactic discovery. The setting's "heart" is referenced as a riddle Lira must solve, giving it causal weight. However, the arcade's dawn timing does not tighten tactics—action could occur at noon or dusk without changing pressure. The arcade returns in the final paragraph but as backdrop, not active constraint.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The timeframe "before a letter is mailed" is ambiguous—Lira receives a letter that has already been mailed and delivered. The opening states "Before the first carrier arrived," suggesting anticipation, but the carrier arrives early in the text without the prior window shaping Lira's choices. No ticking clock or urgency tied to "before mailing" pressures her decisions; the pacing is exploratory rather than deadline-driven.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lira's desire to discover meaning in the margins is explicitly stated and drives her investigation across multiple beats (tracing chalk, scanning letter margins, analyzing the fountain's light). The motivation is rooted in personal history (the earlier "A. Starling" letter) and culminates in the grandmother's hologram, giving it closure participation. However, the motivation is pursued without visible internal conflict—she never questions the worth of the quest, weighs competing obligations, or pays a social or physical cost to continue. Desire is clear but not conflicted in choices.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Futuristic nostalgia is present throughout: pre-digital clipboard powered by footsteps, resurged surface mail, chalk codes blended with holography, the 21st-century fountain retrofitted with solar gel. Tone is coherent and modulates slightly (wonder at the arcade's beauty, urgency when the carrier arrives, tears at the hologram). However, the tone remains decorative—it flavors descriptions but does not pressure Lira's choices or charge the final image with irony or cost. The closing summary ("Futuristic nostalgia wasn't about...") makes the tone explicit rather than letting it resonate through particulars.</comment>
