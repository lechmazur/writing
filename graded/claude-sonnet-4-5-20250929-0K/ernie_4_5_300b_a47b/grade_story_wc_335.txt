<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lirael's walking-backwards habit is label-heavy and appears primarily as quirk rather than a constraint that forecloses options under pressure. The visitor is functionally a receiver of wisdom rather than an active pressure source, and the exchange lacks meaningful internal contradiction or embodied friction. Lirael's motives read as stable and declarative ("exile is reversible") without competing impulses or visible cost. The closure moment—"Then the shadow caught in glass will shift"—relies on metaphorical assertion rather than a dramatized choice that narrows options.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The piece opens with atmospheric description that delays orientation (who Lirael is and what she seeks arrives past the 120-word threshold), triggering a −0.3 penalty and Q3 cap at 7.0. The drive lens appears accumulative/textural (tea-leaf geometry, light patterns, archival motifs), but closure attempts Conceptual Repricing via the visitor's resolve and the shadow metaphor without legible on-page cost—no forfeited path, no felt price, only declaration. The visitor's journey is told rather than shown, and Lirael's role as facilitator means the stakes rest on another character's off-page future action. The "walk backwards" advice reads as thematic echo rather than a causally grounded directive with immediate consequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The forgotten library, ivy, light-and-shadow interplay, and tea leaves establish a vivid atmospheric frame anchored early. The afternoon shadow caught in glass is described but does not constrain a choice or enable a tactic—it functions as symbolic decor. Spatial choreography is coherent (shelf, floor, tea, door), and sensory detail (damp parchment, creak of swing) filters through Lirael's perspective. However, the setting does not pressure the choice at closure; the visitor's resolve could occur in any contemplative space.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—teaching the visitor how to reverse her village's exile—is signaled but escalation is minimal: Lirael pours tea, annotates leaves, and offers metaphorical counsel without on-page friction or tightening. The visitor arrives with a problem and departs with resolve, but no reversal or narrowing of options occurs on the page. The "walk backwards" directive is delivered as wisdom rather than tested in scene, and Lirael's own restlessness ("the exile might soon reverse itself") is mentioned but not dramatized. Closure hinges on the visitor's off-page future action, not a protagonist-driven turn with visible cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The reversible-exile concept and light-shadow imagery cohere thematically, but the ending articulates the theme overtly ("the shadow caught in glass will shift, and the light will find a new path") rather than letting the final image reweight prior material without statement. The "walk backwards" advice functions as explicit metaphor. Mentoring resilience and the archivist's preservation role are told rather than tested under pressure, and the visitor's emotional arc (breathless hesitation → hardened resolve) follows a linear template without contradictory impulses or visible sacrifice on the page.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and anchored to Lirael's perceptual signature (mirrors, light, geometry), with diction that favors the contemplative and archival ("shard-mirror archivist," "fractured reflections"). The visitor's dialogue ("They say you know things") and Lirael's responses carry minimal subtext or indirection; exchanges are expository and declarative. "Combative tenderness" appears in the narrative tag ("sharp enough to cut through lies, soft enough to cradle hope") but is not embodied in Lirael's speech or micro-choices. Filter verbs ("watching," "studying") cluster in descriptive passages but do not overwhelm immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and opening imagery is vivid, but several paraphrase loops appear: "the forgotten library stood… Inside, the air smelled… the only sound was" recounts setting without advancing pressure, and "She'd been sent away… not as punishment but as preservation" doubles back on its own phrasing. The phrase "combative tenderness—sharp enough to cut through lies, soft enough to cradle hope" is a tell-then-clarify construction that flattens the effect. The final paragraph ("Then, slowly, she nodded… I'll do it… I'll face whatever comes") cycles through incremental commitment beats that rephrase the same resolution. No major line-level artifacts obscure causality, but density and propulsion sag in expository stretches.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The shard-mirror archivist and tea-leaf geometry offer fresh specificity, and the "walk backwards when nervous" detail is concrete. However, the mentor-teaches-visitor frame and the village-in-peril premise follow familiar templates, and the ending (wise advice → visitor's resolve) does not transform the arc through lived cost or non-obvious moral calculus. The shadow-caught-in-glass motif is poetic but functions as symbolic ornament rather than a necessity that redefines options. The piece commits to its accumulative atmosphere but does not take structural or emotional risks that elevate stakes beyond the comfort middle.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Lirael is present throughout and her actions (kneeling, reading tea leaves, advising) drive the visitor's resolve, satisfying setup and development. However, her role at closure is to deliver wisdom; the consequential choice (to walk backwards, to face the past) belongs to the visitor and will occur off-page. Lirael's own restlessness is mentioned but not acted upon. The archivist's observation and annotation shape the visitor's path but do not narrow Lirael's own options with visible cost, capping the score near mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The shadow caught in glass appears in paragraph two (early signal +0.5), is described with causal detail ("jagged pattern on the floor, like a map"), and returns metaphorically in the closing line ("the trapped shadow stretching, thinning, ready to break free"), satisfying setup and payoff. However, it is never handled, used, or constrained as a tool—it remains symbolic backdrop. The reprise at closure reweights thematically but does not alter a tactic or choice on the page. Two-gate presence (setup, closure callback) lifts it into mid-band; lack of causal involvement and swappability (any light/shadow metaphor could serve) cap it below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Reversible exile is named explicitly in paragraph three ("exile is reversible") and frames the visitor's village problem and the advice to "retrace the steps." It appears in the closure exchange ("to reverse the exile, you must walk backwards") and shapes the visitor's off-page stakes. However, the concept is told and discussed rather than tested through on-page friction or forfeited paths. Lirael's own exile is backstory context, not a present constraint. The element is signaled early, recurs, and organizes the thematic advice, placing it in functional mid-band; lack of causal pressure or visible cost keeps it from higher.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The attribute "walks backwards when nervous" is mentioned twice: once as character backstory habit and once as literal instruction to the visitor. It does not constrain or enable an on-page action with cost; Lirael "walked backwards to keep her distance" is a gesture, not a tactic with consequence. The advice to the visitor ("you must walk backwards") is metaphorical rather than physical. Present and logically consistent but swappable with any quirk or metaphor, capping it in the lower functional band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Annotating appears in paragraph four ("She began to annotate, her quill scratching") and paragraph seven ("She began to annotate again, her quill moving faster now"), satisfying setup and middle beat involvement. The action enables Lirael to "map the leaves' language into symbols" and deliver the tea-reading advice that the visitor accepts. However, the annotations themselves do not face on-page friction or yield a surprise that alters tactics—the visitor receives the interpretation and agrees. The action is purpose-driven and recurs, placing it solidly in functional-to-purposeful range; lack of closure participation and visible cost keep it from higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The method "by analyzing the geometry of tea leaves" is named in paragraph four and demonstrated when Lirael pours tea, watches the leaves settle, and annotates their shapes ("A spike here, a curve there—a warning, perhaps, or a promise"). She repeats the process with the visitor's cup, pointing to "a convergence. A point where past and future meet." The geometry mechanic is signaled, shown in use, and supplies the diagnosis that drives the visitor's resolve, satisfying setup, middle, and closure contribution. However, the leaves' specific shapes do not constrain or surprise—the interpretation flows without friction or cost. Functional across beats but swappable with any divination system, placing it in mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The forgotten library is anchored early (paragraph one) with vivid detail (stone walls, ivy, damp parchment, creak of swing) and recurs as the physical frame for the encounter. It provides the tea-leaf ritual space and the afternoon light effect. However, the library does not pressure a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome—the conversation could occur in any contemplative setting. The library's archival role is thematic context, not a causal constraint. Present throughout and atmospherically coherent, but lacks tactical involvement, placing it in functional mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>The timeframe "at the hush as an empty playground swing drifts in the breeze" appears once in the opening sentence as atmospheric simile ("the only sound was the hush as an empty playground swing drifts"). It does not recur, track elapsed time, or tighten decisions. The piece unfolds in an untracked afternoon without urgency or clock pressure. Present as poetic anchor but ornamental and disconnected from stakes, capping it in the lower ornamental band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The motivation "to mentor resilience quietly" is named in paragraph three and demonstrated when Lirael teaches the visitor "how to endure, how to find strength in stillness." The visitor's arrival and Lirael's counsel satisfy setup and middle beats, and the closing affirmation ("She'd mentored resilience quietly, but sometimes, the quietest lessons were the loudest") ties the action to the motivation. However, the mentoring is uncontested—no friction, cost, or conflicting desire complicates Lirael's choice to help. The motivation is consistent and drives the visitor's arc but lacks on-page stakes or forfeited paths for Lirael herself, placing it in functional mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The tone "combative tenderness" is labeled explicitly in paragraph six ("a mix of combative tenderness—sharp enough to cut through lies, soft enough to cradle hope") but not embodied in dialogue or gesture. Lirael's advice is gentle and declarative; the visitor's responses are earnest and compliant. The closing smile ("a rare, genuine thing") leans toward warmth without the sharpness. Tone is consistent and calm but does not modulate with pressure or charge the final image with contradiction, placing it in the functional-but-static range.</comment>
