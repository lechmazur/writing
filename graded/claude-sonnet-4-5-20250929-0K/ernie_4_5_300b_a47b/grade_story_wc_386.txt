<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Kael's motivation to "salvage something pure" is asserted early but never tested by contradictory impulses in scene. His action is passive observation of others' dreams rather than micro-choices under pressure. The sailor's ghost, widow, son, and lighthouse keeper exist as static portraits delivered through summary rather than embodied scenes that force Kael to choose between competing goods. The final placement of the snow globe on the altar reads as ceremonial gesture without visible cost or foreclosed path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Drive lens inferred as Accumulative/Textural (dream-to-dream layering toward thematic synthesis). Orientation is adequate: who, where established by ~100 words. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration via the final shrine image, but no visible or felt cost is legible on the page—Kael smiles, descends with starlight guidance, and the windows "flow freely" without evident trade-off or foreclosed option. The three dream vignettes unfold in parallel summary without causal linkage or deepening pressure, failing the one meaningful tightening test. Cost proof test fails: no sentence at closure makes a price undeniable.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Glacier shrine, ice, candles, and snow globe anchor setting adequately. The melted snow globe is handled twice (palm examination, altar placement) and its warped glass recurs across dream vignettes, approaching the purposeful reprise threshold. However, the environment does not constrain a choice—Kael's access to dreams is frictionless, and the shrine functions as atmospheric backdrop rather than tactical pressure. Micro-setting allowance partially met by the globe's charged descriptions, but it does not alter outcome.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reveal the sailor's secret to free his ghost) is signaled early but never tightened. No on-page reversal or narrowing of options occurs; Kael moves through three dreams without obstacle, cost, or adaptation. The sailor's ghost "stirs" and murmurs approval, the widow will "finally see," but these are summarized futures rather than present pressure. Coincidence does not resolve (acceptable), yet protagonist agency is absent—luck and passive reception drive the sequence. No live trade-off or visible price paid.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Theme of connection between living and dead emerges from the snow globe motif and dream structure, avoiding overt moralizing. The final image attempts resonance via "windows of connection" open and truth flowing, but leans toward thesis statement rather than earned particulars. The three dream vignettes (child's laughter, son's guilt, widow's lost daughter) provide concrete anchors, yet they are told rather than dramatized, limiting thematic weight. No false balance or forced allegory, but the ending borders on thematic echo by articulating "fragile, enduring threads" in near-prompt language.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature present in "windows… fragile things" and "breath caught" embodied reactions. Diction remains consistent within Kael's introspective register. However, runs of identical syntactic stems appear: "The first dream came… The second dream was… The third dream was…" (template cadence across three beats). Filter-verb reliance ("felt the sailor's presence," "knew what he had to do") dulls immediacy in peak moments. Voice is competent but not rhythmically controlled under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Template cadence across dream vignettes ("The first dream… The second dream… The third dream…") triggers −0.5. Paraphrase loop: "windows… were fragile things" restated as "windows of connection were open" without added pressure (−0.2). Stock metaphor "borrowed starlight" recurs without evolving meaning. Several filter verbs stack in high-pressure beats ("believed," "suspected," "knew," "felt"). Clarity is adequate; grammar clean. Information density uneven—dream summaries compress three lives into ornamental sketches. Baseline artifacts pull score below 6.5; no figurative muddle touching closure, so penalties remain in mid-range.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Core premise (ghost whisperer reads dreams to free a spirit) is a recognizable template: grieving relatives, unfinished business, redemptive release. The melted snow globe as relic is vivid but its function (window to dreams) is asserted rather than discovered through specific cost. No risky structural or perspectival choice; the three-dream structure is mechanical rather than transformative. Emotional specificity in the widow's lost daughter moment offers a fresh inflection, but the overall arc follows a predictable cathartic path. Derivative premise guardrail applies; transformation insufficient to restore full range.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Wreck-diver ghost whisperer is present in setup (first paragraph) and closure (descending glacier), satisfying two gates. Development gate weak: Kael observes dreams without on-page decision that alters tactics. His choices—pressing hands to ice, closing eyes, placing globe—are ceremonial rather than causal pressures that narrow options. Swappable with "sensitive medium" or "spirit guide" with minor edits. Late penalties waived (early signal +0.5), but ornamental use (−0.7) and low causal pressure (no bonus) place score in functional-replaceable band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Melted snow globe present in setup (first third: found in wreckage, held in palm), development (appears transformed in each dream: pool, prison, mirror), and closure (placed on altar, catches candlelight). Three distinct beats (+0.9), lyric reprise with reweighted meaning in each dream vignette (+0.6). However, Kael does not use the globe to enable or constrain a tactic—it functions as passive symbol rather than active tool. Specificity bonus (+0.4): warped glass, silver smear detail. Swappability concern (−0.3): a locket or ring could serve similar thematic role. Score lands in "shapes one key turn" band via accumulative pattern.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Windows of connection: present as metaphor in first third ("windows… were fragile things"), echoed in final paragraph ("windows of connection were open"). Missing development gate—the concept does not constrain a middle choice or force a tactical adaptation. At closure it appears as thematic summary rather than causal reweighting. Lyric reprise allowance applies (first → last), lifting floor to ~5.0, but ornamental use (−0.6) and label-only treatment (−0.3) pull score down. The windows remain an abstract frame rather than a mechanic that changes Kael's options.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Weaves truth carefully" asserted in paragraph two ("His reputation… wasn't built on reckless revelations but on… listening"). Missing development and closure gates: no on-page moment where careful versus reckless truth-telling creates visible trade-off or cost. The trait is told, not shown through action. Late first functional mention (~20% mark) mitigates late penalty, but label-only use (−0.5) and lack of constraining pressure keep score low. Swappable with "tactful" or "discerning" without altering plot.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Expose" the sailor's secret: signaled in setup ("he would expose the sailor's secret"), drives the middle dream sequence (three revelations), and appears at closure ("expose the truth… by weaving it into… dreams"). All three gates present. However, the exposure is passive summary—Kael will tell others off-page—rather than an on-page dramatic confrontation or cost. Causal pressure moderate (+0.6): the expose goal organizes the dream vignettes. Swappability concern (−0.5): "reveal" or "share" could replace with minor wording changes. Score in "shapes one key turn" band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Analyzing cameo appearances in strangers' dreams: method announced in paragraph three, structurally present in middle (three dream vignettes), mentioned at closure (weaving truth into dreams). Setup (+0.5) and beat involvement for three dreams (+1.4) suggest higher score, but the mechanics are asserted without constraint—Kael closes eyes and dreams arrive frictionlessly, no cost or failed attempt. Summary-only use (−0.8): the dream analysis is recounted, not dramatized with uncertainty or adaptation. Swappability high (−0.6): "communing," "listening to echoes," or "reading memories" could replace the method without altering structure. Score near functional-replaceable boundary.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Candle-lit shrine carved into glacier ice: present in opening line (setup +0.6), mentioned at closure (candles flare, ice hums), but absent from middle development—the three dream vignettes occur with eyes closed, setting inert. Spatial detail adequate (ice wall, altar, slope descent), yet the shrine does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome. Lyric reprise (candles → embers → flare) reweights atmosphere (+0.4). Micro-setting allowance applies (glacier ice as body/tool analogue when Kael presses hands to ice), but no tactical pressure. Score in "shapes one key turn" band via atmospheric charge.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>N/A</grade><comment>Required element is "None."</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>To salvage something pure from the wreckage: stated in setup ("not gold or silver, but… threads of connection"), implicit in middle (freeing the ghost), explicit at closure ("He had salvaged something pure"). All three gates present. However, the desire is told rather than dramatized—no on-page friction between what Kael wants and what it costs him. The motivation organizes the arc (+0.7) but remains abstract; no moment where salvaging "pure" connection forecloses a simpler or safer option. Label-only treatment in final beat (−0.4). Score in mid-5s: functional motivation without embodied conflict.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Borrowed starlight: tone cue in paragraph three ("their light borrowed starlight"), recurs in final paragraph ("borrowed starlight guided his way"). Lyric reprise present, but the phrase functions as atmospheric ornament rather than modulating with pressure. Tone remains elegiac and hushed throughout; no intentional tension or cadence shift when stakes theoretically rise. The "borrowed" motif (light, connection) threads subtly through images (candles, snow globe shimmer), lifting specificity (+0.4). However, static mood (−0.5) and ornamental use (−0.4) prevent higher score. Mid-4s: present and purposeful but does not charge the final image with new pressure.</comment>
