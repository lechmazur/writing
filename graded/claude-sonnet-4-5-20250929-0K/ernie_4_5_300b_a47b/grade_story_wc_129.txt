<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Kael's interior life relies heavily on abstract labels ("boldly sympathetic," "webs of kinship") rather than embodied contradiction. His decision to search for Veyra feels thematically motivated but lacks visceral cost or competing impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The revelation that Lira is Veyra lands without prior tension between what Kael wants and what he fears, flattening the emotional stakes. Embodied emotion is present in "luminescent ache" but remains decorative rather than driving micro-choices under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes a clear accumulative/textural lens: Kael's search gathers details (tags, Lira's clue, the final mural) toward a meeting that reweights his isolation. Orientation anchors (crystalline orchard, crater's edge, Kael's role) arrive early. The closure—Lira's identity reveal and their shared stance beneath the arbor—offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), but the cost remains abstract: "luminescent ache… now shared" asserts connection without dramatizing what Kael forfeits or risks. The search itself involves minimal escalation; clues accumulate but do not narrow options or complicate tactics, weakening the before/after legibility required for higher bands.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The crystalline orchard and obsidian arbor are vividly rendered with selective, purposeful detail (prismatic glass, fractured rainbows, constellations under peculiar light). Spatial choreography remains clear across moves (eastern edge, clearing amphitheater). The arbor charges the final image by appearing in Veyra's mural and framing the closing beat, satisfying the 9+ gate requirement. However, the setting does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters tactics; it functions as atmospheric backdrop rather than pressuring Kael's decisions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Kael's desire to "graft himself onto community"—is signaled early and drives the search. However, the search itself unfolds as a series of discoveries without meaningful resistance or trade-offs. Lira's clue ("follow the angles") leads directly to success; no live option is foreclosed, no tactic shifts under pressure. The reveal that Lira is Veyra provides information but no reversal of Kael's trajectory. The resolution avoids coincidence but lacks agency-driven escalation; Kael's arrival at the clearing completes the search without visible cost or a choice that narrows his path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The theme of kinship and connection emerges organically from Kael's search and the imagery of threads, tags, and the arbor. The final image—two figures beneath the obsidian arbor, ache shared—attempts a non-literal answer to the loneliness premise. However, the resolution leans toward asserted unity ("a thread connecting two hearts to the world") rather than a conceptual cost or ambiguity that resists tidy closure. The piece avoids overt moralizing but stops short of the earned, resonant reweighting required for higher bands.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-person limited on Kael; psychic distance is consistent. Diction carries a lyric, elevated register ("luminescent ache," "beyond the murmur of lost languages") that feels purposeful but occasionally drifts toward stock poetic phrasing. Dialogue is minimal but functional; Lira's line "follow the angles" and her reveal "I had to be sure you'd understand" advance plot without rich subtext. Perceptual signature is present (Kael notices light, texture, kinship motifs) but lacks the specificity and rhythmic modulation under pressure required for 9+.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear and propulsive, with varied sentence structures and vivid imagery. However, multiple text artifacts lower the score: "boldly sympathetic" is asserted rather than dramatized; "luminescent ache" recurs as a label without fresh embodiment; "webs of kinship" and "tapestry of traders, poets, and wanderers" read as stock metaphor. Paraphrase loops appear ("The orchard's visitors… had dwindled. Loneliness seeped into the glass" restates isolation). Filter verbs ("he thought he saw," "he felt a kinship") slightly dull immediacy in key beats. No loops touch the closure beat directly, limiting the penalty, but cumulative density issues prevent higher bands.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The premise—sculptor seeks street artist in a glass orchard—offers a fresh synthesis of elements, and the reveal that the trader is the artist adds a neat turn. However, the emotional arc (lonely artist finds kindred spirit) follows a familiar template without transforming it through non-obvious moral calculus or lived friction. The crystalline orchard and obsidian arbor provide vivid specificity, but the search and resolution feel structurally predictable. The piece commits fully to its lyric premise but lacks the bold risk or inevitable-in-hindsight surprise required for higher originality scores.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Kael (marsh-reed sculptor) appears throughout and his decision to search for Veyra initiates the plot. However, his sculpting with reeds is mentioned only in exposition ("hands… stained with the sap of the glass trees, which he used to bind his creations") and does not constrain or enable a key turn. The search itself is observation-led; Kael studies, travels, and arrives but makes no difficult choice that alters tactics. Present in setup and payoff, but middle development lacks causal pressure tied to the sculpting identity.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The obsidian arbor is introduced early as Kael's "latest work" and recurs in multiple beats: Kael camps beneath it, it appears in Veyra's final mural as a signature motif, and the closing scene places both characters beneath it. The arbor charges the closure image and links Kael to Veyra thematically. However, its use remains symbolic rather than tactically constraining; it does not alter a choice or impose a cost. Strong across setup, development, and payoff, but falls short of indispensable causal pressure for 8.5+.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Webs of kinship" is named explicitly ("Kael believed in webs of kinship, the invisible threads") and drives his motivation to search for Veyra. The concept recurs in Veyra's mural imagery (hands merging into radiant threads) and the closing assertion ("a thread connecting two hearts to the world"). Present in setup and payoff with thematic coherence, but the concept does not constrain an on-page choice or create visible friction. It shapes the dominant stake but remains largely asserted rather than dramatized with cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Boldly sympathetic" is introduced as a trait in the opening ("a trait that drew others to him") but functions only as a label. No on-page action demonstrates how this trait constrains or enables Kael's choices, and no cost is attached to it. The attribute is present in setup but absent from middle development and closure participation. Swappable with "kind" or "empathetic" without altering story logic.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The decision to "dedicate his next project to a shared search" initiates the plot and drives Kael's journey. This action is signaled early and frames all subsequent beats (studying tags, meeting Lira, finding the final mural). However, the dedication itself is stated rather than enacted with visible cost or trade-off. Present across setup, development, and payoff, but the action does not narrow options or create friction; it serves as a structural hinge rather than a causal lever with felt consequences.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The search for Veyra's tags structures the entire narrative: Kael studies the murals, receives Lira's clue about angles, traces the crater's curves, and finds the final tag with date and time. The method's mechanics matter (following light angles, camping beneath the arbor, arriving at the appointed place) and shape multiple beats. Present in setup, development, and payoff. The search does not impose a cost or force a trade-off, preventing higher scores, but it drives escalation and frames the closure unit.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The crystalline orchard and crater are vividly established in the opening and recur throughout (eastern edge, glass trees, clearing amphitheater). The setting provides atmospheric specificity and frames the final scene. However, it does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters tactics; Kael moves freely through the space without environmental friction. Present in setup and payoff with strong descriptive texture, but lacks the causal pressure or micro-setting function required for 7.0+.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Beyond the murmur of lost languages" appears only in the opening as a lyric frame; it establishes tone but does not function as a live timeframe that tightens decisions. The seven-day search provides a vague duration, but no clock pressure is felt on the page. Time remains abstract and untracked, with no tactics altered by temporal constraint. Ornamental use only; missing development and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kael's desire "to graft himself onto community" is stated early and drives the search for Veyra. The motivation recurs in reflections on loneliness and the orchard's dwindling visitors, and the closure image (shared ache beneath the arbor) addresses it directly. However, the motivation is told more than dramatized; no on-page friction between Kael's desire and a competing cost or fear is shown. Present across setup, development, and payoff, but lacks the visible trade-off or conflicted choice required for higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Luminescent ache" is introduced early ("The luminescent ache in his chest grew—a mix of hope and longing") and recurs in the final line ("The luminescent ache remained, but now it was shared"). The tone modulates subtly with pressure (hope, longing, revelation) and charges the closing image. Coherent through turns and purposeful in its reprise. However, the tone is asserted through label rather than embodied in varied perceptual or rhythmic shifts under stress, preventing higher scores.</comment>
