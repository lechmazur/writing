<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Cedar's molting trait is labeled repeatedly but never constrains an on-page choice with visible cost—the personality shift at the end feels asserted rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Marla remains functional but flat, her boxer backstory and daughter in juvie mentioned without pressuring Cedar's arc. The tin's use as a memory anchor is coherent, but the rebuild action lacks embodied struggle; Cedar accesses past poems without friction, and the final molting moment ("He felt the shift like a earthquake") relies on summary rather than sensory breakdown under stress.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural, inferred from the recurring tin motif and the final-image repricing of "bloom through chaos" rather than causal turns. Orientation anchors who/where/when clearly by the opening paragraph. Closure reads as Conceptual Repricing: Cedar's discovery of the new poem reframes his stance from "rebuild" to "grow through the chaos," but the cost remains abstract—no visible forfeiture or tactical shift on the page, only assertion ("he didn't panic"). The tin's return charges the final beat, yet the reweighting feels thematic rather than felt, lacking the undeniable pressure required for high-band Resonant Reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The rusted library with corrugated metal, cracked glass, and flickering bulbs supplies vivid sensory anchors. The tin's false bottom and hidden floorboard constrain Cedar's movements across multiple beats, and the moon's climb tracks time visibly. However, spatial choreography blurs when Cedar pulls the tin from his coat mid-scene after earlier establishing it's hidden beneath a floorboard—no on-page retrieval reconciles the contradiction, weakening micro-setting integrity at a key moment.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Cedar's need to rebuild identity through the tin—is signaled early but never meaningfully tightened; the poems are always accessible, Marla poses no obstacle, and the molting shift at the end adds complexity without foreclosing a prior path. The new poem's directive ("become the anarchy") offers a thematic pivot but no on-page tactical cost or decision that narrows Cedar's options. Escalation under the Accumulative lens requires a deepening that reweights the stake with felt pressure; here the final beat asserts resolution ("he didn't panic") without dramatizing the trade-off or loss that would charge the closure image.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The "blooming resistance" motif recurs across the tin's lid, Cedar's writing, and the final garden metaphor, earning thematic coherence. The piece resists overt moralizing until the penultimate paragraph's "map" metaphor, which edges toward thesis statement. The closing image—"something bloomed"—offers a non-literal answer to the rebuild-versus-growth question, but the resonance is diluted by the explanatory framing ("it was enough") rather than trusting the image alone. Theme emerges from concrete particulars (tin, poems, floorboard) yet the final articulation leans slightly didactic, preventing higher-band entry.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>POV distance is stable in close third, and Cedar's perceptual filter (one green eye, one gray; vagrant idiom) is distinct early. Dialogue between Cedar and Marla feels natural and goal-driven, with Marla's terse "You're late" and Cedar's oblique response advancing rapport. However, diction slips into elevated register at pressure points—"luminous fracture," "earthquake," "consensus reality"—that exceed a vagrant poet's plausible spontaneous lexicon mid-crisis. Free indirect style is clean, but the final paragraph's "hungry and indifferent" city reads as authorial summary rather than Cedar's specific noticing, briefly leaking POV modesty.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops cluster in the middle third: "The tin was his talisman, a relic" restates function without added detail; "Each month, when his personality molted, he'd return to the tin" is echoed two paragraphs later in "He'd spent his life running from his molting selves." Template cadence appears in sequential "He'd found... He'd hidden... He'd scrawled" stems. Mixed metaphor in "his mind fracturing and reforming" then "felt the shift like a earthquake" (tectonic vs. mental architecture) blurs the vehicle. "Luminous fracture" in the climactic writing beat reads as stock poetic diction rather than Cedar-specific invention, and the closing "For now, it was enough" doubles the sentiment within two lines, flattening propulsion at closure. Baseline −0.8 for loops and template stems, plus −0.3 for figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The vagrant-poet-with-fragmenting-identity premise echoes familiar "artist rebuilding self through art" templates without a non-obvious inflection; the tin and prison-library friendship are logically present but do not transform the arc's emotional predictability. "Blooming resistance" and the molting metaphor offer vivid images, yet the final realization—"become the anarchy"—arrives as a late thematic claim rather than an earned synthesis from prior choices. The rusted-library-under-stars setting and Marla's boxer backstory add texture but remain decorative, not constraining tactics or charging closure with irreplaceable specificity. No bold structural risk elevates the execution; the piece plays safely within its genre conventions.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Cedar is present throughout and his writing/sorting actions shape multiple beats, but his vagrant-poet role does not constrain a key turn—Marla's acceptance is immediate, the library grants access without friction, and the molting shift at the end is asserted rather than forcing a choice with visible cost. He observes and reflects more than he decides under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The tin appears in beat one (discovery in dumpster, backstory), beat two (hidden under floorboard), beat three (opened for Marla), and beat four (retrieved after molting to find the new poem). Its false bottom enables the poem-storage mechanism and the final repricing turn. However, spatial contradiction (coat vs. floorboard) and the new poem's unexplained authorship weaken irreplaceability; a similar container could serve with minor edits. Present in closure but not indispensably causal.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Blooming resistance" is scrawled on the tin's lid, repeated in Cedar's in-scene writing, and echoed in the garden-of-words metaphor and final "something bloomed" image. It frames the thematic question but does not narrow on-page options or enable a tactical choice—Cedar's actions (sorting, writing, retrieving the tin) proceed identically whether the phrase exists or not. Functional lyric reprise without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The monthly personality molting is established early and returns at the climax when Cedar "molts again," his eyes shifting and mind fracturing. Yet the trait never constrains a choice or imposes visible cost—Cedar accesses the tin's poems freely across identities, Marla's reaction is unaffected, and the shift enables discovery of the new poem (convenience) rather than forcing a trade-off. Label-only with late ornamental use.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Rebuild" is Cedar's stated method from the second paragraph ("This is how I rebuild") and recurs in his reflections and the closing decision to "grow through the chaos" rather than rebuild. It shapes the dominant stake and the conceptual repricing at the end. However, the rebuild action itself is never dramatized with on-page friction—poems are always accessible, no failed attempt occurs, and the pivot to "become the anarchy" is thematic assertion rather than a turn driven by prior failure. Present across beats but the mechanics remain abstract.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The friendship with Marla is sparked by her request to sort books, present in beats two and three (dialogue, poem exchange, tin reveal), and subtly shapes the ending when Cedar's garden metaphor includes "Marla's silence was soil." Setup and middle development are clear, and the friendship provides emotional grounding for Cedar's work. However, it does not constrain the closure choice—Cedar's realization about the new poem occurs independently, and Marla's role in the final beat is passive observation. Essential to atmosphere, not to causal escalation.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The rusted library with corrugated metal, cracked glass, flickering bulbs, and the hidden floorboard is anchored early and recurs across beats. The floorboard functions as a micro-setting constraint (Cedar hides and retrieves the tin), and the moon's climb tracks time visibly. The setting charges the final "under the stars, something bloomed" image. However, spatial contradiction (tin in coat vs. floorboard) and the library's easy access (no guard friction, no lock) reduce irreplaceability; a similar refuge could serve with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"As the moon clears the skyline" anchors the opening, "the moon climbed higher" marks the midpoint, and "the moon reached its zenith" signals the final turn when Cedar molts. The moon's arc tracks elapsed time across three visible beats. However, no decision or tactic is altered by the timeframe—Cedar's access to the tin, Marla's availability, and the writing action proceed without clock pressure. Functional temporal marker without tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"To forge beauty from anarchy" is Cedar's explicit motivation (stated in paragraph four, repeated in the climactic poem he writes, and repriced in the new poem's directive). It frames the dominant stake and is tested when Cedar writes under pressure. However, the desire is never conflicted on the page—no cost or friction opposes his writing, Marla supports him, and the anarchy outside remains abstract. Told and thematic rather than dramatized through competing wants with visible trade-offs.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Luminous fracture" appears once as Cedar writes, echoing the library's cracked glass and fragmented identity motifs. The tone layers melancholy, fragility, and resilience through imagery (moth-wing coat, desperate fireflies, skeletal structure) and modulates at the molting beat when diction sharpens ("earthquake," "map"). However, the phrase itself is a one-time authorial flourish rather than a sustained tonal register, and the closing "enough" softens rather than charges the fracture motif. Coherent setup and final echo without mid-scene development.</comment>
