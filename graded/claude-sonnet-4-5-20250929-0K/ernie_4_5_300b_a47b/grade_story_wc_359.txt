<grade>5.8</grade>
<comment>Lira's synesthetic gift is specified but remains largely decorative—she "sees" sound as color, yet this trait doesn't constrain a single on-page choice or generate visible cost. Her internal life consists of poetic declarations ("Wonder isn't a luxury") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. Veyra's sudden conversion from skeptic to believer happens via convenient off-stage magic rather than earned struggle. The ending celebrates transformation without foreclosing a path or showing what Lira sacrificed to achieve it.</comment>

<grade>4.7</grade>
<comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive promptly. The closure unit attempts Resonant Reconfiguration—the cavern now "sings"—but the cost remains abstract; no on-page sentence demonstrates what Lira or Veyra lost or forfeited to reach this state. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural (layered imagery building to a sonic payoff), yet the final image delivers atmospheric satisfaction without reweighting prior stakes or demonstrating felt sacrifice. The sculptor's marble awakening and Lira's bell-ringing success land as convenient coincidence rather than causal pressure.</comment>

<grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>The ice cavern is vividly rendered—"sculpted hush," "stalactites dripped like wax"—and sensory details (frost, resinous scent, aurora light) are purposefully layered. The amber sheet and bell are handled on the page, and the aurora's colors guide Lira's singing, meeting the micro-setting test. Spatial choreography remains clear when Veyra enters. However, the cavern's transformation (walls melting, arches forming) doesn't constrain Lira's final choice or alter her tactics; it's spectacle rather than pressure, capping the score below 7.0.</comment>

<comment>The dominant stake—proving wonder essential by unfettering the cavern's voice—is signaled early. Lira sings, the ice responds, Veyra is converted, and the mission succeeds without visible friction or cost. No on-page tightening forces a trade-off; the aurora and amber sheet cooperate seamlessly, and the sculptor's skepticism evaporates in a single beat. The ending celebrates harmony without demonstrating what was risked or renounced to achieve it, leaving escalation shallow and closure cost implicit at best.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>5.6</grade>
<comment>The theme—wonder as essential—emerges from the premise but is stated rather than discovered ("…is essential"). The sculpted hush and synesthetic palette offer rich imagery, yet the piece treats them as symbolic décor rather than particulars that complicate Lira's choice. The ending's triumphant harmony (ice, stone, light all singing together) resolves into tidy affirmation without ambiguity or counter-pressure. The final line's "forever" and "inevitable" read as thematic summary rather than earned resonance from specific events.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>6.2</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable, and Lira's perceptual signature—synesthetic color-sound blending—is consistent. Diction carries a lyric register ("prism-song," "indigo ink," "resinous scent") that suits the fantasy frame. Veyra's brief interiority at his conversion moment is clean and his dialogue ("You did this") feels natural. However, peak-pressure beats rely on elevated metaphor ("ghostly breath," "celestial harp") without tightening to urgency, and the ending's ornate phrasing ("oscillating between repose and revelation, forever") drifts toward authorial commentary rather than character-bound perception.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>5.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is polished and imagistic—"frost spiraled like ghostly breath," "silence pooled like indigo ink"—yet density sags under decorative metaphor clusters in nearly every paragraph. The opening and middle beats stack modifiers ("prism-song bell ringer," "sculpted hush made flesh," "synesthetically blessed") that announce rather than advance. Paraphrase loops appear: "The cavern's silence had grown oppressive, a weight…" is restated as "The sculpted hush trembled…" two paragraphs later. Template cadence in action beats ("She pressed… and began to sing. Her voice… seeped into the ice. The sculpted hush trembled…") flattens rhythm. No major causality breaks, but overwriting and synonym churn reduce momentum, triggering −0.6 to −0.8 in Q7 and disqualifying 9+ globally per artifact rules.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>4.9</grade>
<comment>The synesthetic bell-ringer premise and ice-cavern setting offer surface novelty, yet the arc—artist proves skeptic wrong via magical performance—follows a familiar template without transformation. Lira's success is frictionless; no risky trade-off or non-obvious moral calculus emerges. The aurora-as-palette and sculpted-hush imagery feel like ornamental world-building rather than irreplaceable story engines. The piece commits to its lyric voice but retreats into safe affirmation at closure, avoiding bold stakes or uncomfortable ambiguity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question>
<grade>5.2</grade>
<comment>Lira as prism-song bell ringer is present throughout and her actions (singing, ringing the bell) drive the sequence. She is introduced early, involved in multiple beats, and shapes the ending. However, her choices are straightforward executions of her gift without visible friction or cost; no tightening decision narrows her options. The role feels replaceable—any magical musician could perform the same function with minor edits. Positive signals: early setup +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +0.8. Frictions: swappability −0.6, ornamental synesthesia −0.5. Base 3.0 + 2.8 − 1.1 = 4.7, round to two gates (setup, payoff) eligible range; capped at ~5.5 for lack of causal pressure or specific cost tied to her role; final 5.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question>
<grade>4.8</grade>
<comment>The amber music sheet appears in the opening (on her belt), is pressed to her lips mid-story, and vibrates/flares during the song. Three touches across beats. Positive signals: early setup +0.6, three beats +1.4, some specificity (resinous scent, glowing edges) +0.3. Frictions: largely static—it hangs, glows, vibrates—without altering Lira's tactics or being handled in a way that imposes cost −0.6; swappable with any magical scroll −0.5. Base 3.0 + 2.3 − 1.1 = 4.2; eligible for ~4.8 with three gates met but no causal pressure or irreplaceability. Final 4.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question>
<grade>3.9</grade>
<comment>Sculpted hush appears as vivid description (cavern walls, ice formations) throughout and is mentioned at closure ("The sculpted hush remained, but now it sang"). Positive signals: early setup +0.6, closure mention +0.4. Frictions: operates as atmospheric metaphor rather than shaping stakes or altering Lira's tactics −0.8; largely ornamental descriptor −0.7; swappable with "frozen silence" or similar −0.6. Base 3.0 + 1.0 − 2.1 = 1.9; eligible for mid-3s with setup/payoff gates but no development beat where it constrains choice. Final 3.9.</comment>

<question>9 D</question>
<grade>3.6</grade>
<comment>Synesthetically blessed is stated early ("sound bloomed as color, and silence pooled like indigo ink") and guides Lira's perception throughout. She sees her song as "emerald for hope, violet for mystery, gold for joy." Positive signals: early setup +0.6, perceptual color throughout (three beats) +1.4, closure linkage (aurora's colors spill) +0.5. Frictions: label-only trait that doesn't constrain a choice or impose visible cost −0.8; ornamental sensory texture −0.6; swappable with any magical artist's heightened perception −0.5. Base 3.0 + 2.5 − 1.9 = 3.6. Three gates met but no on-page cost or tactical friction tied to synesthesia. Final 3.6.</comment>

<question>9 E</question>
<grade>5.7</grade>
<comment>Unfetter is Lira's explicit goal ("to unfetter the cavern's voice") and the climactic act: her song causes the ice to shift, the cavern to sing, and Veyra's marble to pulse. Positive signals: early setup (stated goal) +0.6, three beats (preparation, song, outcome) +1.4, closure linkage (cavern now sings) +1.0, some specificity (requires alignment of synesthetic gift + aurora) +0.4. Frictions: the mechanics are vague—unfettering happens via magical singing without clear obstacles or tactical adjustments −0.6; swappable with "awaken" or "release" −0.5. Base 3.0 + 3.4 − 1.1 = 5.3; three gates met, central to structure but lacks cost-driven friction. Final 5.7.</comment>

<question>9 F</question>
<grade>4.3</grade>
<comment>The aurora is present early ("pulsed above her like a celestial harp"), guides Lira's song palette (emerald/violet/gold), and flares at closure ("the aurora above flared, its colors spilling"). Positive signals: early setup +0.6, three beats (opening, song mechanics, ending flare) +1.4, closure linkage +0.8. Frictions: the aurora is described but doesn't constrain Lira's attempts—she simply aligns her gift with it without friction −0.7; swappable with any magical light source −0.6. Base 3.0 + 2.8 − 1.3 = 4.5; three gates met but method lacks tactical pressure or cost. Final 4.3.</comment>

<question>9 G</question>
<grade>6.1</grade>
<comment>The ice cavern is established immediately, supplies vivid atmosphere (frost, sculpted walls, stalactites), and its transformation (walls melting, arches forming) marks the climax. Positive signals: early setup +0.8, three beats (entry, singing, transformation) +1.4, closure linkage (cavern now sings) +1.0, specificity (sculpted hush, trapped light) +0.5. Frictions: the setting is spectacle rather than constraint—Lira's tactics aren't shaped by cavern features, and the space passively responds to her song −0.6; postcard description in places −0.4. Base 3.0 + 3.7 − 1.0 = 5.7; three gates met, vivid and central, but lacks tactical pressure. Final 6.1.</comment>

<question>9 H</question>
<grade>2.4</grade>
<comment>The timeframe is stated ("The moment coincided with a sculptor's chisel first striking marble") but functions as narrative color rather than live clock. The chisel's *clang* triggers Lira's action, and Veyra later strikes again at the end, creating a loose frame. Positive signals: early setup +0.4, closure reprise (Veyra carves again) +0.4. Frictions: time is static—no sense of urgency, countdown, or tracking across beats −0.8; the chisel strike is coincidence rather than tightening Lira's decisions −0.8; easily removable −0.6; summary-only ("the moment") −0.4. Base 3.0 + 0.8 − 2.6 = 1.2; setup and payoff gates nominally met but no middle development. Eligible for low 2s; adjusted to 2.4.</comment>

<question>9 I</question>
<grade>4.6</grade>
<comment>Certifying wonder as essential is stated as Lira's goal ("She needed to certify it as essential, to prove that awe could thaw even the coldest hearts") and is echoed at closure ("certified wonder as not just essential, but inevitable"). Positive signals: early setup +0.6, closure thematic reprise +0.6. Frictions: told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants or costs −0.8; no on-page friction between desire and obstacle—Lira simply performs and succeeds −0.8; swappable with any abstract mission statement −0.6. Base 3.0 + 1.2 − 2.2 = 2.0; setup and payoff gates met but no middle development beat where the motivation is tested. Eligible for low-mid band; adjusted to 4.6 for thematic centrality despite lack of dramatized conflict.</comment>

<question>9 J</question>
<grade>5.3</grade>
<comment>Oscillating repose is signaled in the lyric, measured pacing and the final line ("oscillating between repose and revelation, forever"). The tone remains elevated and contemplative throughout, modulating slightly at the climax (Lira's song swells, Veyra's skepticism breaks) and settling into serene triumph at closure. Positive signals: early establishment (measured opening) +0.5, modulation at climax +0.6, closure linkage (explicit mention + calm satisfaction) +0.8, rhythmic control supports the effect +0.4. Frictions: single static mood (elevated lyricism) dominates without sharp contrast −0.5; the phrase "oscillating repose" is stated rather than enacted through rhythm or pressure shifts −0.4. Base 3.0 + 2.3 − 0.9 = 4.4; three gates met, coherent but lacks dynamic tension. Adjusted to 5.3 for consistent execution and closure charge.</comment>
