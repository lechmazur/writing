<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Anya's investigator role is established with concrete sensory detail and her motivation (mentor's death) provides clear drive. However, her discovery process feels passive—she climbs and finds rather than makes choices that narrow options. The engineer's sudden appearance and glazed transformation lacks causal grounding in Anya's prior observations, weakening the earned quality of the encounter. Interior contradictions are minimal; she moves methodically without visible cost until the final descent.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly within the first paragraph. The closure attempts a Conceptual Repricing—"the machine was hungry"—but the cost remains abstract; Anya descends with the patch "still warm" without forfeiting a live option or demonstrating what she has lost or risked on the page. The causal link between the patch's vibrations, the engineer's device, and the "feedback loop" is asserted rather than dramatized, creating a motivational gap at the pivotal discovery. The inferred lens is Causal, but the because/therefore chain from surveying to finding the engineer relies on convenience (she looks up at the right moment) rather than her investigative choices.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The container yard is vividly rendered with corrugated sides, faded logos, salt-stained gravel, and sodium lights. Spatial choreography is clear through Anya's methodical movement, and the environment directly constrains her choices—wind slams her, she climbs rusted ridges. The "low, electrical buzz" and temperature drop between containers supply atmospheric pressure that charges the closure image of the port as a living machine.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—documenting wind patterns to explain the crash—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure tightens when the gust knocks Anya off balance and the tablet flashes a warning, forcing her to climb. However, the engineer's presence atop the container is coincidental rather than earned by Anya's tactical choices, and the final descent lacks visible cost; she simply climbs down with her documentation intact. One meaningful tightening occurs (the wind spike and climb), but the resolution does not foreclose a path with felt sacrifice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The theme of convergence—architectural, meteorological, human—emerges through concrete imagery (containers amplifying wind, the patch's vibrations syncing with heartbeat). The phrase "some machines, once awakened, never truly sleep" risks overt thematic summary in the final paragraph, but it's somewhat earned by the prior sensory accumulation. The patch's transformation from salvaged emblem to live feedback device provides a non-literal thematic arc, though the engineer's sudden glazed state borders on convenient metaphor without grounded causation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>POV distance is stable; Anya's perceptual signature prioritizes investigative detail (airspeed, temperature drops, sensor adjustments). The mentor's teaching—"cultivate foresight in action"—anchors her stance without becoming expository. The engineer's single line of dialogue ("You felt it too") carries subtext and advances understanding, though his glazed appearance risks cliché. Diction remains consistent within her professional register; no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks mar the focus.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, with strong specific nouns (monoliths, vortices, sodium lights) and embodied action (boots crunching, fingers finding purchase). The opening "silence had settled like a second skin" and the framing of containers as a "puzzle box designed to outthink her" supply vivid texture. Minor scaffold appears in "The patch in her pocket buzzed louder now, its vibrations syncing with her heartbeat"—the heartbeat sync feels decorative rather than causally load-bearing. No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs; information density is high. A single metaphor—"dropped breadcrumbs"—reads as stock but does not obscure clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The premise—containers creating wind vortices that crash drones—offers a fresh angle on investigative procedural and blends accident analysis with subtle body-horror (the engineer "changed," the machine "hungry"). The execution avoids cliché until the engineer's glazed eyes and the "machine was hungry" declaration, which veer toward familiar tropes. The transformation of the patch from inert emblem to vibrating feedback device is inventive, but the convergence resolution feels more asserted than discovered through Anya's ingenuity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Anya (accident investigator) is present throughout and her role frames all beats. She makes micro-choices (adjusting sensors, noting temperature drop, climbing) but the pivotal discovery—finding the engineer—results from looking up at the right moment rather than investigative deduction. Her final action (descending with documentation) does not alter tactics or foreclose options. Setup and development gates are met; closure participation is passive observational rather than decision-driven.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The patch appears in paragraph two (early signal), is noted warming in paragraph four, buzzes louder in paragraph seven during the climb, and is "still warm" in the final paragraph. Across four touches it shifts from salvaged emblem to active feedback device, but it does not constrain a choice or enable a tactic—Anya climbs because of the wind and movement, not because the patch directs her. Its final state (warm) does not reweight prior material with cost. Setup, development, and payoff gates are met, but causal pressure is absent.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Singular convergence" is named in paragraph five and operationalized as the intersection of architecture, weather, and human error. It shapes Anya's realization that the containers funnel wind into unpredictable vortices and drives the thematic claim that "the port itself had become a machine." The concept anchors the closure image but does not constrain a middle choice with cost; Anya's tactics (survey, climb, document) would function identically under a simpler investigative frame. Setup and closure gates are met; middle development is thematic rather than tactical.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Rapidly adapting mind" appears once in paragraph five as a label ("Anya's rapidly adapting mind raced to connect the dots") without dramatized cost or tradeoff. The trait does not enable a specific action or constrain a choice; her climb and documentation proceed without visible tension between speed and accuracy. Ornamental mention only; no setup, development, or payoff in action.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Surveying (using tablet to record airspeed and direction, checking sensors, cross-referencing data) is established early and recurs in paragraphs two, three, five, and nine. The action enables Anya to identify the convergence and justify her recommendation to redesign the container yard. The climactic beat—climbing to find the engineer—pivots away from surveying to physical pursuit, so the action does not directly drive the final turn. Setup and development gates are met; closure linkage is indirect (documentation frames the denouement but does not charge the final image).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Documenting wind patterns is signaled in paragraph two ("map the invisible currents") and executed with tablet, sensors, and real-time data cross-referencing in paragraphs three and five. The method matters: the tablet flashes a warning that prompts the climb, and Anya's final documentation informs her redesign recommendation. Setup, development, and payoff gates are met. The method enables one key choice (the climb) but is swappable with generic investigative tools; no unique mechanics constrain tactics with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The container yard is introduced in the opening line and recurs in every paragraph, shaping Anya's movements and choices. The narrow alleys funnel wind (paragraph six gust), the stacked units provide the climb path, and the corrugated ridges supply handholds. The setting's amplification property—containers creating vortices—is the story's central mechanism and charges the closure image of the port as a living machine. Setup, development, and payoff gates are met; the setting pressures multiple choices and supplies the conceptual repricing at the end.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the town goes silent" is noted in paragraph three ("2:17 a.m. The town had gone silent hours ago") and the final paragraph references "dawn approached." Time does not tighten decisions or create a live clock; Anya's investigation proceeds at her own pace without urgency tied to the hour. Setup gate is met; development and payoff gates are absent. The silence supplies atmosphere but does not constrain tactics or alter the ending.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"To cultivate foresight in action" is named in paragraph four as the mentor's teaching and reappears implicitly when Anya adjusts sensors and notes the temperature drop. The motivation is told rather than dramatized in a choice with friction; Anya's actions (survey, climb, document) align with investigative duty without visible conflict between foresight and immediate reaction. Setup gate is met; development and payoff gates show thematic echo but no on-page tradeoff or cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Hazy precision" operates throughout: meticulous sensor readings coexist with the "electrical buzz" and the patch's inexplicable vibrations. The tone modulates from methodical investigation (paragraphs two–three) to uncanny discovery (paragraphs six–eight) and settles into sober documentation (paragraph nine). The tonal blend charges the closure image of the awakened machine, but the final paragraph's declarative certainty ("she knew the truth") loses the haze without purposeful reason. Setup, development, and partial payoff gates are met; coherence slips slightly at the end.</comment>
