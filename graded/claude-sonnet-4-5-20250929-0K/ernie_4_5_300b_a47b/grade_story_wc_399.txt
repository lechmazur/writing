<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Mara lacks meaningful internal contradiction or embodied struggle. Her emotions are declared ("strange, honest smile," "heart light") rather than shown through contradictory impulses in action. The prophet remains a cipher without motive or conflict; his presence enables but does not pressure. The "consecration" unfolds without visible cost to either character—no path is foreclosed, no value hierarchy tested on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed: who Mara is, what "line walker" means, and why she's waiting remain abstract past 120 words; apply −0.4. The closure offers no decisive change—Mara replaces her mask and walks on exactly as before, the echo "preserved" without visible cost or altered options. The piece gestures toward Accumulative design but delivers only decorative recurrence (pavilion hums, dunes shift) without pressure tightening or a final image that reweights prior material. No felt cost at closure; the ending summarizes rather than dramatizes consequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Vivid fantasy lexicon (whisperfield, kinetic parapet, murmuring pavilion) but the parapet's mechanics remain vague—stones "rearrange," "glow," "surge," "spiral" without spatial clarity or constraint on choice. The pavilion hums and trembles but does not limit or enable tactics. The final image recycles earlier descriptions without new pressure. Micro-setting test: no object or body detail constrains a key choice or charges the closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("preserve the echo of wisdom") is declared but never tested on the page—no risk of failure, no competing value, no visible price paid. The consecration proceeds without obstacle or reversal; coincidence (prophet's arrival) enables rather than complicates. "The echo is preserved" / "For now" deflates any achieved pressure. No tightening that forecloses an option; the line "remains" exactly as it was, confirming stasis without earned cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Theme of preservation and wisdom-as-living-archive is stated rather than emerged from conflict. "Strangely honest" appears as label without dramatized tradeoff. The final paragraph moralizes: "balance was restored," "the line would endure"—abstract summation replacing scene pressure. No fresh inflection; the "echo of wisdom" recurs as decorative motif without reweighting prior material or offering a non-literal answer to a central question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited to Mara is mostly stable, though "the prophet watched her go, knowing she would return" briefly shifts to his knowledge. Voice remains generic high-fantasy register ("cycles," "sages," "consecration") without character-specific texture or perceptual bias. Dialogue is sparse and functional but lacks subtext or goal pursuit—lines could be swapped between characters. Psychic distance is uniform, offering no modulation under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Pervasive paraphrase loops and synonym churn: "murmuring pavilion" / "pavilion's whispers" / "pavilion trembled" / "pavilion fell silent" / "pavilion began to hum" across seven beats without new information. Template cadence: "The prophet [verb]. Mara [verb]. The parapet [verb]." Figurative language is heavy but vague ("voices coiling like smoke," "branches on a tree") without coherent vehicle. Stock high-fantasy diction ("beading on his brow," "wind chimes," "beacon in the endless sea") replaces specificity. Apply −1.2 for loops and template stems; disallow 9+ globally per artifact rule.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Core premise (mystical line-walker preserves ancient wisdom with prophet's aid) follows genre template without fresh angle. "Conjured clearings," "peripheral awareness," "kinetic parapet" are fantasy-lexicon placeholders—interchangeable with other mystical terms. No risk or tradeoff personalizes the arc; the transformation test fails (swap names/places, arc is unchanged). The "strangely honest" trait and half-mask are ornamental quirks rather than constraints that drive choice.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Mara (half-masked line walker) is present throughout but makes no choice that alters tactics or forecloses a path. She waits, explains, traces symbols, feels the echo solidify, and resumes walking—all procedural actions without cost or reversal. The mask slip and replacement are gestural, not causal. Setup and middle presence allow mid-band, but no closure participation with cost caps at 3.8; swappability and ornamental use lower further.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Kinetic parapet appears in five beats (shudders, glows, surges, spirals, settles) but its mechanics remain abstract—it "responds" without constraining choice or altering outcome. Setup is clear; middle beat involvement is descriptive rather than enabling; closure participation is passive ("settled into a new pattern"). Two-gate presence and multiple touches allow ~5.0 neighborhood, but lack of causal pressure and swappability (any mystical barrier could serve) prevent higher.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Conjured clearings are introduced mid-story ("places where time bent and memories took root"), described as repositories Mara "sees," then stabilized off-page. No on-page choice depends on them; their mechanics are told, not shown. Late first appearance (past 40% mark) caps at 4.6; ornamental use (−0.5) and summary-only involvement (−0.8) lower to upper 2.x band. Present but does not shape stakes or tactics.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Strangely honest" appears as label ("they call me") without on-page demonstration or cost. The mask removal is described as revealing "scars and serenity," but no choice hinges on honesty versus deception. The trait could be omitted without altering any beat. Ornamental mention (−1.0), label-only use (−0.3), and missing all three gates place it in low band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Consecrate" frames the central action: Mara says "The sages demand consecration," they perform the ritual together, and the echo is preserved. Setup and middle development are clear; the action drives the procedural arc. However, it's swappable (any ritual term fits) and resolves without cost or complication—no failed attempt, no sacrifice. Three gates met allow ≥6.1 eligibility, but swappability (−0.6) and lack of cost connection (−0.4) place it mid-5.x.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"Through peripheral awareness" is named twice: Mara "honed" it over years (backstory) and "closed her eyes, letting her peripheral awareness expand" during the ritual. The method is told, not shown—we never see how it differs from ordinary perception or constrains her tactics. Summary-only use (−0.8), late functional appearance (second half, −0.3), and swappability (any mystical sense would serve, −0.6) keep it below 4.0.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>Murmuring pavilion is the physical anchor: Mara stands beneath it, its lattice hums with sages' voices, it trembles and falls silent at closure. Setup is immediate; middle beats involve repeated description; it returns at closure ("began to hum once more"). However, it never constrains a choice or alters tactics—purely atmospheric. Three gates met but ornamental use (−1.0) and no causal pressure (−0.8) place it mid-4.x.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"After the prophet arrives" frames the entire sequence: opening line establishes his arrival, Mara has "waited three cycles for this moment," the story closes with "After the prophet arrived, the world had shifted." Setup, middle reference, and closure callback are all present. However, time does not tighten decisions—the ritual proceeds without clock pressure or deadline. Three gates allow ≥6.1, but lack of tactical constraint (−0.5) holds it at upper 5.x.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"To preserve the echo of wisdom" is stated as Mara's duty in paragraph one and confirmed at closure ("The echo is preserved"). The motivation frames her waiting and the consecration action. However, it is never dramatized through conflict—no competing desire, no cost of preservation shown, no friction between want and obstacle. Setup and closure presence meet two gates (~6.0 eligible), but told-only execution (−0.8) and lack of on-page friction (−1.0) lower to low 4.x.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Whisperfield calm" appears in the title phrase and three times in body text: "whisperfield dunes" (opening), "whisperfield calm settled" (mid-ritual), "In the whisperfield calm" (penultimate paragraph). Tone is consistent—meditative, unhurried—and modulates slightly as the pavilion's voices rise and fall. Setup, middle, and closure presence meet three gates. However, tone does not charge the final image with new pressure; it remains static. Three gates allow ≥6.1, but lack of modulation under pressure (−0.8) and ornamental recurrence (−0.5) place it mid-4.x.</comment>
