<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The summoner remains abstract throughout—"terrestrially cosmic" eyes and "tranquil blaze" motivation are labels without embodied cost or contradiction. No micro-choices under pressure reveal hierarchy of values; she executes a ritual without internal friction or genuine struggle. The ending claims success via passive dissolution ("crumbling to dust") rather than a choice that forecloses a path. Diagnostic phrasing ("tranquil blaze," "smoothed hush") replaces particularized interiority.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) appear early, but causality is declarative: the summoner places the wing, it glows, the prophecy is "hushed into submission" without on-page resistance or reversal. The closure unit—wing crumbles, prophecy defused—occurs by passive mechanics rather than protagonist agency reweighting options. No meaningful tightening or cost legible on the page; the "fracture" and "storm" remain abstract threats never tested. Inferred lens is nominally Situational, but pressure never crystallizes into a stance with felt consequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The nocturnal haven and brook are vividly described (moss, fireflies, water ripples) and anchor the single scene early. However, the environment remains decorative—no spatial constraint or resource alters tactics. The origami wing's physical state (absorbing water, crumbling) could qualify as micro-setting, but it dissolves by fiat rather than constraining a choice or charging the final image with cost. Sensory detail (wet earth, distant stars) is selective but does not guide decision.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake—hushing a prophecy to save the haven—is signaled early but never tested on the page. No reversal, deepening choice, or visible price narrows options; the summoner performs a ritual, the wing glows, and success is declared. Coincidence (the wing's passive absorption) resolves the threat without protagonist trade-off. The "fracture" and "cosmic roar" remain abstract; no on-page tightening forces agency or forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Theme—silence as language, fragility versus chaos—is stated rather than dramatized through choice and cost. The prophecy "code" is claimed to unravel but the mechanics remain opaque; no earned insight arises from struggle. The final image (wing crumbling, brook resuming) gestures at tranquility restored but offers no non-literal reweighting or conceptual cost. Prompt labels ("smoothed hush," "tranquil blaze") replace concrete action that would let theme emerge from particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, but diction drifts into elevated register ("terrestrially cosmic," "smoothed hush," "tranquil blaze") that clashes with immediate perception under pressure. Perceptual signature is generic—fireflies, moss, brook—without character-specific bias. The single line of dialogue ("The prophecy speaks of a fracture") adds no subtext or goal pursuit. Filter verbs ("she had learned," "she knew") dull immediacy at key beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Overwriting pervades: "terrestrially cosmic," "smoothed hush," "tranquil blaze," "nocturnal haven" stack figurative and abstract phrasing in most sentences without pattern-teaching or payoff. Paraphrase loops cluster in the middle ("the hush was not passive; it was a force, a current" restates without adding pressure). Mixed metaphor: "tranquil blaze" contradicts itself; "hush must flow like starlight" mixes incompatible vehicles. Template cadence runs appear in the reflective blocks ("She had learned…She had spent…She had done"). Cumulative deductions: density −0.6, coherence −0.5, loop −0.4, total cap per artifact rule at 3.9 with final-third presence disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Core premise—summoner decodes prophecy through silence and origami—combines familiar elements (mystic ritual, paper crane symbolism, abstract threat) without transformation. Emotional arc and plot could swap in any ritual object or elemental force with minor edits. The "smoothed hush" and "terrestrially cosmic" diction read as prompt-response ornament rather than organic voice. No bold structural risk or non-obvious synthesis; the ending's declared resolution lacks the friction that would make it feel earned and surprising in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>The solitary summoner is present throughout and performs the central ritual, satisfying setup and payoff. However, her "choices" are pre-scripted ritual steps without on-page friction or cost; no decision alters tactics or forecloses a path. The character's agency is passive execution rather than dilemma-driven action. Cap for missing middle development (no choice that narrows options) = 3.4; further reduction for swappability (any mystic ritualist could perform these steps) and ornamental interiority (labels without contradictory impulses acting in scene) brings the score to 2.4.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The crane's origami wing appears in setup (folded from midnight-blue paper), is placed at the water's edge in the middle beat, absorbs water and glows, then crumbles at closure—satisfying all three gates and appearing in multiple beats. However, its mechanics are passive (it glows by fiat, not protagonist effort) and it could be replaced by any ritual object with minor edits. No specific cost is tied to the wing itself; the summoner experiences no trade-off in using it. Early signal +0.5, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +0.9, but swappability −0.7 and lack of tied cost −0.5 yield 5.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>The "smoothed hush" appears as a theme label throughout but never constrains an on-page choice or tactic. The summoner is said to "map the silence" and "let the hush flow," yet these remain abstract claims without dramatized mechanics or cost. The concept is ornamental, serving as atmospheric phrasing rather than shaping stakes. Present in setup and payoff as description, but missing middle development (no choice enabled or constrained by this concept) caps at 3.4; ornamental use −0.8, label-only −0.3, and swappability (could substitute "focused calm" or "gathered stillness") −0.4 bring the score to 2.1.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>The "terrestrially cosmic" eyes—"one iris swirling like a nebula, the other steady as aged earth"—are described in setup and mentioned again at closure ("reflecting the crane's glow"). The attribute never constrains or enables an on-page action; it functions solely as a visual descriptor without mechanical consequence or cost. Label-only trait without dramatized tradeoff. Cap for missing middle development = 3.4; ornamental use −0.8, label-only −0.3, swappability −0.5 (could replace with any mystic visual marker) yield 1.8.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Flow" appears as a verb in the summoner's internal narration ("flow with that language," "let her thoughts flow like the brook," "flowed with the tranquil blaze") across setup and middle beats, and is implied at closure when the brook resumes its flow. However, the action is metaphorical and passive—she "lets" rather than performs a concrete, costly act. No major turn traces specifically to flowing; the ritual's success is declared without this action being mechanically necessary. Present in all three gates but swappable with "merge," "align," or "attune." Early signal +0.4, two beats +0.9, closure presence +0.7, but swappability −0.8 and summary-only use (described, not dramatized with friction) −0.7 yield 4.3.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Mapping silence" is named in setup ("she would map the silence") and appears in the middle beat ("She began to map the silence, her mind tracing the contours of unspoken sounds"). The method is claimed as the key but its mechanics remain opaque—no on-page cost, tool, or constraint shows how mapping works or what it forecloses. The prophecy's code "lay exposed" by narrative fiat, not through demonstrated application of this method. Present in setup and middle (cap eligible to ~6.0 with strong work), but ornamental and summary-only: no choice hinges on this method's success or failure. Swappability −0.7 (could replace with "channeling" or "focusing"), ornamental −0.6, summary-only −0.5 yield 2.6.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The "nocturnal haven beside a quiet brook" anchors the single scene early and provides vivid sensory detail (moss, fireflies, water). The brook's surface is used as a reflective medium for the ritual, and the setting's tranquility mirrors the thematic "hush." However, no spatial constraint or resource shortage alters tactics—the summoner could perform this ritual anywhere with water. The setting is atmospheric but functionally passive. Setup +0.6, one beat involvement (brook as ritual surface) +0.4, closure presence (brook resumes murmur) +0.8, but swappability (any quiet water source) −0.6 and ornamental framing (postcard description) −0.5 yield 5.2.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>"Amid whispered secrets" appears in the opening and closing paragraphs as a tonal phrase but never functions as a tightening clock. No deadline or temporal pressure is dramatized; the summoner has "spent weeks studying" and arrives "tonight" without urgency or countdown. The timeframe is label-only atmosphere, not a constraint that alters tactics or stakes. Present in setup and payoff but missing middle development; vague and untracked. Cap for missing middle = 3.4; ornamental −0.6, label-only −0.3, swappability (could replace with "under starlight" or "in stillness") −0.4 yield 2.3.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The motivation—"to hush the chaos before it devoured the fragile peace of the haven"—is stated early and frames the ritual action. The summoner's commitment is declared ("her motivation burned like a tranquil blaze"), and the ending confirms success. However, the desire is never conflicted on the page; no friction between want and cost, no moment where she weighs the price of hushing the prophecy. The motivation is told and executed without dramatized stakes or sacrifice. Setup +0.6, middle involvement (ritual performed toward this goal) +0.4, closure (goal achieved) +0.8, but told-only (no on-page dilemma) −0.6 and swappability (any protective goal) −0.5 yield 4.7.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Tranquil blaze" is mentioned twice as a phrase and used to describe the summoner's motivation and final state. The tone attempts oxymoron (tranquil + blaze) but the prose never modulates—description remains uniformly lyrical and abstract without escalation or pressure shift. No coherent tonal charge at the final image; the ending feels static rather than reweighted. Present in setup and payoff but missing middle modulation. Single static mood trends mid-low per the rubric. Cap for missing middle = 3.4; static execution −0.5, label-only (phrase rather than embodied tonal work) −0.3, plus template phrasing (repeated verbatim) −0.3 yield 3.1.</comment>
