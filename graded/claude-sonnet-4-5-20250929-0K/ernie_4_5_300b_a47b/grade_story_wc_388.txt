<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation as truth-excavator is declared but not dramatized through contradictory impulses or visible struggle. Her "intuition prickled" and mechanical puzzle-solving feel competent without cost—the decision to place the diamond reads as puzzle-completion rather than a choice that forecloses a path with felt weight. The survival motivation ("not just truth—it was survival") arrives late and competes with the truth-excavator frame without friction. Internal experience remains functional but lacks embodied contradiction under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Causal. Orientation anchors arrive cleanly (wasteland orchard, Mara kneeling). The closure—placing the flawed diamond to seal the stillpoint—lands on the page, but the cost is environmental (radiation drops, orchard relaxes) rather than a visible sacrifice or foreclosed option for Mara herself. The letters deliver exposition that enables the solution rather than narrowing her choices through prior causality. One meaningful tightening occurs (fissure opens, dual-diamond reveal), but the final act feels like puzzle-solving without a felt price that reweights her stance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The orchard's radioactive dust storms, glowing apples, and tree-lean toward center create vivid, purpose-driven setting. The clearing's ground markings and fissure chamber constrain the climactic choice by dictating where the diamond must be placed, satisfying the 9+ gate partially. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Mara's investigative lens (loam, grit, humming air). Spatial choreography remains coherent across moves from cottage to clearing to chamber.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—seal the stillpoint to prevent boundary collapse—is signaled by midpoint via the letters. One on-page reversal occurs when the flawless diamond appears, reframing the flawed gem as decoy. However, Mara's hesitation moment ("felt heavier now") lacks a dramatized trade-off; she places the diamond without visible sacrifice or foreclosed path. Agency reads as execution of a discovered solution rather than a choice under competing pressures. The environmental consequence (radiation drops) is visible but not a personal cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme—dangerous secrets and the cost of truth—emerges through the stillpoint's leakage and Crane's vanishing, avoiding overt statement until the final line's "too dangerous to stay buried" edges toward summary. The flawed/flawless diamond pair offers a non-literal frame (decoy versus true anchor), but the resolution into "hope" and "keep digging" softens the ambiguity the dual diamonds introduced. The orchard's survival provides closure without forcing Mara to renounce a competing value, limiting thematic friction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature—conspiracy debunker filtering details through pattern-recognition ("felt like a pattern worth unraveling")—is present but mechanical. Diction stays consistent, though phrases like "truth excavator" and "comfortable lies" lean toward self-branding rather than idiosyncratic thought. No dialogue on the page. Psychic distance is controlled; the midnight letter-assembly beat ("breath fogged") anchors present action cleanly.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Prose is clear and propulsive with varied sentence structure. Opening image ("apples glowed like miniature suns") and "fingers grasping for an unseen force" are vivid. Minor loops: "The orchard's trees defied logic—thriving..." echoes prompt language; "truth excavator" and "comfortable lies" recur as labels without fresh embodiment. The phrase "The wasteland stretched ahead, but for the first time in years, Mara felt hope" tells emotional shift rather than showing it through image or action. Information density is solid; no major scaffold or template cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The dual-diamond decoy (flawed lure, flawless anchor) offers a fresh inflection on the cursed-object trope, and the stillpoint-as-dimension concept is specific. However, the conspiracy-debunker-in-wasteland setup and letter-reassembly mystery follow familiar adventure-puzzle templates. The climactic reveal (second diamond on pedestal) and solution (place the flawed one to seal) feel mechanically ingenious without transforming emotional or moral terrain. Risk-taking is moderate; the piece executes its genre competently but does not subvert or deepen the frame through character cost.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Setup: present from opening ("conspiracy debunker," "truth excavator"). Development: Mara reassembles letters and interprets the stillpoint clues—observation and deduction rather than constrained choice. Payoff: she places the diamond at closure, a decision that resolves the plot. However, the choice feels like executing a discovered solution rather than a turn driven by internal conflict or competing values. Two beats (letter assembly, diamond placement) plus closure presence → ~5.0–5.5 range, but swappability (another investigator could perform the same steps) and lack of visible cost cap the score.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Setup: introduced early ("flawed, milky-white gem rumored to be cursed"). Development: Mara carries it, studies it, and its symbols align with soil markings in the clearing—two distinct beats with tactile and visual engagement. Payoff: placing it on the pedestal seals the stillpoint, directly shaping closure. The dual-diamond reveal reweights its meaning (decoy, not curse), adding specificity. Cost connection is environmental rather than personal. Strong beat involvement and closure linkage, but the protagonist's relationship to the object lacks friction or sacrifice, preventing higher scores.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Setup: "stillpoint" appears in Crane's journal by paragraph one. Development: the letters explain its mechanics (dimension where time pauses, fertility leakage), shaping Mara's understanding and tactics. Payoff: sealing the stillpoint is the climactic action and prevents boundary collapse. The concept drives stakes and the ending choice. However, the stillpoint itself remains abstract—Mara never experiences it directly, and its properties are told via letters rather than dramatized. Three-gate presence with causal pressure but limited sensory embodiment.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Setup: "sharply observant gaze swept the horizon" signals the trait early. Development: Mara notices the tree-lean pattern and reassembles shredded letters—actions consistent with observation, but no visible trade-off or cost tied to hyper-focus. The trait enables puzzle-solving without constraining her socially or physically. Label-only mentions ("intuition prickled") recur without embodied friction. Present across beats but ornamental; swapping "observant" for "analytical" would not alter structure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Setup: "Mara's intuition prickled" appears at the cottage, priming the method. Development: intuition guides letter reassembly and interpretation of the clearing's hum. Payoff: her hesitation moment ("intuition screamed") precedes the dual-diamond recognition, shaping the final choice. Two beats plus closure linkage. However, "intuit" overlaps heavily with "observant"—the mechanics remain cognitive pattern-recognition rather than a distinct, irreplaceable action. Functional but near-swappable with "deduce" or "infer."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Setup: shredded letters appear in the desk drawer by the cottage scene. Development: Mara spreads and reassembles them by midnight, a tactile beat that occupies significant story real estate and delivers the stillpoint explanation. Payoff: the reassembled letters provide the map for the climactic choice, and she pockets them as evidence. The method is specific, irreplaceable (no other means yields the stillpoint knowledge), and shapes the causal chain. Strong beat involvement and closure linkage; the physical act is dramatized on the page.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Setup: "wasteland orchard thriving amid radioactive dust storms" anchors the opening line. Development: the orchard's fertility mystery motivates investigation; the clearing's tree-circle and ground markings dictate where the diamond must be placed. Payoff: sealing the stillpoint stops the leakage, and the orchard's survival is the visible outcome. The setting supplies both the puzzle (trees lean inward) and the constraint (markings align with diamond symbols). Environment shapes tactics and charges the final image (trees "unfurling like sighs"). Indispensable across all three gates.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>Setup: "three weeks ago" locates Crane's disappearance, but no present clock or urgency signal. Development: the "midnight" letter-assembly is the only temporal anchor; no ticking pressure tied to "after the liquidation." Payoff: "dawn broke" marks the resolution, but the time element does not tighten Mara's choices. The phrase "after the liquidation" remains abstract—liquidation of what, when, by whom?—and never constrains tactics or escalates stakes. Present as background but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Setup: "truth excavator" and "excavate truth from comfortable lies" frame Mara's identity early. Development: her reputation is invoked, and the survival motive ("not just truth—it was survival") appears late, competing with the truth-frame. Payoff: the final line ("keep digging") reprises the excavation metaphor. However, no on-page moment dramatizes a conflict between truth and comfort—Mara never faces a choice to suppress or share dangerous knowledge. The motivation is told and thematically present but lacks friction or cost. Lyric reprise lifts it into mid-band.</comment>
