<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to name nameless fears is established and carried through, but his interior life remains largely declarative. The backstory about Lira exceeds 20% by rough count and flattens present pressure in the middle third—*"He'd failed to answer then. Now, he whispered, '*Fear. And names.*'"* reads more like thematic caption than embodied choice. The prism action and whispered response constitute micro-choices, but the final turn lacks visceral cost; we see monsters dissolve, not Elias foreclosing a live path with visible sacrifice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation is clean. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: Elias moves from seeking solace to crystallizing echoes through scattered light, accumulating sensory density until the monsters dissolve. However, the closure unit—monsters vanishing into mist, page gaining "weight," Elias descending—registers as description rather than a decisive on-page change with legible cost. The final paragraph tells us he's "ready" and that his heart "beat with a distant intimacy," but no prior option is foreclosed and no visible price paid on the page. The Cost Proof Test fails: I cannot point to an exact sentence where Elias loses, renounces, or forecloses something tangible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The observatory's dust, rust, amber dusk, broken celestial clock, and mahogany cabinet anchor the scene with vivid specificity. The prism's refracted light constrains the ritual action and charges the climax when "the light flared" and monsters solidify. Spatial choreography is coherent throughout. The setting qualifies as micro-setting that shapes the method and final image, meeting the 9+ gate in principle, but the closure image—descending stairs under indifferent stars—feels atmospheric rather than constraint-driven, capping the score near the 7-band ceiling.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—giving names to nameless fears—is signaled early and pursued through the prism ritual. The whispers escalate from faint to "dissonant hum" to a single clear phrase, a tightening consistent with Accumulative lens. Yet the resolution is passive: the monsters "dissolved into mist" with no on-page cost to Elias's agency. He repeats their phrase and they vanish; luck or atmospheric magic resolves the conflict rather than his sacrifice or renunciation. The final paragraph asserts readiness but shows no forfeited path or tactical shift.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The theme of naming the shapeless emerges organically from the ritual and Lira's memory. The line *"The echo of sacrifice… was about giving shape to the shapeless, voice to the voiceless"* verges on direct thematic statement but remains tied to Elias's action. The prism and atlas motifs recur purposefully. However, the final image—stars "ancient and indifferent," monsters returning as "all fears do"—reaches for resonance without a non-literal answer rooted in prior particulars; it tells us the cycle continues rather than reweighting the premise through a final specific image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent, with controlled psychic distance and a Gothic-inflected register that suits Elias's role as reaper. Diction like "veil," "atlas page," and "dissonant hum" maintains tone. The interior monologue during the ritual—*"sacrifice was never quiet"*—fits the established voice. However, the final paragraph shifts into summarizing reflection (*"The echo of sacrifice, he realized, wasn't just about loss"*) that reads more like thematic wrap-up than embodied perception under pressure. No dialogue appears; focalization remains stable throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; sentences range from terse (*"The observatory fell silent"*) to layered (*"He'd discovered these echoes after finding the old recordings—wax cylinders…"*). Information density is high in the opening and ritual beats. However, paraphrase loops appear: the monsters' eyes "once dull, now glowed faintly, as if awakening" and two sentences later "their forms solidified… scales iridescent… jaws open"—both describe the same visual escalation without adding causal pressure. The phrase "distant intimacy" recurs in the final paragraph without new charge. Minor scaffold phrases like "he'd realized" and "he wondered" dull immediacy. Deduct −0.6 for paraphrase and template stems, capping the score below 7.2.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The reaper-as-cartographer combination and the prism-light method offer fresh angles on grief and fear. The atlas page with sea monsters is a specific, non-generic anchor. However, the core emotional arc—heartbroken guardian seeks solace in archives, performs ritual, gains insight—follows a recognizable template without surprising transformation. The monsters vanishing into mist and Elias descending "ready" feel familiar rather than inevitable in hindsight. The Transformation Test is borderline: swap the reaper for a librarian and the atlas for a grimoire, and the emotional beats remain intact.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elias is present throughout and his heartbreak over Lira frames the story. He makes the decision to use the prism and whispers the monsters' phrase aloud, two on-page choices. However, these choices do not create key turns—the monsters dissolve seemingly of their own accord after he repeats their words. His role is primarily observational and reactive; the ritual's success is atmospheric rather than earned through his agency under pressure. Setup is strong, development is present but passive, payoff is descriptive. Cap at 4.6 for missing causal middle development.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The atlas page appears early (setup), is handled during the prism ritual (development), and gains "newfound weight" at closure (payoff). It is described in two distinct beats: initial discovery and the crystallization ritual. The page's shift from static illustration to glowing, solidified monsters to heavy artifact reweights its meaning. However, the change is told rather than shown to constrain a subsequent choice—Elias tucks it away and descends, but we do not see him forfeit or alter tactics because of its new weight. Strong setup and development, but payoff is summary-descriptor rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The concept "echo of sacrifice" is named explicitly and connected to Lira's loss and the ritual. It shapes Elias's motivation and is invoked in the middle reflection (*"sacrifice was never quiet"*) and the final paragraph (*"The echo of sacrifice… was about giving shape to the shapeless"*). However, on-page action does not hinge on this concept—no sacrifice is enacted or refused with visible cost. The concept functions as thematic claim rather than constraint that narrows options or forces a trade-off. Setup and thematic development are present; causal payoff is absent.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The echoes—whispers from wax cylinders—are introduced early, escalate from faint to overlapping hum, and coalesce into the monsters' final phrase. They enable the ritual by amplifying through the prism's light. Two distinct beats: initial discovery/listening and the crystallization scene. The echoes resist (*"Do not name them"*) and thus constrain Elias's action, though the cost of overcoming that resistance is not visible on the page. All three gates present; causal pressure moderate; closure linkage indirect (monsters speak through echoes, then vanish).</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The action "crystallize" is named in Elias's realization (*"the method… was through scattered light… amplify the echoes, perhaps even crystallize them"*) and enacted when "the atlas page began to shimmer" and "the monsters' forms solidified." This is the story's climactic turn. However, it is triggered by positioning the prism rather than a high-cost protagonist choice, and the result—monsters dissolving—reads passive. The action is present in setup (concept), development (attempt), and payoff (shimmer/solidification), but its mechanics feel atmospheric rather than irreplaceable. Easily swappable with "summon," "reveal," or "manifest."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Scattered light via the prism is signaled midpoint (*"by refracting the fading sunlight through the prism… he could amplify the echoes"*), enacted in the ritual (*"He positioned the prism… until the light split into a rainbow"*), and present at closure (*"the prism's light extinguished"*). The method is specific and irreplaceable—scattered light is what allows crystallization. However, it appears somewhat late (past the 40% mark as method; present as object earlier) and its mechanics are summarized rather than dramatically tested. All three gates met; causal role solid; specificity high. Late signal and summary execution lower the score slightly.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The ancient observatory anchors every beat: dust and rust establish tone, the broken celestial clock yields the atlas page, the marble pedestal holds the scythe, dusk's amber light fuels the prism ritual, and the spiral stairs frame the descent. The setting supplies the archive, recordings, and light source—resources that enable the ritual. The environment constrains timing (dusk fading) and charges the final image (stars winking into view). Setup immediate, development continuous, payoff strong. The setting is indispensable to story logic and tone.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The timeframe "after finding the old recordings" is stated explicitly and frames the narrative present. The recordings' discovery motivates Elias's crystallization attempt. However, time itself does not tighten decisions—dusk provides light for the ritual, but no urgency or countdown pressures Elias's choices. The timeframe is present and logically consistent but swappable (he could have found the recordings days or weeks prior with no structural change). Setup clear, development functional, payoff absent. Cap at 4.6 for missing middle and closure pressure; further lower to 3.8 for replaceability.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elias's motivation—to give names to nameless fears—is stated early (*"His motivation had crystallized then"*) and pursued through the ritual. It connects to Lira's unresolved question and is affirmed in the final paragraph (*"giving shape to the shapeless, voice to the voiceless"*). The desire drives his choice to use the prism. However, it is told more than dramatized in conflicted action; no friction between wanting to name and fearing the cost appears on the page. Setup strong, development present, payoff thematic. Lacks visible trade-off at the choice point.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The tone "distant intimacy" is established through Gothic remove (reaper, dust, dusk, ancient stars) layered with personal grief (Lira's memory, "heartbroken," "failed to answer"). The phrase appears explicitly in the penultimate paragraph (*"distant intimacy—a connection to the fears he'd named"*). Tone modulates subtly: clinical observation in the opening, rising tension during the ritual, reflective melancholy at closure. The final image—indifferent stars, quiet observatory—charges the tone with loneliness and resolve. Coherent throughout, with purposeful modulation. The explicit naming in the text feels slightly labored but does not break the effect.</comment>
