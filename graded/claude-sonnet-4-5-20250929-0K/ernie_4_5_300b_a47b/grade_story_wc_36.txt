<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is established early and interiority is present, but interior contradiction is thin—he moves from grief to insight without the pull of competing impulses acting simultaneously. The mentor's cryptic "unmake your failures" lands as puzzle rather than visceral stakes. Embodied emotion appears ("throat tightened," "hands shook") but some beats lean toward label-only ("fear," "resolve"). The final choice to etch a rune for surrender reads as conceptual shift rather than earned renunciation with visible cost that forecloses a live option on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads Causal-Accumulative Hybrid: the flute opens a passage, the specter delivers riddle, Kael plays discordantly and breaks the flute, then learns silence is key. Orientation anchors who/where/when within the first paragraph. The closure—retrieving broken reeds and etching a new rune—suggests Resonant Reconfiguration (surrender replaces mastery), but the cost is muted: the flute can be repaired, the walk home feels more symbolic than decisive, and no live option is visibly foreclosed. The mentor's moth-dissolution and starfield visions function as atmosphere more than causal tightening.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Thunder-Echo Range is vividly rendered with "stone spires clawed at bruised sky," "petrified pine and ozone," obsidian staircase, and chamber "where time pooled like liquid." Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency (sound in canyon, glow in descent, silence in chamber). The driftwood markers recur at open and close, reweighting directional choice into surrender. Spatial choreography is clear. The setting guides choice (fissure opens, staircase descends) and charges the final image (twilight, rearranged markers), meeting the 9+ gate for micro-setting constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—master the flute's true purpose—is signaled early. One meaningful tightening occurs when the specter says "unmake" and the chamber forces Kael to face shadow-selves. Agency at closure is present (he retrieves fragments, etches new rune) but reads as acceptance rather than a choice that narrows options or pays visible cost. The flute's breaking feels accidental (it slips), not a protagonist-driven reversal. No persistent constraint shapes tactics; the lesson arrives via exposition ("the flute's power lies…in its silence") rather than earned pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Theme of failure-as-teacher emerges from events (mentor's death, prior theft, shadow-selves) and the "avalanchingly quiet" note motif recurs with shifted meaning. The final image—rune for surrender, fragments in pack, "song now a quiet hum"—offers non-literal answer without moralizing. However, the specter's instruction "to weave…you must first unravel your own" borders on thematic statement, and "To harvest insights from failure was to stop fighting the current" in the penultimate paragraph edges into articulated thesis rather than pure resonance from particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present ("the air thick with the scent of petrified pine and ozone," "tone so pure it seemed to unravel the very silence"). Diction fits a relic-keeper's register with elevated archaisms ("uncase," "avalanchingly quiet," "weaving threads between worlds"). The specter's dialogue ("You seek answers in the echoes") reads slightly formal but plausible for a mystical guide. Psychic distance narrows appropriately under stress (roar, hands shake). Prose rhythm modulates with emotional beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Avalanchingly quiet" appears twice with identical phrasing; minor loop penalty. Some figurative density clusters without full payoff: "needle through silk," "tapestry of grief," "blade" for riddle, "swarm of moths"—each vivid but not all constrain action. "The canyon held its breath" is stock. Sentence openings vary and information density is adequate. No major scaffold or template cadence runs. Clarity remains high; no causality breaks. The line "To harvest insights from failure was to stop fighting the current" reads as summary-thesis rather than scene pressure, docking momentum slightly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mystical-instrument-opens-portal and mentor-as-ghost are familiar fantasy templates. The twist—flute's power is silence, not sound—offers a mild inversion but the moral calculus (surrender over mastery) is well-trodden in spiritual-journey tales. Specific details (obsidian stairs, moths scattering ash, driftwood runes) add texture but do not fundamentally transform the template. The emotional arc (grief → failed attempt → epiphany → acceptance) follows a predictable path. Risk-taking is modest; no bold structural or perspectival choices heighten stakes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Kael is on-page throughout and his choices (play flute, roar and drop it, retrieve fragments, etch new rune) drive beats. The final rune-etching directly alters his stance and future path. Present across setup, middle choice (breaking the flute), and closure. Two distinct beats of agency. Causal pressure moderate: the mentor's riddle prompts action but the lesson arrives via exposition. Closure linkage clear (rune, fragments). Specificity: "relic keeper" role shapes lens and the guardianship ending anchors timeframe.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Flute introduced paragraph one (setup), played twice (canyon, chamber), breaks mid-scene, and fragments are carried home in closure image. Four distinct beats. Causal: uncasing initiates descent, discordant notes summon shadows, breaking halts the starfield, fragments symbolize lesson. Closure linkage strong (fragments in pack, song as hum). Cost visible: reeds snap, must be replaced. Specificity: gilded surface, brittle reeds, glow. Not fully indispensable—another mystical object could serve—but deeply woven.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Weaving between worlds" appears in exposition ("said to bridge the veil," "weaving threads between worlds") and the specter's instruction but does not constrain an on-page tactical choice. The fissure opens and Kael descends, but the mechanics of world-bridging remain abstract. Present at setup (relic lore) and thematically at closure (unravel/weave metaphor) but no middle beat where this concept enables or blocks a concrete action. Functional but largely thematic rather than stake-shaping.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Avalanchingly quiet" modifies canyon hush in paragraph one and the climactic note in the chamber. Lyric seed → reprise structure. The term reweights silence from mere absence to active power, charging the closure lesson. However, it does not constrain a choice or impose visible cost; it functions as tonal/thematic descriptor. Present at setup and closure but no middle development where it alters tactics. Reaches lyric-resonance allowance range (5.5–6.3) but lacks causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Uncasing the flute in paragraph one initiates the sequence (setup). The action is specific and irreplaceable—without it, Kael has no instrument to play. However, it does not drive a middle reversal or appear again at closure; the key middle turn is breaking the flute (accidental slip), and closure centers on etching the rune. Present at setup, absent from middle choice and closure participation. Causal role limited to inciting incident. Swappable with "drew" or "lifted" in function.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Driftwood markers introduced paragraph two (setup) and reappear at closure when Kael etches a new rune. The method is specific (runes only he deciphers, directional function) and the closure reprise reweights markers from navigation to surrender. However, no middle beat where arranging driftwood constrains a choice or enables a tactic. Lyric reprise present but the method does not shape the chamber sequence. Functional closure linkage but thin causal pressure. Two-gate coverage (setup, payoff).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Thunder-Echo Range established paragraph one and two; canyon setting supplies the fissure, obsidian staircase, and chamber where the confrontation occurs. The environment enables descent and provides spatial pressure (sheer cliffs, dry riverbeds, maze navigation). Twilight at closure reanchors place. Present across all three gates. Causal: setting opens passage, chamber forces vision. Closure linkage: markers rearranged on surface. Specificity high (Thunder-Echo name, petrified pine, ozone). Not fully indispensable—another mystical locale could serve—but deeply integrated.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"After the guardianship ended with his mentor's death three moons prior" anchors timeframe at setup and motivates Kael's solo journey. The phrase recurs implicitly (he failed to save mentor, now seeks insight). However, the three-moon gap does not tighten a choice or impose urgency; no clock pressures tactics. Present at setup and thematically linked to closure (moving forward after loss) but no middle development where time constraint alters options. Two-gate coverage; causal role as backstory motivation rather than live pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Motivation stated paragraph one ("driven by a need to harvest insights from failure") and enacted across the arc: Kael reflects on past failures, faces shadow-selves, learns the lesson, and walks home with it. Present at setup, middle (shadow confrontation dramatizes failures), and closure (new rune, walk home). Three gates. Causal pressure moderate: the desire drives the journey but the insight arrives via specter exposition rather than Kael's struggle. Cost present (must surrender mastery). Told at open but dramatized via shadow-selves.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Canyon hush" in paragraph one and "avalanchingly quiet" note mid-scene establish tone. Silence recurs as thematic anchor ("the flute's power lies…in its silence") and charges the final image (quiet hum in chest). Tone modulates: hush → shudder → roar → silence → hum. Coherent through turns. The final image is tonal (twilight, quiet hum) and reweights hush from void to presence. Present at setup and closure; middle modulation via sound/silence contrast. Lyric resonance clear; causal pressure moderate (tone shapes atmosphere more than choice).</comment>
