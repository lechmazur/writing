<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lirael's internal experience is vivid and embodied in moments ("her breath fogging the air," fingers brushing the ledger), but her core motivations remain abstract—"purpose in the pauses" is asserted more than dramatized through contradictory impulses. The glass-artist backstory provides texture but doesn't create on-page friction; her decision to retrace the smuggler's steps lacks a visible cost or trade-off that would elevate the choice. The final epiphany about "marking time" feels delivered rather than earned through struggle, and the promised future (teaching others, crafting panels) summarizes instead of crystallizing a present renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes orientation adequately (canyon, dawn, Lirael kneeling) and follows a clear Accumulative lens: frost patterns → crevice → chamber → shard revelation → thematic resolution. However, the closure lacks a decisive on-page cost; Lirael's shift from survival hollowness to purposeful teaching is narrated as future intent rather than a present action that forecloses a path. The ledger and shard provide discovery beats, but the final paragraph summarizes her new direction rather than dramatizing a charged choice or renunciation with felt pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The canyon setting is vivid and specific—"bowl of indigo," "moss-slick rocks," frost as prisms—and the frost patterns directly enable the retracing action, constraining Lirael's method. The crevice and chamber provide spatial progression that shapes the discovery sequence. The glass shard as micro-setting object charges the final revelation, and the canyon's "quiet intervals" echo thematically at closure, though the ending shifts to an imagined studio rather than deepening the present canyon pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—discovering purpose after survival—is signaled early, and the frost-reading method provides one meaningful tightening as Lirael follows patterns to the hidden chamber. However, the escalation remains investigative rather than conflicted; no live cost or trade-off narrows her options on the page. The final decision to return to her studio and teach is stated intent without visible price, and the smuggler's blade/fall backstory creates setup tension but doesn't recur to pressure the present choice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The theme of "purpose in the pauses" emerges consistently through the frost patterns, the shard's phrase, and Lirael's realization about her art, avoiding overt moralizing. The ledger-frost-shard sequence builds resonance through particulars, and the final image of glass panels etched with frost patterns reweights prior material thematically. However, the ending articulates the theme too directly ("not to create objects but to mark time"), reducing subtext, and the promised teaching feels additive rather than a non-literal answer earned by prior pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The prose voice is consistent and lyric—"bowl of indigo," "liquid swirls," "drifting resonance"—with a distinct perceptual signature filtering the canyon through glass-artist metaphors. POV remains stable throughout with no head-hopping. However, the diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("cartographer of hidden things," "etch her existence into the world's quiet intervals") that feels more authorial than character-particular, and the final paragraph's summary mode ("she'd learned," "she'd teach") dilutes the present-tense immediacy established earlier.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The opening establishes vivid imagery and momentum, and many lines carry double duty (frost as map, shard as hologram). However, the piece suffers from elevated-diction density in high-pressure beats ("scorched testament," "drifting resonance," "etched her existence") that reads ornamental rather than propulsive, applying roughly −0.5. The final paragraph loops thematically—restating the "pauses" and "hidden maps" concepts without advancing pressure—and several sentences in the chamber discovery beat use parallel "the ledger/the shard" stems that create template cadence, adding −0.3 for cumulative line-level debt.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The frost-pattern navigation method offers a fresh tactical angle, and the glass-artist lens provides specific filtering. However, the core arc—survival → purpose discovery via hidden map → return to create art—follows a familiar template (trauma → symbolic object → reaffirmed vocation) without a non-obvious moral calculus or turn. The smuggler remains a cipher whose attempt is setup only, and the final teaching/exhibition plan feels genre-conventional for artist-recovery narratives, reducing the sense of inevitable synthesis.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Lirael is present throughout and her glass-artist observation skills enable the frost-reading method, shaping two beats (frost interpretation, shard projection). However, her choices feel investigative rather than decisive; the retracing and chamber entry are pursuit moves without visible trade-offs. The final decision to return and teach is stated intent in summary mode rather than an on-page action that alters present options, capping the score below 5.5.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The ledger strip appears in the opening (setup), its lines mirror in the frost patterns (middle development), and the shard in the chamber echoes its symbols (closure participation). The ledger enables the retracing action and its "scorched edges" hum near the crevice, creating specificity. However, the ledger itself is not handled or reweighted at closure—the shard takes over—so the object's presence in three beats does not translate to irreplaceability at the ending, limiting the score to mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Scorched testament" as concept frames the ledger and shard as evidence of hidden truths, shaping Lirael's investigative goal and the final teaching decision. It appears early (ledger's "scorched testament" in paragraph one) and recurs in the shard's etched symbols (closure linkage). However, the concept remains thematic rather than a constraint on tactics; the "scorched" quality affects atmosphere but not on-page choices or cost, trending mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Steadily adaptive" is asserted in paragraph two ("her art a dance of improvisation") and demonstrated when she reads the frost patterns, but it does not constrain a choice with visible cost. The trait enables her method but remains label-heavy without on-page friction or trade-off (e.g., adaptability causing her to miss a fixed clue or rush a decision). The attribute is functional but swappable with "observant" or "resourceful" without structural change.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Retrace" drives the central action: Lirael decides to retrace the smuggler's steps via frost patterns (paragraph two), follows them to the crevice (paragraph three/four), and the retracing leads directly to the chamber discovery (paragraph five). The action is signaled early, shapes two major beats (frost-reading, chamber entry), and the shard's star map/name reveal is the payoff. The retracing is not easily swappable; removing it would collapse the causal chain from ledger to shard.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The frost-pattern method is signaled in paragraph two ("reading patterns in morning frost"), its mechanics matter in paragraph three (body heat melting ice into branching veins that mirror the ledger), and it directly enables the eastward pursuit to the crevice. The method constrains Lirael's approach (ephemeral beauty vs. fixed landmarks) and demonstrates her glass-artist observation skills, making it causally indispensable. The frost's vanishing nature ("no trace by noon") adds time pressure, elevating integration.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The canyon is established early (paragraph one: "bowl of indigo," "ancient ribs") and its frost-covered floor supplies the frost-pattern resource in paragraph three. The crevice forces Lirael to crawl (spatial constraint), and the chamber holds the shard discovery. The canyon's "quiet intervals" charge the thematic closure. However, the setting could be replaced with another remote, frost-prone location without major structural change, as the canyon's specific geography does not uniquely shape the final choice.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The timeframe "after surviving the attempt" anchors the story's present and frames Lirael's hollowness and need for purpose (setup). The "hush before dawn" and "first light" create atmospheric pressure, and the frost's noon-vanishing quality adds urgency to the retracing (middle development). However, the timeframe does not tighten the final decision; the ending shifts to future intent ("she would return") without a present deadline, so the element shapes mood more than tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Discover purpose in the pauses" is stated in paragraph one, drives Lirael's decision to retrace rather than flee or rest, and the shard's phrase "In the pauses, the truth breathes" (paragraph five) validates the motivation at closure. The desire is told more than dramatized through conflicted choices—Lirael's pursuit faces no on-page friction or competing want—but the motivation does enable the central action and receives thematic payoff, trending mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Drifting resonance" as tone is established through lyric diction ("bowl of indigo," "trapped auroras," "fractured rainbows") and the pacing moves fluidly from survival memory to frost observation to chamber discovery. The tone modulates from hollow urgency (paragraph one/two) to wonder (paragraph three) to quiet realization (paragraph six), supporting the thematic closure. However, the elevated register remains consistent rather than intensifying under pressure, and the final summary paragraph's instructional mode ("she'd teach others") slightly dilutes the resonance, capping just above mid-6s.</comment>
