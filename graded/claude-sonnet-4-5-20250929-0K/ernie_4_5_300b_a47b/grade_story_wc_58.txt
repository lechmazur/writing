<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's profession is clearly established, but her interiority relies heavily on abstract poeticism ("geography of healing," "map of unspoken goodbyes") rather than embodied contradiction. The vanished woman encounter offers atmosphere but no genuine internal conflict—Elara writes, feels ache, then leaves lighter without wrestling competing impulses. The final paragraphs loop through mission-statement language ("her purpose, her peace, her place") that reads as therapeutic self-talk rather than lived tension. Emotional progression is declarative rather than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors by the second paragraph (who, where, when). The piece operates in Accumulative/Textural mode: Elara seeks the thread, experiences a vision, writes the woman's story, and departs with renewed purpose. However, the closure lacks visible cost—she arrives seeking answers and leaves "lighter" with "heart open," a pure gain that forecloses no path. The vision sequence offers atmospheric density but no causal tightening; the woman simply appears, is described, vanishes. The final three paragraphs recycle the mission statement without reweighting prior material or making a trade-off legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The shadowed autumn garden supplies vivid sensory anchors (jasmine, moss, fading light, autumn wind) and the thread is handled twice with tactile detail. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout. The setting supports tone and atmosphere effectively, but does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome—Elara's interaction with the garden is observational and the thread vibrates but does not block or enable any tactic. The final image uses twilight and the thread's glow purposefully, lifting the score within the 6-band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding the vanished woman's story—is signaled early. However, no meaningful escalation or tightening occurs: Elara kneels, touches the thread, imagines, the woman appears, Elara writes, the woman vanishes, Elara leaves satisfied. No reversal, no narrowing of options, no visible price paid. The vision grants her exactly what she sought without friction. The final paragraphs assert ongoing work but do not dramatize a cost or trade-off on the page. Under Accumulative lens, pressure should build to a cadence shift or pattern break that reweights the stake; instead, the ending diffuses into summary.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Theme of healing-as-geography and explained absences emerges from the obituary premise and the thread motif. The vanished woman's story offers one specific enactment. However, the final three paragraphs drift into explicit theme statements ("explained absences were not endings but beginnings," "geography of healing," "lonesome splendor") that replace scene pressure with summary. The phrase "After the last ship sailed" recurs but does not shift meaning; it functions as atmosphere rather than a charged return. No earned epiphany arises from concrete struggle—Elara simply receives confirmation of her worldview.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. The prose carries a consistent lyric register with elevated diction ("lonesome splendor," "intimate whisper of flesh and memory") that fits a writer-protagonist. However, perceptual signature is generic—Elara notices in the same poeticized way throughout, with no modulation under pressure. The italicized writing samples feel like narration rather than distinct voice. Psychic distance is controlled, though the final paragraphs' certainty ("she found her purpose, her peace, her place") lacks the modesty appropriate to a moment of discovery.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Clarity is adequate and grammar clean. However, multiple artifacts lower momentum: paraphrase loops in the final section ("one obituary, one thread, one explained absence" / "her purpose, her peace, her place"), repetitive sentence stems ("She wrote," "She stood," "She paused," "She turned"), and template cadence in the penultimate paragraph where four consecutive sentences begin with declarative constructions. Stock metaphors cluster without fresh specificity ("heart a map," "words a bridge," "beacon in the dark"). The figurative density in the vision sequence (lines 4–5) risks overwriting but remains legible. Scaffold phrasing and synonym churn reduce information density in the final third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The obituary-writer-for-the-living premise offers initial freshness, and the thread-as-memory conceit has potential. However, the execution leans on familiar lyric fantasy tropes: magical object, vision of the past, poetic closure with renewed purpose. The "geography of healing" frame reads as prompt-language abstraction rather than lived metaphor. The vision sequence and the woman's motivations ("left not out of despair but out of love") feel generic within the genre. No bold structural or moral risk; the piece retreats to comfort rather than pressing into ambiguity or cost.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her profession shapes the frame. She makes two micro-choices: kneeling to touch the thread and writing the woman's story. However, neither choice narrows options or incurs visible cost—she seeks understanding, receives it via vision, writes, and leaves satisfied. The character enables atmosphere but does not drive a turn; the vision is granted rather than earned through decision. Present in setup, middle touch, and ending, but swappable agency.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The thread appears in paragraph one (setup), is touched and vibrates in paragraph three (middle beat), and glows faintly in the final paragraph (ending reprise). Handled physically twice. However, its function is atmospheric—it triggers the vision but does not constrain a tactic or reweight meaning at closure. The ending mentions "thread by thread" metaphorically but does not charge the physical thread with new significance. Functional across beats but replaceable with any mystical conduit.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Explained absences" is introduced early as Elara's profession and recurs in the final section ("every absence was explained"). The concept frames the stake but does not shape on-page tactics—Elara does not face a choice between explaining and withholding, or wrestle the ethics of her work. It functions as thematic label rather than a constraint that alters options. Setup and ending present; middle development absent.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Elara is described as writing "vividly descriptive prose" in paragraph two, and her quill-work is mentioned repeatedly. However, the attribute is told rather than demonstrated through distinct sensory specificity or stylistic tradeoff—the narration itself does not shift to match her voice, and no scene shows her descriptive skill enabling or costing her something. Label-only trait without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Intimate" appears once as descriptor ("her presence was intimate, a whisper of flesh and memory") but does not drive a turn or choice. The vision is intimate in tone but the action—observing, writing, departing—could occur with the same structure if the encounter were formal or distant. Ornamental descriptor rather than plot-shaping action. Present in the middle beat only; no setup or closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>"Projecting presence into the past" is named explicitly in paragraph three and the vision sequence enacts it. However, the method is not taught with mechanics that matter—Elara closes her eyes, syncs breath, imagines, and the vision simply appears. No cost, no failed attempt, no constraint. The method enables the vision but is swappable with any mystical technique. Setup and middle use present; ending does not rely on it.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The shadowed autumn garden is anchored in paragraph one, supplies sensory detail (moss, jasmine, leaves, twilight) across beats, and the final image places Elara at its edge. The setting provides atmosphere and the thread's placement, but does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome. Micro-setting allowance applies (the thread and moss are handled), lifting the score. Present in setup, middle, and ending; causal pressure modest.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"After the last ship sailed" appears in the opening paragraph, recurs twice in the middle, and bookends the final section. However, the timeframe is purely atmospheric—no urgency, no ticking clock, no decision shaped by the post-departure state. It could be removed or replaced with "after the war" with no structural change. Setup and ending present; middle mention is decorative. No development or causal role.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The motivation is stated in paragraph two and Elara's actions (seeking the thread, writing the woman's story) align with it. However, the desire is never conflicted—no competing want, no cost to pursuing it, no moment where understanding threatens her. She articulates the motivation, enacts it, and achieves it without friction. Setup and action present; cost and closure reweighting absent. Functional but unearned.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Lonesome splendor" is named twice and the prose maintains a consistent elegiac, elevated register throughout. The tone does not modulate with pressure (no scene builds tension that would shift cadence) but it coheres and charges the final image of Elara walking into twilight. Atmosphere is stable rather than dynamic. The tone supports the material without overwhelming it, and the ending relies on it to sustain the mood. Setup, stability, and closure participation present; no turn or deepening.</comment>
