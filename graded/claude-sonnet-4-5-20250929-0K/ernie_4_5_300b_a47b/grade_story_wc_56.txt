<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias is assigned generic legend-seeker traits and a motivation ("unravel threads of deception") that's told rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. His warehouse "revelation" about "architecture of lies" reads as epiphany-by-arrival rather than earned through visible struggle or internal cost. The captain and his warning are stock conveniences; no relationship pressure forces a choice. Embodied emotion is thin—"breath caught" and "weight of revelation settling" are label-only—and the final stance feels awarded rather than won through on-page sacrifice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads Causal-Accumulative Hybrid: the sundial points, Elias follows, discovers blueprint—minimal because/therefore linkage. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing ("the sundial wasn't a map to a place; it was a map to a way of seeing"), but the cost is abstract philosophical clarity rather than a felt forfeiture on the page. Orientation anchors arrive quickly (canal, barge, Elias). One meaningful tightening occurs (shadow redirects to warehouse), but no live option is foreclosed with visible price—he simply walks in and finds confirmation. The "architecture of lies" blueprint feels like a prompt echo rather than an earned discovery that narrows his world.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The canal, barge, and warehouse are vividly rendered ("liquid silver," "drowned coins," "door hanging askew") and grounded early. However, the setting pressures mood more than choice—Elias walks freely to the warehouse without spatial obstacle or environmental constraint altering tactics. The sundial-as-object constrains slightly (its shadow guides), satisfying the micro-setting allowance, but the warehouse interior supplies only atmosphere, not a resource or barrier that changes the ending image. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered ("muddy banks," "lantern flickered"), lifting the score into mid-6s.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake ("unravel the threads of deception") is declared early but remains abstract—no on-page test where failure costs Elias something concrete. The sundial's redirection to the warehouse is a single tightening, but no reversal: he encounters no locked door, hostile presence, or ambiguous choice. The blueprint "revelation" is handed to him without a trade-off or visible sacrifice. Coincidence (a lit lantern, an open door, papers conveniently waiting) eases rather than complicates. Agency is observation, not decision under duress, and the ending reconfigures understanding without foreclosing a live path or paying a felt price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Theme ("truth lies where light dares not tread," "architecture of lies") emerges through image and the sundial motif, avoiding overt moralizing until the penultimate paragraph's blueprint description ("controlling the narrative"). The final image (dawn over canal, "clarity to see the world as it truly was") reweights prior material but edges toward thesis statement rather than dramatized tension. Subtext operates in gesture (captain's wariness, door creaking) and the sundial's shifting shadow. The piece invites reflection on perception versus reality, yet the thematic answer feels awarded by arrival rather than wrestled from contradictory evidence or cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV holds cleanly with no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and consistent ("liminal hour," "serene upheaval," "architecture of lies"), though occasionally drifts into abstract register ("the architecture of lies" feels like prompt vocabulary rather than Elias's lived idiom under stress). Dialogue (captain's warning) is brief, functional, and carries subtext. Perceptual signature is present—focus on the sundial, shadows, forgotten histories—but does not degrade or sharpen under pressure. Free indirect style is controlled; psychic distance remains stable. Minor register elevation in peak beats ("hindsight clarity," "to confront the darkness within himself") slightly reduces voice specificity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully (short urgent beats at the warehouse, longer reflective passages on the barge) and information density is moderate. However, adjacent sentences loop conceptually: "It wasn't just a map to a place; it was a key to understanding" / "The sundial wasn't just a tool for telling time; it was a compass for truth" recycles the "wasn't just X; it was Y" template without added pressure. "Architecture of lies" appears three times, twice in close proximity, without evolving charge. Figurative language is vivid ("liquid silver," "eyes like drowned coins") but occasionally stacked ("slow fuse," "labyrinth of lies," "fog of misdirection") in descriptive passages. Clarity holds; no causality breaks. One paraphrase loop and template cadence trigger −0.4 to −0.6 deduction within Q7's non-closure band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The "lost relic guides seeker to hidden truth" premise is familiar, and the story does not transform it through non-obvious moral calculus or lived complication—Elias finds exactly what the sundial promised without irony or cost. The sundial-as-metaphor (shadow pointing to truth) is on-the-nose. Specific details (brass gnomon, flooded crypt, blueprint margins) add texture but don't shift the predictable arc. The captain's warning and the warehouse discovery both follow template beats. Emotional honesty is present (Elias's slow-burn motivation) but the resolution lacks the friction or synthesis that would make the familiar feel inevitable in hindsight. Derivative Premise Guardrail applies: −0.8 within Q8 for close template match without transformation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Elias ("errant legend seeker") is present throughout and makes two decisions: to investigate the sundial's shadow (middle) and to enter the warehouse (closure beat). Both are observational follow-throughs rather than high-cost reversals. Setup clear, development functional, payoff present but passive—he finds confirmation rather than confronting a dilemma that his seeker role creates. Two-beat involvement and closure presence lift the score to mid-5s, but swappability (any investigator type could fill this role with minor edits) and lack of visible tradeoff cap further rise.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The sundial appears in four distinct beats: opening (Elias traces it), canal reflection (he flips it open, reads inscription), shadow redirect (points to warehouse), and final paragraph (he turns it over, understands its metaphoric function). Setup early, middle constrains (the shadow guides his path), closure reweights (it's "a map to a way of seeing"). Specificity is high—brass, tarnished, gnomon, constellations—and the object's changing meaning charges the ending. Causal pressure is moderate (it directs but does not force a trade-off). Strong integration across all three gates and closure linkage push the score into the 7s.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Hindsight clarity" is named twice ("hindsight clarity," "the clarity to see the world as it truly was") but functions primarily as thematic echo rather than on-page constraint. The concept shapes the protagonist's goal (decode the sundial to see past lies) and is present at closure (dawn revelation), but it does not alter tactics mid-scene—Elias's approach remains unchanged whether he has clarity or not. Setup present (early motivation), payoff thematic, but middle development is absent as a live pressure. Two-gate partial with lyric resonance, but no causal narrowing, caps the score near mid-4s.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Thoughtfully clear" appears once as adverb ("smiled thoughtfully") and is implied in the final image ("clarity to see the world as it truly was"). The trait does not constrain a choice or enable a tactic with visible cost—Elias's thoughtfulness is asserted rather than dramatized through a deliberate, slow decision that forecloses a faster option. Label-only mention in one beat, no middle development, and no on-page tradeoff. Closure participation is thematic rather than causal. Cap for label-only use and missing development holds the score in low-4s.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Salvage" is enacted twice with reweighted meaning: Elias salvaged the sundial from a sunken chest (backstory, setup) and "to salvage its secrets" (middle paragraph, framing his interpretive work). The action seeds the plot and recurs with metaphoric shift, but the major turn (discovering the blueprint) is a find rather than a salvage under pressure. Setup strong, development metaphoric, closure indirect (the revelation is about understanding, not physical recovery). Two-beat involvement with lyric resonance lifts the score to mid-6s, but the climactic discovery is not itself an act of salvage, capping further rise.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"By training instincts" is signaled early ("he'd have to train his instincts") and mentioned again ("He'd trained his instincts for years, but this was different"). The method is told rather than shown—no on-page beat demonstrates Elias sharpening perception or making a choice whose success traces to trained instinct. The warehouse discovery is coincidence (lantern lit, door open), not the fruit of honed skill. Setup present, development summary-only, closure does not hinge on the method. Two mentions, no causal work, caps score near mid-4s.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The "twilight barge canal" is anchored early, described vividly (liquid silver, stars, muddy banks), and returns in the final paragraph ("first light of dawn crept over the canal"). The canal pressures tone (serene upheaval, stillness humming) and provides spatial staging (Elias on barge, crosses to warehouse). It does not constrain a choice—Elias moves freely—but the dawn-over-canal image charges the closure moment with transition from night (deception) to light (clarity). Setup strong, middle atmospheric, payoff symbolic. Early–final reprise with closure linkage and moderate causal presence place the score in high-6s.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"By the silence of morning radio" appears once in paragraph two as atmospheric detail ("that liminal hour when static replaced news"). It establishes mood but does not tighten decisions or track elapsed time—no clock pressure, no racing dawn, no tactical trade-off tied to the hour. Elias's investigation proceeds at leisure until "first light of dawn" (closure), but that shift is thematic backdrop, not a live deadline. Setup present, development absent, closure ornamental. Single mention, no causal tightening, caps score in low-3s.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"To understand the architecture of lies" is stated early ("his motivation burned like a slow fuse") and recurs at the blueprint discovery ("This was it—the architecture of lies"). The desire drives Elias's choices (follow the sundial, enter the warehouse) and frames the closure revelation. However, it is not dramatized through friction—no moment where Elias must choose between comfort and truth, or pay a visible cost to pursue understanding. Setup clear, development goal-directed, closure thematic. Three beats, causal involvement moderate, but no on-page sacrifice or conflicted want/fear tension. Mid-6s for solid integration without felt cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Serene upheaval" is named once ("the canal's stillness hummed with a serene upheaval") and established through contrasts: quiet canal / urgent quest, dawn calm / revelation weight. The tone holds coherently—no jarring tonal breaks—and modulates slightly (reflective on barge, tense in warehouse, elevated at closure). The final image ("soft and golden" dawn, "weight of revelation settling") sustains the serene-upheaval blend. Setup strong, middle consistent, closure reinforces. Tone charges the ending without a decisive shift that reweights pressure. Solid coherence across beats lifts score to high-5s, but static execution (no pattern break or cadence pivot) caps further rise.</comment>
