<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation ("discover the shape of intentions") is declared but never tested by competing desires or genuine cost. Her blithe nature remains static decoration; no contradictory impulses act simultaneously under pressure. The tapestry discovery proceeds without internal friction—she traces, realizes, smiles, reburies—foreclosing no path with visible sacrifice. Interiority leans on stock phrasing: "her heart raced," "her breath caught."</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Drive lens reads accumulative/textural but the closure lands as pure summary: "She would rebury the case, letting the dead rest once more, but she would carry the knowledge with her." No on-page decisive change, renunciation with felt cost, or image that reconfigures prior pressure—only a told intention to rebury and an abstract claim of carried knowledge. The chess clock and tapestry set up pattern but dissolve into explanation rather than a charged final image. Orientation is clean (who/where/when by early paragraphs), preventing deeper penalty, but closure itself lacks the required on-page cost or reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The cobalt silo and velveteen gloom anchor setting vividly early. The tapestry on stone slab and the oculus showing stars provide concrete spatial grounding. However, the environment does not constrain a single on-page choice—Elara's work proceeds unimpeded by spatial or material limits. The final image gestures toward stars "shimmer[ing] with approval" but this remains atmospheric backdrop rather than a pressure element that charges the closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—uncovering the tapestry's story—is signaled early but never tightens options or forces a trade-off. Elara decodes threads in a frictionless sequence; each discovery "brings her closer to the truth" without complication or reversal. The chess clock's echo and the phrase "silence between moves" suggest thematic escalation but no on-page choice narrows her path or imposes visible cost. Agency is observational rather than decisive.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Theme ("the dead speak in echoes, intentions across time") emerges through concrete images—tapestry threads, chess pieces, constellation patterns—but the final paragraph explicates rather than dramatizes: "The dead were not silent; they spoke in the language of echoes." The story resists a tidy moral yet the closure tells us Elara is "a gardener not just of the earth, but of time itself" instead of showing the cost or friction of that role. Subtext operates in the woven symbols but dissolves into direct thematic statement at the end.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Elara with consistent diction and perceptual filter. Vocabulary ("velveteen gloom," "skeletal finger," "uncharted echoes") is controlled and purposeful, creating a distinct texture. However, the prose occasionally drifts into elevated register that feels authorial rather than Elara's lived idiom: "a dance of intentions played out across time." No dialogue present to assess. Distance control is clean with no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Overwriting pervades high-pressure beats: "the silo's velveteen gloom deepened, the cobalt walls seeming to pulse with the rhythm of her discoveries" stacks metaphor without advancing causality. Paraphrase loops appear: paragraph 2 repeats "discovered/found" across adjacent sentences. Template cadence: "She traced… She understood… She rolled… She smiled… She would rebury…" in the final third. Stock metaphor: "skeletal finger," "voices trapped in the weave." Figurative density in most sentences of key beats without pattern payoff triggers −0.5; template stems and loops add −0.4; touching closure with summary adds −0.3, total deduction ~−1.2 from a functional baseline.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The core premise—cemetery gardener decoding a tapestry as a map of time—synthesizes gothic atmosphere with puzzle-box discovery, but the emotional arc (curiosity satisfied without friction) follows a template path. The chess clock, sovereign case, and constellation symbols feel like prompt-element assembly rather than organic integration. "The silence between moves" offers a fresh phrase but arrives without groundwork in prior choices. No bold structural risk; the discoveries proceed in and-then fashion to an explained resolution.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her role as gardener frames the premise, but her blithe nature does not constrain or enable key choices—she observes, traces, realizes, and reburies without internal conflict or visible cost. No decision alters tactics or forecloses options. Swappable with "curious archivist" or similar roles without structural change.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The sovereign case appears in paragraphs 2 (discovered), 4 (opened to reveal tapestry), and final third (rolled back, reburied). It holds the tapestry and its hinges are noted, but the case itself does not evolve in meaning or constrain action—any container would serve. Present across beats but replaceable; no charged reprise or causal pressure tied to its specific properties.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Uncharted echoes" appears as a phrase in paragraph 3 ("whisper of uncharted echoes—voices, perhaps, or memories trapped in the weave") and again thematically in paragraph 7 ("they spoke in the language of echoes"). It names the concept but does not change options on the page—Elara's decoding proceeds identically whether echoes are charted or uncharted. Functions as atmospheric label rather than stake-shaping constraint.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Tenderly organized" modifies Elara's rows of marigolds and lavender in paragraph 2, establishing her care but never constraining an action or creating visible tradeoff. The attribute is told once, not dramatized through choice under pressure. Ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Untangle" drives the middle action: Elara untangles threads (paragraphs 4, 5, 6) to decode symbols, names, dates, and the final phrase. Each untangling discovery advances knowledge and the action recurs across multiple beats. However, the final closure is "rolled the tapestry back" and "rebury the case"—the untangling itself does not redefine options at the end, capping the score below 7.0 despite strong mid-story presence.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The method—decoding frayed threads in the tapestry's border—is signaled in paragraph 3 ("she knew the method") and executed across paragraphs 4–6 (tracing threads to stars, chess knight, name, date, phrase). The mechanics matter: each thread leads to a discovery. However, the method is summarized rather than shown in granular detail, and the final phrase "The silence between moves" arrives as revelation without demonstrating how frayed-thread pattern yields that text. Present and functional but not irreplaceable or charged at closure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The cobalt silo anchors location throughout (paragraphs 1, 2, 4, 6, 8) and its oculus provides the constellation visible in paragraph 5. The "velveteen gloom" and cobalt walls "pulse" in paragraph 6. Stars appear at opening and closing. Setting is consistent and atmospheric but does not constrain choice—Elara's work would proceed identically in any crypt or archive. The final image (stars "shimmer with approval") reprises the opening but offers conceptual validation rather than altering tactics or cost.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>The chess clock runs down in paragraph 2, establishing the timeframe "after" that tick. It reappears thematically in paragraph 5 (chess knight position) and paragraph 8 ("The chess clock's echo faded"). However, no on-page time pressure tightens Elara's choices—she works at her own pace. The clock functions as symbolic motif rather than a live constraint that alters tactics. Missing middle development as a pressure element.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"To discover the shape of intentions" is stated in paragraph 3 as Elara's standing motivation and echoed in paragraph 7 ("a dance of intentions played out across time"). The desire frames her decoding work but is never dramatized as conflicted—no competing want, fear, or cost tests her commitment. Told-only; no friction between this desire and another stake on the page.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Velveteen gloom" appears in paragraphs 1, 4, 6, and 8, establishing and sustaining a consistent gothic-lyric tone. The tone modulates slightly—paragraph 6 "deepened" as discoveries accumulate—and the final image ("silent melody in the velveteen gloom") reprises the opening phrase with thematic weight. Coherent through turns and present at closure, charging the final image with atmospheric continuity even though the emotional arc remains static.</comment>
