<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is established (hired to map, really seeking chip fragments), but her interior life remains thin—no contradictory impulses act simultaneously under pressure. The pilgrim is a cipher; their "surprise" is asserted twice without embodied texture. The final choice (listening to the frequency) arrives without visible cost or foreclosed path; Lira merely receives an answer rather than making a renunciation or enduring a tradeoff. Embodied emotion is sparse: "breath hitched" and "hum in her bones" are generic physiological placeholders.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Causal-Accumulative Hybrid: Lira tracks the pilgrim, discovers alignment mechanics, pulls the lever, and the chip assembles. Closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the frequency hums, the pilgrim says "now we listen," and the story ends on resonance without decision. Cost is conceptual (the unknown) but not viscerally felt or paid on the page; the protagonist receives insight rather than forfeiting something tangible. Orientation anchors arrive promptly (observatory, dusk, Lira's role). One meaningful tightening occurs (lever pull → beam alignment → chip assembly), satisfying the 600–800 word minimum, but the ending diffuses into thematic musing rather than crystallizing a trade-off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The observatory's stone arches, rusted dome, niches, and Cassiopeia alignment are vivid and purposeful. The lever mechanism and light-beam niches constrain the climactic choice (pull to align), satisfying the micro-setting allowance. Sensory detail is selective: "hum in the air," "chill of the stones," "fractal shadows." However, spatial choreography wobbles—Lira's grappling hook catches "a protruding bolt" at the dome's apex, but she then "pulled" a ground-level lever; the hook's function is never paid off. The "brilliant dimness" in the final paragraph is asserted but not woven through action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode the frequency via chip fragments) is signaled early and pursued. The lever-pull constitutes one meaningful tightening that narrows options under the Causal-Accumulative lens. However, the tightening is mechanical rather than agonistic—Lira hesitates briefly, then pulls without visible trade-off or competing desire. No persistent constraint (time, resource, rival claim) shapes tactics. The pilgrim's arrival complicates but does not oppose; coincidence (constellation overhead at the right moment) enables rather than tests. Cost at closure is conceptual (the unknown) but not felt as forfeiture on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Theme (belonging as resonance, not place) emerges from the frequency metaphor and the pilgrim's declaration, but the final image—"a melody without words, a language older than language itself"—tilts toward abstraction rather than a non-literal, particular answer. The prism recurs (splits light, spins at the end) but does not reweight prior material with new cost. The pilgrim's "Now we listen" substitutes for dramatized stance crystallization. Thematic statements cluster in the final third ("It's not a place. It's a resonance"), risking the Thematic Echo penalty but stopping short of full sermonizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>POV remains stable (third-limited Lira) with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present but thin: "sharp-eyed," goggles with AR overlays, drone feed. Diction occasionally slips into elevated register unmotivated by stress ("fractal patterns," "harmonics that made Lira's ears tingle"). Dialogue is functional and goal-driven; the pilgrim's lines carry mild subtext ("You're here for the chip" / "And you're here to guide me"). Free indirect style is clean. The pilgrim's voice lacks distinct idiom; both characters speak in similar cadences under pressure. The phrase "brilliant dimness" in the final paragraph jars—register drift into poetic abstraction without clear POV anchor.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Syntax varies; no template runs. Figurative language is controlled except for "fractal patterns," "fractal shadows" (repeated vehicle), and "brilliant dimness," which reads as placeholder lyricism. Paraphrase loops: "The pilgrim's surprise mirrored her own—a flicker of recognition in their widened eyes" restates concept without added detail. Filter verbs cluster in the opening ("She'd tracked," "She'd been hired," "She'd never seen") but do not stack densely in peak beats. Clarity is high; no pronoun confusion. Information density is moderate—some lines do double duty (lever mechanics + emotional hesitation), but the final paragraph summarizes rather than advances. No major artifacts touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The premise—ancient observatory, celestial alignment, lost communication protocol—is genre-familiar (SFF quest-mystery). The story executes conventions competently but does not transform them through lived detail or moral calculus; the lever-pull and chip assembly proceed without friction or surprise. "Frequency of belonging" is a fresh phrase, but the resolution (resonance over place) trends toward abstraction. The pilgrim's iridescent cloak and harmonics hint at mystery without specificity. No bold structural risk; the arc is linear cause-effect. One fresh inflection: the prism casting fractal light onto floor niches is visually particular, though not fully exploited.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Lira (sharp-eyed drone pilot) is present throughout. Her sharpness manifests in tracking the pilgrim and reading the drone feed. She makes two choices: deploy the grappling hook (functional but not pivotal) and pull the lever (the climactic turn). The lever-pull alters the situation causally, but Lira's "sharp eye" does not constrain the choice—her hesitation is brief and generic. The attribute "sharp-eyed" is mentioned once and not dramatized under pressure. Functional but replaceable; a non-pilot with tools could execute the same arc.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The matrix chip is seeded early (Lira's true mission), appears in the drone blueprint (three gaps match three niches), and assembles at the climax when the lever aligns starlight. It returns in the final paragraph as a whole object whose "symbols shifted under starlight." Present in setup, middle development, and ending. However, its properties (decoder, frequency emitter) are told rather than handled; Lira never touches it. The chip drives the quest but does not constrain her tactics—she follows the pilgrim's instruction rather than wrestling with the chip's mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Missing pieces" shapes the dominant stake (find and reassemble fragments) and structures the middle (three gaps, three niches). The concept appears in the opening exposition and is paid off when the chip assembles. However, it does not constrain Lira's choices beyond "find them"; once the lever is identified, the pieces float into place without friction. The concept is functional but does not generate internal conflict or surprise. Present in all three gates, but swappable with "lost key" or "broken seal."</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Perpetually surprised" is asserted in the opening ("perpetually surprised resident") and echoed once ("The pilgrim's surprise mirrored her own"). The trait does not constrain an on-page action or enable a tactic; Lira's reactions are measured and competent throughout. No visible tradeoff tied to this attribute. It reads as character color rather than a pressure-bearing trait. Late signal (midpoint echo), ornamental use, no cost connection.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Pull" appears early (Lira pulls tools from her toolbelt, pulls the grappling trigger) and peaks when she "pulled" the lever, which rotates the dome and assembles the chip. The lever-pull is the story's decisive action, causing the climax and enabling closure. The action is seeded, developed, and paid off. However, the pull is instructed by the pilgrim ("Pull the lever") rather than arising from Lira's agency, which slightly weakens irreplaceability. Still, remove "pull" and the mechanics collapse.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Following star trails" is signaled early (Lira mutters "Star trails," pilgrim says "by following the star trails"). The method matters: Cassiopeia's alignment guides the lever mechanics and beam placement. Present in setup and climax. However, the means is explained rather than enacted—the pilgrim and drone do the interpretive work; Lira pulls without needing to "follow" the trails herself. Functional but passive; the method shapes the world logic more than Lira's tactics.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The ancient observatory (stone arches, rusted dome, niches, lever) is present from the opening and supplies the resources for the climax: the dome rotates, niches catch starlight, the chip assembles. Setting is integral to causality. Dusk timing matters—Cassiopeia is "directly overhead" at the moment needed. The observatory constrains action (Lira must pull the ground-level lever to align the dome). Micro-setting (the lever, the niches) alters tactics and outcome. Essential across beats and ending.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Time anchor: "after the pilgrim arrives" (an hour ago). The hour elapsed is noted but not tracked; no live clock tightens decisions. Dusk provides ambient pressure (stars brighten), but Lira does not race daylight. The timeframe is present in setup and implied at closure ("the dusk deepened") but does not constrain choices. Functional background rather than causal driver. Present in two beats (opening, ending) but ornamental in middle development.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"To decode the frequency of belonging" is Lira's stated motive (true mission) and reappears at closure when the chip emits the frequency and the pilgrim names it ("Belonging"). The desire is told in exposition and restated thematically at the end. However, it is not dramatized in conflicted choices—Lira pursues it linearly without friction between wants and costs. No on-page moment where decoding the frequency competes with another desire or exacts a visible price. Present in setup and payoff, absent in middle development as tested pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Brilliant dimness" appears once, in the final paragraph: "the brilliant dimness of the observatory seeping into her vision." The phrase is poetic but static; it does not modulate with pressure or charge the closure image beyond assertion. The story's tone throughout is competent SFF (mystery, discovery, mild awe) but does not cohere around this specific oxymoron. Late first appearance, ornamental use, no clear causal or thematic integration. The tone is coherent but the exact phrase "brilliant dimness" is forced.</comment>
