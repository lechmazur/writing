<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Kael's mechanical arm and philosophical stance are established, but his interior contradictions remain thin—the duel functions more as intellectual exercise than deeply embodied crisis. Elyra's "diplomatically fierce" trait is asserted but not tested through genuine cost or trade-off. The final moment ("I evolve") reads as clever declaration rather than earned transformation; no visible path is foreclosed with felt weight. Interiority leans toward label-speak ("chaos is honesty") without sufficient embodied pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece anchors quickly (atrium, brook, philosophers dueling) and holds spatial coherence. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (stance crystallization: "Now we follow the map"), but the cost is conceptual and thin—no option visibly forecloses, no tactic meaningfully narrows. The lens appears Hybrid-Causal in setup but drifts toward thematic declaration at the end without a decisive pressure point that alters what either character can do next. The tin-card reveal mid-duel offers a micro-turn but does not generate new friction or sacrifice.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The glass atrium, sundial floor, and brook are vivid and purposeful; the tin card's needle-hole projections charging the space elevate the setting beyond backdrop. Spatial choreography (épées, pedestal, sundial angles) remains clear throughout. The sundial's incomplete lines function as both arena and map, constraining movement and charging the closure image when Kael aligns the card with its angles. Sensory selection is strong (prismatic shadows, water trickling, gears whirring) and filtered through the duel's urgency.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—philosophical translation via duel—is signaled early but remains abstract; no live consequence or visible price grounds the contest. Elyra disarms Kael, yet the moment deflates immediately with "I evolve," erasing tactical loss. The tin-card decoding offers a mid-duel tightening, but the discovery arrives without prior struggle or failed attempts, reducing earned pressure. Agency at closure is cooperative rather than agonistic, and the final "wherever the questions take us" avoids a choice that forecloses an option or imposes felt cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Theme (questions as journeys, chaos as honesty, collaborative refinement) emerges clearly from the duel structure and tin-card decoding. The sundial and needle holes accumulate symbolic weight without overt moralizing. However, the final exchange ("Next time, we'll make one together") borders on thematic summary rather than image-driven resonance, and the penultimate line ("better questions") edges toward platitude. The concept of "hidden overture" is invoked but not dramatized with specific cost or friction that would deepen the thematic question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Single-POV Kael focalization is clean with no head-hopping; mechanical-arm and philosophical idiom create a distinct perceptual signature. Dialogue carries subtext and goal pursuit ("You think chaos is dignity" / "No. Chaos is honesty"), though some lines ("Turn questions into destinations") drift toward thematic echo. Distance control is stable; free-indirect thought ("This was why he dueled her—not to win, but to refine") fits voice and pressure. Minor register drift into elevated abstraction ("recontextualized") at peak beats slightly dilutes immediacy but remains within character lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose is crisp with strong imagery (prismatic shadows, constellation of dots, gears whirring) and varied sentence rhythm. Information density is high; each paragraph advances duel or discovery. Two minor artifact patterns emerge: near-paraphrase loops ("not decoded / recontextualized," "not destinations / directions") and one template-stem run in the opening (multiple "his/her" openers). No severe scaffold or opacity, but the final paragraph edges toward summary ("something had shifted") where a concrete image would sharpen. Line-level clarity and propulsion are solid throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The dueling-philosophers premise with a mechanical arm and coded tin card is fresh synthesis, and the atrium-as-arena with sundial angles offers specific world-building. The "hidden overture" concept and collaborative closure sidestep stock combat-resolution templates. However, the emotional arc (refinement rather than transformation) and the tin-card decoding sequence feel engineered to checklist rather than inevitable from prior character friction. The piece commits to its conceit but the core turn (recognizing the stellar map) arrives without sufficient prior struggle or cost to feel indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Kael's mechanical arm is present in multiple beats (grip adjustment, sweeping the card, gears spinning) and his philosopher role frames the duel's stakes. However, his choices do not create the key turn—Elyra disarms him, and the tin-card insight is collaborative discovery rather than his exclusive agency. The arm is embodied but does not constrain a pivotal decision; it functions more as texture than decisive pressure. Setup and development gates met; payoff weakened by shared closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The tin card appears early (propped against pedestal), is handled mid-duel (swept into the air, needle holes projecting light), and shapes the closure (aligned with sundial angles to reveal the map). Its cryptic patterns drive Kael's weeks-long investigation and the duel's conceptual stakes. The card constrains interpretation (via needle holes) and charges the final image ("wherever the questions take us"). All three gates met with strong causal pressure; irreplaceability high. Minor deduction: the card's prior investigation is told, not shown, reducing mid-story friction.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The "hidden overture" is invoked late ("a hidden overture to a philosophy beyond words") as theme claim rather than dramatized pressure. It does not shape tactics or constrain choices on the page; the tin card's stellar map is the active element, and "overture" functions as label. Setup absent; development minimal; payoff ornamental. Swappable with "hidden message" or "secret language" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Elyra's "diplomatically fierce" trait is established in dialogue tone ("diplomacy threading through her words like steel") and dueling precision, but it does not constrain or enable a specific choice with visible cost. The attribute colors her manner without forcing a trade-off or altering tactics. Label-only in setup; functional but replaceable in development; absent from closure participation. No meaningful cost tied to this trait on the page.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Fencing structures the entire duel: stance shifts, lunges, parries, disarmament. The action drives multiple beats and enables the tin-card discovery (card swept into air during combat). However, the duel could be reframed as chess or debate with moderate edits; the épée-specific mechanics (angles, grazes) do not uniquely redefine options at closure. All gates met with strong beat involvement, but swappability and lack of closure specificity prevent higher score.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The sundial's coded angles are signaled early (half-painted, incomplete lines as map) and used mid-duel (Kael's épée traces paths via angles). At closure, the tin card's alignment with sundial angles reveals the map. The method shapes interpretation and constrains the discovery. Setup and payoff strong; development functional. Minor deduction: the mechanics remain abstract ("via the coded angles") rather than concretely dramatized with failed attempts or tactical cost.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The glass atrium and brook anchor the scene early, and the prismatic light from panes interacts with the tin card (projecting needle-hole constellations). The sundial floor constrains movement and provides the decoding grid. The brook's "quiet song" recurs at closure, charging the final image. Setting shapes discovery and charges atmosphere but does not alter a tactical choice under pressure. Setup and payoff strong; micro-setting (sundial, glass walls) elevates integration.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.7</grade><comment>The timeframe "while waiting" is not anchored or legible on the page. No waiting state or clock is established; the duel unfolds continuously without reference to an external schedule or looming deadline. The sundial's shadow shift ("marking the passage of time") is ornamental post-closure rather than a live constraint. Timeframe absent from setup, development, and payoff; does not pressure decisions.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Kael's desire to "turn questions into destinations" is stated explicitly ("more to himself than to her") and debated with Elyra ("Not destinations, directions"). The motivation frames the duel's philosophical stakes and recurs at closure ("Wherever the questions take us"). However, the desire is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choice or visible cost. Setup present via dialogue; development through debate; payoff reinforced but not tested with friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The tone "dignified chaos" is embodied in the duel's blend of formal épée combat and philosophical improvisation, glass-atrium elegance against conceptual flux. The phrase appears explicitly mid-story ("this dignified chaos") and recurs implicitly at closure (sheathed swords, shared laughter, collaborative map-making). Tone modulates with pressure (fierce lunges, then softening) and charges the final image. Setup strong; development functional; payoff reinforces without deepening.</comment>
