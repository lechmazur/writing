<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lirael's recklessness is asserted ("reckless idealist") but her actual choices feel passive—she follows the keeper's instructions without meaningful internal resistance or contradiction. The regret over the drowned boy is told rather than dramatically embodied in a present micro-choice that costs her something. The final transformation from recklessness to "fiercely gentle wisdom" arrives as summary epiphany rather than earned through on-page struggle with visible forfeit.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the orchard, needle-thread ritual, and fruit-eating layer toward a reconfiguration. Closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (the patchwork soul holds firm), but the cost is abstract—no concrete path is visibly foreclosed on the page. The keeper guides every beat, reducing protagonist agency at key turns. Orientation is clear early (catacomb orchard, Lirael, bartering purpose).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard is vividly rendered with bioluminescent fungi, roots coiling through bones, and pulsing black fruit. The setting shapes the ritual beat (skeleton in meditative pose, needle piercing bone) and charges the final image (tree shuddering, golden light). Spatial choreography remains coherent throughout. Micro-setting (the skeleton's ribcage, the single tree) constrains the sewing action and anchors the ending.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—patching the holes in her soul—is signaled early and pursued. However, the escalation is guided entirely by the keeper's instructions rather than Lirael's agency narrowing options. The fruit-eating provides a vision-summary of lessons learned, but the trade-off (giving the Fool card) feels lightweight and resolved off-stage. One tightening occurs (the sewing ritual), but the cost at closure is told through metaphor rather than a visible forfeiture.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges clearly: recklessness transformed into measured action, regret into understanding. The burned Fool card and black fruit function as recurring images that shift meaning. However, the ending risks thematic echo when Lirael internalizes "fiercely gentle wisdom"—the phrase lands close to prompt language rather than arising organically from scene particulars. The vision sequence tells rather than dramatizes the conceptual shift.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization is stable; Lirael's perceptual signature (brushing walls, feeling vibrations, throat tightening) is character-specific. The keeper's dialogue carries distinct archaism ("Trammel your regret"). Diction remains consistent except for one slip: "fiercely gentle blade to cut through illusion" elevates into abstract register during the keeper's speech, clashing slightly with the grounded tactile voice elsewhere. No head-hopping; psychic distance is controlled.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies well and sentence openings are diverse. Two minor loops: "walked back through the half-lit corridors" echoes the opening's "half-light" without reweighting it; "fiercely gentle" appears as keeper's dialogue then again in the final paragraph, the second use reading as thematic summary rather than earned image. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent. Information density is high; no major scaffolding or clarity breaks.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard premise is vivid and the barter-for-soul-repair setup is fresh in its tactile specificity (needle and bone, spider-silk thread). However, the emotional arc—troubled hero receives wisdom from mystical guide—follows a recognizable template. The sewing ritual and fruit-eating provide grounded beats, but the final transformation summary ("fiercely gentle wisdom of the orchard") retreats from bold risk into stock spiritual-journey language.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lirael is present throughout and her initial recklessness is asserted, but her on-page choices are largely reactive—following the keeper's guidance rather than making independent decisions that narrow options. Her agency drives the sewing action (one beat) and the choice to eat the fruit (closure participation), meeting two gates. Causal pressure is moderate; the trait shapes her willingness to proceed but doesn't force a trade-off with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The burned Fool card appears in three beats: Lirael carries it in her pocket (setup), she presses it into the keeper's hand (middle transaction), and the keeper places it on the skeleton's chest (closure participation). All three gates are met. However, the card functions mainly as a symbolic token of regret rather than constraining a tactical choice or altering options. Its meaning is told ("symbol of her own recklessness") rather than reweighted through action.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Bartered destinies frames the premise and drives Lirael's visit to the orchard (setup). The keeper's transaction (Fool card for soul-patching) occurs on the page, and the skeleton's prior barter is recounted as an example (middle beat). The concept shapes the scenario but doesn't create a moment where Lirael must choose between competing destinies with on-page cost—she gives the card and receives the result without visible forfeit or tactical constraint at closure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Fiercely gentle" appears twice: the keeper describes the gift of doubt as "a fiercely gentle blade" (middle, told), and Lirael internalizes "fiercely gentle wisdom" in the final paragraph (closure, summary). The attribute is never demonstrated through a concrete action where gentleness constrains force or vice versa with visible cost. It remains label-only, serving as thematic claim rather than a trait that enables or limits a choice.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Trammel" appears in the keeper's dialogue twice: "Trammel your regret" (early instruction) and "trammel your fate with care" (parting advice at closure). Setup and closure gates are met. However, the action itself is abstract—no on-page beat shows Lirael trammeling (restraining, binding, channeling) in a way that alters tactics or narrows options. The word functions as thematic flavor rather than a causal action that shapes the outcome.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Inlay meaning everywhere" is the keeper's instruction, repeated twice (first encounter and during the sewing ritual). Setup and middle gates are met. The method's mechanics are gestural: Lirael sews "small and precise" stitches, each "a whisper of regret turned into resolve." The needle-and-thread ritual enacts the method on the page, constraining one beat. However, the method doesn't shape multiple attempts or force a tactical choice with cost; it's applied once and succeeds immediately.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard is established immediately (setup) and pressures the entire sequence: roots between bones create the ritual site, the skeleton and tree anchor the sewing beat (middle), and the tree's shudder and golden light charge the ending (closure). The setting supplies the resources (needle from bone, tree fruit) and its half-light atmosphere shapes Lirael's perceptual experience. All three gates met; the orchard is indispensable to story logic and the final image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Half-lit corridors" and "the glow" establish the time-and-light frame immediately (setup) and recur in the exit beat (closure). However, the timeframe imposes no urgency or clock pressure—Lirael proceeds at her own pace without tightening decisions. The "half-light deepening as she worked" marks passage but doesn't alter tactics. The glow intensifies at closure but as a reward rather than a constraint. Two gates met, minimal tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Lirael's desire "to patch the holes in my soul" is stated explicitly in dialogue (setup and middle) and pursued through the sewing ritual. The motivation drives her to the orchard and sustains her through the keeper's instructions. However, the friction between wanting gentleness and her reckless nature is told rather than dramatized in a choice with visible cost—she complies with the ritual without a moment where recklessness threatens the outcome. Closure participation is present (the patchwork holds), but the want-versus-cost tension is abstract.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Dusky resolve" coheres as a tone throughout: the half-light, calcified fragments, Lirael's "steady" voice despite trembling hands, and the "fiercely gentle" final stance. Tone modulates slightly when the orchard's glow intensifies (bathing her in golden light), charging the ending. The tone is consistent and purposeful, supporting the accumulative lens. However, it remains relatively static—no sharp tonal shift under peak pressure that would elevate it into the high band.</comment>
