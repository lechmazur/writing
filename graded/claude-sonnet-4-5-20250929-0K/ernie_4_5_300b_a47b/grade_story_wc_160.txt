<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lira's motivation (harmonizing conflicting values) is stated but never dramatized as a contradiction acting in scene. Her "slyly heartfelt nature" appears only as a label; we see competence and method but no visible internal friction or cost when she pauses or proceeds. The final choice—reading the message aloud—feels like an arrival rather than a foreclosure with visible price. Interiority relies on abstract claims ("her mind raced") rather than embodied tension.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (the message transforms from encrypted fear to open trust), and the final image attempts to reweight prior material. However, the cost remains atmospheric rather than felt; Lira walks away satisfied, with no visible forfeiture or path foreclosed. Orientation anchors cleanly by the first paragraph. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (measurement, decryption, pattern-building converge), but the escalation consists of repeated measuring without a meaningful tightening that narrows options—she simply completes the puzzle.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The amphitheater's breathing and volcanic setting are vividly rendered and return at closure ("breath a steady rhythm beneath her feet"), charging the final image. Micro-setting (the adhesive, the chain's weight) appears in multiple beats. However, the environment does not constrain a choice—Lira's decryption proceeds smoothly without spatial or material friction. The surveyor's chain is handled across beats but does not alter tactics or impose cost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake (decrypt the message) is signaled early, but pressure never tightens—each measurement brings Lira closer without complication or reversal. The cipher's solution arrives on schedule; no live option is foreclosed. "I fear the floodgates will fail" introduces a secondary concern (external safety) but remains unconnected to the decryption puzzle. Agency is present (she chooses to measure and decode), yet the cost is conceptual only, not viscerally tested on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme (compassion hidden in precision, order meeting chaos) emerges from concrete images: adhesive patterns, chain links, floodgate balance. The final message—"I trust you to hold them... to mend it"—offers a resonant answer without overt moralizing. However, "harmonize conflicting values" is stated more than dramatized; Lira experiences no friction between machinery and emotion. The ending's thematic charge is present but muted by the protagonist's untroubled competence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Single POV is stable; perceptual signature (geological/mechanical filtering) is consistent. Diction is precise and voice-specific ("antique surveyor's chain," "spiderweb patterns"). However, under peak pressure, the prose inflates rather than compresses: "dappled resolve shimmering like volcanic glass" reads ornamental. No dialogue appears. Free indirect style is clean, and no head-hopping occurs. Psychic distance remains controlled throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Multiple paraphrase loops: "the adhesive held more than residue—it held the imprint" / "measure both distance and deceit" restates without adding pressure; "each measurement, she knew, was a clue" / "each measurement a note in a symphony" recycles the same content. Template cadence in the middle section ("She unrolled... She hummed... She cross-referenced") flattens momentum. Figurative density in high-pressure beats ("dappled resolve shimmering," "volcanic glass," "symphony of decryption") muddies clarity. Stock metaphors ("secrets waiting to be unlocked") appear without transformation. Combined artifacts disallow 9+ globally and pull the score below 6.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The core premise—decrypting a message via leftover adhesive—offers a fresh angle, but execution relies on template plot: hero receives puzzle, measures methodically, solves without complication. "Encrypted compassion" and "harmonizing conflicting values" read as prompt labels rather than lived tension. The emotional arc (fear → trust) is told in the decoded message, not earned through Lira's choices. The amphitheater and volcanic setting provide vivid texture but do not transform familiar "puzzle-solver" material into something structurally surprising.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Present throughout; drives the measurement and decryption sequence. Appears in setup, middle (measuring adhesive), and ending (reads message, walks forward). However, decisions do not create reversals—Lira proceeds smoothly from clue to solution. Swappable with "cryptographer" or "engineer" without structural loss. Two gates (setup, payoff), causal pressure weak, closure linkage present but passive. Band guidance: 4.0–4.9 functional but replaceable. Score 4.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Signaled in paragraph one, handled in paragraphs three and six ("unrolled," "links clicking," "rolled back"), returns in final paragraph ("chain in her belt"). Shapes two distinct beats (measuring adhesive, cross-referencing surveys). However, the chain's unique properties (brass, grandfather's relic) do not alter tactics—any measuring tool would serve. Three gates met, beat involvement +0.9, closure linkage marginal (+0.3), specificity low. Swappable with "tape measure" caps at ~6.0; lyric reprise nudges slightly lower. Score 5.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Present in title framing and decoded message ("compassion, once encrypted, now bloomed"). Does not shape on-page stakes—Lira's goal is simply to decrypt, regardless of content. The "why encrypt compassion?" question is asked but not answered through action. Appears in setup (envelope) and payoff (message text), missing middle development. Two gates, no causal pressure, thematic only. Cap 4.6 (late middle), swappability −0.4, ornamental −0.3. Score 3.8.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Slyly heartfelt" appears once as a label in paragraph two and again in paragraph eight without constraining action. The pause ("made her pause") is described, not dramatized with cost. Attribute is told, not shown through distinct choices. Setup gate met, missing middle and closure. Label-only −0.3, ornamental −0.5, cap 4.6 (missing middle dev), swappable −0.4. Score 2.4.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Present across the piece: amphitheater trembles (paragraph one), Lira trembles from "thrill of the chase" (paragraph four), amphitheater's breath quickens/slows (paragraphs four, seven), "whatever trembles the world might send" (final paragraph). Action appears in setup, middle (her trembling under pressure), and closure reprise. Drives two beats (her emotional state, environmental rhythm), reweights at ending. Three gates, beat involvement +0.9, closure linkage +0.9, causal pressure moderate (+0.8). Specificity medium (+0.4). Score 6.7.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Signaled in paragraph one (envelope, adhesive), method detailed in paragraphs two and six ("analyzing the leftover adhesive," "reconstruct the envelope's original seal"), shapes middle beat (measurement and cross-reference). Appears in setup, middle development, and payoff (cipher solved via adhesive patterns). Three gates met, beat involvement (one distinct) +0.4, causal pressure +0.8, specificity +0.5. However, mechanics remain vague—pressure and angle reveal the key without clear logic. Summary-only in key moment −0.4. Score 5.1.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Present throughout: volcanic rock worn smooth, amphitheater breathing, stones settling. Setting frames every beat and returns in final paragraph ("amphitheater... watched her go"). Appears in setup, middle (provides workspace), and closure. However, the crumbling amphitheater does not constrain Lira's choices—she kneels, works, and climbs without friction. Three gates, beat involvement +0.4, closure linkage +0.7, causal pressure negligible. Postcard description lowers score; micro-setting (the stage) is static. Score 5.9.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"As the building breathes" appears in title framing and throughout (low groan, quickened breath, slowed breath, steady rhythm). Timeframe is atmospheric rather than a constraint—no deadline tightens Lira's choices. Present in setup, middle texture, and closure reprise. Three gates, beat involvement +0.4, closure linkage +0.4, no causal pressure. Swappable with generic "passage of time" −0.5. Score 4.8.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Stated in paragraph two ("harmonize conflicting values: precision of machinery and chaos of human emotion") and echoed at closure ("harmonized conflicting values"). Never dramatized as friction in Lira's choices—she proceeds smoothly. Desire is told, not shown through competing impulses. Setup and payoff gates met, missing middle development. Cap 4.6, label-only −0.3, summary-only −0.4, ornamental −0.3. Score 3.6.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Dappled resolve" appears once in paragraph eight ("dappled resolve shimmering like volcanic glass") and does not modulate with pressure. Tone throughout reads more as lyric confidence than conflicted resolve. Present at closure only, missing setup and middle. One gate (payoff), cap 2.8 waived due to conceptual link at ending, but static mood and late arrival lower score. Closure linkage +0.7, no beat involvement, ornamental phrasing −0.5. Score 5.3.</comment>
