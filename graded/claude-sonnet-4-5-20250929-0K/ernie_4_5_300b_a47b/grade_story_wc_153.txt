<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lirael's motivation is stated clearly—seeking "the moment before deciding" and unspoken words—but her interior life relies heavily on label-only emotion ("throat tighten," "warmth in her chest") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final shift from "heavy" to "lighter" feels declared rather than earned through micro-choices that foreclose a path with visible cost. Backstory is woven throughout but functions primarily as exposition rather than tilting present stance through on-page choices. The character reads as a vehicle for the concept rather than a flawed individual whose blind spots drive mistakes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land within the first paragraph. The closure attempts a Resonant Reconfiguration—Lirael walks away "lighter" with the spirits' command "Go. Live. Speak."—but the cost is asserted ("no longer heavy") rather than dramatized through a forfeited path or visible sacrifice. The moonlight ritual and condensation letters provide atmospheric deepening but no meaningful tightening of options or tactical constraint. The final image reconfigures emotional weight but lacks the felt price required for higher bands.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The mangrove labyrinth is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (roots like "ancient fingers," peat-rich earth, moon casting "silvery sheen"). The gargoyle shard constrains the ritual beat—it must be placed, it glows, its edges smooth by dawn—charging the final image with tactile specificity. Spatial choreography (clearing, kneeling, water, leaves) remains clear. The setting pressures Lirael's choices by providing the medium (condensation on leaves) and the resource (moonlight) that enable the evocation, lifting this above postcard description.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—evoking unsent letters to face unspoken regrets—is signaled early. The ritual in the clearing provides one meaningful deepening (condensation letters appear, Lirael reads and traces them), but no live option is foreclosed and no tactical trade-off emerges. The spirits' songs and the shard's glow add texture but do not narrow Lirael's choices or raise cost. The resolution (walking away "lighter") is declared rather than earned through protagonist agency that alters tactics under the chosen Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Theme—unspoken regrets, the beauty in brokenness, fierce tenderness—emerges from image and event rather than direct statement. The condensation letters and smoothed shard edges work as concrete particulars. However, the final paragraph moralizes overtly: "some wounds never fully close—and that was okay" and the spirits' command "Go. Live. Speak." The ending offers a resonant answer but edges toward thesis statement, diluting the non-literal charge. The gargoyle shard shifts meaning (sharp to smooth) but the transformation feels convenient rather than inevitably earned from prior particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited, filtered consistently through Lirael's perceptions ("quiet precision," "throat tighten," "steps lighter"). Diction remains character-appropriate with no unmotivated register shifts. Psychic distance is controlled, and no head-hopping occurs. The prose carries a distinct lyric texture in vocabulary and rhythm ("roots clawed at the sky," "smoke through church bells"). Under peak stress (the ritual), compression is purposeful and the perceptual signature (spirits' songs, condensation words) remains character-specific. No dialogue is present; judge by interiority and narrative voice alone.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings and paragraph lengths create visual breath. Information density is generally high with most lines advancing atmosphere or event. Minor scaffold appears: "She'd lost too much to silence, too many words left unsaid" is a paraphrase loop within one sentence. Template cadence in the final paragraphs ("She didn't need to. The spirits' songs faded... but their message remained") uses repetitive declarative stems. The figurative language is mostly coherent, though "wind through church bells" and "roots like ancient fingers" edge toward stock metaphor. No loops obscure causality or dull the closure image enough to warrant harsher penalty.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The core premise—cryptic medium uses gargoyle shard to evoke unsent letters via condensation in a moonlit mangrove—synthesizes familiar elements (spiritual healing journey, objects as keys, writing-on-glass motif) into a specific configuration. However, the emotional arc (burdened → lightened by viewing ghost-letters) and the healing-through-witnessing structure feel template-derived without a non-obvious moral calculus or lived detail that transforms the journey. The mangrove and singing spirits add atmospheric particularity but do not create a fresh inflection in the turn or final reconfiguration. Risk-taking is minimal; the story chooses safe symbolic resolution over friction.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Lirael is present throughout, but her choices are largely ritualistic and pre-determined: she enters the labyrinth, kneels, places the shard, reads the letters, and leaves. The decision to "carry them forward... as reminders" is declared rather than enacted through a tactical shift or forfeiture. She observes and witnesses more than she decides under pressure. The character appears in setup, middle ritual, and closure, satisfying the gate model, but causal pressure is low.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The gargoyle shard is introduced early (first paragraph), handled in the ritual (placed on ground, glows in moonlight), and returns with reweighted meaning at closure (edges "no longer sharp, but smooth"). It appears across three beats and its transformation charges the final image. However, the shard does not constrain a tactical choice or enable a turn—it functions as a symbolic marker rather than a tool whose specific properties alter Lirael's options.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Unsent letters are the conceptual heart: Lirael seeks them (setup), they manifest as condensation words in the ritual (middle), and their essence ("still echoing... but no longer heavy") shapes the closure. The concept defines the dominant stake and drives the protagonist's tactics (placing the shard, tracing the letters). Removing this element would collapse the story's logic. The concept is present across all three gates and integral to escalation and closure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Heals in moonlight" is mentioned as lore ("labyrinth was said to heal in moonlight") and the ritual occurs under the moon, with the shard glowing and the letters appearing. The attribute enables the manifestation but does not impose a visible cost or constrain a tactical choice—Lirael simply waits for moonlight. The healing is asserted in the resolution rather than dramatized through a trade-off. Setup and closure participation are present; middle development is weak.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Evoke" frames the action: Lirael's stated goal is to "evoke those words, to coax them into the light," and the ritual beat centers on her whispered command "Show me... evoke the letters." The condensation letters appear in response. The action drives the middle beat and connects to closure (the letters' essence persists). However, the evocation is mostly passive reception; Lirael does not wrestle with the mechanics or pay a price for the summoning. All three gates are met with moderate causal weight.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The method—messages in condensation—is signaled ("messages in condensation on windows—or, in this case, the glistening leaves"), dramatized in the ritual (water droplets form words on mangrove leaves), and Lirael traces them with her fingertips. The method appears in setup, executes in the middle, and its ephemeral nature (words dissolve at touch) charges the moment. However, the mechanics are not tested or constrained; the condensation simply appears when called. All three gates met; causal pressure moderate.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The mangrove labyrinth is introduced immediately and its properties (roots, spirits' songs, moonlight healing) enable the ritual and guide Lirael to the clearing. The spirits' songs swell during the evocation and follow her at closure. The setting provides the medium (leaves for condensation) and the resource (moonlight), shaping the attempt. The labyrinth "shifts around her... guiding her toward the exit" at closure, an active presence. All three gates met; causal and atmospheric contribution solid.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"The moment before deciding" and "the space where an apology waits unspoken" are framed as Lirael's conceptual goal, not a tracked temporal constraint. The story unfolds "until dawn" with no clock that tightens tactics or alters moves. The timeframe is thematic rather than dramatic—a metaphorical space rather than a live deadline. Setup (stated motivation) and thematic echo at closure are present, but middle development and tactical pressure are absent.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Lirael's motivation—to find "the moment before deciding" and face unspoken words—is stated early, drives her entry into the labyrinth, and is answered at closure when she gains "courage to face the unspoken." The desire is told rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses or visible friction between wants and costs. The resolution (walking away lighter) is asserted, not tested. Setup and closure participation are clear; middle friction is minimal.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Tone is signaled as "fierce tenderness" in the spirits' paradoxical songs and sustained through the ritual's mix of sorrow and resilience. The tone modulates (songs "grew louder," "swelled," then "faded") and charges the final image ("fierce, tender reminder"). However, the tone is more consistent atmosphere than a dynamic force that shifts under pressure. It colors the closure without undergoing a decisive transformation. Setup, middle presence, and closure contribution are all met; moderate charge.</comment>
