<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Lirael's motivation is clear and sustained, but her internal experience remains abstract—terms like "scheming pacifist" and "heart soft as moss" serve as labels rather than dramatized contradictions. The visitors (Elara, Kael) undergo identical epiphany arcs without distinct flaws or resistance patterns; their transformations feel mechanical rather than earned through individuated struggle. Embodied emotion is thin: reactions are summarized ("eyes glistening," "hand trembling") rather than shown through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. Lirael's competence goes unchallenged, and no genuine mistake compounds pressure before the resolution.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who, where, and when by the opening paragraph, avoiding the Orientation Test penalty. The piece follows a mosaic pattern (five visitor vignettes within the sanctuary), but the transitions are list-like ("Others came—a man bitter over lost love...") rather than taught or legible under pressure. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis: Lirael accepts that "resentment would creep back" but "for now... grace had shifted"), yet the cost feels asserted rather than dramatized—no visible forfeiture or tactical constraint emerges on the page. The accumulative lens is signaled but not consistently deepened; each visitor beat resets rather than tightening options or knowledge.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The sanctuary is vividly established ("walls lined with velvet," "echoes drowned in silence"), and the broken pin is handled across multiple beats, charging the closure image. Spatial choreography remains stable, and the pedestal anchors the ritual. However, the sanctuary's constraint—its silence—does not meaningfully pressure a choice or tactic; it functions as atmosphere rather than a material limit. The vial of cellular memory extract and the pin's transformation provide micro-setting specificity that elevates the score into the 6-band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake (teaching release) is signaled early, but escalation is absent: each visitor receives the same ritual without complication or cost that narrows Lirael's options. Kael's skepticism ("This is a trick") is the only moment of resistance, yet it resolves in a single exchange without altering tactics or risking failure. No reversal or tightening forecloses a live path; the story accumulates examples rather than building pressure. Agency is present (Lirael's ritual choices), but the absence of meaningful trade-offs or visible prices caps the score in the mid-4s.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Theme (grace through release, imperfection as strength) emerges through the broken pin's transformation and recurs across visitor beats. However, the final paragraph ("grace had shifted. And that was enough") states the theme rather than letting the image resonate. The pin's scars "gleaming like stars" is a strong particular, but Kael's articulation ("I think… I understand") and Lirael's summary reduce thematic complexity to a tidy resolution. The piece gestures toward ambiguity ("the lesson wouldn't stick forever") yet undercuts it with sentimental reassurance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable throughout, anchored to Lirael's perspective. Dialogue carries naturalism and subtext in Kael's exchange ("Mending doesn't erase the break"), and Lirael's voice is distinct in cadence and diction ("sharp as flint and a heart soft as moss"). However, visitor voices converge: Elara and Kael ask identical structural questions ("How?" / "This is a trick"), and their responses lack idiomatic distinction. Free indirect style is clean, and psychic distance modulates purposefully during ritual beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Prose is clear and propulsive in the opening, with strong rhythm ("echoes drowned in silence and even whispers died midair"). Template cadence appears in the visitor sequence: "She stared... then at Lirael. 'Why show me this?'" repeats structurally for Elara and Kael, creating a loop that dulls momentum (−0.4). Stock metaphors ("eyes glistening," "jaw set") and paraphrase near the close ("grace had shifted" echoes prior phrasing without added pressure) reduce density. Figurative language in the final beat ("scars gleaming like stars") is vivid but arrives after the closure choice has already been summarized, limiting its charge.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The sanctuary and broken-pin-as-metaphor setup is familiar (healing through acceptance, brokenness as strength), and the visitor sequence follows a predictable template: resistance → ritual → epiphany. Cellular memory extract offers a speculative detail, but it functions as a magic-wand device rather than a constraint that complicates choice. The piece does not transform its premise through specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus; Lirael's wisdom is unearned and frictionless. The ending's reassurance ("that was enough") retreats from risk.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Lirael (scheming pacifist) is present throughout and her ritual choices drive each beat. However, "scheming" is not dramatized—her tactics are straightforward and meet no resistance that would test cunning or require misdirection. She makes repeated identical choices (pour liquid, guide visitor) without a mid-story adjustment or trade-off. The character shapes structure but does not create a key turn; her arc is flat.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The broken pin appears in the opening, is handled across five visitor beats (ritual transformation), and returns in the final image ("clutched tight"). It reappears materially ("vanished, only to reappear moments later in Lirael's hand") and its scars are charged in Kael's closure beat. However, the pin's reappearance is asserted as magical without cost or constraint—it does not pressure a choice. Three gates met (setup, development, payoff); causal pressure is weak but closure linkage and beat involvement elevate the score into the 6-band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>"Shifting grace" is named in the opening ("shifting grace of acceptance") and recurs thematically in the ending ("grace had shifted"). However, it operates as a thematic label rather than a mechanic that alters options or tactics on the page. The pin's transformation and Lirael's ritual are the visible actions; "shifting grace" is the story's interpretation of those actions, not a rule that shapes attempts. Present and functional but replaceable with "acceptance" or "healing" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The pin "reappears when needed" twice: in Lirael's hand after Elara leaves, and in Kael's palm at closure. The reappearance is magical and costless—it does not constrain Lirael's choices or enable a tactic that would otherwise fail. The attribute is present and serves the ritual structure, but its mechanics are decorative. Two beats, weak causal pressure, closure participation as a prop rather than a deciding constraint.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Convince" is the dominant action across all five visitor beats: Lirael's dialogue and ritual aim to persuade each visitor toward release. Elara's and Kael's turns (resistance → acceptance) trace directly to this action. However, the action is repetitive without escalation; Lirael's approach does not adapt when Kael resists. The action is indispensable to structure and appears in the closure beat, but its sameness across vignettes and lack of visible cost in execution keep it in the upper-6 band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Cellular memory is introduced in the second paragraph ("cellular memory extract, harvested from her own blood") and explained to Elara ("Our bodies remember every hurt"). It is poured onto the pin in each ritual beat, making it mechanically present. However, its function is stated rather than demonstrated—how does pouring the liquid enable the pin's transformation? The method is a declared cause without visible mechanics or constraint; Lirael never runs low or faces a trade-off tied to its use. Present across beats but functionally equivalent to a generic magical catalyst.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The soundless sanctuary is vividly described in the opening and frames all action. Its silence "deepened" during Elara's moment of release, and the closing line notes "the sanctuary's silence fading into the hum of the world." However, the silence does not constrain a choice—Lirael's ritual works identically whether or not sound is present. The setting provides atmosphere and a thematic mirror ("the noise within") but does not alter tactics or supply a resource that affects outcome. Setup and closure gates met; middle development is thematic rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"While reality shifts" appears once in the opening ("while reality shifted around her") and again as "the air shimmered as reality warped, time bending like taffy." The phenomenon is described but does not tighten decisions or create a deadline. Lirael's ritual proceeds at an untracked pace; the final line notes "reality snapped back into place," but this has no consequence on her choices or the visitors' outcomes. Ornamental use; no causal role.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Lirael's motivation (to teach resentment to release) is stated in the opening and drives every beat: she designs the ritual, explains it to visitors, and reflects on its partial success at closure. Her desire is consistent and enacted through repeated on-page choices. However, it is never conflicted—no friction between her want and a competing cost or fear. The motivation is essential to structure and appears at closure ("the lesson wouldn't stick forever, that resentment would creep back"), but the absence of internal contradiction or visible sacrifice limits the score to the upper-6 band.</comment>
