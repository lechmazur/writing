<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lila's characterization relies heavily on abstract labels ("functionally creative," "curious civil engineer intern," "stoic wonder") rather than embodied action under pressure. Her emotional state is largely told through declarative statements ("her mind racing," "stoic wonder filling her chest") instead of contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The pivotal "resurrection" sequence lacks genuine struggle—she kneels, recalibrates conduits with unexplained ease, and the terminal responds as if programmed to her intent. The final decision to return feels more like narrative scaffolding than a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first paragraph, satisfying baseline requirements. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural—the piece layers atmosphere and engineering metaphor toward a final image—but the "resurrection" mechanism lacks causal grounding: Lila's tool use and the terminal's response are asserted rather than dramatized with legible steps. Closure attempts a Resonant Reconfiguration through the projected equation, yet the cost remains abstract ("raw, untested") rather than felt on the page. The Orientation Test penalty is waived, but the closure's conceptual cost is insufficiently materialized to enter high bands.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The abandoned terminal is established early with vivid sensory detail (domed roofs, bruised twilight, shattered glass ceiling, moonlight pooling). The setting supplies the sextant piece and dormant conduits, both of which Lila uses, meeting the micro-setting standard. However, spatial choreography remains vague during the climactic recalibration—readers cannot trace which conduits she reroutes or how the tools interact with the infrastructure. The final image of the equation projected on the wall does charge the ending, lifting the score above mid-band despite missing occupational specificity in the engineering work.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"to puzzle out new equations for hope"—is signaled early but remains conceptually abstract throughout. Lila encounters no meaningful opposition or tightening: the sextant piece is simply lodged in a crack, she pries it free without cost, and the terminal's systems respond to her recalibration without friction or failure. The single reversal (the terminal shuddering and humming) is atmospheric rather than a consequence of protagonist choice. No visible price is paid; the "raw, untested" equation is declared rather than earned through a trade-off that narrows options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Theme—repurposing broken systems, functional resurrection—emerges from the terminal's transformation and Lila's engineering metaphor, avoiding overt sermonizing until the final paragraphs. However, the closing lines tip into thematic echo: "a future built not on nostalgia, but on the courage to repurpose the old into the new" and "a single equation in a universe of possibilities" articulate the story's thesis in prompt-like language. The equation projected on the wall gestures toward resonance but lacks the specificity to reweight prior material with undeniable pressure. Conceptual cost is asserted ("raw, untested") rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable, and diction maintains a consistent engineering-inflected register ("structural calculations," "dormant conduits," "makeshift generator"). However, Lila's perceptual signature is generic rather than character-particular—her way of noticing the terminal reads like baseline description rather than shaped by her stated functional creativity. Filter verbs ("she'd always been," "she decided") appear frequently but remain voice-motivated. The prose modulates appropriately during the climactic hum sequence, tightening syntax to match rising pressure. No dialogue is present to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Sentence openings vary and no paraphrase loops appear, but the prose carries moderate scaffold: "Her goal wasn't just to find it; she wanted to puzzle out new equations for hope" restates the same intent without added pressure. The climactic beat—"She knelt, placing the sextant piece at the center of the atrium's crater. Using her engineering tools, she began recalibrating the terminal's hidden conduits, rerouting electrical and water systems into a makeshift generator"—summarizes the pivotal action in two generic verbs ("placing," "recalibrating") without tactile specificity. Stock phrasing appears in emotional beats ("her breath caught," "stoic wonder filling her chest"). Information density is adequate but not high; many sentences perform one job only.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The core premise—abandoned spaceport, mystical sextant piece, engineer repurposing infrastructure—assembles familiar genre elements (explorer relic, liminal space, STEM protagonist) without a non-obvious synthesis. The "functional resurrection" frame adds modest conceptual freshness, but the execution is template-safe: Lila encounters no genuine friction, the terminal responds to her intent without dramatized trade-offs, and the final "equation for hope" remains abstract. The carnival's departure is mentioned twice but never integrated into causality or stakes. Transformation test: swapping the terminal for any other abandoned infrastructure and the sextant for any other artifact would leave the emotional arc unchanged.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Lila is present throughout and her engineer identity is mentioned repeatedly, but her choices do not create key turns. She decides to enter the terminal, to search, to pry the sextant free, to recalibrate conduits, and to return later—all uncontested actions that follow outline logic rather than constrain tactics or alter cost. The attribute "curious" is label-only; "civil engineer intern" supplies occupation but not occupational friction. Setup and development gates are met (she appears early and acts in the middle), but closure participation is weak: the final decision to return is scaffold rather than a choice that reweights prior material. Causal pressure is minimal, limiting the score to mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The sextant piece appears in three beats: discovered in the atrium, held to moonlight for study, and placed at the center to trigger the terminal's hum. Setup, development, and payoff gates are satisfied. However, its properties remain vague—"edges etched with constellations no longer visible"—and its function (aligning with cosmic forces, triggering the hum) is asserted rather than earned through prior specificity. The object enables the climax but could be replaced with any mystical artifact that "resonates" without structural loss. Cost connection is absent; Lila experiences no trade-off in obtaining or using it. Beat involvement and closure linkage lift the score above replaceable, but swappability and lack of cost cap it below essential.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>The phrase "maze of intentions" appears once in paragraph two as atmospheric description: "The terminal's labyrinthine corridors formed a maze of intentions, each corridor a choice between stagnation and progress." It does not shape on-page choices—Lila traces faded maps but encounters no navigational friction, dead ends, or decision points. The concept is present and logically consistent (the terminal is maze-like), but it remains ornamental theme-speak rather than a constraint that alters tactics. Setup gate is met (mentioned in the first third), but development and payoff gates are missing. The score reflects functional presence without causal integration.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"Functionally creative" is mentioned three times but remains label-only: paragraph one declares it ("a penchant for functional creativity"), paragraph two restates it ("She'd always been functionally creative, blending logic with intuition"), and paragraph six recaps it ("a product of curiosity and creativity"). No on-page action demonstrates the trait through visible trade-offs or constraints. Her recalibration of conduits is summarized in generic terms without showing how blending logic and intuition differs from straightforward problem-solving. Setup gate is met, but development and payoff are absent. The attribute is present and mentioned but does not constrain or enable a beat with cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Resurrect" is the story's central verb: the sextant piece is said to "resurrect lost truths," and Lila achieves "a functional resurrection, a rebirth of purpose through redirected flows." The action shapes the dominant stake and the climax hinges on it. However, the mechanics are vague—Lila places the sextant and reroutes conduits, the terminal hums and projects an equation—so the action is asserted more than dramatized. Setup (mentioned in paragraph one), development (enacted in paragraph four), and payoff (reflected in paragraph five) gates are all met. Causal pressure is moderate: the action drives the ending but feels predetermined rather than earned through struggle. Swappability is modest; "restore" or "revive" would fit with minor edits, but "resurrect" carries thematic weight in the functional/metaphorical frame.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Redirected flows" is mentioned in paragraph four ("redirect those flows") and paragraph five ("a functional resurrection, a rebirth of purpose through redirected flows"). The method is signaled at the climax and restated in reflection, but its mechanics are summarized: "rerouting electrical and water systems into a makeshift generator." Setup gate is missed (the method is introduced in the second half), development gate is weak (the rerouting is told, not shown), and payoff gate is met (the method is named in the closure beat). The means appears late and lacks specificity, capping the score below 5.0. It shapes the ending conceptually but does not constrain attempts or expose cost.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport passenger terminal is established in the opening line and dominates every beat: Lila explores its corridors, finds the sextant in the collapsed atrium, and uses its dormant conduits to power the equation. Setup, development, and payoff gates are all met. The setting supplies the sextant, the conduits, and the wall for the projected equation—three resources that affect outcome. However, spatial specificity is weak (which conduits? how does the atrium connect to ticketing booths?), and the terminal's decay functions more as atmosphere than constraint. The setting is essential to the plot but does not pressure Lila's choices with friction or cost, placing it in the mid-essential band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>"After the carnival left town" is mentioned in the opening sentence and once more in the closing paragraph ("The carnival had left town"). The timeframe establishes a post-event stillness but does not create urgency or tighten decisions. No ticking clock, no approaching threat, no temporal constraint shapes Lila's exploration or recalibration. Setup gate is met, but development and payoff are absent—the carnival's departure is backstory rather than an active pressure. The element is present and logically consistent (the terminal is silent because the carnival is gone) but remains ornamental. The score reflects presence without causal work.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"To puzzle out new equations for hope" is stated in paragraph one and echoed in the climactic equation projected on the wall. The motivation frames Lila's goal and the ending image, satisfying setup and payoff gates. However, the desire is never dramatized through conflicting wants or costs—Lila pursues the sextant without friction, and the "hope" remains abstract. Development gate is weak: no mid-story choice tests the motivation against a competing priority. The motivation is told repeatedly ("her goal wasn't just to find it; she wanted to puzzle out new equations") but not embodied in a choice that exposes what she is willing to sacrifice. Causal pressure is minimal, capping the score in the functional-but-replaceable band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Tone blends restraint and awe throughout: "stoic wonder filling her chest," "her stoic resolve softening," atmospheric description of the terminal's decay and moonlight. The tone is coherent and modulates subtly with pressure—tightening during the hum sequence, softening at the close. Setup and payoff gates are met; the tone shapes the final image's emotional charge. However, the tone is performed through label phrases ("stoic wonder," "stoic resolve") rather than enacted through contradictory impulses or embodied restraint under stress. The tone supports closure but does not constrain a choice or expose cost, placing it in the mid-band for tonal coherence without causal integration.</comment>
