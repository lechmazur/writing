<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's internal state is richly embodied through gesture (trembling hands, tracing the crack) and her motivation to atone drives the ascent and card-laying. However, the climactic choice—climbing the tree and placing *The World*—feels more like a ritual completion than a decision that forecloses a competing path with visible cost. The mother's voice and the healed saucer arrive as external gifts rather than consequences of Elara's contradictory impulses acting simultaneously under pressure. Interiority leans toward poetic summary ("cloudbound repentance," "willingly perplexed") rather than embodied contradiction in peak beats.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers card placements, symbolic objects, and imagery toward a final reconfiguration. Orientation is delayed—we lack clear spatial anchors and "after the birth" remains vague until late—but the lyric mode teaches this pattern early enough to avoid collapse. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (the healed saucer, the mother's handprint on the cloth) with conceptual cost (acceptance that "repentance isn't a place"). However, the saucer's healing and the mother's appearance feel granted rather than earned by prior causality; the tree and nest appear without prior setup, weakening the because/therefore linkage even under an accumulative lens. Cost is legible but the causal path to that cost is soft.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The midnight glade is vividly rendered with moss, silver birch, and edges dissolving into mist, and the floating-island premise constrains the encounter. The saucer's crack and the tree's hourglass roots provide concrete focal points. The setting charges the final image (the path home through parting mist) and the glade's shuddering twice signals instability that pressures Elara's actions. Spatial choreography remains clear despite the fantastical elements. The body (shift snagging on bark) and recurring objects (cards, saucer, cloth) function as micro-setting that shapes beats and the ending, meeting the 9+ quick test's threshold.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—seeking penance for her mother's absence—is signaled early and drives the card-laying and ascent. One meaningful tightening occurs when the saucer's crack widens and light seeps through, forcing the climb. However, escalation is primarily textural (accumulating symbolic gestures) rather than a narrowing of options or a visible tradeoff. The resolution (healed saucer, mother's handprint) arrives as discovery rather than a choice that forecloses a path with on-page cost. Coincidence (the tree appearing, the nest containing the saucer) complicates but also resolves, which softens agency under the accumulative lens. Cost is felt emotionally but not dramatized as a renunciation or endurance that closes off a live alternative.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme—grief, time, and the search for lost connection—emerges through the cards, saucer, and handprint motif rather than direct statement. The mother's closing line ("repentance isn't a place. It's a choice") verges on thematic echo but is brief enough to avoid heavy penalty. The final image (new handprint in onyx ink, mist parting to show a path home) offers a resonant answer: lost time accumulates in "the spaces between breaths, in the cracks we willingly perplex." However, the piece leans toward poetic assertion ("choking and bright," "The clock's always ticking, even when it's broken") rather than earning insight strictly through prior dramatic particulars. The saucer and cloth do recur with shifted meaning, and the emotional truth of unresolved grief reads specific, lifting the score into the 6.5–7.2 range.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Elara with a lyric, elevated register ("ozone and old starlight," "pooling like ink") that remains consistent and voice-motivated. Psychic distance is controlled, and perceptual signature (card imagery, onyx ink, the saucer's crack as question mark) is distinct. However, register drift occurs in peak beats: "willingly perplexed" and "cloudbound repentance" read as authorial insertions rather than Elara's interior idiom under stress. The mother's dialogue is brief but distinct. Purposeful compression and patterned metaphor (cards, cracks, light) are taught early and legible, so experimental allowances apply. Minor filter-verb stacks ("She'd read," "She'd found") and some ornamental phrasing ("the phrase tasting of ash and honey") slightly dull immediacy but do not obscure the lens.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and figurative density is high but controlled: "robes pooling like ink," "roots coiled like hourglasses," "shift billowing like a parachute." However, multiple beats lean toward overwriting—nearly every sentence in the middle third carries metaphor or simile without pattern-teaching or payoff, approaching the density penalty threshold. Template cadence appears in "She knelt… and laid out," "She traced… She'd found… She'd read," a run of identical "She [verb]" stems that flatten propulsion. Paraphrase loop: "The glade shuddered" (twice) and "unfasten" (three times) without additive detail. Clarity remains high and no artifact obscures the closure image, so penalties are moderate. Information density is uneven—some lines do double work (saucer as relic and ritual object), others are ornamental ("lilacs—her mother's favorite flower" adds color but not pressure).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The premise—cartomancer seeking penance in a cloud-glade with tarot and a cracked saucer—combines familiar fantasy elements (mystical cards, floating realm, quest for closure) without a sharp transformative angle. Emotional specificity (the birthday cloth, untraced hand, mother's mid-song silence) lifts particularity, but the core arc (ascending to vision, receiving symbolic healing) follows a well-worn template. The saucer's crack-as-question-mark and the tree of hourglass roots offer fresh images, yet the resolution (healed saucer, mother's handprint appearing) feels pre-packaged rather than an earned synthesis. Risk-taking in structure (lyric density, non-linear card-laying) is present but does not fundamentally reweight the emotional arc. The Transformation Test is borderline: swap "cartomancer" for "priestess" and "glade" for "temple" and the arc holds unchanged.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her choices—laying cards, tracing her palm, climbing the tree, placing *The World*—drive all major beats. Setup is immediate (kneeling, unfastening satchel), development occurs in the card sequence and ascent, and payoff appears in the final packing and step off the glade. Two gates met strongly; causal pressure is moderate (her actions summon the vision but the tree and nest appear without her decision). Specificity is high (cartomancer role, onyx-ink marking). Cost is felt emotionally but not shown as a visible tradeoff that narrows options. Score: early signal +0.5, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.0, moderate causal pressure +0.8, specificity +0.5, emotional cost +0.3, minus swappability −0.4 (another seeker archetype could replace her role with minor edits). Baseline 3.0 + 4.1 = 7.1, round down to 7.0, but the lack of a decisive choice with visible cost lowers to 6.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The saucer appears in beat one (Elara traces its crack), widens with light in beat two (middle escalation), is found whole in the nest in beat three, and is packed "whole in her hands" at closure. Four beats. Setup is immediate, development occurs when the crack widens and she presses her ear to it, closure participation is strong (healed saucer as proof of transformation). Causal pressure: the crack guides her actions (listening, unfastening with onyx ink). Specificity: the question-mark shape and tea-set origin are unique. Cost: healing the saucer costs her the search (she must accept that lost time isn't in the crack but "in the spaces between breaths"). Score: early signal +0.6, four beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage +1.4, specificity +0.6, cost +0.5. Baseline 3.0 + 5.7 = 8.7, but late payoff (nest reveal) slightly weakens necessity, adjust to 7.2.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Cloudbound repentance is named once early ("she whispered, the phrase tasting of ash and honey") and echoed in the mother's line ("repentance isn't a place"). It frames Elara's motivation but does not shape on-page tactics or constrain choices—Elara's actions (card-laying, climbing) would occur under any grief-seeking premise. Setup is present; development is thematic rather than mechanical; payoff is thematic restatement. No middle beat where the concept alters options. Score: early signal +0.4, thematic closure linkage +0.4, minus ornamental use −0.7, swappability −0.6 (could be "sky-bound mourning" with no structural change). Baseline 3.0 − 0.5 = 2.5, lifted slightly by the mother's dialogue moment to 4.1.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Willingly perplexed" appears once in dialogue ("she murmured, a smile twisting her lips") but does not constrain or enable an on-page action with cost. It labels Elara's stance without altering her tactics. No setup beat where the trait is shown through choice, no development where it creates friction, and no payoff where it charges the ending. Score: mid-story mention −0.3, label-only −0.5, no causal work −0.7. Baseline 3.0 − 1.5 = 1.5, but the smile and card reflection provide a micro embodiment, lifting to 3.8 (functional but replaceable).</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Unfastening occurs three times: the satchel clasp (opening), the robe sash (mid-ritual), and "unfastening the saucer's crack with onyx ink" (key turn). Setup is immediate, development is the robe moment (revealing the handprint shift), payoff is the crack-opening that releases light and summons the tree. Two of the three uses drive beats; the third (satchel) is setup only. Causal pressure: unfastening the crack is the pivot that escalates the vision. Specificity: the sash and crack unfastenings are distinct acts. Cost: revealing the shift and opening the crack expose vulnerability. Score: early signal +0.5, two functional beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +0.8, specificity +0.4, cost +0.4, minus one ornamental use (satchel) −0.3. Baseline 3.0 + 3.7 = 6.7, round to 6.9.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The birthday tablecloth custom is introduced in backstory (second paragraph) as a memory, reappears on Elara's shift (she traces her palm on it in the middle beat), and returns at closure (the cloth bears the mother's new handprint). Setup is early, development occurs when Elara traces her own palm (enabling the vision), payoff is the mother's handprint appearing. The custom's mechanics—tracing to bind time to flesh—matter: Elara's act of tracing herself inverts the absence and opens the crack. Causal pressure is moderate; the tracing is more ritual than a choice with visible cost. Score: early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +0.7, closure linkage +1.0, specificity +0.5, cost +0.3, minus backstory lag −0.3. Baseline 3.0 + 3.6 = 6.6, but the handprint's appearance as gift rather than earned consequence lowers to 5.9.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The midnight glade is introduced in sentence one and remains the sole setting. It constrains the encounter (floating, edges dissolving, shuddering twice to signal instability) and charges the final image (fading, mist parting to show the path home). Setup is immediate, development is the glade's shuddering and the tree's appearance within it, payoff is the soft landing and the path reveal. The glade's instability pressures Elara to complete the ritual before it vanishes. Specificity: moss, silver birch, floating above clouds. Cost: the glade fades, forcing her to leave. Score: early signal +0.7, two development beats +0.9, causal pressure +0.9, closure linkage +1.2, specificity +0.6, cost +0.4. Baseline 3.0 + 4.7 = 7.7, but the glade is more atmospheric container than active constraint on tactics, adjust to 6.4.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"After the birth" appears in backstory (second paragraph: "not after the birth, when her mother's voice had gone silent mid-song") but does not function as a live timeframe that tightens decisions. It explains the origin of Elara's grief but does not create urgency or constrain the present action—the ritual could occur at any point in Elara's adult life. No setup as a ticking clock, no development where time pressure alters tactics, no payoff where elapsed time matters. Score: mentioned once in backstory −0.5, no causal pressure −0.9, no closure linkage −0.6. Baseline 3.0 − 2.0 = 1.0, lifted slightly because it anchors the emotional wound to 2.6.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Elara's motivation—to find where lost time accumulates—is stated explicitly in paragraph three and drives the card-laying, the listening to the crack, and the climb. Setup is early, development occurs in the tree ascent and discovery of the city where time moves backward, payoff is the realization that lost time accumulates "in the spaces between breaths, in the cracks we willingly perplex." Two beats where the desire propels action. However, the motivation is told more than dramatized through conflicting wants; no visible friction between this goal and a competing need. Score: early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, specificity +0.4, minus told-only friction −0.7. Baseline 3.0 + 3.1 = 6.1.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Tone is lyric and melancholic throughout with moments of compressed intensity: "the sound choking and bright," "pooling like ink," "starlight," "ash and honey." Coherent from opening to closure. The "choking" quality appears twice (the laugh at the end, the throat tightening when the mother calls), creating a charged reprise that reweights the opening mood. Modulation is present but subtle—tone does not shift dramatically under peak pressure. Setup is immediate (ozone, starlight, onyx-ink), development is the lilac wind and the choking throat-tighten, payoff is the "choking and bright" laugh. Score: early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.1, modulation +0.5, specificity +0.4. Baseline 3.0 + 3.5 = 6.5, round to 6.7 for the exact phrase reprise at closure.</comment>
