<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elio's interiority is well-developed with specific perceptual details (meteorite ink, temporal stretching), but the grandmother apparition arrives without prior setup of Elio's relationship to grief or memory, making the emotional stakes feel declared rather than earned. The final choice to descend feels more like thematic necessity than character-driven contradiction—no visible cost or foreclosed path emerges from the decision. Embodied emotion is present in the palm-press and trembling hand, but the piece leans toward contemplative summary rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation is anchored adequately (deck, post-shutdown, Elio alone). The closure unit reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (confusion reframed as compass), but the cost remains abstract—no on-page forfeit or visible price paid for choosing the left-right-up path. The grandmother's "glimpse" complicates but does not causally enable the final descent; Elio's shift from hesitation to trust occurs through epiphany rather than pressure-driven choice. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural with thematic reweighting, yet the final image (golden light, ready quill) feels more like promise than reconfiguration with felt stakes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The deck's time-dilation effect is vividly rendered and constrains perception throughout (frosted glass, warping constellations, vibrating compass). Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (meteorite ink, syrup-slow nebula). The compass rose functions as micro-setting, appearing in three beats and charging the final choice with its warmth. Spatial choreography is clear through the descent.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding order/true north in exile) is signaled early, but escalation is more thematic than tactical—no live option is foreclosed by the glimpse or grandmother's appearance. The final path choice (left-right-up) occurs without visible cost or trade-off; Elio's shift from hesitation to trust is asserted rather than tested. One meaningful tightening exists (compass needle points to the past), but it complicates conceptually without narrowing on-page options or forcing a renunciation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The theme (confusion as compass, exploration vs. stasis) emerges organically from the deck's dilation mechanics and Elio's ritual. The compass-north metaphor accumulates purposefully and the final image reweights it without stating a moral. However, the grandmother's line "Confusion is just exploration's first draft" edges toward thematic statement rather than subtext. The piece resists neat resolution and invites reflection, with the golden-light threshold offering a resonant non-literal answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with strong perceptual signature (astronomer's eye, temporal metaphors). Diction is controlled and voice-specific ("blessed pariah," "syrup," "stitched into the fabric"). The grandmother's dialogue feels slightly expository ("You felt it then. The pull. The confusion.") but serves the thematic hinge. Psychic distance modulates purposefully from intimate interiority to the wider lens at closure. No head-hopping or filter clutter.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with varied syntax and strong imagery (frosted glass, gilded filaments, nebula pulsing). Minor loops appear: "confusion" is named three times in close proximity, and "true north" recurs without evolving meaning mid-story. The metaphor "temporally stretched their perception" and "syrup" dilation are vivid, but "fragments—a laugh from yesterday, a sigh from tomorrow" strains clarity. Opening and closing lines anchor well. Information density is high; no significant scaffolding or template cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The time-dilation deck premise is fresh and the grandmother-as-glimpse twist offers a non-obvious synthesis. However, the "exiled scientist finds meaning in solitude" arc and "confusion as compass" insight trend toward familiar territory. The specificity of meteorite ink and the compass rose's mechanics elevate, but the final threshold-of-light ending feels archetypal. Risk-taking (temporal apparition, non-linear perception) is present but does not fully transform the template.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elio ("blessed pariah") is present throughout and his choice to descend drives the ending, but the decision feels more thematic than pressure-driven—observation dominates over decisive turns that alter tactics. Setup and closure participation are clear; middle development is light.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The compass rose appears in four distinct beats: railing description, vibration during glimpse, grandmother's gesture toward it, and warmth in palm during descent. It shifts from decorative to directional guide, shaping the final path choice. Setup, development, and payoff gates are met with causal pressure at closure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"True north" is named early and returns in the grandmother's line and Elio's realization, reweighting from literal direction to philosophical willingness. It shapes the final choice (trusting the compass over analysis) but remains more thematic than tactical—no on-page option is narrowed by the concept itself. Setup and closure participation present; middle constraint is light.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Temporally stretched" is described vividly (colleagues in fragments, seconds cracking) but functions as atmospheric trait rather than on-page constraint. Elio's perception dilation is label-only; no choice or action is enabled/disabled by the trait. Present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The "glimpse" (dilation field falter) triggers the grandmother's appearance and the compass needle's shift, creating the story's major turn. It is signaled early, recurs with escalation (stars invert, compass spins), and directly enables the final descent by providing the directional cue. Setup, development, and payoff gates met with causal weight.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The family custom (sketching the sky on anniversaries) frames the opening ritual and anchors Elio's connection to his grandmother. It triggers the glimpse timing and provides the quill as a recurring prop at closure. Setup and payoff present; middle involvement is light—the act of sketching does not constrain choices after the glimpse begins. Lyric reprise reweights meaning but lacks mid-scene pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The time-dilation observation deck supplies the core mechanics (dilation field, glimpse phenomenon, compass pointing to past coordinates) and forces Elio's exile context. It constrains perception throughout and the deck's "fading hum" guides the final breath-sync choice. Setup, development, and payoff gates met; the setting's rules are indispensable to closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"After the shutdown" anchors the abandoned Institute context and Elio's isolation, shaping the opening atmosphere. The anniversary timing triggers the ritual. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions or create urgency—no clock pressure or tactical shift results from post-shutdown status. Setup and thematic presence; development and closure linkage are weak.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"To turn confusion into exploration" is dramatized through Elio's hesitation-to-trust arc and voiced explicitly by the grandmother. It shapes the final path choice (closing eyes, trusting the compass) with visible shift from overanalysis to movement. Setup and payoff present; middle friction is light—the desire is more stated than tested by competing costs. Cost at closure is conceptual (foreclosing overthinking) rather than tangible.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Echoed silence" appears in the opening line and recurs as "silence pressed in" mid-story, then modulates to "heart quiet" at closure. Tone is coherent and atmospheric, supporting the contemplative lens. However, the tone remains relatively static—no sharp modulation under the glimpse's pressure or the grandmother's appearance. Setup and closure participation present; pressure modulation is subtle rather than charged.</comment>
