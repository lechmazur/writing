<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is stated rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. The pilgrim memory and "spiritually curious" label arrive as exposition without embodied cost. The breathing method and camera obscura work function as props rather than revealing character under pressure. The pool discovery feels declarative—"she understood now"—rather than earned through on-page struggle with visible stakes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: attempted Accumulative/Textural but collapses into summary. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive promptly. The closure unit—finding unused love in "spaces between breaths"—is abstract philosophy stated rather than a resonant reconfiguration with felt cost. The journey from viaduct to clearing to pool reads as transit without narrowing options or raising price. No on-page choice forecloses a path; the ending tells us she found peace without showing what she sacrificed or how her stance crystallized.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The viaduct's moss-slick path and glowing flowers establish atmosphere early. The clearing, tree, and pool function as setting stations for revelation rather than constraining choice. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout the walk and kneeling. The "foggy lucidity" tone is maintained but the woods and clearing do not pressure Lira's decisions—she follows embers without friction from terrain or environment.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding where unused love is stored—is signaled early but never tested. Lira walks, follows light, kneels, and receives understanding without a single on-page reversal or tightening choice. No visible cost narrows her options; the breathing and the pool's glow arrive as solutions to a question she never struggled against. Coincidence (the embers, the tree, the pool) delivers resolution without protagonist agency altering tactics.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The central question "where is unused love stored?" is posed clearly and the answer—"spaces between breaths"—attempts thematic resonance. However, the ending states the insight as a platitude rather than earning it through specific conflict and image. The pilgrim-of-sparks motif and camera obscura work remain decorative metaphors without forcing a moral calculus. Subtext is thin; the pool scene tells us the revelation rather than letting gesture and image imply meaning.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with no head-hopping. Diction leans lyric—"soft edges and half-truths," "foggy lucidity"—and maintains tonal consistency. However, register drifts into abstract philosophical language ("collective well of unused love," "essence of compassion") that undermines embodied perception. No dialogue to evaluate. Perceptual signature is generic; Lira notices glowing flowers and humming stones without character-specific bias shaping what she sees or ignores.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and opening/closing lines anchor tone. Persistent scaffold and paraphrase loops dilute momentum: "revealing what was hidden, but now she sought to heal" echoes the premise multiple times; "breath remained steady" and breathing-change motifs recur without fresh pressure. Mixed metaphor: "pilgrim of sparks tending flames that burned without fuel" then "trail of unused love seeking its purpose" conflates spark/flame/love without coherent vehicle. Template cadence in the final paragraph ("love, like light, was never truly unused") and filter-verb stacks ("seemed to," "felt a") dull immediacy. Stock phrasing: "foggy lucidity," "testament to unseen forces."</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The combination—camera obscura artist, Kwan Yin's Tear, breathing method, twilight viaduct—reads as checklist assembly rather than organic synthesis. "Where is unused love stored?" echoes prompt-template spirituality without transforming the familiar quest-for-wisdom structure. The pilgrim-of-sparks past-life conceit and the revealing-through-breathing method feel ornamental, swappable with other mystical devices. No bold structural or perspectival risk; the linear walk-and-discover arc follows a median path. The final platitude—love waits in pauses—offers no fresh synthesis.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Lira sets up the camera but never makes a choice with it that alters tactics. She follows embers, kneels, dips hands—all passive observation. Her artist identity is mentioned but does not constrain or enable a beat with cost. Present throughout but replaceable with any seeker role.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Kwan Yin's Tear appears early (setup gate), is consumed in one beat (single touch), and does not return or reweight at closure. The vial enables the warmth that begins her journey but the mechanics are vague and it resolves nothing. Swappable with any mystical catalyst. Functional but not essential.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The pilgrim of sparks surfaces as backstory exposition and is referenced again at the clearing ("trail of the pilgrim"). It frames Lira's question but does not shape an on-page choice or tactic. The concept remains thematic decoration rather than driving conflict. Present in two beats but lacks causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"Spiritually curious" is a label applied in paragraph two without constraining or enabling action. Lira's journey follows from the memory, not from curiosity forcing a tradeoff. The trait could be omitted without altering plot. Ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Healing is declared as Lira's new aim but no on-page beat shows her attempting to heal or facing a cost tied to that action. The ending claims she "sought to heal" yet the journey is about finding, not mending. Told-only, not dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Breathing changes are introduced early (setup gate), used in the middle sequence ("revealing through breathing changes"), and mentioned at closure ("her breath a steady rhythm"). However, the method's mechanics remain vague and it does not narrow a choice or enable a tactic under pressure. It appears in three beats but functions as atmosphere rather than plot engine.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The twilight viaduct in bloom is established early with vivid detail (glowing flowers, moss-slick path) and serves as departure and return anchor. It does not constrain Lira's choices—she walks freely—but it charges the opening and closing images. The setting shapes two beats (departure, return) and contributes mood that supports the ending's peace. Functional reprise but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the past life memory surfaced" is stated in paragraph two and motivates the quest. It does not tighten tactics or create urgency; the memory is backstory rather than a live clock. Present as premise but does not shape beat pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The question "where is unused love stored?" is posed early, drives Lira's journey, and is answered at closure. However, the desire is declared rather than dramatized through conflicting wants or visible cost. The pool scene delivers understanding without forcing Lira to choose between competing goods. Shapes the arc but lacks friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Foggy lucidity is introduced in the woods beat and maintained through the clearing sequence. The tone modulates with the glowing pool and charged final image. It supports the mystical atmosphere and charges the closure without becoming static. Present across beats and woven into the ending's resonance.</comment>
