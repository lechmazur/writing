<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lirael's caretaker role is embodied through precise actions (tracing the fissure, dismantling the chime, singing), but her interior life remains underexplored—motivations are asserted more than dramatized through contradictory impulses. The final choice to repair the chime feels thematically resonant yet arrives without visible cost or foreclosed paths; she succeeds without struggle or sacrifice. The director's hologram functions as exposition rather than relational pressure. Embodied emotion is sparse; moments like "chest tightened" and "heart both heavy and light" lean on stock physiology rather than character-particular sensation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Orientation is clean by the opening paragraph (who, where, when). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through layered imagery (glass-orchids, chime, extinct feelings) and the closure operates as Resonant Reconfiguration—the chime is "repaired, though not as it had been," reweighting preservation as evolution rather than stasis. Cost is conceptual (accepting transformation over perfection) but lacks felt sting; Lirael's success is untroubled, and the final image charges theme without narrowing her options or exacting a visible price. One meaningful deepening occurs when she realizes preservation demands creativity, but the escalation is atmospheric rather than stakes-driven.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The opal library, glass-orchids, and bamboo chime are vivid and purposeful, filtering through Lirael's caretaker lens (humidity, frequencies, runes). The cracked tube constrains her repair attempt and charges the closure when its fissure becomes "a conduit for a sound no one had heard in centuries." Sensory detail is selective and serves atmosphere without slowing momentum. Micro-setting qualifies: the tube itself functions as a constrained object-as-setting. Spatial choreography is clean; the library's verticality and cloud-edge location ground the action throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving the chime's song to keep extinct feelings dormant—is signaled early. Pressure tightens when the director declares the tube irreparable, forcing Lirael to improvise. However, escalation lacks cost: her humming and singing succeed without friction, the glass-orchids respond cooperatively, and the resolution arrives without trade-offs or foreclosed paths. The actualized lens (Accumulative/Textural) permits deepening over causal turns, and the final reconfiguration reweights preservation, yet agency is muted—Lirael's creative choice feels thematically inevitable rather than hard-won under pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: preservation as evolution, memory as collaboration, and the cost of letting the past transform. The cracked tube becomes a resonant particularity, its fissure enabling new harmony. The final image—"deserted marvels…waiting…to be remade"—offers a non-literal answer without moralizing. However, the director's line "You've preserved the act of remembering" edges toward thematic echo, and "foxglove regret" is named once without anchoring in action or choice. The piece resists easy binaries and invites reflection, though the emotional stakes remain abstract rather than viscerally felt.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with clean focalization on Lirael. Diction is elevated and consistent, with purposeful lyricism ("prismatic whispers," "iridescent mist," "liquid light") that never drifts into incoherence. Perceptual signature is present: Lirael notices humidity, frequencies, and the orchids' colors. The director's hologram speaks in distinct register ("opalescent static"). No head-hopping. Brief filter verbs ("She realized," "She felt") are voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy. Rhythmic control under pressure is solid, though the prose maintains a uniform lyric texture throughout without modulating sharply at peak beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high, but overwriting pervades: nearly every beat carries figurative language ("cascade of opalescent static," "tapestry of old and new," "foxglove regret"). Stock metaphors cluster in the final third ("liquid light," "patient as bamboo"). Mixed metaphor appears when "deserted marvels" are said to "pool like liquid light" then "rise." Paraphrase loop: the director says the tube "cannot be repaired," then Lirael realizes "some things…could not be mended," restating without added pressure. Template cadence in paragraph four: "She retrieved…She hummed…She returned." Apply cumulative penalty for density and stock phrasing (−0.8) and paraphrase/template run (−0.4); total −1.2 from a ~7.6 baseline.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The premise—caretaker of extinct feelings in a cloud library—is imaginative and the glass-orchid/wind-chime synthesis feels specific. The thematic turn (preservation as transformation, not freezing) offers a fresh angle on memory and legacy. However, the emotional arc and resolution echo familiar template beats: wise elder doubts, protagonist persists, ingenuity triumphs, everyone learns. The final realization arrives without surprise or counter-pressure. "Foxglove regret" is ornamental and the "museum of extinct feelings" functions more as atmospheric flavor than a constraint that reshapes choices. Risk-taking is modest; the lyric mode is well-executed but safe within its genre.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Lirael's choices (dismantling the chime, humming, singing) drive key turns. She refuses the director's verdict and improvises a repair. Her agency shapes the middle beat and the closure. Setup is immediate, development is present (she adapts her method mid-scene), and payoff occurs when the repaired chime sings. However, the choices arrive without visible cost or foreclosed options; she succeeds on first attempt without friction. Causal pressure is moderate. Two-gate coverage (setup + closure participation) plus beat involvement and causal linkage place the score in the functional-essential range, but lack of cost caps higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The cracked bamboo tube is handled in multiple beats: traced, dismantled, sung to, remounted. Its crack is the inciting problem and becomes "a conduit for a sound no one had heard" at closure—a charged reprise. Setup is immediate, middle development constrains her repair method, and payoff transforms the fissure into an asset. The object is irreplaceable (sourced from a vanished grove) and its physical properties matter. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage. Cost connection is conceptual (accepting imperfection). Three gates met, beat involvement across three segments, closure participation, and specificity justify high-essential range.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Deserted marvels" appears once in the final paragraph as thematic commentary ("The deserted marvels of the past were not lost…waiting…to be remade"). It does not shape stakes, constrain choices, or alter tactics on the page. The museum of extinct feelings is the story's setting and thematic vehicle, but "deserted marvels" as a phrase is ornamental. Setup absent, development absent, closure mention only. Swappable with "forgotten wonders" or similar. Late first appearance (final third) and ornamental use trigger caps and subtractions: cap 4.6 for missing setup, −0.5 ornamental, −0.4 swappability. Scored 4.1.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Gently systematic" is shown early (Lirael tending orchids with "precise humidity" and "faint resonance of certain frequencies") and recurs when she dismantles the chime with "movements precise, almost ritualistic." The trait constrains her method (systematic care, ritual patience) but does not face a visible cost or tradeoff. Setup present, middle development weak (the trait enables but does not complicate), closure absent. One beat involvement with mild causal pressure. Two-gate coverage (setup + development) allows eligibility to ~6.0, but lack of cost and closure participation prevent higher scores. Band guidance and friction adjustments yield 5.8.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Light" is seeded midway ("*Light*, she thought. Not the harsh brilliance of the sun, but the soft glow of memory") and returns at closure when the glass-orchids "cast rainbows across the library." The element shapes one key turn (Lirael's realization that memory-light can replace the chime's sound) and charges the final image. Setup is late (second third, −0.3), but closure participation is strong (+1.2) and the concept is specific (+0.5). One beat involvement (+0.4). Two gates (development + payoff) plus closure linkage and specificity justify mid-essential range. Late signal and single-beat use prevent higher scores.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The "echo of a long-forgotten song" (grandmother's lullaby) is signaled midway and used as the repair method: Lirael sings, the tube vibrates, the orchids respond, and the closure sound is "a tapestry of old and new." Setup in second third (−0.3), but development and payoff are clear. The method is irreplaceable (the specific song's resonance matters) and causally shapes the ending. Two beats (singing, mounting the repaired chime), strong causal pressure (+1.2), closure linkage (+1.4), specificity (+0.6). Three gates met. Adjusted for late signal but elevated by causal and closure work, score lands at 7.1.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The "opal library above clouds" is present throughout, anchoring setting and tone. The apex location (where the chime hangs) and cloud-edge vista supply spatial grounding. However, the setting does not constrain choices or supply tactical resources; it functions as atmospheric backdrop. The orchids and chime are objects within the library, not the library itself acting as pressure. Setup immediate (+0.6), but development and payoff are ornamental. Micro-setting (the body, a tool) is not leveraged. Swappability is moderate (any elevated, isolated location would serve). Score in lyric-resonance allowance range: 5.9.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Across the museum of extinct feelings" names the spatial scope, not a timeframe. The story unfolds in a single continuous scene ("Today, Lirael knelt…") with no clock or temporal pressure. Time is vague and untracked; no tightening decisions or tactics are altered by deadline. The phrase "across" implies traverse but does not constrain when or how fast. Setup ambiguous, development absent, payoff absent. Swappable with "throughout" or "within." Ornamental mention (−0.5), swappability (−0.6), missing all three gates → cap 3.4. Scored 3.2.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"To preserve the sound of forgotten names" is Lirael's motivation, mentioned obliquely ("she'd never known the names of those who'd crafted the chime") and thematically at closure ("connected to them…as a collaborator in their legacy"). The desire is told more than dramatized; we see her repair the chime but do not witness internal friction between preserving versus transforming. Setup is present but late (middle third), development is thematic rather than conflicted, payoff is conceptual. One beat with thematic pressure. Missing middle dramatization → cap 3.4, but lyric reprise and closure linkage lift within allowance to 4.7.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Foxglove regret" appears once as a label ("her foxglove regret softening") without embodied cost or action. Tone overall is elegiac and lyric, coherent through turns, and modulates subtly when Lirael shifts from fear to creative agency. The phrase itself is ornamental, but the regret-to-connection arc charges the final image ("heart both heavy and light"). Setup weak (label-only, mid-scene), development absent as named trait, payoff present in tonal resolution. Lyric reprise (softening regret → heart both heavy and light) reweights the stake. Two-gate allowance (weak setup + payoff) plus closure linkage justify 6.1 within lyric-resonance band.</comment>
