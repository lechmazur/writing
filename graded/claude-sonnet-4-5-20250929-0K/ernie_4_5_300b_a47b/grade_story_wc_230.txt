<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to cultivate psychological safety is stated but never tested through competing goods or visible tradeoffs. Her decisions feel scripted rather than pressured—slipping the glass eye into her socket to elicit truth from Jorn proceeds without internal resistance or cost. The relationship with Jorn shifts from paranoid to collaborative in a single scene without earned friction. Interiority leans on stock phrases ("her heart sinking," "her mind racing") rather than embodied, character-particular perception.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors arrive quickly (who, where, when by ~100 words). The closure—"We occlude... with truth"—reads as a declaration rather than a Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with on-page cost; the ledger's discovery and Mara's plan are told, not dramatized into a choice that forecloses options. The inferred lens is Causal, but the final beat substitutes thematic assertion for a visible consequence or renunciation. Cost is conceptual at best and not made undeniable in the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The ravine orchard and storm are vivid and purposefully atmospheric, but they function as backdrop rather than constraint—Mara reaches the oak without the storm altering her tactics or choices. The glass eye's physical properties (scratched, milky surface) are described multiple times but never constrain a beat. Spatial choreography is clean; sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered. The hut anchors the final scene, but no environmental feature charges the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—psychological safety in a post-virus world—is signaled early but remains abstract; no on-page beat tests Mara's commitment through competing goods or visible loss. Jorn's arrival with the ledger introduces a potential complication, but Mara's response ("We occlude") resolves it declaratively without a tightening choice or visible price. The storm and the ledger's threat never force a trade-off that narrows options. One micro-turn (Jorn's revelation) exists, but escalation under the Causal lens is minimal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Theme of truth-as-weapon emerges through the glass eye and ledger, but the final line—"The truth... could be a weapon—but only if you wielded it with care"—states the thesis rather than offering a resonant, non-literal answer. The orchard and truffles recur but function as setting more than charged motifs. Mara's insight ("We occlude... with truth") is asserted, not earned through specific prior struggle. No purposeful ambiguity or counter-reading complicates the resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and consistently filtered through Mara's perception. Dialogue with Jorn is functional and goal-driven but carries minimal subtext—his paranoia and her reassurance proceed transparently. Diction remains consistent; no register drift or head-hopping. The perceptual signature is serviceable but not character-particular—Mara's way of noticing (methodical grace, rational forager) is labeled more than enacted through specific syntax or rhythm. Free indirect style is clean; no filter-verb stacks or template cadence in peak beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Prose is clear and propulsive with varied sentence openings and paragraph lengths. Minor scaffold appears in adjacent lines: "Mara listened, her mind racing" followed immediately by "They reached the hut" elides the walk without compression signal. Stock phrases cluster in the Jorn encounter ("eyes were wild," "voice trembling," "heart sinking") but do not obscure causality. No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs. Information density is moderate; the ledger reveal and final exchange could be tighter. Opening and closing lines are serviceable but not charged.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The core premise—empathy virus, truth-sickness, glass eye relic—stitches multiple speculative tropes without transforming them through specific, grounded choices. The "rational truffle forager" cultivating psychological safety via infused herbs reads as quirky ornament rather than organic necessity. The ledger subplot (shadowy profiteers) is generic conspiracy material. The ending's declaration ("We occlude... with truth") gestures at paradox but retreats to abstraction rather than a bold, specific synthesis. Transformation test: the emotional arc (discover ledger, decide to act) would work unchanged with different names and setting.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Mara appears in every beat and makes decisions (to use the eye, to shelter Jorn, to "occlude with truth"), satisfying the setup and development gates. However, her choices feel scripted rather than pressured—no visible cost or friction accompanies the eye's use, and her final plan is declared rather than enacted. The "rational" trait is labeled but not dramatized through on-page problem-solving under constraint. She is present at closure but her decision does not transform prior material or foreclose a path. Swappable with a generic "cautious healer" archetype with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The glass eye is introduced early (first third), handled twice (carried in pocket, slipped into eye socket), and returns at closure (its milky surface reflecting lamplight). Its property—making bearers involuntarily truthful—is used functionally in the Jorn scene to elicit confession. However, the eye's mechanics are asserted rather than tested with cost, and its presence in the final image is ornamental (reflection) rather than causally active. Removing it and replacing with a trust-building herb would require only minor edits to the Jorn dialogue. Specificity is moderate; reprise reweights meaning only slightly.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The "smuggled relic" concept is present (glass eye passed by a vanishing historian) and mentioned early, but it shapes atmosphere more than stakes. The eye's smuggled origin does not constrain Mara's choices or create on-page danger—no pursuit, no scarcity, no trade-off tied to its illicit status. The ledger subplot introduces a second "smuggled" element (forbidden knowledge) but does not link causally to the relic concept. Closure participation is thematic (relic-as-tool) rather than mechanical. Could be replaced with "rare artifact" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The "involuntarily truthful" attribute is assigned to the glass eye's effect on others (Jorn speaks freely) but not dramatized as a constraint or cost on Mara herself. The trait is introduced mid-story (second third) and used once in the Jorn scene without visible friction or trade-off. No on-page moment shows Mara struggling with unwanted honesty or paying a price for eliciting truth. Label-only mention; swappable with "calming presence" or generic trust-building. Missing setup gate (not assigned to Mara by end of first third); present at development but ornamentally.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Occlude" appears as a thematic verb (the historian claims the eye can "occlude the truth") and is reprised in Mara's final declaration ("We occlude... with truth"). However, the action itself—what it means to occlude in practice—is never demonstrated on the page. Mara does not perform occlusion; she enables transparency (Jorn's confession). The word functions as conceptual gloss rather than enacted choice. Closure participation is verbal (Mara says "We occlude") but not causal. Removing the word and replacing with "reveal" or "harness" would alter tone but not plot structure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>The method—"rumored cures in discredited textbooks"—is signaled early (Mara has learned to harness the eye's properties through these texts) and mentioned twice (library discovery, notes in the oak's hollow). However, the mechanics never matter on the page; Mara does not consult the texts, test a cure, or face a choice shaped by their dubious authority. The method is backstory that primes atmosphere but does not constrain present action. Missing development gate (does not enable or complicate a middle choice). Present at setup and referenced at closure (notes) but functionally inert.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The hanging orchard in the ravine is vividly described and present in the opening, transition, and closing reference ("The orchard would wait"). The storm is signaled as pressure ("battered by storms," "another storm rolled in") and arrives on cue, but it does not alter Mara's tactics—she reaches the oak and then the hut without storm-driven friction. The ravine's verticality and the orchard's chandelier image are atmospheric but do not constrain movement or supply resources. Micro-setting (the hut) anchors the final scene but does not charge the closure image. Two gates (setup, closure mention); development is ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The timeframe—"after the empathy virus"—is established early and shapes world logic (lies curdle, emotions bleed into one another, psychological safety is scarce). The virus's effects pressure Mara's motivation and justify the truffles and glass eye. However, the "after" timeframe does not create urgency or tighten decisions in the present scene—no clock, no escalating symptoms, no trade-off tied to post-virus conditions. The virus is causal backstory that primes stakes but does not constrain present choices. Present at setup and development (Jorn's paranoia is virus-linked) and implicit at closure. Cost is conceptual (world-state) rather than tactical.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation—"to cultivate psychological safety"—is stated explicitly early and drives her truffle-selling and use of the glass eye. It is present at closure (her plan to "show them that safety... is a choice"). However, the motivation is never dramatized through friction between wants and costs—Mara does not face a choice where cultivating safety for one person harms another or forecloses her own security. The ledger subplot introduces a potential conflict (safety vs. truth-telling) but is resolved declaratively. Two gates (setup, closure); development is told rather than tested. Moderate causal role with minimal visible trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The tone "fractured grace" is signaled in the opening ("methodical grace," "chandelier of green") and modulates with the storm's arrival and Jorn's paranoia. Diction mixes lyricism ("lies curdled in the air") with grounded action, creating a tonal texture. However, the tone does not charge the final image—the closing lines ("a new kind of calm settled," "she felt hope") retreat to conventional warmth rather than sustaining fracture. Tone is present and coherent but does not reconfigure under pressure. Single static mood with slight modulation; does not elevate closure.</comment>
