<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lira's interiority is specific and consistent ("to understand why some houses feel alive"), and her micro-choices (placing objects, testing the orris root) reflect her motivations. However, the piece never dramatizes internal conflict or contradictory impulses; she moves through her theory-testing without genuine struggle or visible cost. The final "smile" and understanding feel like an epiphany awarded rather than earned through pressure. Embodied emotion is thin—most beats describe her actions externally rather than showing degraded perception or contradiction under stress.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece anchors "who" and "where" early (Lira, the bay) but delays the specific present action until mid-story, making the opening feel like extended setup. Drive lens reads as Accumulative: the displaced objects accrue meaning through association and the final glow/sanctification reweights the bay's "hush." The closure moment (the glow, houses feeling alive, Lira's smile) lands on the page and offers a Resonant Reconfiguration, but the cost is implied rather than visceral—no foreclosed path or felt sacrifice is visible. The "sanctification" feels more like a revelation than a choice with consequences.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The bay setting is evoked with selective detail ("streetlights daydreamed in their amber haze," water lapping at boots) and the orris root shard is handled twice (dock, then bay's edge). However, the setting mostly provides atmosphere rather than constraining choice—Lira could conduct her experiment anywhere quiet. The final image (houses pulsing with golden light, curtain twitch, porch light flicker) charges the ending but doesn't alter tactics or options. The "displaced objects" motif recurs but remains ornamental until the ending glow.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding why houses feel alive—is clear, but pressure never escalates; Lira arranges objects without opposition, uncertainty, or cost. The orris root experiment succeeds immediately with no reversal or complication. No tightening narrows options, no visible price is paid, and the protagonist's agency is passive observation rather than a choice under duress. The "sanctification" arrives as a granted result rather than an earned turn, leaving the piece feeling like a demonstration rather than a conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The theme of "hush as potential" and objects as anchors emerges through the orris root experiment and displaced-object motif, but the piece tells us the insight ("The hush wasn't emptiness; it was potential") rather than letting the ending image carry it non-literally. "Inadvertently profound" is named but not dramatized with cost. The final glow and sanctification lean toward overt symbolism without ambiguity or counter-reading. The thematic question is posed but answered too neatly, without the friction or complexity that would make it resonate beyond the immediate plot.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The voice is consistent and carries a distinct perceptual signature ("creeping normality noticer," "inadvertently profound"), and the prose maintains stable third-person limited POV throughout. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register that feels authorial rather than character-specific ("the ineffable," "inadvertently profound" as a phrase that "came to her in a dream" but reads imposed). No dialogue appears, so naturalism and subtext bullets are N/A. Psychic distance is controlled, but the piece withholds the orris root's significance in the opening beat solely to manufacture mystery, violating POV modesty.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The prose carries several patterned artifacts: "She'd [verb]" template openings cluster in the second paragraph, "not haunted, not merely old, but *vibrant*" uses italic emphasis as a crutch, and the phrase "inadvertently profound" is introduced as if coined by the character yet feels like prompt-speak. The final third contains paraphrase loops ("The bay held its breath" / "a hush fell"). Stock metaphors ("walls themselves breathed," "streetlights daydreamed") appear without fresh transformation. Sentence rhythm is often sluggish, with multiple filter verbs ("she'd recognized," "she wondered," "she felt") dulling immediacy. Information density is low; many lines restate setup without advancing pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The premise—using displaced objects to "fix" silence—offers a lyric concept, but the execution reads like a prompt-fulfillment exercise rather than a singular artistic vision. The "creeping normality noticer" and "perfumer's orris root" feel like externally assigned elements rather than organic discoveries. The final sanctification is visually familiar (golden light, pulsing houses) and the emotional arc follows a predictable "theory → test → success" template without surprise or transformation. No bold risk-taking or synthesis elevates the material beyond its constituent parts.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Lira as "creeping normality noticer" is present throughout and her observation habit frames the story, but her choices do not create key turns—she arranges objects and the sanctification simply occurs. Her role is investigator rather than decision-maker under pressure; no on-page choice alters tactics or forecloses a path. Setup and development gates are met, but closure participation is passive observation. Mid-band due to framing presence without decisive agency.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The orris root shard appears in three beats: found at the dock, brought to bay's edge, and glowing at the ending. Its property as a "fix" for scents is noted and applied metaphorically to silence, giving it some causal role. However, its mechanics are asserted rather than tested under pressure, and it could be replaced with any symbolic anchor object without structural loss. Setup, development, and payoff gates all present, but specificity and irreplaceability are low.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"A shard of hush" is echoed thematically ("fragments of hush," "the hush wasn't emptiness") but never constrains a choice or shapes tactics on the page. It remains an abstract concept rather than a story mechanism. Present as theme claim without pressure involvement; late reprise in the ending thought does not reweight prior stakes with cost. Ornamental use trends low.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Inadvertently profound" is introduced as a phrase Lira coined in a dream and applied to the orris root, but it functions as a label rather than a trait that constrains action. It does not enable or limit any on-page choice, and its presence reads like prompt-language inserted to fulfill the requirement. Mentioned twice without causal or tactical consequence; ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Sanctify" appears in the final third when the bay "became a sanctuary" and the houses "pulsed with a faint, golden light." It names the climactic effect but does not drive prior turns—Lira's actions lead to it, yet the sanctification itself is not a decision or action with cost. The element participates in closure but is more outcome than turn. Development and payoff gates present; setup absent. Mid-band for closure linkage without prior causal work.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Through displaced objects" is seeded early (teacup in a field, locket in a tree), developed in the middle beat (arranging key, doll's arm, marble, spoon), and pays off when the objects "trembled, as if awakening" and anchor the hush. The method shapes Lira's approach and is named as essential ("anchors, grounding the hush"). Setup, development, and payoff gates all met with some causal pressure, though the mechanics feel asserted rather than tested. Solid integration but not indispensable—other ritual methods could substitute.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The "quiet bay in spring" is named and evoked with selective sensory detail (water lapping, shore, amber streetlights) and chosen for its ability to "amplify the smallest sound—or the largest absence of it." However, it provides atmosphere rather than constraining choice or altering tactics. The houses lining the shore feature in the closure glow but do not pressure Lira's experiment. Setup and payoff present; development absent. Functional but replaceable with any quiet liminal space.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"While the streetlights daydream" appears as a poetic descriptor in two beats but does not function as a timeframe that tightens decisions. The action occurs at night, but no clock pressure or temporal urgency shapes Lira's moves—she works "slow and deliberate" without time constraint. The phrase reads as tonal flourish rather than a story mechanism. Ornamental mention without tactical consequence.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Lira's motivation "to understand why some houses feel alive" is stated early and frames her years of study and the present experiment. It drives her choice to bring the orris root to the bay and arrange the displaced objects, and the ending delivers the understanding she sought. However, the desire is never conflicted or tested with cost—she pursues it without friction, sacrifice, or competing wants. Setup, development, and payoff all present but with low dramatized tension. Mid-band for consistent framing without pressure friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Hushed blaze" as tone is evoked through quiet diction ("hush," "whisper," "still") paired with charged images (glowing shard, golden light, pulsing houses). The tone is coherent and modulates slightly at the sanctification moment, but "blaze" intensity is muted—the ending glow feels more reverent than incandescent. The tone supports the concept but does not charge the final image with undeniable pressure. Functional mood without decisive tonal turn.</comment>
