<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias's interior life consists largely of poetic yearning without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. His motivations—articulating unspoken needs through encoded messages—remain abstract; the story tells us he encodes for Lira and his brother but never shows him wrestling with competing desires or costs in real time. The gestures (kneeling, drawing, whispering) are present but lack embodied tension or self-contradiction. Emotional states are asserted ("smiled," "wondered") rather than dramatized through perception and micro-choice under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece anchors who/where/when early (balladeer, misty courtyard, between lightning and thunder). Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through repeated encoding gestures and the storm's arrival, with the final bluebell press serving as a charged image. However, no meaningful tightening occurs—each message is written without complication, and the storm passes without altering Elias's options or forcing a trade-off. The closure (walking away with the pressed bluebell, "a ghost smiled") offers a Resonant Reconfiguration, but the cost is implied rather than felt on the page; no prior action is foreclosed, no live tension resolved.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The misty courtyard, cobblestones, and storm details are vivid and consistent. Spatial choreography is clean (kneeling by the edge, charcoal against stone, plate beside him). However, the setting remains largely atmospheric; it does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters Elias's outcome. The flower press bolt plate is handled twice (rests beside him, slips and is picked up) but functions as a symbolic anchor rather than a tactical element that shapes a decision.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—articulating unspoken needs through encoded messages—is signaled early but never tested. Elias completes each message without obstacle, misunderstanding, or internal conflict; the ghost does not answer, and no consequence follows. The storm complicates atmosphere but does not narrow his options or force a trade-off. The flower press slip is a micro-beat, not a reversal. The ending offers a moment of poise (walking away, the ghost smiling) but no on-page cost or foreclosed path is legible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Theme—communication with the lost, the bridge between spoken and unspoken—emerges from the premise but remains largely asserted rather than earned through friction. The messages to Lira and the brother carry emotional content ("Do you remember?" "I forgive you") but are delivered as exposition rather than tested in scene. The final image (bluebell pressed, ghost smiling) gestures toward resonance but does not reweight prior material; the "unspoken needs" remain abstract. No counter-reading or complexity challenges the protagonist's certainty.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with consistent distance and no head-hopping. Diction ("tinkersong wonder," "driftingly alert") is purposeful and voice-driven, though occasionally elevated beyond Elias's embodied state. The prose carries a lyric texture that fits the tone. However, filter verbs ("believed," "wondered," "knew") appear frequently without adding subtext, and the narration occasionally tells emotional states ("smiled") rather than showing them through perception. No dialogue is present to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and the prose is largely clean, but several moments show decorative phrasing that stalls momentum: "his fingers moving faster now, the charcoal leaving trails like smoke" restates action without advancing pressure. The opening of multiple paragraphs with "The" or "Elias" creates template cadence. Figurative language ("mist curled," "sky flickered like a half-remembered dream") appears frequently in non-peak beats, sometimes blurring specificity. No major loops or causality breaks, but density could tighten by 15–20% without loss.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The premise—messages encoded in graffiti for a ghost—offers a fresh angle, but the execution leans on stock metaphors (spirals, constellations, lightning bolts) and does not transform the balladeer archetype through specific lived detail. The flower press bolt plate has potential but is used primarily as a symbolic anchor rather than a tool with unique constraints. The emotional arc (longing → encoding → walking away) could occur with different names and setting largely unchanged. No bold structural or perspectival risk elevates the material.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elias is present throughout and his encoding actions drive all beats, but his status as a "seldom-heard balladeer" does not constrain or enable a key turn. The trait is mentioned in the opening but never dramatized—he does not sing, hesitate to speak, or choose silence over voice in a way that shapes the outcome. His role as encoder could be filled by any lonely character.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The flower press bolt plate appears in setup (clutched in hand, rests beside him), is handled mid-scene (trembles in grip, slips and is picked up), and returns at closure (pressed with bluebell). However, it functions as a memory anchor and symbolic weight rather than a tool whose mechanics matter. Its presence does not constrain a choice or enable a tactic; Elias could encode without it. The closure reprise reweights it slightly (warm now, "as if the ghost had touched it") but the effect is lyric rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Ghost in code" is explained (spectral presence in stones, carries secrets) but never tested on the page. The ghost does not answer, resist, or alter Elias's options; it remains atmospheric. The concept is claimed thematically but does not change tactics or stakes—Elias encodes without friction, and the ghost's "smile" at the end is asserted, not earned through prior interaction. Swappable with "messages to the wind" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Driftingly alert" is applied twice to the mist ("driftingly alert, as if the world itself held its breath" and "the mist grew thicker, driftingly alert"). The trait is atmospheric and does not constrain or enable an action with cost. It could describe any attentive environment. No on-page tradeoff or choice hinges on this attribute; label-only.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Encoding is the method Elias uses across all beats: he draws spirals, constellations, lightning bolts, mirrors, and a lullaby. The action is present from early setup through closure (pressed bluebell as final encode). However, each encoding is completed without complication or cost; no message fails, is misunderstood, or forces a revision. The action structures the piece but does not redefine options or create a turn. Functional but not indispensable—another method (singing, writing) could substitute with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Graffiti art is specified early ("messages encoded in graffiti art, etched into the courtyard's ancient walls with a charcoal stick dipped in moonlight") and the mechanics matter across beats (symbols, spirals, constellations, lullaby etched). However, the medium does not constrain or shape attempts—Elias succeeds every time, and the rain threat (messages will fade) is mentioned but never tested. The method is present and consistent but not essential; another encoding medium would not alter the outcome.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The misty courtyard above clouds is anchored early and remains stable. The environment supplies atmosphere (mist, cobblestones, storm) and the courtyard's stones "hum" as if the ghost sings. However, the setting does not pressure a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome. Elias could encode elsewhere with minimal loss. The courtyard is vivid but largely postcard; no spatial constraint shapes his tactics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Between lightning and thunder" is mentioned twice (opening and mid-scene) and the storm arrives late ("the sky cracked open, rain hissing"). However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions—Elias completes all messages before the storm passes, and no clock forces prioritization or trade-off. The window is present but not tracked as a constraint. Functional mention without pressure; easily swappable with "at dusk" or "before dawn."</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The motivation to articulate unspoken needs is stated early and drives all encoding beats (messages for Lira, brother, himself). The final mirror symbol ("Speak, before the silence swallows you whole") and whispered "For you" gesture toward the motivation. However, the desire is told rather than tested—Elias never wrestles with competing wants, fears exposure, or pays a cost for articulating. The friction between need and silence is asserted but not dramatized in choices. Present in setup, middle, and closure but without visible tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Tinkersong wonder" is invoked in the opening and closing lines ("the air hummed with a tinkersong wonder" / "the tinkersong wonder of the courtyard lingering in his steps"). The tone is consistent—lyric, wistful, elevated—and modulates slightly with the storm's arrival (urgency, rain). However, the tone remains largely static; it does not charge the final image with pressure or shift under crisis. The reprise brackets the piece but does not reweight prior material. Coherent but not indispensable.</comment>
