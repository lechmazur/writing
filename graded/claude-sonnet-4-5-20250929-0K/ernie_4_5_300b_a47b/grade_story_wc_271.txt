<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lila's interiority shows embodied trauma (flinching at gate sounds, trembling hands) and micro-choices (pressing palm to stone, smoothing photograph). However, the trajectory relies on therapy-speak labels: "somatic markers," "PTSD," "quietly talented hands" become diagnostic rather than felt. The final moment—"her heart steady"—arrives without visible internal contradiction acting in scene; the shift reads more as therapeutic summary than earned struggle. Mrs. Voss functions primarily as exposition conduit rather than applying immediate pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors early (arboretum, Lila, post-bombing survivor). The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: sensory anchors (stone, lavender, salt) layer toward a final reweighting. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration—Lila moves from freezing at Elias's image to tucking it away steadily—but cost is asserted ("her heart steady") rather than shown through a constraining choice or forfeited path. The "pearl of stillness" remains abstract; no single action forecloses an option with legible price. Orientation Test penalty waived (anchors land by ~50 words), but closure cost remains oblique.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The arboretum setting supplies concrete sensory detail (wind-twisted pines, weathered stone bench, ocean roaring below) and the cliff/sea anchor the final image. The stone bench constrains Lila's kneeling posture and provides the somatic anchor that drives the scene's central action. Lavender in pocket recurs with tactile specificity. However, the lighthouse-keeper backstory adds atmospheric flavor without constraining choice; Mrs. Voss's journal ships are told, not pressuring present tactics. Setting charges the ending image but could deepen pressure in middle beats.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: Lila seeks stillness to counter PTSD paralysis. Pressure accumulates through sensory layering (stone, lavender, gulls) but lacks a live tightening that narrows options. The wind-gust flinch is a micro turn, yet Lila's recovery via anchors feels rehearsed rather than costly. Mrs. Voss's arrival and advice offer comfort without opposition. The ending claims agency ("I want to anchor optimism") but the choice to tuck away the photo carries no visible forfeiture—no rejected path, no trade-off. Cost is felt thematically but not dramatized as a foreclosed option.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Theme—grounding trauma in present reality—emerges through particulars (stone, salt, lavender) and the pearl-of-stillness motif. The final image of Lila walking home "light" with "the pearl of stillness cradled in her chest like a promise" attempts non-literal resonance. However, "anchor optimism in realism" is stated meta-thematically in dialogue, and Mrs. Voss's "you've already found your pearl" is an on-the-nose declaration. The thematic answer is told rather than shown in the final action; the photograph reprise shifts meaning but the insight is summarized ("love wasn't erased") rather than earned through scene pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited on Lila; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature filters setting through trauma (flinching at gate rattle, "ears ringing, Elias's blood on her dress"). Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext in Mrs. Voss's gentle coaching. However, interiority occasionally slips into therapeutic register ("somatic markers," "anchor optimism in realism") that reads more clinical than embodied voice. The final paragraph's "terrible and tender" and "promise" lean slightly elevated for someone mid-recovery. Distance control is otherwise clean; psychic shifts serve emotional beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear with varied syntax and strong concrete detail (wind-twisted pines, salt-bleached roses, crumpled photograph edges). Rhythm modulates between Lila's stillness and the flashback's chaos. However, several scaffold/loop issues: "freeze" appears in three separate contexts (trauma response, somatic choice, emotional freeze at photo) without clear distinction; "pearl of stillness" recurs six times as label; "anchor" (verb/noun) loops across five beats. Minor template cadence in opening ("not just... but..."). These patterns dull momentum without obscuring causality. Information density is solid; no major clarity breaks.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The arboretum-as-healing-space premise is familiar; the trauma-survivor-seeks-stillness arc follows therapeutic recovery templates. Specificity in sensory anchors (lavender, stone texture, cliff setting) and the lighthouse-keeper frame add texture, but the emotional arc—PTSD survivor learns grounding technique, finds peace—reads conventional. The somatic-marker method is current therapeutic vernacular presented without transformation. Risk is low; the story commits to its premise but does not subvert or inflect it in a non-obvious way. Mrs. Voss's journal of passing ships offers a lyric detail but doesn't reshape the central trajectory.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Lila (drone strike wedding survivor) is present throughout and her grief drives the quest for stillness. The wedding-bombing backstory primes the PTSD flinch and photograph handling. However, her choices (kneeling, pressing palm, breathing, tucking photo) are responsive rather than creating key turns; Mrs. Voss's guidance and the sensory anchors do more causal work. Lila's final decision to "anchor optimism" is stated, not enacted through a trade-off. Two gates (setup, payoff) but middle development is thin on protagonist-driven reversal. Early signal +0.6, closure linkage +0.5, but low causal pressure −0.8, swappability (any trauma survivor could occupy this role) −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The crumpled photograph appears in three beats: intro (edges frayed, folded a thousand times), mid-scene (pulled from pocket, Lila glances at it), and ending (smoothed, no longer freezing, tucked back). Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.2 (final handling shows shift). The photo's physical state (creases) and Lila's evolving reaction (no longer freezing) track causally. However, the middle beat is observational; the photo doesn't constrain a choice, it illustrates internal state. Specificity (frayed edges, Elias's ring finger) adds texture. Swappability mild (any keepsake could serve) −0.4.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Pearl of stillness" is named five times but remains abstract metaphor. Mrs. Voss defines it in exposition; Lila seeks it as a goal; the ending claims she's found it ("cradled in her chest like a promise"). Setup +0.6, closure mention +0.4. However, it doesn't shape on-page tactics or choices—Lila's actions (pressing stone, breathing) are somatic grounding, not pearl-seeking. The concept is thematic label rather than a mechanism that alters options. Ornamental use −0.9, swappability (any metaphor for calm could replace it) −0.6, summary-only −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Quietly talented" appears once: "Lila's quietly talented hands—once steady for painting wedding invitations, now trembling from PTSD." Setup present +0.4, but this is label-only backstory. The attribute doesn't constrain or enable an on-page action; the trembling matters, but "talented" adds no cost or capability in scene. Lila's return to painting is mentioned in reflection but not dramatized. No middle development or closure participation. Ornamental −0.8, label-only −0.4, swappability (any skill descriptor could serve) −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Freeze" appears in trauma response (flinching, then returning via anchors), as somatic choice ("learned to freeze... from a deliberate, somatic choice"), and in the ending ("didn't freeze at the sight of Elias's smile"). Early signal +0.6, two functional beats +0.9 (flinch-recovery, photo non-freeze), closure linkage +0.9. The action tracks Lila's arc from involuntary paralysis to controlled stillness. However, the verb is overloaded across contexts (trauma symptom, therapeutic method, emotional reaction) without clear differentiation, muddling specificity. Causal pressure +0.6, but swappability moderate (other verbs—"pause," "hold"—could replace with edits) −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Somatic markers" are explained by Mrs. Voss early, then enacted: Lila presses palm to stone, feels roughness, scents salt and lavender, uses these anchors to counter the flinch. Setup +0.7, two beats (explanation, application during flinch) +0.9, closure mention +0.4 (lavender in pocket during final photo moment). The method shapes Lila's central tactic (grounding via body cues). However, Mrs. Voss delivers the mechanics in exposition; Lila's use is brief. The method enables rather than constrains, and the technique is current therapeutic vernacular presented without fictional transformation. Causal pressure +0.8, but summary-heavy explanation −0.4, swappability (any grounding technique) −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The arboretum on seaside cliff is anchored early (wind-twisted pines, stone paths, ocean roaring below) and supplies the stone bench (tactile anchor), cliff edge (visual/auditory pressure), and the lighthouse-keeper frame. Setup +0.8, present across all beats +1.4, closure linkage +0.8 (final image of Lila walking through arboretum). The setting provides resources (stone, salt air) that Lila uses for grounding, constraining her choice to kneel and press palm. Spatial choreography is clear. Specificity (abandoned since keeper left, mossy walls, iron gates) adds texture. However, the lighthouse backstory is atmospheric rather than tactical. Causal pressure +0.9.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"After the last lighthouse keeper retired" anchors historical context (arboretum abandoned, no lantern for sailors) but doesn't create time pressure. The timeframe is static backdrop; no clock or deadline tightens Lila's choices. Mrs. Voss's anecdote about watching ships adds thematic echo but no urgency. Present as setting flavor +0.3, but no middle development or closure participation. Ornamental −0.9, swappable with any "post-event" frame −0.6, no tactical constraint −0.7. The story could occur at any point post-bombing with identical beats.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Anchor optimism in realism" is Lila's stated goal in dialogue and closing reflection. Setup via her therapy journey and Mrs. Voss's teaching +0.6, closure explicit statement +0.7 ("I want to anchor optimism in realism"). The motivation is dramatized through Lila's kneeling, grounding practice, and photo-handling; she tests whether she can hold grief without crumbling. However, the phrasing is meta-thematic rather than embodied want, and the friction between optimism and realism is told more than shown in conflicting micro-choices. Causal pressure moderate +0.5, but summary-heavy −0.4, label-speak −0.3.</comment>
