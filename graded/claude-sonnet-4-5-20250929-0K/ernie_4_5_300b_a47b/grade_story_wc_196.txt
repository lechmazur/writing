<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias is grounded in embodied detail (breath catching, heart stuttering) and his archivist's lens shapes perception throughout. The opening backstory block (~15%) anchors in present dust patterns and primes his magnifying impulse at closure. Internal contradiction is thin—his hopeful belief never meets meaningful resistance—and the final act (opening a fresh folder, beginning to write) feels more like documentation than a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. The button-handling beats show micro-choices, but they don't narrow options or force a trade-off.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story seeds pattern (dust, button, gaps in records) and accumulates evidence toward the final reweighting. Orientation is clean (who/where/when by ~80 words). Closure reads as Conceptual Repricing—Elias recognizes the button as a token of intergenerational loss and opens "Unknown Histories"—but the cost is conceptual only, not felt or visible on the page. The final beat ("he knew enough to magnify the small kindnesses hidden in the gaps") states theme rather than dramatizing a forfeiture or stance crystallization. One meaningful deepening occurs (the date on the button recontextualizes the boy's story), satisfying minimum escalation, but the ending lands as thematic echo rather than a choice with undeniable pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The file room is vividly anchored (mildew, bowing shelves, creaking wood) and filtered through Elias's archivist expertise. Dust patterns function as micro-setting: the disturbed circle constrains his inference and charges his imaginative reconstruction. The button's brass surface and regimental crest supply tactile, visual specificity. Sensory selection reflects his professional lens (ink bleed, corner curl, dust settlement). The environment enables his detective work and the final image of opening a fresh folder uses the room's materials, meeting the Q3 9+ gate's constraint test.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: recover the story behind the button and honor the forgotten child. The date reveal (April 12, 1865) is a meaningful deepening that reweights the boy's history and Elias's understanding. However, escalation is accretive rather than constricting—no reversal narrows Elias's options or forces a trade-off. The final act (labeling a new folder, beginning to write) is generative, not renunciatory, and no visible price is paid; he gains insight without forfeiting an alternative or enduring a cost. Agency is present but unfolds as discovery, not decision under pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme—intergenerational erasure, the archive as witness, small acts of recovery—emerges through the button's layered history and Elias's method. The final image ("Unknown Histories: The Button") offers a non-literal answer: cataloging absence is itself a form of care. However, the last two sentences tip into direct thematic statement ("he knew enough to magnify the small kindnesses") rather than letting the scene image carry resonance. Subtext operates in the dust patterns and the button's date, but the ending articulates rather than enacts the theme, lowering the score from high-7 range.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Single-POV narration is stable and closely filtered through Elias's archivist expertise: "the language of neglect," "the way ink bled through paper over time." Perceptual signature is distinct—he reads grime patterns, imagines hands in dust smudges—and vocabulary (emancipation, regimental crest, methodically unfurl) fits his autodidact register. Psychic distance tightens during the button examination and loosens for the imaginative leap ("he imagined a soldier…"). No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks. The prose rhythms modulate with discovery beats, and interior voice remains consistent under mild pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Clarity and momentum are strong; sensory detail is woven through action. Minor scaffold appears: "He'd spent decades here" → "after the emancipation had freed him" is a nested aside that momentarily stalls the opener. The phrase "he felt a flicker of something tactfully hopeful" uses adverbial "tactfully" awkwardly (trait as modifier rather than action). Two instances of "he imagined" in the penultimate paragraph create light synonym churn. Information density is high in the button-examination beats. No loops touch closure, and figurative language (silent tombs, forgotten keepsakes) is moderate and apt, so deductions remain modest.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The premise—archivist decoding a child's history through a Civil War button—synthesizes period detail (emancipation, infantryman's crest, foster care records) with procedural detection. Elias's method (reading dust patterns, imagining touch-traces) is specific and fresh. However, the emotional arc—lonely scholar finds meaning in honoring the forgotten—is familiar, and the resolution (opening a new folder, beginning to write) is a low-stakes affirmation rather than a bold or risky turn. The transformation test is mixed: the core arc could transfer to other objects and eras with moderate edits, but the dust-pattern methodology and 1873 timeframe add specificity that resists full genericization.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias (broken-hearted archivist) is present throughout and his professional lens shapes all perception. He makes micro-choices (pulling the folder, examining the button under magnification, opening a fresh folder at the end), meeting the middle-development gate. The final act—labeling "Unknown Histories: The Button" and beginning to write—is tied to his role, satisfying closure participation. However, the choices are additive (cataloging, imagining) rather than narrowing or costly. The "broken-hearted" modifier is mentioned once in backstory but does not constrain later action or create visible friction. Setup, development, and payoff gates are met, eligible for mid-band, but causal pressure and cost are thin, capping score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The button (infantryman's button) anchors three distinct beats: (1) falls from folder, (2) examined under magnifying glass for crest and date, (3) imagined in the hands of soldier and child, then returned to the desk as Elias writes. Setup is immediate (falls in paragraph 2), middle use includes the magnifying-glass inspection and date discovery, and closure links it to the new folder label. The button enables the causal chain (date → reweighting of John Doe's timeline) and charges the final image. Specificity is high (brass, regimental crest, April 12, 1865). All three gates met; causal pressure and closure linkage push it into the 7+ range, though it does not foreclose a path or impose visible cost, keeping it below 8.5.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Unknown histories (core concept) is seeded in paragraph 1 ("gaps in records where lives had been erased") and recurs throughout: "absence could be a kind of clue," John Doe's sparse file, the final folder label. The concept shapes Elias's stake (recovering the lost story) and tactics (reading dust, imagining touch). Middle development is present (the sparse file and absent button-mention drive his inference), and the ending folder title ("Unknown Histories: The Button") directly names and crystallizes the concept. All three gates met, eligible for mid-6s. However, the concept is more thematic frame than a constraint that narrows options or imposes cost, and the final beat states it rather than dramatizing a tradeoff, capping score near 6.1.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Tactfully hopeful (attribute) appears once in paragraph 1 ("a flicker of something tactfully hopeful") as interior label. It does not recur or visibly shape an on-page choice. The trait is told, not shown through action, and no cost or friction is tied to it. Setup gate is met (present early), but middle-development and closure-participation gates are missing. Late-appearance and ornamental-use penalties do not apply since it is seeded early, but absence from middle and ending caps it below 5.0. The label reads as authorial descriptor rather than character-specific constraint.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Unfurl (action) appears in paragraph 5: "He began to unfurl the story, methodically, through accumulated dust patterns." The verb names the method and links to the dominant stake. However, it is summary label rather than a distinct dramatized beat—no step-by-step unfolding is shown on the page, only the result (noticing the dust circle, imagining the waiting figure). The action does not create a turn; it describes Elias's ongoing detective work. Setup and middle-development gates are met (seeded and tied to inference), but the action is swappable (decode, reconstruct, trace would fit with minor edits) and does not drive closure causally, capping it in mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Through accumulated dust patterns (method) is seeded early (paragraph 1: "faint, irregular pattern in the grime") and returns in paragraph 5 ("began to unfurl the story, methodically, through accumulated dust patterns") and the disturbed dust circle. The method enables one causal beat: the circle and smudges let Elias infer someone sat there holding the button. Setup and middle-development gates are met; the method reappears at closure indirectly (the final folder honors the method's yield). The mechanics matter once (circle = waiting figure), but do not constrain multiple choices or shape the final image directly, placing it in low-6s. Lyric-resonance allowance (seed → reprise) applies, lifting it slightly above 6.0.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Foster care file room (setting) is vividly established (mildew, bowing shelves, cardboard boxes) and supplies the materials for Elias's work: folders, desk, magnifying glass, dust. The room's archive function pressures his professional identity and the shelf above the folder provides the dust-circle clue. Setup and middle-development gates are met; the room is present at closure (he sets the button on the desk, opens a fresh folder). The micro-setting (desk, dust, folder) constrains his method and charges the ending image. All three gates met; the setting alters tactics (he reads dust, handles folders) and supplies resources, pushing it near 7.0. Lacks irreplaceability (another archive would serve similarly), capping it at 6.9.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>After the emancipation (timeframe) is mentioned in paragraph 1 ("after the emancipation had freed him") as backstory and returns via the button's date (April 12, 1865, "The day the emancipation was signed"). The timeframe contextualizes Elias's identity and the button's history, meeting setup and middle-development gates. The date discovery reweights the boy's timeline (admitted 1873, eight years after). However, the timeframe does not tighten a decision or create a live clock; it supplies historical context rather than pressure. Closure participation is indirect (the date informs Elias's imagining, which leads to the new folder), so the payoff gate is weak. Two of three gates met, eligible for mid-5s; lacks causal constraint or cost.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>To magnify small kindnesses (motivation) is stated in paragraph 1 ("a belief that even the smallest marks left by the lost might hold stories worth telling") and returns in the penultimate paragraph ("he didn't know the full story—not yet—but he knew enough to magnify the small kindnesses hidden in the gaps"). The motivation drives Elias's stake (honoring the button-holder) and the final act (opening "Unknown Histories"). Setup and closure-participation gates are met. Middle development is present (he pursues the button's story throughout). However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants, and no visible cost or friction is tied to it. All three gates met, eligible for mid-6s, but lack of embodied conflict or trade-off caps it at 6.4.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Examined unknown (tone) is coherent: quiet, reflective, forensic curiosity dominates. The tone modulates slightly—breath catches, heart stutters during discovery beats—but remains contemplative throughout. The final image (opening a folder, "his heart full") sustains the examined-unknown frame: wonder at the recoverable trace. Setup is immediate (running a finger along the folder, noticing the pattern), middle development includes the button examination, and the ending's thematic statement embodies the tone. All three gates met. The tone charges the final image (curiosity rewarded by small revelation), pushing it above 6.0, but the static mood and lack of tonal tension or surprise keep it below 7.0.</comment>
