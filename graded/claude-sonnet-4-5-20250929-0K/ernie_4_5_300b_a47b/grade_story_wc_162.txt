<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lira's journey from fugitive to cartographer shows embodied stakes through grain-reading and code-deciphering, but her emotional progression feels overly composed. The final reunion with her father lacks contradictory impulses—relief and regret are stated rather than enacted through resistance or cost. "Featherly determined" appears as a label without constraining a choice. The protagonist's competence (analyzing grain, reading codes) never degrades under stress or leads to a costly mistake that compounds before resolution.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (grain patterns, prisms, codes layering toward threshold-crossing). Orientation anchors arrive late—we learn Lira's age and backstory only after the opening image. The closure unit (stepping through the light-door, meeting father, walking with new codes) offers a Resonant Reconfiguration, but the cost is asserted ("featherly determined," "didn't look back") rather than shown through forfeited options or visible loss. The butterfly-effect premise is told in abstract terms mid-story without altering on-page tactics.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The drifting prism terrace and cornfield maze are vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (kaleidoscopic shadows, groaning wood, hum through floorboards). The prisms shift to reveal a path, directly enabling Lira's descent—setting constrains and guides choice. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from terrace to spiral staircase to clearing. Grain analysis and the logbook anchor micro-setting, charging the final image when she writes her own codes at the field's edge.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—understanding why thresholds feel sacred—is signaled early and sustained. One tightening occurs when the prisms align to reveal the hidden path, but this feels coincidental rather than earned by Lira's prior choices. The light-door materializes after she writes in the logbook, offering a reversal, yet the father's appearance carries no visible friction or trade-off. The resolution hinges on Lira's decision to step through, but walking away from the terrace is narrated as effortless ("not fearless but featherly determined"), undercutting the sense of foreclosed paths or opportunity cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme of necessary distances and sacred thresholds emerges through the terrace, maze, and logbook codes rather than direct statement. The final image—Lira writing her own codes at the field's edge—offers a non-literal answer to the central question. However, late-paragraph philosophizing ("Distance is a kind of prayer," "Some thresholds...are sacred because they remind us how far we've come") edges toward moralizing. The butterfly-effect concept remains abstract and label-driven rather than embodied in on-page causality.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV remains stable with a lyric, image-dense voice. Perceptual signature (grain-reading, code interpretation) is character-specific. Dialogue with the father is minimal but functional. Register occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("cartographer of necessary distances," "mosaic of relief and regret") that feels authorial rather than filtered through a fourteen-year-old's idiom under pressure. Free indirect style is clean, though the final paragraphs slip toward summary rather than immediate perception.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Prose is image-rich and rhythmically varied, with strong opening and closing lines. However, density issues appear: "featherly determined" recurs as a phrase without evolving meaning; "sacred" and "threshold" loop across multiple paragraphs without added pressure. Template cadence in the middle section ("She followed...She opened...She stepped") flattens momentum. Mixed metaphor: "fractured hush that muffled even the wind" asks hush to both fracture and muffle, straining coherence. The butterfly-effect explanation mid-story reads as exposition rather than discovery woven through action.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The drifting prism terrace and grain-reading architect's child offer fresh specificity, and the logbook codes as inherited language show care. However, the core arc—lost child returns, solves father's riddle, crosses threshold to reunion—follows a familiar template. The butterfly-effect framing and "sacred thresholds" phrasing feel prompt-derived rather than organically discovered. Emotional honesty is present but lacks the bold risk or non-obvious synthesis that would elevate originality. The premise transforms modestly through the grain-analysis method, but the resolution's ease undercuts stakes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Lira (architect's lost child) is present throughout and makes key choices: descending the terrace, following the grain, writing in the logbook, stepping through the light-door. Setup is immediate, development spans the middle beats (analyzing grain, deciphering codes), and payoff occurs when she crosses the threshold. However, many turns feel triggered by coincidence (prisms aligning, door materializing) rather than solely by her decisions. Her grain-reading constrains her path, but the father's appearance and the ease of crossing reduce her agency at closure. Score: functional across beats with moderate causal pressure, but swappable protagonist type (resourceful lost child) and convenience plotting limit indispensability.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The pilot logbook appears early, is handled in multiple beats (reading codes, flipping to Thresholds page, writing her own codes at the end), and its reweighted meaning at closure (from father's weather language to Lira's personal codes) charges the final image. Setup is strong, development includes interpretation that shapes her understanding of the maze, and payoff occurs when she authors her own entries. Cost connection is present but mild—writing codes does not visibly foreclose an option. The object is essential but not fully indispensable; a similar artifact (map, journal) could serve with edits. Score: essential across beats and ending, with a charged reprise, but not irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Necessary distances" is named early ("cartographer of necessary distances") and recurs in the father's dialogue ("Sometimes you have to walk away to see how close you are") and Lira's final code ("Distance is a kind of prayer"). However, it operates primarily as theme rather than shaping on-page stakes or tactics. Lira's physical journey through the maze and across the terrace does not dramatize a choice between proximity and separation with visible cost. The concept is told and reflected upon rather than constraining options. Score: present and thematically consistent, but ornamental to causality; swappable with similar abstractions.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Featherly determined" appears twice as a descriptor of Lira's resolve: once describing a knot's edges ("featherly determined, like the resolve in her own chest") and once at the threshold crossing ("not fearless but featherly determined"). It functions as a label rather than constraining or enabling action with cost. No on-page moment shows this trait forcing a trade-off or shaping her tactics under pressure. Setup is present (first third), but development and payoff are missing—no middle choice is altered by this attribute, and the final crossing does not hinge on it. Score: ornamental mention without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Intuition appears explicitly ("Intuition prickled her neck") when the prisms reveal the hidden path, prompting her to consult the logbook. It recurs implicitly when she trusts the grain patterns over the visible path and later when she writes the new code ("I analyzed the grain"). Setup is mid-story, development includes following the grain to the clearing, and payoff occurs when intuition-led analysis enables the door to materialize. However, "intuit" is partly swappable with "observe" or "deduce"—the mechanics are not unique to intuition versus other cognitive actions. The trait shapes one key turn (path revelation) and contributes to closure, but is not indispensable. Score: shapes one key turn and contributes to ending, but replaceable with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Analyzing the grain appears twice: Lira kneels on the terrace to read grain patterns ("a method her father had used to divine weaknesses in beams") and later follows grain patterns in the cornfield ("she saw the patterns—the way stalks bent like compass needles"). Her father confirms she "analyzed the grain" to find the code. Setup occurs in the first third, development includes using grain-reading to navigate the cornfield, and payoff is acknowledged at the reunion. The method enables key moves but is not mechanically specified—how grain spirals reveal thresholds remains abstract. Cost is absent; grain-reading never misleads or imposes a price. Score: functional and causal in one beat, contributes to ending acknowledgment, but mechanics are vague and it could be replaced with "followed the pattern" or "trusted her instinct" with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The drifting prism terrace is present from the opening line, handled physically (Lira presses her palm against the railing, kneels to analyze the grain, descends the spiral staircase), and its prisms shift to reveal the hidden path—a direct constraint on choice. Setup is immediate, development includes the hum and alignment that guide her descent, and payoff occurs when the terrace drifts away after she crosses the threshold, never to be revisited. The setting pressures movement and supplies the crucial path revelation. However, the mechanics of why prisms align at that moment feel coincidental rather than tied to Lira's action. Score: essential across beats and ending, pressures choices, but some causal passivity.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"After the butterfly effect" appears in the title/framing and is explained mid-story ("After the maze's completion, after the first child got lost...the terrace had begun to drift"). The timeframe is static—no ticking clock or time pressure alters Lira's decisions. The piece does not track elapsed time or use temporal constraints to tighten tactics. The butterfly-effect premise is told rather than demonstrated through cascading consequences on the page. Setup is conceptual (backstory), development is absent (no middle choice shaped by time), and payoff does not engage the timeframe. Score: ornamental; present in exposition but does not constrain on-page action.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The motivation—to discover why some thresholds feel sacred—is stated in Lira's reflection on her father's notes ("Sacred spaces are not places but gaps") and implicit in her quest to understand the terrace and maze. Setup occurs early (logbook and maze mystery), development includes her realization about codes mapping thresholds, and payoff lands when she writes her final code acknowledging thresholds' sacredness. However, the motivation is more told than dramatized through conflicted choices. Lira's desire does not collide with a competing want or cost on the page—she pursues understanding without friction. The final insight ("Some thresholds...are sacred because they remind us how far we've come") is reflective rather than enacted. Score: shapes one key turn (realizing codes are about change) and contributes to ending reflection, but lacks on-page friction between wants and costs.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Fractured hush" appears in the opening line ("glass panels refracting light into a fractured hush that muffled even the wind") and returns in the closing paragraph ("the hush remained—a fractured, lingering silence that felt like home"). The tone is lyric, image-dense, and quiet, modulating with pressure (tension during the maze navigation, release at the reunion). However, the tone occasionally drifts into abstraction ("cartographer of necessary distances," "mosaic of relief and regret") that feels decorative rather than pressured. The reprise of "fractured hush" at the end reweights the opening image, charging closure. Coherence holds across turns. Score: purposeful early seed with a charged final reprise that reweights the stake; tone modulates with pressure and contributes to the ending image.</comment>
