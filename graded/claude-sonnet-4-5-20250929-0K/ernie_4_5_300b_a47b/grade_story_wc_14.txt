<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Althea's interiority is almost entirely abstract exposition about invented histories and time-collecting rather than embodied choices under pressure. The dominant emotional register is label-only ("earnestly studious," "trembled," "smiled") without contradictory impulses acting in scene. The moment when the lamp's hum syncs with her breathing could generate tension, but she simply writes more stories without forfeiting anything or facing a dramatized cost. No genuine internal conflict or decision that narrows options appears on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed: who she is and what she does remain vague through the first third, with "gilded-leaf stationer" unexplained and no spatial anchor until the lamp appears. The drive lens reads as accumulative/textural, but no meaningful tightening or deepening occurs—Althea collects textures, then collects more textures, with no causal linkage or escalation. The ending offers no decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing; she simply continues her routine with townsfolk approval mentioned in summary. No visible or felt cost lands on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The bonsai labyrinth is described with vivid sensory detail (moss-cushioned bench, mineral-rich soil, shimmering leaves), but it functions as backdrop rather than constraint. The fluorescent lamp appears in multiple beats and its hum is central, qualifying as a micro-setting object. However, the labyrinth's spatial choreography is vague—no sense of how far she moves or what adjacencies matter—and the environment never pressures a choice or alters tactics at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The stated stake is "to collect the textures of different times," but this remains abstract and unchallenged throughout. No opposition, cost, or reversal appears; Althea sits, writes, and succeeds without friction. The lamp-hum moment briefly suggests something unusual, but she simply writes faster without forfeiting anything or narrowing options. The ending summary—townsfolk now respect her—is told rather than dramatized and introduces no visible price or trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Theme is asserted rather than emerged: "bridges, connecting the past, present, and future" and "guardian of memories" are stated directly in narration. The invented-histories concept could generate rich subtext, but it remains decorative—no moral calculus, earned insight, or non-obvious complexity appears. The final image (notepad growing thicker) is literal rather than resonant, and the phrase "incandescent restraint" in the last line reads as prompt echo rather than earned conclusion. Pseudo-profundity in "tapestry of light and shadow" lowers the score further.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Single third-person POV is stable with no head-hopping. Diction occasionally elevates ("incandescent restraint," "earnestly studious") in ways that feel authorial rather than character-filtered. Free indirect style is clean, but perceptual signature is generic: Althea notices exactly what the prompt requires (bonsai, lamp, notepad) without idiosyncratic bias. Narrative distance is consistent but the voice lacks distinct texture—syntax and rhythm do not modulate under the lamp-hum pressure moment.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops appear: "collect the textures of different times" is restated multiple times without added pressure. Template cadence is visible in repeated "She would…" and "Each…" sentence openers across paragraphs three and four. Figurative language clusters without coherence: "symphony," "key to unlocking," "door to a realm," "bridges," "tapestry" stack in adjacent beats. The phrase "a torrent of invented histories that seemed to write themselves" is passive and contradicts prior "fervor." Clarity is adequate but density is low, with many scaffold sentences that restate rather than advance.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The core premise—character invents histories by listening to a lamp—offers a mildly fresh angle, but execution is generic: the bonsai labyrinth, dawn ritual, and townsfolk approval arc follow familiar template beats. The lamp's hum syncing with breathing could be distinctive, but it yields no transformation or earned turn. Emotional specificity is absent; the arc could apply to any solitary artist figure with surface details swapped. No bold risk or non-obvious synthesis appears.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Althea is present throughout but makes no on-page decision that alters tactics or forecloses a path. She observes, writes, and continues her routine without cost or reversal. Late first mention of townsfolk approval introduces no choice, only summary validation. Ornamental protagonist; swappable with any solitary artist archetype.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The notepad appears in beat one (setup), is handled in the lamp-hum scene (development), and returns in the final image growing thicker (payoff). However, its "patchwork of parchment, graph paper, and banknotes glued with violet paste" details never constrain a choice or cost—any notebook would serve the same function. The ending reprise reweights slightly (testament to persistence) but carries no dramatized cost. Two-gate solid use, but swappable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Invented histories" is present as theme and description throughout, but it remains abstract. Althea writes fictional explorers and lost cities, yet none of these inventions shape a tactic, create friction, or generate cost on the page. The concept is told and restated rather than dramatized as a stake with pressure. Functional presence without causal work or closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Earnestly studious" is labeled in paragraph one ("She was earnestly studious") but never constrains or enables an action. No trade-off or cost tied to this trait appears—she could be earnestly playful or earnestly skeptical without altering any beat. Label-only attribute without visible consequence.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Refract" appears once in a descriptive aside: "the way the mountain's mist refracted the sunlight." It does not drive a turn or decision; the lamp's hum, not refraction, is the active mechanism. The mist-refraction detail is ornamental scenery. Swappable with "filtered" or "scattered" without impact on escalation or closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Charting the lamp's hum is signaled early (paragraph three), repeated in the climactic beat (paragraph five), and mentioned again in the resolution (paragraph seven). The method shapes her attempts—she listens, charts variations, and writes in response. However, the mechanics remain vague (what does "chart" mean here?), and the hum never constrains a choice or imposes cost. Solid setup and development presence, but the method is passive observation rather than active pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The bonsai labyrinth is present from the opening and described with sensory detail (moss bench, shimmering leaves, mineral-rich soil). It frames the entire scene and appears in the final paragraph. However, it never pressures a choice or supplies a resource that alters outcome—Althea could perform the same actions in any quiet outdoor space. Setup and closure presence earn mid-band, but postcard function without tactical constraint or cost linkage.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"After the town goes silent" is stated in the opening and "each dawn" establishes a repeating timeframe, but no clock tightens decisions. The story spans days in summary ("In the days that followed") without tracking elapsed time or using deadlines to shape tactics. Functional framing but no pressure or cost tied to the temporal window. Late summary expansion weakens integration further.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>"To collect the textures of different times" is stated as motivation in paragraph two and restated multiple times, but it remains abstract. No friction between this want and a competing cost or fear appears—she collects textures, succeeds, and is validated. Told-only desire without dramatized choice, obstacle, or trade-off. Setup present, development absent, closure mention is summary.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.3</grade><comment>"Incandescent restraint" is declared in the final paragraph but not embodied in the prose. The tone is consistently gentle and expository throughout; no modulation under the lamp-hum pressure moment (which should heighten intensity) occurs. The phrase reads as a prompt label rather than an earned tonal signature. Single static mood without coherence through turns or charge at closure.</comment>
