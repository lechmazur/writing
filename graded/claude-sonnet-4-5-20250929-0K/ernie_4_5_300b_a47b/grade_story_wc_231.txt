<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias shows some interior specificity (the nest of silver and seaweed beard, his eccentric habits), but his core motivation—borrowed memories—remains abstract and exposition-heavy rather than embodied through contradictory impulses. The woman's grief over her daughter's stolen memories carries weight, yet her sudden appearance and instant confession flatten what could be a more gradual reveal earned through resistance. The final choice ("I'll return them") arrives without visible struggle or cost on the page; Elias simply declares his mission rather than dramatizing the renunciation or forfeiture that would anchor Earned Stasis. Backstory about his vanished wife and decades of study occupies substantial real estate without tilting a present micro-choice until the very end.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation is swift (who/where/when by the second sentence). The drive lens reads as Causal with Accumulative texture: the boutonnière clue → woman → hatch → trunk → journal forms a because/therefore chain, but the final beat—Elias's promise to "return them"—lacks on-page mechanics or visible cost; we don't see him begin the work or forfeit anything concrete to earn the closure image. The "borrowed memories" mechanism is told in summary ("a forbidden art") rather than dramatized through choice or constraint. The dawn-lift mist and "hope" tag feel like a thematic overlay rather than a pressure reconfiguration with felt consequence, landing closer to Resonant Reconfiguration but undercharging the cost proof test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The opal dock, bruise-purple sky, and nautical twilight anchor atmosphere early and recur (dock's mist parts, hatch beneath the dock, dawn glow). Sensory detail is vivid ("salt and mist that clung like cobwebs," "brine and old iron") and filtered through Elias's eccentric perception. However, the environment doesn't constrain a key choice—the hatch opens without struggle, the trunk's padlock "clicks" conveniently—so setting remains more postcard than pressure. The lighthouse as Elias's workspace is mentioned but never used as a resource or obstacle, missing the micro-setting integration that would lift this toward the 9-band gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—decode the boutonnière and recover stolen memories—is signaled early and pursued through investigation. One meaningful tightening occurs when the woman reveals the captain scuttled the Aurora and stole her memories, raising moral weight. Yet the escalation lacks a live constraint or visible price: Elias encounters no resistance (the woman cooperates immediately, the trunk opens on first try), and his final vow to "return them" doesn't narrow options or trade off a competing want on the page. Agency is present but not tested; coincidence (the woman waiting at the exact moment) complicates setup but doesn't force a difficult choice under pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Theme—isolation as carrying what isn't yours—emerges from Elias's line and the woman's loss, threading borrowed memories, guilt, and redemption. The Edelweiss shifts from confession token to "symbol… of hope," a purposeful reprise, though "hope" is told rather than shown through a charged image. The piece resists a tidy moral by keeping the captain's guilt unresolved (he's dead, his act irreversible), but the ending pivot to "a child's laughter waited to be reclaimed" veers toward soft sentimentality, diluting the complexity. Thematic statements ("redemption… had to be earned," "isolation isn't just about being alone") are direct rather than implicit, lowering subtext density at the closure beat.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Elias; psychic distance is controlled, and his eccentric filter (hymns to waves, gaps in time) colors perception consistently. Dialogue is sparse but functional: the woman's rasp and Elias's "softly persistent" replies carry subtext (her reluctance, his resolve). However, the woman's confession arrives in two long exposition blocks ("He borrowed mine… took my memories… scuttled her") that read more like report than goal-driven speech under pressure. Elias's interior voice leans toward lyric register ("frayed at the edges," "moth wings," "hand-me-down coat") which fits his eccentricity but occasionally drifts into elevated diction ("perceive," "residue, a gap in the fabric of time") that feels authorial rather than lived-in for a lighthouse keeper.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and imagery is dense ("bruise-purple sky," "nest of silver and seaweed," "brittle as moth wings"), but several lines loop or paraphrase: "borrowed memories—a phenomenon he'd studied for decades" is restated as "borrowed memories—a forbidden art" two paragraphs later; "Show me" / "She nodded, leading him" / "Inside, the air was thick" is clear but template-paced. The journal excerpt ("I can't live with the weight. I'll trade her pain for mine") lands as tell rather than discovery through action. Filter verbs cluster in high-pressure beats ("his focus was sharper," "he felt," "he knew") without voice motivation, dulling immediacy. No major artifacts touch the closure image, but cumulative scaffold and synonym churn (gaps, residue, phenomenon) in the middle third trigger baseline deductions in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The core premise—borrowed memories investigated by an eccentric keeper—echoes familiar speculative templates (memory trade, guilt displacement, detective with personal loss). The Edelweiss and opal dock add texture, but the emotional arc (lone investigator redeems a stranger's crime through selfless vow) follows a well-worn path without a fresh inflection or non-obvious moral calculus. The woman's instant cooperation and the conveniently unlocked trunk reduce surprise; no turn arises from Elias's prior blindness or a constraint he helped create. Derivative Premise Guardrail applies: the borrowed-memory mechanic and redemption-through-recovery structure match widely used writing prompts, and the story does not transform them through lived detail or a stance that feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elias (the eccentric lighthouse keeper) is present throughout, frames the investigation, and makes the final vow to return the memories. His eccentricity (seaweed beard, speaking to gulls) is shown early and his expertise in "borrowed memories" enables the plot. However, his key choices—approaching the woman, opening the trunk, promising to return the memories—lack on-page cost or constraint; he decides without visible struggle or trade-off. He shapes two beats (the dock encounter, the hatch discovery) and participates in closure, meeting Setup/Development/Payoff gates, but his agency doesn't narrow options with felt consequence, capping him in the mid-5s per the causal-pressure test.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The dried Edelweiss boutonnière is introduced in the opening paragraph (pinned to parchment, brittle as moth wings), held up in the confrontation with the woman ("He held up the boutonnière"), placed on the trunk as a closing gesture ("He placed the Edelweiss on the trunk"), and referenced in the final paragraph as "symbol… of hope." It seeds expectation early (+0.6), recurs across three beats (+1.1), and is physically handled twice, but its final reprise is told ("symbol… of hope") rather than shown through a charged image with cost. The object's properties (brittle, Edelweiss species tied to the captain's collar) matter, but removing it would not break the story's logic—the investigation could proceed via the parchment alone. Setup/Development/Payoff gates are met; causal pressure is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Borrowed memories is present as backstory (Elias's wife, the phenomenon he's studied), the woman's revelation (the captain took her memories), and Elias's final vow (to return them). It frames the investigation and provides the mystery's answer, meeting Setup and Payoff gates. However, the mechanics are told in summary ("a forbidden art," "the act had left a residue") rather than dramatized through a choice or constraint that narrows Elias's options on the page. The concept shapes the plot but doesn't alter tactics under pressure—no scene shows Elias navigating the cost of memory recovery or wrestling with the ethical calculus. Development gate is weak (the concept is revealed, not tested), and swappability is moderate (any mysterious transactional crime could substitute with minor edits).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Softly persistent" is applied once to Elias's reply ("softly persistent") and echoed in his measured steps and his final gentle insistence ("I'll return them"). It colors his approach but doesn't constrain or enable a choice with visible cost—he never faces a moment where being softly persistent forecloses a more forceful or passive option. The trait is label-only in its single mention and implied elsewhere through tone, but no on-page beat shows a trade-off (e.g., persistence delaying action, or softness allowing the woman to evade a harder question). Setup gate is met (signaled early in dialogue tag); Development and Payoff gates are weak. Swappable with "gently determined" or similar synonyms without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Investigate" is the action Elias names ("I'm here to investigate") and executes: he questions the woman, follows her to the hatch, examines the trunk and journal. It drives the middle sequence (hatch discovery, journal reading) and the final revelation (the captain's guilt, the woman's stolen memories). However, the investigation proceeds without resistance or detour—each step yields immediate cooperation and convenient access (woman confesses, lock clicks open)—so the action doesn't redefine options under pressure or force a tactical shift. Setup/Development/Payoff gates are met; causal pressure is present but not tested by constraint. Removing "investigate" would require reframing the scene, so it's essential but not irreplaceable with minor edits (e.g., "uncover" or "solve" could substitute).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"By observing gaps" is introduced as Elias's method ("He'd spent years observing gaps: the way a sailor's laugh didn't match his eyes") and applied in backstory, but it doesn't shape his on-page investigation. The woman's confession and the journal's scribbles are delivered as direct exposition rather than discovered through Elias noticing a mismatch or residue that alters his approach. Setup gate is met (method seeded early); Development gate is weak (the method is told, not used to constrain or enable a middle choice); Payoff gate is absent (the ending pivots on Elias's vow, not a final gap observation). The method is ornamental—describing Elias's expertise rather than driving tactics—and easily swappable with "by sensing echoes" or similar phrases.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The opal dock in mist is anchored in the opening paragraph (shimmering planks, salt and mist, bruise-purple sky, nautical twilight) and returns as the woman waits at its edge and the hatch is hidden beneath it. The mist "parts" to reveal the woman and "begins to lift" at closure, a purposeful reprise that reweights the atmosphere from obscurity to clarity. However, the dock doesn't constrain Elias's choices—he moves freely, the hatch opens without struggle, and the location could swap for any isolated pier or shore without structural loss. Setup/Development/Payoff gates are met (setting frames all beats and charges the final image); causal pressure is weak (postcard function). The micro-setting (body/tool) option isn't invoked; the dock remains environmental backdrop rather than tactical resource.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"At nautical twilight" is specified in the opening ("At nautical twilight, when the horizon blurred into a seamless gray") and closes with "the first light of dawn," bracketing the investigation in a single night. The timeframe sets mood (liminal hour, gray blur) but doesn't tighten decisions—Elias faces no clock pressure, and the investigation unfolds at a measured pace without urgency or deadline. Setup gate is met (time anchored early); Development gate is absent (no mid-scene moment where time narrows options); Payoff gate is weak (dawn arrives as thematic symbol, not a consequence of elapsed time). The timeframe is ornamental—marking atmosphere rather than constraining action—and swappable with "at dusk" or "in the fog" without structural impact.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Elias's motivation—to decode the stranger's final gesture (the boutonnière and date)—is established in the opening paragraph and drives his approach to the woman ("You're here for the memories"), his request ("Show me"), and his closing vow ("I'll return them"). The motivation is conflicted briefly when he says "I've carried enough," hinting at personal cost, but this friction isn't dramatized through a choice where decoding the gesture competes with self-protection or another want. Setup/Development/Payoff gates are met (motivation frames all beats and resolves at closure); however, the desire is told more than tested under pressure. Elias's curiosity never forces a trade-off (e.g., risking the woman's trust by pressing too hard, or abandoning the search to spare himself pain). Causal linkage is present; visible cost at closure is implied but not shown.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Witnessed isolation" is coherent through the piece: Elias alone on the dock, the woman hunched and hidden, the hatch as a sealed chamber, the final walk back to the lighthouse. Tone modulates from eerie stillness (opening mist, hollow boot echoes) to revelation (woman's rasp, journal's frantic scribbles) to tentative hope (mist lifting, dawn glow). The isolation is witnessed by Elias (he observes the woman's solitary grief, his own decades of carrying borrowed pain) and by the reader. Setup/Development/Payoff gates are met; the tone charges the final image (Elias walking back, still alone but now purposeful). However, the ending's shift to "hope" and "child's laughter waited to be reclaimed" softens the witnessed isolation into sentimentality, diluting the tonal cost. The tone shapes atmosphere and modulates with pressure but doesn't constrain a choice or foreclose a path with felt consequence, keeping it in the mid-6s.</comment>
