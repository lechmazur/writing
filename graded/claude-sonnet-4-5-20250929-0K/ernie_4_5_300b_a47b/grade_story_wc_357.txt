<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lira's interiority is largely observational rather than contradictory; she moves through the discovery without internal conflict or micro-choices that reveal competing values. The arrow-tip warming and her theorizing read as exposition rather than embodied pressure. The final "smile" and role-acceptance feel unearned—no visible cost forecloses a path, and the shift from seeking exploitation to guardianship lacks dramatized friction. Competence is unbalanced by struggle; she solves the mystery without mistake or trade-off.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who, where, and when by the opening paragraph. The drive lens reads as Causal-Accumulative Hybrid: the arrow tip guides her to the cavern, she inserts it, and the planet's resilience is revealed. Closure attempts Conceptual Repricing—"resilience comes from willingness to bend, to store, to echo"—but the cost is abstract and off-page; no visible forfeiture or tactical alteration follows the discovery. The "gathering of echoes" as living archive is told rather than dramatized with a felt price, and the protagonist's shift to guardian lacks on-page consequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Vivid sensory detail throughout: vine-woven glider, midair water spheres, bioluminescent lattice, gravel that "defies the looming inversion." The floating arches and inversion phenomenon constrain Lira's flight timing and tactics. The arrow tip's warmth and the pedestal socket provide micro-setting pressure at the closure beat, directly shaping the discovery moment. Spatial choreography is clear; the environment actively charges the final image of vines settling with gold leaves.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—discover the source of resilience—is signaled early. The gravity inversion functions as a ticking clock, but no on-page reversal narrows options or forces a trade-off; Lira reaches the cavern, inserts the tip, and the answer is given to her. The pedestal socket is a perfect fit with no cost, complication, or choice between competing goods. Agency at closure is reception rather than decision, and the shift to "guard the gathering" lacks dramatized price or foreclosed path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Theme of resilience through adaptive symbiosis emerges from the vines' growth response and the "gathering of echoes" conceit. The arrow tip's growth acceleration and the planet's storage capacity are specific rather than generic. However, the final paragraph moralizes openly: "resilience came from its willingness to bend, to store, to echo" and "she'd finally learned to listen" are thesis statements rather than resonant images. The "symphony" metaphor in the closing line is a restatement, not a fresh reprise that reweights prior material with cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Lira; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature shows her pilot's attention to water flow and vine behavior. Register occasionally drifts elevated—"symbiosis," "living archive," "cadence shift"—beyond plausible in-scene lexicon during peak discovery. The phrase "whirling silence" recurs but reads more as authorial motif than Lira's idiom. Free indirect style is generally clean, though the closing introspection ("to guard the gathering, to let the echoes grow") tilts abstract and summary rather than embodied choice under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies; opening lines anchor voice and stakes cleanly. Mid-story suffers minor scaffold: "The planet's name, *Vespera*, meant 'gathering of echoes' in the old tongue. Legends said…" is an expository patch. Paraphrase loop in final third: "The planet's resilience came from its willingness to bend" is restated as "to store, to echo" and then "a symphony." Template cadence in several beats: "She [verb]. The [noun] [verb]." Filter-verb stack in cavern scene not severe but present. No figurative muddle, and information density is generally high, but the explain-everything ending lowers propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Orchard planet with gravity inversion and vine-based ecosystem offers specific world detail. The arrow-tip-as-key and symbiosis reveal are logically consistent but feel derived from familiar science-fantasy templates: lost technology, planetary mystery, protagonist as lone discoverer. The shift from exploitation to guardianship is a standard trope arc without fresh inflection. Emotional specificity is limited; the "smile" and acceptance read generic rather than character-particular. No bold risk or non-obvious synthesis charges the closure; the premise executes competently but safely within genre conventions.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Lira is present throughout and her flight leads to the cavern. She makes the decision to insert the arrow tip, which triggers the discovery. However, that insertion is a simple fit with no complication, and her subsequent shift to guardian role is told rather than enacted with cost. Her choices advance the plot but do not create meaningful turns with trade-offs; she receives the answer rather than wrestling a problem.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The broken arrow tip appears in the opening paragraph, guides Lira via warmth and vibration in the middle, and is inserted into the pedestal socket at the climax, fusing with it. It constrains her path (dowsing-rod function) and is causally active at closure. Its growth-acceleration property is signaled early and ties to the planet's resilience. The tip is indispensable to the discovery beat, and its presence in her pocket at the end marks continuity, though the final reprise is brief.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Gathering of echoes" is named and glossed as "memories stored in arches" early, then restated at closure as "living archive" and "willingness to echo." It operates primarily as thematic label rather than shaping on-page stakes or tactics. The concept does not constrain choices or alter Lira's moves; it is the answer she discovers, not a force that pressures her. The ending explains it overtly rather than demonstrating its cost or mechanics in action.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Plant growth acceleration is attributed to the arrow tip's alloy in the opening and shown when vines coil and flare crimson as Lira approaches the arch. The rapid lattice formation and tower eruption after the tip is inserted demonstrate the trait on the page. However, the trait does not constrain or enable a protagonist choice with visible cost; it is an effect she observes rather than a tool she wields or a risk she navigates. The trait shapes setting spectacle but not decision-making.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Discovery is Lira's stated mission from the opening and the action that structures the narrative: she follows clues, reaches the cavern, and inserts the arrow tip to reveal the source. The major turn—understanding symbiosis—traces directly to this action. However, "discover" as verb is reception rather than active struggle; swapping it for "unlock" or "activate" would not require major structural change. The action drives the plot but lacks contested cost or tactical friction.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Navigating by water flow is signaled in the second paragraph and Lira follows the river to the massive arch. The method shapes her route and is visually present (midair spheres, liquid light at closure). However, the mechanics are not tested or constrained—she does not face a choice between water-guided and alternate paths, nor does the method impose cost or complication. It is a functional navigation cue that informs but does not pressure her attempts.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The orchard planet with floating arches is established in the opening line and pervades every beat: Lira flies among them, vines anchor in arch cracks, the massive arch houses the cavern, and the final image shows vines settling after inversion. The arches supply the pedestal, constrain Lira's landing site, and their root-storage capacity is the discovered resilience mechanism. The setting is causally active, indispensable to the closure, and the inversion phenomenon directly pressures her timing.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The one-hour gravity inversion is announced in the opening paragraph and creates urgency: "gravity began to waver," Lira lands and enters the cavern before inversion, then "gravity inverted…forever—or so it seemed," followed by "the inversion ended, gravity resettling with a thud." The timeframe tightens her window but is not tracked beat-by-beat, and the "forever" moment blurs the constraint rather than sharpening it. The clock pressures tactics but does not force a visible trade-off or choice under countdown.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Finding the source of resilience is Lira's explicit mission from the opening and drives her flight path, cavern entry, and arrow-tip insertion. The motivation is present and goal-directed. However, it is not dramatized with internal conflict or competing wants; Lira pursues discovery without friction between desire and cost. The shift from seeking a "machine to exploit" to "a truth to protect" is a tidy moral pivot told in summary rather than enacted through a choice with visible price.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Whirling silence" appears twice: once as "the whirling silence of the approach—no wind, no birds, just the hum of overstimulated plants" and again as "the silence still whirling around her" after the discovery. The tone is poetic but static; it does not modulate with pressure or charge the final image with fresh meaning. The phrase functions as atmospheric label rather than a tonal shift that reweights stakes. Coherence is present but without dynamic participation in escalation or closure.</comment>
