<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lirael's motivation to preserve hope is signaled early but her decision-making feels more passive curator than active agent—she follows Thalos's guidance rather than generating choices through internal contradiction. The "softly deliberate" trait appears as label without constraining action; her emotional embodiment defaults to generic gestures ("grip tightened," "eyes wet with tears"). The transformation at closure lacks visible personal cost; she restores hope through a discovered word rather than a renunciation or trade-off that alters her stance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes a Causal lens (dream-sharing causes hope to fray; comparing footage reveals the solution) but the closure beat relies on a late-revealed word "Bloom" that lacks causal groundwork—we don't see Lirael deduce or struggle toward it. The spiral symbol recurs but doesn't narrow options; Thalos provides both the second stone and the method, reducing protagonist agency at the decisive moment. Cost at closure is asserted ("gave it room to grow") rather than dramatized through a visible forfeiture or trade-off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The blooming library offers vivid details (petrified petals, glass dome, spider silk robes) but functions as backdrop rather than constraint. The river stone's gold veins pulse and rearrange, yet this property doesn't limit or enable a tactical choice—it's observed, not used. Spatial choreography remains clear; the 1987 footage superimposition is anchored. The pedestal-to-console shift provides a concrete anchor for the solution but doesn't pressure Lirael's access or method.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving hope's shape—is declared early but escalation depends on exposition (Thalos explaining metamorphosis) rather than protagonist trials. The one reversal (shadow as metamorphosis, not glitch) arrives via dialogue, not Lirael's agency under pressure. The final act solves via the correct word without a visible trade-off; no live option is foreclosed. Thalos hands Lirael the second stone and the insight, softening the causal pressure that should tighten her choices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Hope as a shapeless, fraying thing is a strong conceptual anchor, and the closing image of books rearranging into new titles offers a non-literal answer. However, the resolution leans on prompt language ("preserve the shape of hope," "room to grow") that echoes the setup without surprise. The shadow's hunger "not for destruction, but for definition" provides thematic specificity, but Lirael's final realization ("We did it. The past and present.") states the theme rather than letting the particulars resonate.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Lirael with clean focalization. Diction is elevated and consistent ("luminous with regret," "motes that settled") but occasionally drifts into abstract register ("diffuse," "metamorphosis") that feels more authorial than character-particular. Dialogue advances plot but Thalos's exposition dumps ("The dream-sharing network isn't just for sharing dreams. It's for sharing *time*.") read as mechanical info-delivery. Perceptual signature is generic; Lirael's noticing doesn't carry a distinctive filter beyond "sharp eyes."</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but figurative language clusters without building pressure: "coiled at the edge," "touch like starlight," "scattering into a million glowing motes" in rapid succession at closure. Paraphrase loop present: "The shadow is what's left" followed immediately by "So we need to… reshape it?" Minor template cadence in Thalos's exposition blocks ("It's a metamorphosis." / "Of hope." / "This stone was…"). No major loops or scaffolding, but peak beats lean on stock metaphor.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The dream-sharing premise and "shadow unbound" concept offer a fresh hook, but the execution follows a familiar mentor-guided revelation arc. The solution—a single word that reshapes hope—arrives without groundwork in Lirael's prior attempts or mistakes. The library-above-clouds and petrified-petal details provide texture but don't transform the underlying discover-the-key structure. Emotional beats (tears, warmth, smile) follow expected arcs without risk or surprise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Lirael is present throughout but her "sharp eyes" trait appears as label; her key choice (saying "Bloom") is prompted by Thalos rather than generated by her observation. She compares footage (mid-scene beat) and speaks the word (closure beat), meeting two gates, but the decisions feel externally guided.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The river stone appears in paragraph one, shifts to show a spiral (beat two), and Lirael holds twin stones at the climax (beat three), with the warmth cue at closure. It's handled across multiple beats and returns with reweighted meaning (key to shadow's origin), but the stone doesn't constrain—it's observed and held, not used to force a choice.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The shadow unbound drives the initial mystery (appears in dreams, whispers) and is the object of transformation at closure. It shapes the dominant stake but doesn't alter Lirael's tactical options on the page—she follows Thalos's method rather than confronting the shadow's properties directly. Present in setup, middle, and payoff, but role is more symbolic than causal.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Softly deliberate" is mentioned once in narration ("Her softly deliberate nature made her pause") but doesn't constrain or enable a choice with visible cost. Lirael pauses to research rather than alert the council, but this is told rather than dramatized as a trade-off between speed and thoroughness. Label-only.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Metamorphosis" is named by Thalos as the shadow's nature (beat one), drives the reframe from glitch to transformation (beat two), and the shadow's final twist into a spiral (closure beat) enacts it. The concept shapes the dominant turn and closure image; swapping for "change" or "evolution" would dilute specificity. Strong causal and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Comparing silent video footage is signaled early (Lirael spends the day doing it), used in the middle (she finds the blurred figure), and provides the method at closure (superimposing images to align the stones). Present across all three gates and shapes one key turn, but the method itself is straightforward—no friction or failed comparison dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The blooming library is vividly described (petrified petals, glass dome, shelves that hum) and frames the entire scene. It provides the archive and footage, but doesn't constrain Lirael's choices—she has access to everything she needs. The library's transformation at closure (books rearrange) is consequence, not pressure. Postcard function dominates.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"After dreams became shareable" sets the premise (day three noted) but the timeframe doesn't tighten decisions. Lirael works "for hours" without urgency; no clock pressures the choice to say the word or risk the shadow shattering. Present in setup but doesn't constrain middle or closure tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"To preserve the shape of hope" is stated as Lirael's job and drives her research rather than alerting the council. The motivation shapes the dominant stake and closure image (hope preserved, room to grow), but friction between want and cost is minimal—she succeeds without visible sacrifice. Desire is clear but not dramatized through competing goods or a renunciation.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Luminous regret" appears in Thalos's voice and the final image ("sharp eyes wet with tears," "gave it room to grow"). Tone modulates from mystery to revelation but remains consistently elevated and wistful. The regret element is more asserted ("luminous with regret") than embodied through loss or ambivalence at the closure beat. Coherent but static.</comment>
