<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's interiority relies heavily on labeled emotions ("curiosity overpowering caution") and stock embodiment ("breath caught," "throat tighten"). Her choice to accept the pearl lacks internal contradiction or visible cost—she hesitates briefly but no competing value is dramatized. The pilgrim is atmospheric but flat, existing primarily as a thematic mouthpiece. No micro-choices reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The story anchors who/where/when adequately early. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the cave's song shifts through intensifying descriptions toward a final reconfiguration. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the cave's song returns "steady and clear" but "changed," and Elara feels "unseen forces now")—however, the cost is asserted rather than shown through a forfeited option or visible consequence. The pilgrim's disappearance and the pearl's vanishing feel convenient rather than causally earned.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The crystal cave is vivid and consistent: quartz/obsidian walls, prismatic light, chimes, underground springs. The cave constrains Elara's choice by "magnifying everyday magic" and the crystals shatter during the climax, altering the space. The pearl's warmth and symbols are specific. Setting actively shapes the final image (the cave's changed song), meeting the 9+ test's constraint requirement, but the specificity doesn't deepen further under pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Elara's desire to magnify everyday magic and control the cave's unpredictability—is signaled early. However, escalation is weak: the pilgrim's arrival doesn't narrow her options through agency; she passively accepts the pearl and the transformation happens *to* her. The shattering crystals and the pilgrim's dissolution are spectacular but don't stem from Elara's decision. No visible price alters her tactics; the ending recounts a change without showing what she lost or chose to forfeit.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The theme of balance between control and chaos, brightness and darkness, emerges from the cave's unpredictability and the pilgrim's philosophy. The final image (the cave's changed song with an "unpredictable hum beneath") offers a non-literal answer. However, the pilgrim's late-paragraph moralizing ("brightness and darkness are twins. You cannot have one without the other") is an overt thematic statement that undercuts resonance, triggering a −0.6 deduction for sermonizing at closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Elara with consistent psychic distance. The prose has a distinct, slightly elevated register ("his voice was a rumble of distant thunder"). Dialogue feels somewhat mechanical and expository ("Unseen forces are fickle. They inhabit the spaces between..."), lacking subtext. The pilgrim's closing speech ("Remember: brightness and darkness are twins") reads as authorial rather than character-driven. Perceptual signature is present but not deeply character-specific.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and the prose is generally clear, but several artifacts lower the score: paraphrase loops ("the cave's songs had grown steadily unpredictable, their cadences warping into dissonance, as if unseen forces were tugging"), filter-verb stacks in the opening ("had foreseen," "had waited," "had made," "had grown"), and elevated metaphors during high-pressure beats ("his laughter echoing through the chaos") that drift from Elara's experiential frame. Template stems ("She stepped," "He stepped," "He lifted," "He placed") appear in sequence. Apply −0.8 cumulative in Q7 for these patterned artifacts.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The premise—clairvoyant surprised by an entity that defies sight—offers a fresh angle on divination tropes. The overlapping shadows and cave pearl are specific. However, the pilgrim's dissolution and the pearl's vanishing echo familiar "wise stranger imparts lesson then disappears" templates. The emotional arc (acceptance of unpredictability) is earnest but not deeply transformed through lived detail or a non-obvious moral calculus. The piece commits to its premise but plays it safely within genre expectations.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elara is established as a clairvoyant who "didn't see [the pilgrim] coming" in the opening beat. Her blindness drives her curiosity and acceptance of the pearl (middle beat). However, her "not seeing" is more a setup irony than a decision-driver; she doesn't wrestle with the failure of her gift or make a tactical adjustment because of it. The trait is present and functional but doesn't constrain a key choice with visible cost. Setup and middle development are present; closure participation is weak (she observes the change rather than deciding). Cap at 4.6 for missing strong closure linkage; the element is functional but replaceable. Score 4.8 within that band for solid setup and one middle touch.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The cave pearl appears in three beats: the pilgrim holds it (early), places it in Elara's palm (middle), and it vanishes after the crystals shatter (closure scene). It is causally active: touching it triggers the cave's transformation. However, its specific properties (etched symbols, warmth, condensation) don't shape tactics—any mysterious object could serve. The pearl is essential to the plot mechanism but not irreplaceable by exact properties. Setup, development, and payoff gates are met; causal pressure is present; closure linkage is clear. Score 6.7 for solid three-beat involvement with moderate causal work, but swappability for a generic "magic key" object limits higher scoring.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Unseen forces" are named early ("lately, the cave's songs had grown steadily unpredictable, as if unseen forces were tugging"), recur in the pilgrim's dialogue ("Unseen forces are fickle"), and reappear in the ending ("she could feel the unseen forces now"). The concept frames the dominant stake (Elara's struggle with unpredictability). However, it remains thematic and atmospheric rather than constraining on-page choices—Elara doesn't navigate or resist these forces tactically; they happen to her. Setup and payoff are present; middle development is weak. The concept is present and coherent but doesn't alter options on the page. Score 5.2 for shaping one key turn (the pearl moment) with thematic resonance but limited tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Steadily unpredictable" describes the cave's songs ("the cave's songs had grown steadily unpredictable") and echoes in the ending ("a steady, unpredictable hum"). The attribute is present in setup and payoff but does not constrain an on-page action with cost. It's a label for the cave's behavior rather than a trait that forces a tradeoff or enables a tactic. The attribute is functional atmosphere but lacks causal bite. Setup and payoff present; middle development absent. Cap at 4.6 for missing middle development; score 4.1 for label-only use without visible tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Inhabit" appears in the pilgrim's instruction ("Let the unseen forces *inhabit* you") and structurally defines the climax: Elara closes her fingers around the pearl, and the transformation occurs. The action is the story's major turn. However, "inhabit" is nearly swappable with "enter," "fill," or "possess"—the exact verb doesn't add unique mechanics. The action drives the closure but is not irreplaceable. Setup (late, second half), development (the instruction), and payoff (the transformation) are present. Causal pressure and closure linkage are strong. Score 5.9 for driving the key turn with moderate specificity but high swappability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Through overlapping shadows" is introduced early (the pilgrim's "three overlapping shadows"), recurs in the middle ("The overlapping shadows around the pilgrim coalesced"), and returns at the ending ("his shadow merging with hers" / "Let the shadows overlap"). The method is visually specific and mechanically consistent: the shadows signal the pilgrim's nature and frame his instruction. It shapes the pilgrim's arc (fragmentation to coalescence to merger) and charges the ending image. Setup, development, and payoff are present; causal pressure is moderate (the method defines the pilgrim's form but doesn't constrain Elara's choices). Closure linkage is clear. Score 6.4 for solid three-beat presence and thematic charge, but limited tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The musical crystal cave is established in the opening paragraph, constrains Elara's presence ("made it her home years ago, drawn by the promise of magnifying everyday magic"), provides resources (the crystals' song and light), and undergoes transformation (crystals shatter, song returns changed). The setting is causally active across all three gates and essential to the closure image. The cave's unpredictability is the story's pressure source, and its changed song is the final Resonant Reconfiguration. Removing the cave would break the story's logic. Setup, development, and payoff are strong; causal pressure and closure linkage are high; specificity (quartz/obsidian, chimes, springs) is vivid. Score 7.2 for essential integration across beats with strong closure charge.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the pilgrim arrives" is satisfied—the entire story occurs post-arrival. However, time does not tighten decisions: no clock pressures Elara's choice, and the sequence (arrival, dialogue, pearl touch, transformation) could unfold over minutes or hours without affecting stakes. Time is present as a structural marker (continuous scene) but does not alter tactics. Setup is implicit; middle and closure development are absent as constraint. The timeframe is functional but replaceable with minor edits. Cap at 3.8 for swappability and lack of tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Elara's motivation "to magnify everyday magic" is stated early ("drawn by the promise of magnifying everyday magic") and recurs in the pilgrim's acknowledgment ("you seek to magnify everyday magic"). It frames her residence in the cave and her acceptance of the pearl. However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized in a conflicted choice—Elara doesn't weigh costs or face friction between this desire and another value on the page. Setup and development are present; payoff is weak (the ending recounts change but doesn't show her wrestling with whether to accept unpredictability). Score 5.6 for shaping one key turn (accepting the pearl) with moderate thematic linkage but insufficient friction or cost visibility.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Bright darkness" is embodied throughout: the cave's "prismatic patterns," "light bends just so," violet and gold hues, then the dimming/flaring during the transformation, and the final image of a "steady and clear" song with a "steady, unpredictable hum beneath." Tone modulates with pressure (bright wonder → shattering chaos → quiet reconfiguration) and charges the ending. The tone is coherent, purposeful, and integral to the piece's emotional texture. Setup, development, and payoff are present; the tone shapes perception across beats and reweights the final image. Score 6.8 for strong coherence and modulation that charges closure, approaching essential status.</comment>
