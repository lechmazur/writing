<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lira's interiority relies heavily on coined terms ("shrewdly innocent gaze," "lotus-hearted ache") that function as labels rather than embodied contradiction. The translator role shapes perception selectively (coral grooves mirroring cast marks), but peak moments default to abstract emotional summary ("grief and tenderness coiled together") instead of simultaneous impulses in scene. The final coral-placement choice at the negotiating table arrives without visible internal cost or foreclosed alternative—she simply acts, and delegates respond cooperatively. Micro-choices exist (tracing doodles, writing translations) but carry no trade-off pressure that would earn the ending's hopeful reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph; no penalty. The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens: mist, coral fragment, cast notes, and atrium recur with shifting emotional weight toward a final Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise: coral placed between delegates, cast hung as "flag of fragile hope"). Cost is asserted abstractly ("lotus-hearted ache… lighter, a seed waiting to sprout") but not dramatized as a visible forfeiture or stakes narrowing on the page—the talks simply resume and a delegate touches the coral without on-page resistance or price paid by Lira. The lens holds, but the closure image depends on cooperative reception rather than protagonist sacrifice or choice under constraint, weakening felt cost proof.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The mist-clad atrium and brain coral fragment anchor setting and micro-object throughout. The coral's grooves guide Lira's perceptual frame (mirroring cast scribbles), and the atrium's twilight and moss-stained bench provide spatial coherence. The coral reappears at closure, placed on the negotiating table to constrain rhetoric ("This grew from ruin. So can we."), satisfying the 9+ quick test for object-as-setting constraining choice. However, the broader atrium space remains largely atmospheric postcard (mist curling, twilight) without altering tactics beyond mood, and the child's cast—though thematically charged—floats as decor ("hung in the atrium's rafters") rather than a spatial pressure point in the final beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—grafting new meaning onto loss, operationalized through translating the girl's cast—signals early and tightens once when Lira moves from private decryption to public gesture (coral at negotiating table). That beat deepens emotional register but does not narrow options or force a visible trade-off; the delegates respond amenably, and no fallback plan or cost (professional risk, personal vulnerability) materializes on the page. The girl's anxiety "unknotting" and Lira's ache "softening" are asserted outcomes, not dramatized prices. Accumulative pressure builds through recurring motifs (coral, cast, ache), meeting the lens requirement for one meaningful deepening, but agency at closure reads passive—Lira offers an object and a line; the world cooperates without friction.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme—translation as alchemy, wounds as blueprints for regrowth—emerges through concrete particulars (coral fragment, cast scribbles, "ocean heals in whispers") rather than thesis statements. The final coral gesture and cast-as-flag image offer a non-literal answer to "can meaning regrow from ruin?" without overt moralizing. However, the closing paragraph edges toward thematic summary ("even broken things could hold the blueprint for something whole") and the ocean's whisper-back feels like authorial confirmation rather than ambiguous resonance. The widow's eulogy flashback and ecosystems-aquarium memory add texture but also dilute present-tense pressure with reflective drift. Subtext operates in the translated lines and coral symbolism, but the ending's optimism ("seed waiting to sprout") resolves tension tidily instead of leaving a charged question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Lira's perceptual signature (translator lens, metaphor-defusing gaze) is consistent, and the prose modulates between lyric reflection and concrete action. Dialogue is sparse but functional ("They're not just scribbles. They're codes"; "It's… sharp"). However, narrative diction drifts into elevated abstraction at emotional peaks ("lotus-hearted ache," "shrewdly innocent gaze") that feel authorial rather than character-interior, and the anesthetic frame introduced in the opening ("after the anesthetic kicked in") vanishes without affecting perception or closure. The voice is literary-poetic throughout, but compression under stress (mist, twilight, ache) relies on repeated atmospheric gestures rather than syntactic tightening or fresh sensory hierarchy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops appear in adjacent beats: "grief and tenderness coiled together" / "lotus-hearted ache" restate the same hybrid emotion without added pressure; "frayed words into bridges" / "translation was about finding equivalence… now alchemy" recycles the transformation metaphor. Template cadence runs: "She'd felt it… She'd taken it… She pulled… She opened…" in sequential paragraphs. Stock metaphors cluster without fresh vehicle logic: "mist curled… like a ghost's fingers," "ocean whispered back." The opening anesthetic reference ("after the anesthetic kicked in") sets a disoriented frame that the prose never delivers—perception remains sharp and lyric throughout, breaking the promised effect. Filter-verb reliance ("wondered if," "realized," "believed") in reflective blocks dulls immediacy. Applying patterned-artifact penalty pack: paraphrase/synonym loops, template stems, and stock metaphor strings touching multiple beats trigger −1.2 in Q7; anesthetic setup abandoned adds −0.3 for unkept setup. Information density is mid-range; many lines do double duty (coral/cast mirroring) but reflective passages dilute propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The translator-in-conflict-zone premise and coral-as-ruin-relic are familiar from recent literary templates; the story does not transform them through non-obvious moral calculus or lived occupational detail—Lira's translation work is gestured at (widow's eulogy, "defusing landmine metaphors") but never demonstrated under pressure with professional constraint. The cast-scribbles-as-codes twist and "unknotting" action feel token-quirky rather than inevitable. The coral-at-negotiating-table closure echoes object-as-symbol moves common in workshop fiction; the general's response ("It's… sharp" / "sharp things can carve new paths") lands as on-the-nose metaphor rather than a surprising synthesis. Emotional truth in the grief/hope blend is present but wrapped in generic "wounds heal into hope" framing. Derivative premise without transformation: −0.8 within Q8.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Lira (pacific conflict-zone translator) appears throughout and makes two on-page choices: decrypting the cast privately and placing the coral publicly at the negotiating table. Her role colors perception (metaphor-defusing, bridge-building) and frames the widow eulogy flashback. However, most beats are observational or reflective rather than decision-under-pressure; the climactic coral gesture is cooperative (delegates respond positively without resistance), so the translator attribute enables but does not constrain with cost. Early signal (+0.6), two beats (+0.9), causal enablement moderate (+0.7), closure linkage (+1.0), but swappable with "mediator" or "aid worker" (−0.5). Late first major choice at negotiating table (−0.3). Base 3.0 + 2.4 = 5.4, round down 5.7 for lyric integration.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Brain coral fragment introduced in opening beat (Lira holding it, tracing grooves), returns in aquarium-memory beat, and reappears decisively at closure (placed on negotiating table, touched by general, becomes talisman in final image). Early signal (+0.7), three beats (+1.4), causal pressure (enables metaphor, shapes final tactic) (+1.2), closure linkage strong (+1.5), irreplaceability (grooves mirror cast, sharp texture charged) (+0.6). Total +5.4 from base 3.0 = 8.4, but the coral's grooves and sharpness are described more than used with visible cost—Lira simply places it and it works—so slight swappability with any symbolic ruin-object (−0.4). Lyric reprise with thematic charge justifies mid-7s; round to 7.2.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Shared anxieties (core concept) appear thematically: girl's fear, Lira's ache, delegates' presumed conflict-fatigue. The cast scribbles embody child anxiety that Lira "unknots," and the coral gesture invites shared recognition of ruin/regrowth. However, the concept never forces a tactical choice or trade-off on the page—Lira translates privately, then offers publicly without friction. It shapes theme more than stakes or options. Late crystallization at closure (−0.4), ornamental until final beat (−0.6), swappable with "collective trauma" (−0.5). Base 3.0 + thematic presence in two beats (+0.9) + closure mention (+0.5) − frictions = ~3.4; lyric integration adds +0.3 for patterned callback, lifting to 4.8 but capped shy of 5.0 due to lack of on-page cost tied to the concept.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Shrewdly innocent" (attribute) is introduced early as a label ("her shrewdly innocent gaze—a paradox she'd honed over years") but never constrains or enables a visible action with cost. The trait is told, not shown through contradictory impulses or a choice where innocence and shrewdness clash. It does not shape the coral gesture or translation tactics on the page. Label-only mention (−0.8), no beat involvement beyond the opening descriptor (−0.5), swappable or omittable (−0.7). Base 3.0 − 2.0 frictions = 1.0; slight thematic relevance to her role as translator raises to 3.2 but remains ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Unknot" (action) appears twice: Lira promises to "unknot" the girl's anxiety and later the anxiety "unknotting like a frayed rope" when she writes beside the doodles. Early signal (+0.5), two beats (+0.9), causal (private translation enables public coral gesture) (+0.8), closure linkage indirect (the unknotting primes her confidence, but coral placement is the final action) (+0.4). Swappability moderate—"decode," "untangle," "translate" could substitute with minor edits (−0.5). Base 3.0 + 2.6 − 0.5 = 5.1; the action is more thematic verb than decisive story turn, but it does shape the middle beat and prime closure, lifting to 6.4 for functional integration across two beats with modest causal work.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Decrypting smudged notes on the child's cast (method) is signaled early (Lira studying the cast, first note "Mom says the ocean's sick") and executed in the middle beat where she traces doodles and rewrites them. Early signal (+0.6), two beats (study, decrypt) (+0.9), causal (translations become the basis for her hopeful stance and coral gesture) (+1.0), closure linkage (cast hung as flag, though not actively used in final image) (+0.5), specificity (smudged notes, bandaged fish) (+0.5). Total +3.5 from base 3.0 = 6.5, but the decryption itself is brief and summary ("began decrypting… her translations not of language but of emotion")—mechanics glossed rather than dramatized (−0.4). Round to 5.9; functional but not fully pressured.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Mist-clad atrium at twilight (setting) frames the entire piece: opening image (mist curling around columns), middle (condensation on bench), closing (mist-clad atrium walk). Early signal (+0.7), present across all beats (+1.2), but the atrium functions as atmospheric backdrop rather than constraining choice or altering tactics—Lira could translate and place the coral anywhere without structural change. Postcard description (−0.7), swappable with any reflective liminal space (−0.6). Base 3.0 + 1.9 − 1.3 = 3.6; the twilight mood supports tone and the cast hanging in the rafters adds symbolic closure charge (+0.5), lifting to 4.1, but micro-setting test (does space alter moves?) fails.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>"After the anesthetic kicks in" (timeframe) appears in the opening sentence, setting a disoriented or altered-state expectation, but never affects Lira's perception, decision-making, or pacing. No clock tightens moves; the atrium scene is timeless twilight with no urgency or deadline. The anesthetic frame is ornamental and unkept (−0.9), no middle development (−0.5), no closure participation (−0.6), swappable or omittable (−0.7). Base 3.0 − 2.7 = 0.3; lyric opening hook adds +0.2 for atmospheric seed, but total integration remains minimal at 2.3 due to complete abandonment after first line.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Grafting new meaning onto old wounds (motivation) is signaled early ("wondered if meaning could be grafted onto ruins") and drives the middle beat (rewriting cast notes) and closure (coral placed to demonstrate regrowth). Early signal (+0.6), three beats (wondering, translating, placing) (+1.4), causal (desire propels all major actions) (+1.3), closure linkage (coral gesture is the grafting attempt) (+1.2), but no on-page friction between this want and a competing fear or cost—Lira acts hopefully throughout without setback or trade-off (−0.8). Base 3.0 + 4.5 − 0.8 = 6.7; the motivation is clear and consistent but never tested under opposing pressure, capping near mid-6s. Round to 6.6.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Lotus-hearted ache" (tone) is introduced as a coined term early, recurs in flashback ("she'd felt it during her first assignment"), middle ("flared in her chest"), and closure ("she felt the lotus-hearted ache again… lighter, a seed"). Early signal (+0.6), three beats (+1.4), modulates from sharp to softened (+0.7), closure charge (ache-as-seed final image) (+0.9). However, the term itself is abstract label-speak rather than embodied tone—it tells grief-tenderness hybrid instead of showing contradictory sensory/emotional texture (−0.8), and the label recurs mechanically without fresh angle (−0.4). Base 3.0 + 3.6 − 1.2 = 5.4; lyric integration and closure callback lift slightly, rounding to 5.3 for functional but label-reliant tonal throughline.</comment>
