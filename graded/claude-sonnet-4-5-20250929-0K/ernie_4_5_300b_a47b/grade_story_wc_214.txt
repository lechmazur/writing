<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Zara's motivation ("find strength in vulnerability") is asserted repeatedly but never dramatized through a credible on-page choice with cost. The journey to the crater unfolds without internal conflict or a decision that forecloses a path—she walks, kneels, and returns, all frictionless. Veyra's softening at the end reads as convenience rather than earned change. Interiority relies on abstract philosophical claims ("the flourishing stillness she sought") instead of embodied contradictory impulses under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The piece establishes orientation (who, where, when) adequately within the opening. However, the closure lacks decisive change or visible cost: Zara returns with stardust in the lantern, Veyra softens, and both "found a truth worth holding"—but no option has been foreclosed, no stance crystallized with price. The walk to the crater and the star's fadeout are atmospheric but do not tighten or alter Zara's position. Under an Accumulative lens the ending would need a pattern break or cadence shift that reweights the stake with cost; under Causal it would need a because/therefore link that narrows options—neither is present.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The shooting star station, plateau, and yellow lantern glass are vivid and consistently rendered across the piece. The lantern appears in three beats (control room, walk, crater) and its glow mingles with the star's radiance at the pivotal moment, lending some constraint to the scene's spatial logic. However, the environment does not force a choice or alter tactics—Zara's path is unobstructed, and the setting functions more as backdrop than crucible. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered, avoiding tourist catalogs.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Zara's pursuit of "flourishing stillness" and empathy with the stars—is signaled early but never tested by opposition or cost. The walk to the crater proceeds without obstacle, reversal, or a choice that narrows options. The star's fadeout is atmospheric but does not impose a price on Zara or alter her tactics. Veyra's critique in the opening could have supplied friction, but he softens off-page without dramatized pressure. No escalation or deepening occurs; the arc is flat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The theme of vulnerability-as-strength and the metaphor of falling stars are coherent throughout. The final image (stardust in the lantern) offers a non-literal emblem, and the closing "act of letting go" ties back to the opening premise. However, the theme is stated more than dramatized: "In its death, she found a mirror of her own journey" is direct philosophizing rather than earned insight from specific struggle. The piece resists moralizing in the final beat, but the earlier on-page articulations ("courage to let go," "acceptance of motion") blunt the resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>POV remains stable in third-person limited on Zara; no head-hopping. The prose carries a consistent lyric register with elevated diction ("primal elegance," "velvet expanse") that feels voice-motivated and legible. Dialogue is minimal (two brief exchanges with Veyra), natural, and goal-driven. However, the narration occasionally drifts into abstract philosophizing ("the flourishing stillness that bloomed when the universe paused to breathe") that reads as authorial intrusion rather than Zara's perceptual signature. Psychic distance is controlled, and focalization remains clean throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies adequately, and the opening/closing images bookend with intentional symmetry. However, multiple passages loop or restate without advancing pressure: "the quiet between the chaos, the flourishing stillness that bloomed" is paraphrased across three beats. "Primal elegance" appears twice without evolving function. Abstract high-level descriptors ("velvet expanse," "faded glow of ancient constellations") recur in place of concrete sensory anchors. Information density is moderate—many sentences do one job rather than two. The crater scene's key beat ("For a moment, the world held its breath. Then, the star winked out") compresses causality into inert summary.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The cosmic-janitor premise offers a fresh angle on the overlooked-worker trope, and the yellow lantern glass as both relic and compass is specific. However, the emotional arc (finding strength through empathy with stars) follows a familiar template without transformation through lived detail or moral friction. The walk-to-crater structure is linear and predictable; no turn arises from character choice. The resolution—Veyra softens, Zara collects stardust—feels like median synthesis rather than bold risk. Proximity check: "the universe paused to breathe" and "tears from the heavens" echo common lyric idiom.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Zara (cosmic janitor) appears in every beat and her occupation frames the opening. However, her choices do not create key turns: she walks to the crater without decision friction, kneels, and returns. The mid-scene choice to place the lantern beside the crater is observational rather than a trade-off that narrows options. She is on-page throughout but her agency is passive. Setup and closure participation are present; middle development (a choice with cost) is absent.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The yellow lantern glass is introduced in paragraph two, used in the walk ("lifted her yellow lantern glass, its light catching the star's descent"), placed beside the crater where its light mingles with the star's glow, and returns in the final exchange containing stardust. Three distinct beats; the object's final state (stardust within) reweights its earlier function as compass. Causal pressure is moderate—it enables tracking but does not constrain a choice. Early signal, closure linkage, and beat involvement lift the score; swappability (a different-colored glass would work with minor edits) and lack of a tied cost limit the band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"Flourishing stillness" is named in paragraph one and echoed in the penultimate paragraph but never shapes an on-page stake or tactic. It functions as thematic label rather than a constraint that alters Zara's choices. No middle beat tests the concept with cost. Ornamental use and thematic-only presence keep the score low.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Spiritually curious" is asserted in paragraph two but does not constrain or enable a visible action with cost. Zara's walk and empathy unfold without on-page friction tied to this trait—any curious character could perform the same arc. Label-only trait without dramatized trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Empathize" is signaled in paragraph two ("to empathize with the stars' fleeting existence"), enacted at the crater ("She empathized with the star's end"), and informs the closing reflection. The action appears across three beats and frames the thematic spine. However, it does not create a major turn or trade-off—Zara's empathy is uncontested and costless. Two-gate coverage (setup, closure) plus thematic presence but no middle causal pressure; lyric reprise lifts the score into mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Tracing the path of falling stars" is introduced in paragraph two, actualized in the walk ("began to walk" following the fractured star's descent), and mentioned in Veyra's closing acknowledgment. The method shapes the middle beat (the walk to the impact site) and is present at closure. Mechanics are implied (visual tracking → physical pursuit) but not detailed. Early signal, one substantive beat, and closure mention meet two gates; lack of on-page constraint or cost caps the score.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The shooting star tracking station is established in paragraph one, houses the opening and closing scenes, and supplies the domes and control panels as ambient anchors. However, it does not pressure a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome—Zara leaves the station, and her journey occurs on the plateau. The station's instruments are described as passive ("waited, patient as stone"). Setup and closure presence meet two gates; lack of middle constraint and postcard-style description limit the score.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"The hush of an overlooked era" appears in the opening and closing lines but does not tighten decisions or tactics. Time is vague and untracked ("Hours passed, or perhaps it was only minutes"); no clock pressure shapes Zara's choices. Thematic frame only, no middle development or closure linkage to tactics. Ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>"To find strength in vulnerability" is stated in paragraph two, echoed at the crater ("In its death, she found…courage to let go"), and referenced in the closing image. The motivation frames the arc but is never dramatized through a choice with friction—Zara's journey unfolds without competing wants or on-page cost. Told motivation across setup and closure; no middle choice beat. Thematic presence without dramatized conflict.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Primal elegance" is named twice (paragraphs five and ten) and the prose sustains a lyric, elevated register throughout. Tone is coherent across turns and modulates slightly (the Veyra exchange is cooler, the crater scene warmer). However, the tone does not charge the final image with fresh intensity—the closing beat maintains the same lyric distance as the opening. Consistent mood without escalation or cadence shift; lyric reprise without reweighting.</comment>
