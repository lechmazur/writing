<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The keeper's motivation—to witness without judgment and find regenerative silence—is clear and sustained. Interiority is present ("their grip on reality loosening with each century"), though some passages lean toward abstract declaration rather than embodied contradiction. The final choice to let go feels earned by the journey, but the transformation reads more as poetic summary than urgent lived struggle. Emotional embodiment is intermittent; phrases like "their heart light" trend toward label rather than sensory particularity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches its patterned progression early (four folds, each opening a new chamber) and follows through with a coherent deepening. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): the keeper returns transformed, their burden now "a bridge," with visible cost ("grip on reality now a faint echo"). Orientation anchors who and where by the second paragraph. The cost is legible in the keeper's shedding of self and the swan's abandonment, though the final paragraph's summary mode slightly softens immediacy.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful: the library's "moss-choked stone," bioluminescent fungi, and black water pool all constrain and guide the keeper's descent. The obsidian refuge functions as both destination and metaphor, charged at closure when it vanishes and the keeper recognizes the transformation. Spatial choreography is clean through the tunnel, fissure, staircase, and cavern. The environment actively shapes choices (following the swan's folds) and the final image (the wall of stone replacing the river's edge).</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reaching the regenerative silence—is signaled early and sustained. The journey tightens through each fold, with the keeper shedding layers of self at the black water pool and yielding the petrified door. The final turn (the river vanishing, replaced by stone) forces a reconfiguration with visible cost: the keeper's "grip on reality now a faint echo." Agency is clear in the choice to sit, let go, and rise transformed. One meaningful deepening under the Accumulative lens is sufficient; the cost is legible though somewhat softened by summary.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—letting go of judgment to witness change—emerges organically from the keeper's journey and choice, not assertion. The origami swan, black water, and river's backward flow all accumulate meaning without overt symbolism. The final image (stone wall, lightened heart, knowledge as "bridge not chain") offers a resonant answer to the central question without moralizing. The piece resists tidy resolution; the keeper's transformation is complete yet ambiguous, the silence internalized rather than possessed. No thematic echo or label-speak mars the closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited throughout; focalization remains with the keeper. Diction is elevated and consistent ("moth-eaten tome," "fractured black," "burrowed through hidden veins"), creating a distinct lyric texture. Some filter verbs ("felt distant," "seemed less oppressive") slightly dull immediacy in the final stretch. Perceptual signature is present but not sharply individuated; the keeper's way of noticing trends poetic-universal rather than idiosyncratically character-particular. No dialogue to evaluate. Psychic distance is controlled; no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear with vivid imagery ("roots dangled like question marks," "soft black sand"). Rhythm varies appropriately, though some passages recycle stems: "The first fold led... The second fold pointed... The third fold guided... The fourth fold led" creates template cadence across the middle section (−0.5). Minor paraphrase loop: "becoming silence, becoming change, becoming nothing and everything" restates without added pressure (−0.2). Information density is strong; no major scaffolding. Figurative language is controlled and purposeful, but the cadence pattern in a high-pressure sequence slightly flattens propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The combination of keeper, library catacombs, and origami-map transformation feels fresh through specific execution. The river flowing backward and the obsidian refuge as "state of being" rather than place offer non-obvious angles. The piece commits fully to its lyric-philosophical premise without hedging. Risk is present in the abstract handling of time and self-dissolution; the gamble mostly pays off, though the elevated register and symbolic density may narrow appeal. Not derivative, but the "ancient keeper seeks transcendence" frame is recognizable; transformation through particulars (the folds, the black sand) earns the band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Chronicle keeper is present throughout and makes the key choice to descend, sit, let go, and return transformed. Setup clear; middle involves following folds and shedding self; payoff is the return with "heart light." However, many moves are passive reception (the folds guide, the door yields, silence washes over) rather than active decisions that narrow options under pressure. The keeper's agency is more receptive-contemplative than decisive-conflicted. Two-of-three gates met (setup, payoff); middle is observational travel. Causal pressure modest; some irreplaceability (the keeper's centuries-long purpose).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Obsidian refuge appears in paragraph two as goal, in the middle as the keeper climbs toward it, and at closure when it vanishes into stone. Setup and payoff gates met; middle mention is anticipatory but not interactive. The refuge's transformation (from place to "state of being" to vanished wall) reweights meaning at the end. However, it is never handled or used—only approached and internalized—so beat involvement is limited to thematic charge rather than tactical constraint. Lyric reprise carries cost but lacks physical engagement across distinct beats.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Regenerative silence is the keeper's stated goal (paragraph three), shapes the descent (seeking silence that "could regenerate the soul"), and is realized at closure ("The regenerative silence had done its work"). All three gates met. The concept alters the keeper's state and tactics (choosing to sit, let go, shed judgment). Cost is visible in the loosened grip on reality and the emotional transformation. However, "regenerative silence" trends abstract; the story dramatizes it through immersion and transformation rather than making silence itself a concrete obstacle or tool that changes move-by-move tactics.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Grips reality loosely" is introduced in paragraph one, recurs at the black water pool ("their grip on reality loosening"), and at closure ("their grip on reality now a faint echo"). Setup and payoff clear; middle touch is brief. The trait enables the keeper's willingness to shed self and accept transformation, but it functions more as poetic summary of state than a specific constraint that forces a visible trade-off in a decision beat. Label-only in most mentions; the cost is thematic rather than tactical. Two gates, modest causal work, swappable with similar metaphors.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Burrow" is signaled in paragraph two ("burrow through the library's hidden veins"), drives the middle sequence (tunnel, fissure, staircase descent), and implicitly completes at closure when the keeper retraces steps through "the library's veins." All three gates met. The action structures the entire middle arc and is mechanically specific (following the swan's folds to burrow deeper). Two distinct beats (initial descent, return journey). Removal would break the quest structure. Strong causal role and irreplaceability; the burrowing is both physical and metaphorical shedding.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Origami swan is introduced in paragraph two, unfolded in paragraph four to guide the descent through four folds (tunnel, fissure, staircase, door), and lies "abandoned on the cavern floor" in the penultimate paragraph. All three gates met. The swan's mechanics shape every middle beat and enable the journey; without it, the keeper has no map. Two to three distinct beats (unfolding, guiding, abandonment). High causal pressure and specificity. The swan is indispensable to the structure, though its final abandonment is noted rather than charged with immediate consequence.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Overgrown library is established in paragraph one, frames the keeper's purpose and home, supplies the hidden veins and chambers that structure the descent, and returns at closure ("overgrown shelves seemed less oppressive now"). All three gates met. The library physically constrains the journey (narrow tunnels, groaning staircase, petrified door) and emotionally pressures the keeper (crumbling peace, burden of knowledge). Three or more beats; strong causal and closure linkage. The library's transformation from chain to bridge at the end reweights the setting's meaning. High irreplaceability and specificity.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Across the drift of untold seasons" appears twice (paragraphs one and penultimate) as a lyric refrain. Setup and payoff met, but no middle development. The timeframe is vast and vague, supplying atmosphere but not tightening decisions or altering tactics. The keeper has spent "eons" documenting, but this does not create a live clock or urgency. The phrase charges mood (crumbling peace, timelessness) but does not constrain choice. Lyric reprise without tactical pressure; swappable with similar temporal abstractions. Ornamental use; late return does not reweight prior stakes.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Motivation "to witness change without judgment" is explicitly stated in paragraph three, drives the keeper's choice to seek the river's edge, and is fulfilled at closure ("no judgments lingered"). All three gates met. The desire is clear and shapes the quest, but it is told more than dramatized through conflicting wants. The keeper's journey is linear pursuit rather than friction between competing impulses. One causal beat (choosing to descend) and closure participation. Cost is present (shedding self, loosening grip on reality) but the motivation itself is not tested by an opposing pull. Functional but not deeply conflicted.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>"Crumbling peace" is introduced in paragraph one ("crumbling peace of a place abandoned"), echoed in the keeper's need for "more" than the library's decaying tranquility, and modulates through the descent (bioluminescent silence, black water stillness) to resolve in the final paragraph's "heart light" and the library's shelves now "less oppressive." Setup, middle modulation, and payoff all present. The tone is coherent and charges the final image (peaceful letting-go after crumbling constraint). Modulates with pressure from decay to regeneration. Strong closure linkage; the tone shift embodies the thematic answer.</comment>
