<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is clear and consistent—she seeks missing paths—but her interior life remains vague and label-dependent ("cheerful gloom," "regret...like molasses"). The transliteration process is asserted rather than embodied through contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. The final realization ("paths were *released*") arrives without visible cost or a choice that forecloses an alternative; Lira remains an observer. Embodied emotion and agency that alters tactics are absent at closure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The piece establishes who/where/when by the opening paragraph and pursues one dominant stake (why paths disappear). The closure offers a conceptual repricing—paths are released, not forgotten—but the cost is purely intellectual; no on-page choice or forfeiture accompanies the insight. The final pool-vision sequence summarizes rather than dramatizes the turn, and Lira's options remain unchanged. Under a Causal lens, the link from conjecture → seeds → pool lacks embodied resistance or trade-off, weakening closure impact.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The iridescent geode is vividly rendered with bioluminescent glow, moss-carpeted alcove, and liquid-light pool; sensory detail is selective and atmospheric. The crater glass and seeds function as recurring objects that guide Lira's investigation. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; Lira moves freely without spatial friction. The final pool provides spectacle but does not charge the closure with physical or spatial consequence, capping the score below the 9-band gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake (discover why paths disappear) is signaled early, but escalation remains conceptual rather than embodied. Lira sifts, conjectures, and receives visions without meaningful resistance, trade-off, or narrowing of options. The seeds and shard "answer" her question in the pool without requiring a decision or forfeiture. No visible price is paid; the final insight arrives as exposition rather than earned choice, and prior tactics do not foreclose alternatives.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The theme—memory, loss, and the necessity of letting go—emerges from the crater glass, scattered seeds, and vanishing paths. The final realization ("released," not "forgotten") reweights prior material without overt moralizing. However, the insight is delivered as summary ("Because holding onto them hurts too much") rather than through image or renunciation with cost. The piece invites reflection but does not offer a non-literal, resonant answer to the central question via concrete particulars at closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>POV remains stable single-focalizer; diction is consistent and lyric ("tide-washed sand," "viscous thing, like molasses"). Perceptual signature is present but generic; Lira's noticing does not reflect character-specific bias or stakes-driven selection. Minimal dialogue; the few lines ("Why?" "Because...") lack subtext or goal pursuit. Under peak pressure (the pool vision), the prose remains descriptive rather than tightening syntactically or rhythmically to reflect urgency.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose is clear and imagistic with strong sensory detail ("oil on water," "liquid light"). Sentence variety is present; rhythm supports atmosphere. However, paraphrase loops appear ("The seed trembled, and the shard's regret deepened" echoes prior "regret" descriptions), and filter-verb stacks ("She saw," "She felt," "She knew") cluster in the climax without voice-motivated purpose. The final pool sequence lists images rather than propelling through syntax, slightly dulling momentum. Information density is moderate; some lines repeat emotional states without advancing pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The sea-foam recollectionist, crater glass, and iridescent geode offer fresh surface texture. The central insight—paths are released, not erased—risks familiar territory (acceptance/letting go) without a non-obvious moral calculus or embodied cost that transforms the premise. The scattered seeds and transliteration method are intriguing but remain ornamental; the story could function with any discovery mechanism. No bold structural or perspectival risk heightens stakes; the ending summarizes rather than reimagining the premise through lived consequence.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Lira's choices (collect, sift, press seeds into shard, walk to pool) advance the plot but do not create key turns with cost. She observes and conjectures; the pool vision provides the answer without requiring a decision that alters tactics or forecloses a path. Present across beats but largely passive.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Crater glass appears in three beats: opening sift, seed-press experiment, and pool dissolution. It evolves from regret-symbol to clarity vessel. However, it does not constrain a choice or impose a trade-off; Lira handles it without cost. The glass shapes the investigation but does not charge the final image with irreplaceable specificity.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Missing pieces" frames the stake early and recurs in the final realization (paths released vs. erased). It motivates Lira's search and provides thematic coherence. However, it does not narrow options or impose a visible cost; the concept remains abstract rather than forcing a choice or trade-off on the page.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Transliterates emotions" is asserted in the opening and used once (amber shard = regret). The trait does not constrain or enable a later action with cost; it functions as background flavor. Label-only mention without dramatized trade-off or tactical consequence.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Conjecture is introduced early ("art of filling gaps") and applied in the middle sequence ("The seeds are messages"). However, the final turn comes from the pool vision, not from Lira's conjecture process. The action is present but swappable; "intuition" or "meditation" would yield the same outcome.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The scattered seeds appear in the opening (bird entrance), are collected and pressed into the shard, and dissolve in the pool. They signal the path map and participate in two beats. However, the seeds' mechanics (how they mark paths) are asserted rather than demonstrated through cost or constraint. They shape Lira's attempt but do not impose a trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The iridescent geode provides vivid atmosphere and recurring locations (alcove, tunnels, heart pool). The setting supplies the liquid-light pool that delivers the final vision and houses the crater glass. It does not constrain a choice or alter tactics, but it charges the final image with sensory specificity and participates in closure. Essential to tone and ending resonance.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Before memory fades" is mentioned in the penultimate paragraph but does not tighten decisions or tactics on the page. Time pressure is asserted ("determined to solve it") without a live clock or deadline that alters Lira's choices. The timeframe motivates the quest but remains abstract.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"To discover why some paths disappear" frames Lira's goal early and drives her investigation across beats. The final answer (paths are released) directly addresses the motivation. However, the desire is not conflicted on the page; no competing want or fear complicates the pursuit. Dramatized pursuit without internal friction or visible cost at closure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>"Cheerful gloom" is introduced early ("paradox she wore like a second skin") and modulates slightly ("lifted slightly" near the end). The tone supports atmosphere but remains static; the oxymoron is asserted rather than embodied through contradictory rhythms or image shifts under pressure. Present and coherent, but does not charge the final image with tonal reconfiguration.</comment>
