<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to document storms and hold power accountable is declared rather than revealed through contradictory impulses. The progression from isolation to activism feels schematic—"His motivation crystallized" tells us the shift rather than dramatizing it. The woman in the lab coat arrives as a plot convenience; no prior friction suggests why Elias would follow a stranger into a biohazard zone. The choice to burn the evidence ("some truths are meant to be shared, not preserved") contradicts his role as witness without visible cost or internal struggle on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation is established by ~120 words (courtyard, dusk, storm recorder), and the pigeon message provides the inciting catalyst. The closure lands—Elias decides to share evidence and begins a new log entry—but the cost is asserted rather than felt: burning the parchment after deciding to "share" the truth is contradictory, and the woman's vial hand-off resolves a problem Elias didn't help create. The causal lens weakens when coincidence (the pigeon's arrival, the woman's emergence) drives key turns instead of protagonist agency. One meaningful tightening occurs (entering the zone), but the resolution depends on external rescue rather than Elias's prior choices.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The courtyard is anchored with selective detail (stone wall, ivy-choked trellis, fountain) and recurs at closure, but it functions primarily as backdrop rather than constraint. The storm recorder's dials and sensors are described but don't meaningfully limit Elias's choices—he climbs, descends, and walks freely. The rogue zone's "patch of darkness where streetlights flickered" is vivid but generic; the makeshift clinic interior is sketched without tactile grounding. Spatial choreography is clear, but environment doesn't pressure decisions at pivotal beats.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—exposing the quarantine zone—is signaled early and maintained. One tightening occurs when the recorder's biohazard alarm confirms the threat, narrowing Elias's options. However, escalation depends on coincidence: the woman emerges to guide him, hands him the vial, and provides the press as an off-page solution. The final choice to "deliver" the message lacks on-page cost; Elias smiles and adjusts his recorder, foreclosing no visible path. Agency is reactive rather than driven by protagonist decisions under the inferred causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Theme of integrity versus silence emerges from the quarantine plot, but the closure moralizes: "some truths are meant to be shared, not preserved" and "the quietest places often held the loudest truths" state rather than dramatize meaning. The storm-recorder motif recurs but doesn't accumulate pressure—it's mentioned at opening and ending without reweighting prior material. Elias's shift from "purity of data" to "defender of integrity" is declared in the final paragraphs rather than earned through specific contradictions. The engineered-flu reveal and the woman's plea lack complexity; the piece settles into a transparent thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping, and focalization through Elias's meticulousness is consistent. The woman's dialogue ("They're calling it a flu, but it's engineered") is functional but generic. Voice carries a slight formality ("credibly curious," "layered tranquility") that edges toward prompt-echo rather than Elias's lived idiom. Filter verbs ("He thought," "he realized") are acceptable in frequency, but peak beats rely on summary rather than immediate perception: "Her words hung in the air, a storm in themselves" tells rather than shows pressure. Distance is controlled, but the prose doesn't modulate rhythm under stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Clarity is generally maintained, but several artifacts dull momentum. "Credibly curious" (line 4) and "To nurture integrity in solitude" (line 5) read as prompt labels inserted mid-narrative. "Progressing laterally" (line 6) is announced rather than enacted. The final two paragraphs loop: "He'd always been a recorder of storms. Now, he was something more" is a paraphrase of the log entry just described. Stock phrases appear under pressure: "Her words hung in the air, a storm in themselves." Information density is moderate; transitional scaffolding ("As he neared," "Back in the courtyard") could compress. The closure beat itself—"some truths are meant to be shared, not preserved"—is an over-articulated thesis.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The premise—a storm recorder uncovers a government cover-up—follows a familiar whistleblower template without transformation. The pigeon-message device and brass recorder add steampunk texture but don't drive fresh causality. The woman in the lab coat is a stock ally; her respirator and tattered coat are convenience signals. Elias's arc from isolated scientist to defender tracks a predictable path, and the ending's triumph ("defender of integrity") lands without ambiguity or cost. No inflection reweights prior material; the piece executes the template but doesn't reimagine it.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elias's meticulousness is labeled ("his meticulousness a bulwark") and shown through adjustment of the recorder, but his choices are reactive rather than decision-driven. He follows the pigeon's message and the woman's lead without on-page deliberation that narrows options. The trait appears in setup and ending (adjusting the altitude sensor) but doesn't constrain a key turn with cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The message tube appears in beat 2 (pigeon arrival), drives the decision to investigate (beat 3), and is burned at closure (beat 8). However, the burn contradicts the "share" decision, and the tube itself is a delivery mechanism rather than a recurring object with reweighted meaning. Present in three functional beats but swappable with any message device.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The rogue quarantine zone is the dominant stake, signaled early (beat 2) and pursued through the middle (beats 4–6). It shapes Elias's tactics (rooftop survey, zone entry) and the ending log entry. However, the zone's mechanics are generic (biohazard, coughing patients) and resolved by an off-page press rather than on-page cost. Present across all three gates but lacks irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Credibly curious" appears as a label in beat 4 ("Credibly curious, Elias cross-referenced the note") but doesn't constrain an on-page action with cost. It describes his baseline behavior (cataloging storms) rather than enabling a specific tradeoff under pressure. Label-only presence without dramatized friction.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Intuit" appears twice: Elias intuits the quarantine is a lie (beat 4) and later acts on that inference. The action is summarized rather than dramatized—no on-page moment shows the deductive leap or cost of trusting intuition over data. The turn depends on the woman's exposition (beat 6) more than Elias's intuition. Present in setup and middle but swappable with "deduce" or "suspect."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Progressing laterally" is announced in beat 5 ("Progressing laterally, Elias abandoned his usual route") and shown through the rooftop detour. However, the method is declared rather than discovered, and the rooftop grants information (visual survey) without altering the zone's challenge. Present in one middle beat but doesn't shape closure or impose cost.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The courtyard is anchored at opening and closing, framing the journey. It provides the trellis for the rooftop detour (beat 5) and the fountain where the pigeon lands (beat 2). However, it functions as a return-point rather than a constraint—Elias leaves and returns without the space pressuring his choices. Lyric reprise reweights "tranquility" slightly ("seemed to approve") but the cost is conceptual rather than spatial.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"After being followed home" is mentioned in beat 1 ("He'd been followed home… by whispers") but never developed. No pursuer appears, and the sensation doesn't tighten decisions. The timeframe (dusk to night) is tracked loosely but doesn't impose a deadline or alter tactics. Present in setup as mood but absent from escalation and closure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"To nurture integrity in solitude" is stated in beat 4 ("To nurture integrity in solitude, Elias had always avoided politics") and referenced at closure ("a keeper of secrets, a defender of integrity"). The motivation is declared rather than dramatized through contradictory wants; Elias's shift from isolation to activism lacks visible cost. Present in setup and ending but told rather than constrained.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Layered tranquility" appears in the opening ("The quiet courtyard at dusk held a hush") and closing ("The courtyard's tranquility seemed to approve"), framing the piece. However, tone doesn't modulate under pressure—biohazard alarms and coughing patients are narrated in the same steady register. The final image asserts tranquility without charging it with prior cost. Lyric bookend without tonal escalation.</comment>
