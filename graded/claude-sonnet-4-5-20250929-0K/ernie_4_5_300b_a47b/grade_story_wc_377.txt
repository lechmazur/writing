<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation ("preserve the color of wonder") is declared rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. Her seasonally mute state is treated as a completed choice with no on-page cost or friction; the vow is backstory. The final bell-strike feels like a gesture rather than a choice that forecloses a path. Internal conflict is absent—she watches her creation without struggle or micro-decisions under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Orientation is clear by the opening. The piece follows an Accumulative lens: Elara finds fragment → builds sculpture → performs → fragment melts → final bell strike. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the symphony "transformed"), but the cost is conceptual and abstract—no visible forfeiture or change in Elara's options on the page. The final paragraph's "remind" and "released" are thematic assertions rather than dramatized consequences, weakening the closure's felt weight.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The bluff is vividly rendered with "mossy steps," "obsidian pedestal," and "prismatic shadows." Sensory detail is dense but becomes decorative rather than constraining choice. The iceberg fragment's cold "seep[s] into her skin," yet this does not alter her next action. The sculpture's mechanics are described extensively but do not narrow options or create friction. The setting charges the final image modestly but does not drive a key turn.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving wonder through her art—is signaled early but never tested. Elara encounters no obstacle; the fragment cooperates, the sculpture performs, visitors arrive and understand. No reversal or tightening narrows her options. The melting of the fragment is a natural process, not a consequence of her agency. The final bell-strike is a demonstration, not a choice under pressure, so escalation remains flat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Theme is overtly stated in the final two paragraphs: "remind," "color of wonder," "symphonies of truth." The piece tells rather than showing through image. "Silence and sound danced in perfect harmony" and "words had ceased to matter" are abstract declarations. The iceberg could have been a charged particular, but it dissolves without thematic friction. The ending moralizes ("testament to the symphonies of truth") instead of offering a resonant image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays clean with no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and consistent ("liquid light," "crescendo," "gilded the horizon"). Perceptual signature is lyric but generic; the voice could belong to any poeticized narrator. Register occasionally drifts into writerly abstraction ("color of wonder," "muted vigor") that feels imposed rather than character-rooted. Psychic distance is stable, but the narrator's way of noticing lacks idiosyncrasy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Prose is polished but over-written in key beats. "The air shimmered with secrets only the wind could interpret" and "notes that rippled through the mist like liquid light" stack metaphors without causal pressure. Paraphrase loop: paragraph four's "symphony was not just sound—it was truth" is restated as "unspoken wonders, the color of moments too fragile for words." Template cadence in final paragraph: "not something to be captured, but something to be released—over and over, like…like…like" creates mechanical rhythm. Figurative density in closure beat weakens propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The premise—mute artist creates kinetic sound sculpture—is fresh in combination, but the execution leans on abstraction ("symphonies of truth," "color of wonder") rather than specific lived detail. The iceberg fragment and bell-tuning are concrete, yet their interaction feels illustrative of theme rather than driven by character need. The ending's "testament" and "promise" are generic wisdom. No bold risk or unexpected synthesis; the arc follows a predictable demonstration pattern.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout. She tunes bells (opening), descends to find the fragment (early), builds the sculpture (middle), and strikes a bell (closure). However, most actions are setup or demonstration; only the final bell-strike could be a choice, but it reads as ritualistic confirmation rather than a decision that alters stakes. Two beats (find, build) but minimal causal pressure or cost. Swappable with "contemplative artist" archetype.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Iceberg fragment appears early (~15% in), is handled and placed on obsidian pedestal, sheds droplets that trigger the sculpture's performance (middle), and melts entirely before the final bell (closure). Three distinct beats with evolving state. Its cold and rhythm are noted but do not constrain Elara's choices. The fragment's dissolution is passive process, not cost. Strong setup and development, modest payoff; necessary but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Symphonies of truth" is named explicitly in the final paragraph and echoed in "truth made audible" earlier. It functions as thematic label rather than shaping on-page stakes. The sculpture plays music, but "truth" as a stake never faces friction or opposition. The concept is told, not dramatized through conflicting options or visible cost. Present and logically consistent, but swappable with "beauty" or "wonder" without structural change.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>Elara's "seasonally mute" state is established in paragraph two as a completed vow. She does not speak on the page, but this creates no conflict or trade-off in the story window. Visitors "tried to speak" and fall silent, but Elara's muteness does not enable or constrain her sculpture-building or final act. Label-only trait; no visible cost or tactical friction. Mentioned early but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Glisten" appears three times: the iceberg fragment glisten(s) when found, its surface "began to glisten" at the first performance, and the final line references "the glisten of ice." Early signal, middle beat, closure reprise. However, the glistening is description; it does not drive a turn or choice. The fragment's visual quality charges the final lyric image modestly. Purposeful recurrence but passive role; replaceable with "shimmer" or "shine."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Kinetic sculpture is introduced at ~35% ("Through kinetic sculpture, Elara transformed…"), described in detail (pendulums, chimes, water), and performs in the climax. Setup and development are clear, but the method does not constrain attempts or create friction. Elara's building process is summary; no on-page problem-solving. The sculpture's mechanics matter thematically but do not shape tactics. Functional, integral to premise, but mechanically passive.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The bluff is named in the opening line and provides spatial anchor throughout (mossy steps, obsidian pedestal, eaves for chimes). Visitors "climbed the bluff" to reach Elara. The setting is vivid but does not constrain choice or supply resources that alter outcome. "Above the clouds" and "whispering" are atmospheric descriptors. The bluff is the stage, not a pressure. Present across all beats but ornamental; replaceable with any remote elevated locale.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"After words become unnecessary" is stated in paragraph one as backstory context. The timeframe is not a live constraint; no ticking clock or urgent decision window. Elara's vow "when the last winter's frost clung to the bluff" is past tense. Days pass during the sculpture's performance, but this does not tighten tactics. The temporal setting is world-building, not plot pressure. Summary-only mention; no causal role.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"To preserve the color of wonder" is named in paragraph two and echoed in the final paragraph. Elara's motivation is told rather than tested. She builds the sculpture to "remind," but no friction arises between this want and a cost or obstacle. The desire shapes the premise but not the on-page choices. Declared early, thematically consistent, but abstract and unchallenged. Functional setup, minimal development, no payoff cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Muted vigor" is gestured at through restrained diction ("faint smile," "quiet anchor") and the contrast between silence and symphonic sound. Tone is consistent and modulates slightly (lyric opening → physical building → performance crescendo → reflective close). However, the modulation is structural rather than pressurized; tone does not charge the final image with new intensity. Coherent but static mood; no tonal turn that reconfigures stakes.</comment>
