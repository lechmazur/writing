<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lira's motivation to "photosynthesize pain into beauty" is present but remains primarily declarative rather than enacted through conflicted micro-choices. The insomnia dissolves offstage without on-page struggle or visible cost after centuries of pressure. Internal contradiction is gestured at ("shield" vs. "bridge") but not dramatized through simultaneous impulses acting in scene. The final stance—"shyly unstoppable certainty"—arrives without a credible forfeiture that closes off a prior path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens through centuries of migration, moss blooming, seed planting, and tree growth. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Lira singing into the wind with the tree responding, reweighting her silence into offering. However, the causal link between postcard arrival and moss bloom is elided, and the insomnia's dissolution happens offstage without a pivot moment. The postcard disappears and a seed appears with no on-page mechanism, weakening closure cost legibility despite the final image's resonance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The gargantuan shell, bioluminescent tides, moss-lined cavern, and indigo sea establish a vivid, coherent setting early. The shell's migration functions as backdrop pressure rather than constraint on choice. The tree's physical presence charges the final image (leaves singing in wind), satisfying the 9+ gate requirement that setting or object constrains choice or charges closure. Sensory detail is filtered through POV (reef-shadow joy, off-key wind) without catalog tourism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—turning pain into beauty—is signaled early but remains abstract across centuries. One meaningful deepening occurs when the postcard prompts Lira to venture outside and write bolder verses, yet the moss bloom and insomnia fade happen to her rather than through her agency. The tree's appearance is coincidental (seed replaces postcard), not driven by protagonist choice. The final act of singing is Lira's decision, but it does not foreclose a prior path with legible cost; pressure accumulates without a tightening that narrows options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The blossom armistice as truce between sorrow and dawn emerges from the postcard and recurs at closure when pain and beauty "coexist without silence or surrender." The tree as physical embodiment of centuries of longing anchors theme in image rather than statement. However, "photosynthesize pain into beauty" is stated twice without being fully dramatized through conflicting wants, and the final paragraph edges toward thematic summary ("she realized") instead of letting the singing image stand alone. The resonance is present but slightly over-articulated.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV remains stable in third-limited with consistent psychic distance and a distinct perceptual signature ("reef-shadow joy," "off-key wind," "shyly unstoppable"). Diction is controlled and voice-particular throughout. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping. Filter verbs ("noticed," "realized") appear at a few beats but do not flatten immediacy. The prose texture—lyric, patient, image-dense—matches the focalizer's artistic sensibility and holds under pressure without register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and figurative language is dense but mostly coherent ("bioluminescent tides painted the air," "ensconced in the arms of the sea"). Two coherence slips: "hands trembling as if the paper itself might dissolve" mixes agency (hands/paper), and "ensconced in the arms of the sea" at closure feels slightly stock. Template cadence appears in one run: "She described…she'd never dared…her poetry had always been…the postcard made her wonder" (four consecutive "she/her" stems). No paraphrase loops or major scaffold. Information density is high; momentum is steady but not propulsive. Minor figurative muddle and stem repetition prevent entry to 7.5+.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The insomniac poet in a shell home, galaxy postcard as messenger, and tree-of-longing image are imaginatively rendered and avoid close echoes of famous works. However, the core arc—artist receives mysterious message, plants symbolic seed, finds peace—follows a familiar template without a sharp transformation. The centuries-of-longing timeframe is bold but functions as backdrop rather than tightening constraint. Emotional specificity (moss blooming, tree singing) elevates above generic, yet the resolution into certainty and sleep feels tidier than the complexity of the premise warrants.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Lira is present throughout and makes two visible choices: venturing outside after the postcard arrives and planting the seed. Her decision to sing at closure shifts her from silent scribe to vocal participant. However, most major turns (moss blooming, insomnia fading, postcard vanishing) happen to her rather than from her agency. The trait "insomniac poet" frames the premise but does not constrain peak choices with cost. Setup and closure participation are present; middle development is weak.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The galaxy postcard appears early (first third), prompts Lira to venture outside (middle choice), and vanishes at closure to be replaced by the seed, reweighting its role as catalyst rather than keepsake. It is handled physically ("clutched it to her chest," "tucked it into the pocket") and returns in the moss-bloom beat. Its disappearance is plot-functional but not causally dramatized. All three gates present; causal pressure moderate; swappable for another message form with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Blossom armistice—a truce between sorrow and dawn" is named on the postcard and recurs at closure when Lira realizes pain and beauty can "coexist without silence or surrender." It shapes her realization and the final stance but does not constrain on-page tactics or choices in the middle. Setup and payoff are present; middle development absent. The concept functions as thematic frame rather than a resource or obstacle that alters decision paths.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Shyly unstoppable" appears once in the final third as a label for Lira's certainty. It is not demonstrated through contradictory actions (shy hesitation vs. unstoppable force) in any prior beat. No setup, no middle constraint, late label-only mention. The trait does not enable or foreclose a choice with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Ensconce" appears three times: Lira "ensconced herself in her work" during migration, poems are "ensconced in the arms of the sea" at closure, and the verb recurs thematically. The action of sheltering/embedding oneself is consistent with her shell-dwelling and her shift from hiding to offering. However, removing "ensconce" and replacing with "immerse" or "shelter" would not break story logic. Setup and closure participation present; middle beat is metaphoric rather than plot-driving.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The "half-sung lullabies carried on an off-key wind" appear early (first third), recur when Lira hears them during migration, and return at closure when her own song joins them and "the wind carried her song away." The wind as carrier is plot-functional (dispersing her poems, amplifying her voice) and charges the final image. Setup, middle mention, and payoff present. The method is lyric and atmospheric; its mechanics (how wind carries sound) are implied rather than specified, but it shapes the ending's resonance.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The gargantuan shell is established early as home and vessel, its annual migration provides the temporal frame, and its "central chamber" is where Lira plants the seed. The moss within the shell blooms and the tree grows there, directly shaping the physical transformation at closure. The shell's exterior (slick with salt, spirals humming) is handled in sensory detail. All three gates present; causal involvement solid. The shell is setting-as-container rather than setting-as-obstacle, but it constrains action spatially and charges the final image when the tree's roots anchor in "the shell's bones."</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Across centuries of longing" is stated in summary ("Days passed, then years, then centuries") but not tracked as a constraint that tightens choices. The timeframe establishes scale and mood but does not function as a clock that alters tactics or raises cost. Lira's insomnia persists "for centuries" and then fades in one paragraph without showing the accumulated toll forcing a decision. Setup present, middle and closure participation absent as live pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"To photosynthesize pain into beauty" is stated early and recurs when Lira writes "bolder" verses after the postcard and when she plants the seed. The motivation drives her centuries of work and the final act of singing. However, it is told twice and dramatized weakly; no on-page scene shows her choosing beauty over numbing or silence with a visible cost. Setup and closure present; middle friction minimal. The desire is consistent but not conflicted in a way that forces a trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Reef-shadow joy" appears early as descriptor of the bioluminescent tides and recurs implicitly in the moss glow and tree's iridescent seed. The tone is elegiac, patient, and tinged with melancholy-as-beauty throughout. It modulates only slightly (from solitary ache to communal offering) and charges the final image when Lira's "thin but steady" voice joins the wind. Setup and payoff present; middle modulation subtle. The tone is coherent but does not shift dramatically under pressure, remaining in a single register.</comment>
