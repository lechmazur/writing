<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is established but remains largely external (summoned, instructed by the covenant). His insight about the widow's husband's dishonesty drives the resolution, yet the protagonist feels more like a wise facilitator than someone with contradictory impulses under pressure. Lira's admission provides the key turn, but it arrives through Elias's prompting rather than dramatized internal struggle. The widow's crumpling face offers embodied emotion, but the repairman's calm competence throughout bypasses genuine mistakes or visible cost to his own stance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece anchors who/where/when cleanly within the opening paragraph. Closure lands on-page: the box plays true when Lira admits her husband's lie, fulfilling a Resonant Reconfiguration under a Causal lens (truth → stone flares → box repairs). The cost is legible—Lira must vocalize a painful truth—and the mechanics (starlight thread, tethering) follow established rules. One meaningful tightening occurs when Elias identifies the moral ailment and Lira's confession enables the repair. The lens holds without contradiction through the ending.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The resonance chamber is vividly rendered (copper walls, pulsed runes, syrup of sound) and constrains the repair: Elias uses its amplifying properties to guide his work. The chamber's hum modulates with action, supporting pressure. Spatial choreography is clear throughout (box on dais, widow at glass wall). The toolkit's exotic contents (obsidian needles, spun starlight, liquid silence) charge the tinkersong atmosphere and the starlight thread becomes a tactile agent in the climax, weaving through cracks to restore the box.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—repairing the "infected by midnight" music box—is signaled early and tightens when Elias diagnoses a moral ailment rather than mechanical failure. The widow's confession ("I knew he lied") is the hinge that enables resolution, narrowing options from mechanical fix to truth-telling. The cost is felt: Lira must vocalize her husband's cowardice and her own complicity in silence. One clear escalation occurs when the box's whine threatens permanence until truth is spoken. The protagonist's agency is diagnostic rather than renunciatory, which keeps the stake from reaching higher intensity.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the covenant's creed, the philosopher's stone as mirror rather than cure, and the motif of "midnight stealing light by convincing us to hide our shadows." The final image—the box playing true as a "tether between past and present, loss and hope"—reweights prior material without stating a moral. The stone chip's flare when Lira speaks truth embodies the core question (Can honesty restore what deception corrupted?) in a concrete, non-abstract moment. Subtext operates in Elias's calibrated pressure on the widow and the covenant's euphemisms. The piece avoids overt sermon.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable, filtering through Elias's expertise and the widow's grief without head-hopping. Elias's dialogue carries a calm, instructive cadence ("We don't repair the box—we realign its purpose") that distinguishes him from Lira's clenched brevity. Diction is elevated and consistent ("syrup of sound," "tethering," "wilted near his lies"), fitting a fabulist register. Filter verbs ("knew," "believed") appear but do not dull immediacy. The prose texture is controlled, though Elias's voice lacks idiosyncratic tics that would elevate distinctiveness. Psychic distance holds steady across beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully and figurative language is dense but mostly coherent ("air thickening into a syrup of sound," "star smothered by ash"). However, overwriting appears in stacked metaphors during high-pressure beats: "the covenant's creed was not just a philosophy but a kind of magic—one that mended not what was torn, but what had never been whole to begin with" adds exposition at closure rather than trusting the image. Minor loops: "the stone's fragments could only thrive where truth was tethered to action" and later "tethering… we realign its purpose" recycle the concept. The final paragraph's explanatory summary ("midnight steals light by convincing us…") tells rather than shows. Information density is high, but some sentences perform thematic work twice.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The premise—music box infected by moral dishonesty, repaired through confession—offers a fresh synthesis of steampunk craft and moral allegory. The covenant of rust and the philosopher's stone chip as lie-detector are specific, non-generic choices. The "mending what isn't torn" paradox and the resonance chamber's acoustic magic feel integrated rather than ornamental. Risk is present in the fabulist register and the choice to center truth-telling over mechanical puzzle-solving. However, the widow-as-confessor and wise-craftsman-as-healer are familiar archetypes, and the resolution (truth restores artifact) follows a well-trodden moral template. The piece transforms its materials through specificity but does not subvert expectations.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elias (music box repairman) is present from the opening and drives two key beats: diagnosing the moral ailment (middle) and weaving the starlight thread after Lira's confession (climax). His choice to press the widow for truth rather than attempt a mechanical fix alters tactics and enables closure. Setup and payoff are strong; middle development is diagnostic rather than decisively constrained. The role is essential but his expertise flows smoothly without visible personal cost or risk.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The philosopher's stone chip is established early (paragraph 3: hidden by husband, wilts near lies), flares when Lira confesses truth (paragraph 10: "the stone chip flared—a flicker of gold"), and is described as "steady and bright" at closure (paragraph 12). Three distinct beats: backstory setup, reactive flare as truth-detector, and final stabilization. The chip's property (wilts near dishonesty) constrains Elias's method and its brightness shift charges the ending. Irreplaceable: no generic gem could perform this moral-calibration function. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The covenant of rust is introduced early (paragraph 1: "secretive order of artisans who believed that decay held the key to preservation") and its creed is quoted. Elias identifies himself as covenant-trained and uses their term "tethering" during the repair (paragraph 6). The concept shapes stakes (elders declared the box "infected by midnight") and provides the philosophical frame ("mending what isn't torn"), but the covenant itself does not constrain a specific on-page choice with cost. It functions as worldbuilding and thematic anchor rather than active pressure. Present in setup and closure reflection but not middle development.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Wilts near dishonesty" is established in paragraph 3 (the stone "had wilted near his lies") and demonstrated on-page in paragraph 10 when the chip flares gold after Lira's truthful confession. The attribute constrains Elias's repair method: he must elicit truth rather than apply mechanical skill. The widow's admission is the cost-bearing action that enables the stone's restoration. Two beats (backstory explanation, live demonstration) and direct causal pressure on the climax. The trait is irreplaceable and charges the closure image.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Tether" appears as both concept (paragraph 6: "The covenant calls this tethering") and final image (paragraph 13: "its melody a tether between past and present, loss and hope"). Elias's action—weaving the starlight thread and "tethering" the box to truth—is the climactic repair that restores the music. The method is signaled in the middle, executed at the peak beat, and reprised metaphorically at closure. Two functional beats and closure linkage. Swappable with "bind" or "align" in some lines, but the resonance-chamber mechanics and the final metaphor give it earned specificity.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Mending what isn't torn" is the covenant's creed (paragraph 1), Elias's murmured motto (paragraph 4), and his explanation to Lira (paragraph 6: "requires unraveling the lies that bind it"). The method shapes his diagnostic approach—he identifies a moral rather than mechanical break—and the final reflection (paragraph 13) closes on "mended not what was torn, but what had never been whole." Strong thematic frame and closure reprise, but the actual repair involves conventional actions (needle, thread) rather than a unique technique tied to the paradox. The method is conceptual more than procedural.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The resonance chamber is established in the opening line and used throughout: its hum amplifies Elias's adjustments (paragraph 4), he presses his palm to the wall to intensify the effect (paragraph 4), and the chamber's resonance shifts with the repair's progress (paragraphs 11–12). The dais, runes, and copper walls are tactile anchors. The setting constrains method—Elias needs the chamber's acoustic properties to "realign" the box—and the chamber's "low, resonant chord" at closure signals success. Three distinct beats, strong causal pressure, and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"In the balance" appears in the final sentence: "in the balance of that moment, Elias knew the covenant's creed…" The phrase serves as lyric accent rather than temporal constraint. No ticking clock or urgency shapes decisions; the repair unfolds at a contemplative pace. The timeframe is more thematic (a threshold moment) than structural. Present at closure but does not pressure choices or tactics elsewhere.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"To reclaim the light stolen by midnight" is Elias's stated goal (paragraph 7: "To reclaim the light stolen by midnight, you must first admit what was taken"). The motivation drives his method (eliciting confession) and is fulfilled when the stone chip's light is restored (paragraph 10: flare of gold; paragraph 12: "steady and bright"). Friction exists—Lira must pay the cost of admission—but Elias himself faces no competing desire or sacrifice tied to this motivation. Two beats (declaration, fulfillment) and closure linkage, yet the protagonist's want is never tested against a personal cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Tinkersong wonder" coheres through brass goggles, obsidian needles, spun starlight, liquid silence, and the chamber's musical hum. The tone modulates from mystery (opening atmosphere) to instruction (Elias's explanations) to quiet triumph (the lullaby's return). Diction remains elevated and fabulist throughout ("syrup of sound," "threads of spun starlight"), supporting the tone without ironic deflation. The final image—melody as tether, covenant's creed as magic—charges closure with the promised wonder. Tone is consistent and purposeful, though the contemplative pacing risks flattening urgency in the middle beats.</comment>
