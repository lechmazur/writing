<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is clear and rooted in childhood memory, and her final choice to burn the film negative and take the locket shows agency. However, the interiority leans heavily on poetic abstraction ("walls dream," "passage's face") without sharp internal conflict or contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The climactic moments—placing the negative in the fireplace, finding the locket—feel more like symbolic gestures than choices that foreclose a path with visible cost. Embodied emotion is present but sometimes diluted by elevated diction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story establishes who/where/when by the first paragraph and maintains a coherent Accumulative/Textural lens: density increases through layered discovery (diaries, fireplace debris, locket), and the final image (grandmother's photo, "You are the map") reweights the opening question with conceptual cost. The closure qualifies as Conceptual Repricing—the legacy's burden shifts from uncovering secrets to carrying them forward—and the cost is felt in Lira's act of burning the negative. One meaningful deepening occurs when she realizes the walls' dreams are not separate from her own, narrowing her interpretive frame and charging the ending.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The ivy-veiled passage is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (wet earth, iron, moss, soot-stained glass) and the setting constrains choice: the fireplace holds the diaries, the ivy parts to reveal the alcove. The passage's physical state—walls humming, stones grinding—applies pressure and the micro-setting (fireplace, locket, film negative) charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clean, and the climate-shifted world is anchored early without excess exposition. The body and recurring objects (locket, negative) function as micro-setting that shapes the ending.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—discovering what walls dream about—is signaled early and deepens when Lira realizes the dreams are her own. The walls' groaning and the ivy's shudder add situational pressure, and her decision to burn the negative and take the locket narrows options. However, the escalation relies more on atmospheric accumulation than protagonist-driven reversals; the diaries and locket appear as discoveries rather than choices that alter tactics. The cost at closure is conceptual (accepting the burden) but not sharply visceral or foreclosing a live alternative with felt tradeoff.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the passage's "living architecture," the diaries' legacy burden, and the film negative's ghost-of-what-was. The final image—"You are the map"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting the opening question and Lira's inheritance. Subtext operates in gesture (burning the negative, the locket's warmth) and the passage's voice ("a throat, and we are the food"). Minor penalty for one moment of near-thematic echo: "The legacy's burden is not in the keeping, but in the sharing" reads slightly prompt-declarative, though it is embedded in the found diary and does not occur in the final paragraph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature (cartographer's spatial attention, textural sensitivity). Diction is elevated and lyric-consistent, though at peak moments ("The corridor's echo had found its voice") the voice tilts slightly toward thesis statement rather than embodied perception. No dialogue is present. Filter verbs ("sensing," "thought of") are minimal and voice-motivated. The prose reflects Lira's contemplative stance, but under peak stress (walls groaning) the compression is modest and the rhythm does not sharply accelerate. No head-hopping or POV leakage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and clarity is generally high, but figurative density is heavy throughout ("question mark," "spine of a forgotten map," "mosaic of cracks and growth," "dreams were not separate," "hum in her bones") without pattern-teaching or sharp pressure payoff. Some scaffold remains: "She'd come here to discover" and "Now, with the world reshaped" are expository anchors. The final beat ("The corridor's echo had found its voice") reads as explanatory summary rather than image. Minor paraphrase loop: "Let it burn, she thought. Let it become part of the walls' memory" restates the same intent. Deduction: −0.6 for figurative density without escalation payoff, −0.3 for scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The cartographer-of-echoes premise and the walls-as-memory conceit offer a fresh angle, and the film negative's role (ghost of light, sacrificial offering) is specific. However, the emotional arc—solitary explorer discovers ancestor's legacy and accepts burden—follows a recognizable template without sharp transformation. The diaries and locket provide closure via inheritance rather than a non-obvious synthesis. The ending's "You are the map" risks abstraction, though it is grounded in the locket and photo. No proximity issues with famous lines, but the piece does not take bold structural or moral risks that elevate ingenuity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lira is present throughout and her choices (sifting debris, burning the negative, taking the locket) create the final turn. Setup is immediate, development occurs mid-story (reading diaries, placing negative), and she is causally active at closure. However, much of her arc is observation and realization rather than decisions that narrow options under pressure. Two beats (burning negative, taking locket) show agency, pushing the score into mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The film negative strip appears early (first paragraph, in her pocket), is handled twice (second paragraph thought, final act of burning), and returns with reweighted meaning (becomes part of walls' memory). However, its mechanics are thin—"a ghost of what once was"—and it does not constrain a mid-story choice. Closure participation is present (she places it in the fireplace) but the act feels symbolic rather than causally necessary. Two-beat use with lyric reprise, but low specificity and no middle constraint.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Legacy's burden" is introduced in the diaries ("The legacy's burden is not in the keeping, but in the sharing"), tested when Lira contemplates her grandmother's film negative, and resolved at closure when she accepts the burden ("to carry them forward, to let the past hum in her bones"). It shapes the dominant stake and alters her final choice (burning the negative, taking the locket). Setup, development, and payoff gates are met, and the concept drives the ending's reconfiguration. Modest specificity and visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Sensitively perceptive" appears once as a direct label ("her fingers sensitively perceptive to the textures") in the fireplace scene. It enables discovery (brittle paper, melted wax, locket) but is not foregrounded early, does not constrain a choice with visible tradeoff, and does not return at closure. Present in one beat, functional but replaceable with "careful" or "attentive." Missing setup and payoff gates; cap at 4.6 for missing setup, small lift for functional middle use.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Glimpse" is the stated goal ("to discover what walls dream about—to glimpse") and frames the opening and final realization ("she understood: the dreams were not separate from her own"). It shapes the dominant stake and charges the ending when she glimpses her grandmother in the locket photo and hears the whisper. However, the action itself is observation rather than a decisive physical act; it does not constrain mid-story tactics. Setup and payoff are strong, but development is passive. One causal beat at closure, lyric reprise.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The half-burned diaries in the fireplace are discovered mid-story (setup), provide key knowledge (the cartographer's legacy, the walls' memory), and their content directly shapes Lira's final choice to burn the negative in the same fireplace (payoff). The method is specific and irreplaceable: the diaries' existence and their location teach her the legacy's burden and prime the symbolic act. Two beats (discovery, application) with strong causal pressure. Modest cost linkage (understanding precedes sacrifice).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The ivy-veiled passage is present throughout, its physical state (groaning walls, shuddering ivy, hidden alcove) drives pressure and revelation, and it is charged at closure ("The corridor's echo had found its voice"). Setup is immediate, development includes the walls' reaction and the alcove's reveal, and the ending ties the passage's voice to Lira's realization. Two beats with causal pressure and closure linkage. Spatial details (fireplace, alcove) alter tactics and discoveries.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"After the climate shifts" is mentioned twice (first paragraph anchor, diary date "the year the climate shifted") and establishes the world's present state (ivy grown bold, earth's patience not infinite). However, it does not tighten decisions or create a live clock; it functions as backdrop rather than pressure. No middle constraint or payoff beat. Setup only, no development or closure participation. Cap at 4.6 for missing setup (it is present but not before the 20% mark in functional terms), further lowered for ornamental use.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The motivation "to discover what walls dream about" is established in the first paragraph (rooted in childhood stories), drives Lira's presence in the passage, and is resolved at closure when she realizes the dreams are her own and accepts the burden. It shapes the dominant stake across all three gates (setup, development via diary reading, payoff in the final realization and locket scene). Two beats of friction (sifting debris, confronting the walls' voice) and clear cost at closure (acceptance of legacy). Strong causal role.</comment>
