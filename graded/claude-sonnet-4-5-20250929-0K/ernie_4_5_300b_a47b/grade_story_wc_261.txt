<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to decode her mother's death drives her into the tower, but her interior life leans heavily on label-speak ("raw and hyperaware," "accidentally telepathic") without embodied contradiction. The scar functions more as thematic device than lived constraint—she never makes a micro-choice shaped by physical pain or limitation. The final "smile, her heart light" resolves grief too tidily without visible renunciation or ongoing cost, undercutting the earned-stasis claim.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The piece opens with adequate spatial/temporal anchors (tower at dawn, post-surgery). The tunnel descent through coffee-ring portals provides a causal spine, but the hourglass shattering and Mara's return to the tower reads as convenient reset rather than earned closure—no on-page cost or foreclosed path is legible in "her heart light for the first time in years." The closure effect (supposed Resonant Reconfiguration) lacks the undeniable pressure or felt sacrifice required; she gains insight without visible trade-off, violating the cost-proof test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The tower, frosted hourglass, and tunnel mosaic are vivid and purposefully strange. Sensory detail is selective (damp stone, frosted crackle, fogging breath) and the coffee rings function as portals, a micro-setting choice that drives the middle sequence. However, spatial choreography grows vague in the tunnel—her body's interaction with the rings and chamber lacks tactile grounding, and the final return to the tower skips over how she exits the collapsed tunnel.</comment>

<queue>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—learning to read scars and find closure—is signaled early. The tunnel descent offers one meaningful tightening (visions force her to relive trauma), but the resolution arrives without visible cost: the hourglass shatters off-page agency, and Mara emerges smiling with no path foreclosed or price paid. The plants' whispers guide rather than oppose, flattening conflict into a puzzle-box rather than pressure that forces trade-offs.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Theme (scars as stories, honoring the past without being chained) emerges from concrete image work and the coffee-ring structure. The hourglass-as-miracle motif recurs with shifting weight. However, the final paragraph's "to honor the past without being chained to it" borders on summary moralizing, and "The displaced miracle had finally found its place" is a near-explicit thematic claim that replaces scene pressure. The piece invites reflection but edges toward stating rather than earning its insight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with strong perceptual anchoring ("her breath fogging," "the scar throbbed"). The plants' whispered dialogue is stylized but consistent. However, the prose occasionally drifts into elevated register ("anesthesia from her surgery," "meteor hush") that sits oddly against Mara's raw grief, and the final "meteor hush" phrase feels imported rather than voice-native. Free indirect distance is clean; no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and imagery is vivid, but several passages loop: "The scars weren't just maps of loss; they were bridges" restates earlier material, and the plant whispers repeat similar syntax across beats (*They know*, *Follow the rings*, *This is how it happened*). The phrase "the displaced miracle had finally found its place" in the final paragraph is both a thematic echo and a paraphrase loop. Figurative density is high but occasionally mixed (frost "releasing a hum," sand "swirling like a storm" then "forming images"). No severe clarity breaks, but cumulative template cadence and synonym churn ("trembling… gasping… stumbled") dull momentum in the middle third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The coffee-ring portals and plant telepathy offer surface novelty, but the emotional arc—grieving daughter seeks closure in magical space, relives trauma, emerges healed—follows a familiar template without transformation. The hourglass and tunnel function as quest objects rather than constraints with cost. Swapping coffee rings for mirror shards or changing plants to wind-whispers would leave the structure intact, signaling insufficient specificity. The ending's tidy emotional resolution and stated theme lower originality further.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Mara's role as closure-seeker frames the story and she descends the tunnel by choice, but her agency is passive observation—she watches visions triggered by the rings rather than making contested decisions. The final "smile" suggests change but no on-page action or renunciation is tied to her choice. Present throughout but functional without driving reversals.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The frosted hourglass appears in the opening (she traces it), triggers the tunnel opening (frost crackles), and shatters at the climax. Three beats, but its shattering feels decorative rather than causally active—Mara does not break it or use it to make a trade-off. It anchors the premise but does not constrain her final stance.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>The "displaced miracle" is named twice (opening and closing) as thematic label but never dramatized as a constraint or tactical element. The reader cannot point to a moment where the miracle's displaced nature shapes Mara's choice or forecloses an option. Ornamental rather than structural.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Plant telepathy is declared in the first paragraph ("accidentally telepathic with the ivy") and the plants whisper guidance across three beats, but their messages are ambient rather than conflicting or costly. Mara never chooses between plant advice and her own impulse, and the trait does not limit her. Label-only with no visible trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The tunnel appears when the hourglass cracks, structures the middle descent, and ends in the chamber. Two of three gates (setup, development, closure nearby). The tunnel's coffee-ring mosaic drives her vision sequence, making it essential to the middle arc. However, the ending happens after she exits, weakening closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Coffee rings line the tunnel walls and trigger Mara's visions when she examines them—setup and two middle beats. The method shapes her exploration tactics (she pauses, traces rings, is transported). However, the final hourglass shattering bypasses the rings entirely, and the closing paragraph does not return to the method, capping closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The quiet tower at dawn frames the opening and closing and provides the spatial anchor. The tower calls to her (motivation link) and the windows' twilight-to-dawn shift bookends the story. However, the tower itself does not constrain her choices—she could conduct the same journey in a library or ruin. Atmospheric but replaceable in function.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.7</grade><comment>"After the anesthesia wears off" is mentioned in the first paragraph but never tracked or pressured. Mara does not race a clock, fight fatigue, or feel the surgery wound limit her movement. The timeframe is declared but functionally absent from tactics and closure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"To learn to read the stories in scars" is stated early and drives her tower visit. The desire is tested when visions force her to relive trauma, and the ending claims she now "read[s] the stories in scars… with pride." Two gates (setup, closure participation) with middle friction. However, the friction is observational rather than a conflicted choice between competing wants, capping causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Meteor hush" appears once in the final paragraph as a descriptor ("The tower's quiet settled around her, a meteor hush"), offering a lyric reprise of the opening "quiet tower." The tone is contemplative and consistent, but the phrase itself does not modulate with pressure or charge the closure image—it ornaments rather than reweights. Functional atmosphere but not indispensable.</comment>
