<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lira's motivation to find truth is clear and embodied through methodical action (stamp ritual, sketching grooves). Interior reflection is substantial but anchored to present stimuli and yields micro-choices (following the sound, opening the vault). The final renunciation—leaving the vault ajar, choosing to share rather than hoard—feels earned, though the emotional cost remains more stated than viscerally shown. Minor register drift into elevated diction ("tranquilly perceptive," "dappled resolve") weakens voice specificity under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with causal beats. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land by ~100 words. The blackout-to-vault sequence tightens causally: sound → door → pattern → journal. Closure is Conceptual Repricing (city sank from denial, not disaster) with conceptual cost legible in the journal reveal and Lira's decision to share. One micro turn (realizing the blackout wasn't accidental) deepens stakes. The final swim-home image reweights the opening but the cost feels more thematic than visceral on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The sunken library is vividly rendered with sensory specificity (bloated spines, bioluminescent algae, slick stairs) and constrains choice (the blackout forces alternative perception, the dry vault preserves the journal). Spatial choreography tracks cleanly. The stamp's owl crest aligning with the door indentation is a micro-setting constraint that enables the vault opening. Minor deduction: "dappled resolve" as a visual descriptor is ornamental metaphor rather than concrete detail filtered through POV bias.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (trace honest origins) is signaled early and tightens once: the vault discovery narrows options from passive cataloging to active witness-bearing. The protagonist's sketch-and-stamp action opens the door, demonstrating agency. The journal reveal reweights the city's fall from external disaster to internal denial, a meaningful deepening. The final choice to share (leaving the door ajar, taking the journal) forecloses solitary preservation with felt cost in the swim home. No secondary antagonist, but the city's buried truth supplies coherent pressure throughout.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Theme (truth vs. denial, honest origins) emerges through concrete particulars: the hidden journal, the vault's engineering, Elara's confession. The ending offers a non-literal answer via the swim home and "Some darknesses, once faced, become light." However, the final paragraph edges into thematic summary ("not as a warning, but as a reclaimed stillness") that replaces scene pressure with assertion. The owl-crest motif recurs but its thematic weight is more decorative than causally charged at closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Single POV, stable distance, no head-hopping. Voice carries a distinct texture ("tranquilly perceptive," methodical observation) but register drifts into elevated diction ("dappled resolve," "reclaimed stillness") that feels imposed rather than character-organic, especially under the stress of discovery. Perceptual signature (indexer's eye for grooves, patterns) is consistent. Psychic distance widens appropriately in reflection. No dialogue. Minor deduction for phrase recycling ("tranquilly perceptive" appears twice, "dappled resolve" used as both visual and conceptual shorthand).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high (vault sequence, journal entries). Clarity is strong; spatial choreography tracks. However, ornamental phrases recur: "dappled resolve" (visual then thematic), "tranquilly perceptive" (twice), and elevated metaphor ("resolve" as light pattern) that blurs rather than sharpens the image. The stamp's function is clear, but "a silent plea to trace honest origins" over-explains interiority. Minimal loops; no major scaffold. One paraphrase slip (blackout crept/swallowed in opening lines) does not obscure causality. Overall propulsion is solid but figurative language clusters without pattern-teaching.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The sunken-library premise and truth-vs.-denial theme are familiar; transformation comes through specific details (bioluminescent algae, bronze door puzzle, stamp-as-key). The twist (city sank from lies, not disaster) is non-obvious and earned in hindsight via the journal. However, the emotional arc (lone archivist discovers suppressed history) follows a recognizable template without bold risk. The owl-stamp mechanic and vault-opening sequence provide fresh inflection within the familiar frame. Commitment to premise is full; no safety hedging.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Lira's indexer training shapes her methodical approach (sketching grooves, aligning the stamp) and the decision to "readjust her approach" when the blackout reveals the vault. Present in opening, middle problem-solving, and closure (sharing vs. hoarding). Her logic-driven choices create two key turns: following the sound and opening the vault. The final swim-home choice is hers, though the cost is more conceptual than immediate.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Stamp introduced early (salvaged ritual), handled in two beats (chest-clutch during the groan, door-opening alignment), and carried to closure ("adjusted her grip"). Its owl crest enables the vault door via physical alignment, a causal beat. However, symbolic weight ("symbol of vigilance") is asserted rather than charged by prior action. Swappable with any carved key without major rewrite; specificity (owl vs. other icon) does not alter outcome.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Reclaimed stillness" appears as thematic label in the final paragraph ("as a reclaimed stillness: a chance to rebuild") but does not shape on-page stakes or tactics earlier. The concept is told rather than dramatized. Lira's vault discovery and decision to share align thematically but the phrase itself is ornamental. Late first explicit mention, no middle development, closure participation is label-only.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Tranquilly perceptive" is asserted twice as label (opening gaze, journal reading) but does not constrain or enable a choice with visible cost. The trait describes her method (adjusting to gloom, reading scrawl) but remains interchangeable with "calm" or "observant." No moment where this exact combination of tranquility + perception creates a trade-off or alters tactics under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Readjust" is signaled mid-story when Lira realizes the blackout's significance and shifts from cataloging to problem-solving (sketching the door pattern). The action drives the vault-opening beat. However, the term itself is generic; "reconsider" or "pivot" would serve equally. Present in middle escalation and implied in the final stance (leaving the door ajar, choosing transparency). Two-gate presence (middle, closure implication) but modest causal weight.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Alternative hypotheses" is named once when Lira considers the vault's purpose ("this wasn't just a library—it was a vault"). The method shapes her sketch-and-align approach (testing the door pattern) but mechanics remain vague. No early signal or explicit return. One middle beat where it matters, but the term could be cut without restructuring the scene. Functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The forgotten library inside the sunken city frames all action: blackout removes electric light (forcing tactile navigation), water-damaged shelves guide her search, the dry vault preserves the journal, and algae-slick stairs slow the exit. Present in opening, pressures middle choices (following the groan, kneeling at the door), and charges the final image (wading through shallows, moonlight on water). The setting is irreplaceable; a surface archive would erase the discovery's logic and atmospheric weight.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The blackout is present from the opening line, removes electric light (enabling moonlight navigation), and persists through closure ("the blackout had stripped away distractions"). It tightens decisions by forcing reliance on touch and ambient light, shaping the vault discovery. However, no live clock or urgency escalation; time passage is unmeasured. Two-gate presence (setup, closure framing) but minimal middle pressure beyond initial constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Lira's desire "to trace honest origins" is stated early and dramatized through her ritual (stamping pages), vault search, and journal discovery. The motivation drives two key beats (following the sound, opening the vault) and is reweighted at closure when she finds "the honest origin she'd sought—not a grand tale...but a quiet confession." Friction between the ideal (heroic truth) and reality (failure) is legible. The final choice (sharing vs. secrecy) grows from this want with visible cost in the swim home.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Dappled resolve" appears in the opening (moonlight visual) and closing (moonlight + determination), creating a purposeful reprise. However, "resolve" is asserted rather than modulated under pressure; Lira remains steadily determined throughout with minimal tonal shift during the vault discovery or journal reading. The phrase functions as bookend rather than dynamic tonal guide. Present but static; lyric resonance is partial.</comment>
