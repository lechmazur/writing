<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation (discovering time's texture) is established early and drives her use of the fragment, but her internal contradiction remains abstract—she studies photographs yet dismisses legends without embodied friction. The retrocognitive visions are label-heavy ("retrocognitively trapped," "hyperbolic geometry") rather than showing how this constraint forces micro-choices under pressure. The final shift from "texture to be touched" to "story to be told" reads as an asserted epiphany rather than one earned through visible cost; no prior choice is foreclosed on the page. Emotional embodiment is thin: "head spun," "fell to her knees" are stock reactions that don't reveal character-particular processing of the disintegration.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: visions layer, the fragment pulses, photographs flicker, then the garden reforms with the images "stabilized." Orientation is clear by the first paragraph (who, where, when). However, the closure moment—photographs now glowing, visions replaced by "quiet certainty"—lacks visible cost: Elara leaves smiling with a plan to design a memorial maze, but no path is foreclosed, no resource spent, no relationship altered. The fragment becomes "dull and inert," yet this loss doesn't constrain her next move. The resonant reconfiguration is gestured at ("time wasn't a texture...but a story") but the conceptual repricing is told rather than made undeniable through image or action.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The living bridge garden is vividly rendered with sensory specificity: vines that pulse, ivy that hums, paths with hyperbolic geometry, and the scent of ozone and old paper during the climax. The garden's geometry changes under Elara's will (paths stretching, bridge arching), which supports her experiment, but these transformations don't constrain a tactical choice—they illustrate her success without friction. The fragment and photographs function more as thematic objects than spatial constraints that alter her moves. Strong atmospheric control and selective detail, but the environment doesn't pressure a decision at the closure beat, keeping this in the mid-6s.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—discovering time's texture—is signaled early and pursued through a single escalating action: placing the fragment on the bench, triggering visions, causing the garden's disintegration, then its reformation. The piece lacks a meaningful reversal or tightening that narrows options; Elara's action succeeds without a visible tradeoff. The "quaking reverie" passes, leaving her with clarity and a new goal, but no prior want is sacrificed, no cost paid that alters her tactics. The escalation is atmospheric (visions surge, bridge collapses) but not causal in the chosen Accumulative lens: the density increase doesn't foreclose a path or force a hard choice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the interplay of photographs, memory, and time's fabric, avoiding overt statement until the final reflection. The recurring motifs (photographs, fragment, Clara's life) accumulate meaning, and the closing insight—"time wasn't a texture...but a story"—reweights the premise. However, this reweighting is asserted in narration rather than demonstrated through a non-literal final image. The piece resists tidy morals and embraces ambiguity (the fragment's purpose, Clara's fate), but the ending paragraph edges toward thematic summary ("she'd design one to remember") rather than letting the images speak.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited on Elara; perceptual signature is consistent (traces cracks, notes scents, sees flashes). Diction is controlled and purposeful, with a distinct lyric texture ("petals unfolded in slow-motion symphonies," "invisible hand"). However, elevated register occasionally drifts into abstraction that doesn't match urgent stakes: "hyperbolic geometry" and "retrocognitively trapped" read as prompt-labels rather than Elara's lived idiom under stress. No dialogue to evaluate. Psychic distance is appropriate, but the final paragraph's clarity ("She understood now") feels too complete, flattening the ambiguity built earlier.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and rhythmically varied, with strong figurative language ("edges curled like dry leaves," "bridge arching upward like a question mark"). However, scaffold and paraphrase loops appear: "She'd spent months studying its design, noting how the paths curved...how the hedges seemed to bend light" restates observation without adding pressure. The phrase "disintegration" is used three times in close proximity (title requirement), but the repetition feels mechanical rather than patterned. Stock embodiment ("head spun," "fell to her knees") in the climax dulls immediacy. Information density is high in the opening but thins at closure, where summary replaces scene work.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The premise—time as fabric, living architecture, retrocognitive visions—combines familiar speculative elements (memory magic, sentient gardens, artifact fragments) without a fresh inflection. Elara's profession (hedge maze designer) and goal (discover time's texture) feel assembled from the prompt rather than integrated into a singular vision. The transformation at the end (photographs stabilized, visions replaced by clarity) lacks the specificity or surprise that would distinguish this from template time-travel/memory stories. The Victorian woman Clara is glimpsed but remains a stock figure; her narrative doesn't complicate Elara's arc in a non-obvious way.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Hedge maze designer is present as Elara's occupation and frames her final goal (design a maze "to remember"), but it doesn't drive on-page choices. Her maze-design thinking (observing paths, curves, geometry) informs her study of the garden but doesn't constrain her use of the fragment or alter tactics. The profession returns at closure but functions as thematic echo rather than causal lever. Functional but replaceable with "architect" or "historian."</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Halo fragment appears in three beats: Elara withdraws it, places it on the bench to trigger visions, then picks it up "dull and inert" at the end. It enables the climactic action (disintegration/reformation) and its state change signals closure. However, the fragment's mechanics are vague ("pulsed faintly," "resonate"), and its loss of power doesn't constrain Elara's next move—she leaves with clarity intact. The fragment shapes two key turns but its specificity (why a halo fragment versus any artifact?) is ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Fading photographs are central: Elara studies them in the opening, believes they are keys, places the fragment beside the oldest one to trigger the climax, and they reappear "crisp and clear" at closure, signaling time's stabilization. Their decay mirrors her fragmented visions; their restoration anchors the ending's conceptual shift. The photographs constrain her experimental method (she chooses the oldest) and their transformation provides the story's decisive change. Essential across beats and ending.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Retrocognitively trapped" is labeled in paragraph two and used to explain Elara's visions, but it doesn't constrain an on-page choice or impose visible cost. The visions surge during the climax and vanish at the end, but this change happens to her rather than forcing a tradeoff. The attribute is described ("memories she'd never lived," "visions surged") but not dramatized as a tactical constraint. Present and logically consistent, but replaceable with generic "psychic sensitivity."</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Disintegrate drives the climax: the photograph disintegrates into dust, Elara intends to "disintegrate the barrier," the bridge collapses into sparks, and the garden "disintegrates" before reforming. This action defines the story's major turn—destruction followed by stabilized renewal—and is irreplaceable. The mechanics are atmospheric rather than causally tight (what exactly disintegrates, and why does it reform?), preventing a higher score. Still, the action is essential to both escalation and closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Through hyperbolic geometry" appears twice: Elara notes the garden's "hyperbolic geometry" in paragraph four and thinks "*Through hyperbolic geometry*, I can unravel time's threads" in paragraph seven. The method is asserted but not demonstrated—how does hyperbolic geometry enable disintegration? The phrase functions as a prompt-label rather than a mechanical constraint that shapes her attempts. Mentioned in two beats, but its role is ornamental and easily swappable with "arcane mathematics" or "dimensional folding."</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Living bridge garden is introduced immediately and supplies vivid micro-setting: vines that pulse, ivy that hums, shifting planks, paths with impossible angles. The garden's geometry responds to Elara's action (vines retract, paths stretch, bridge collapses then reforms), making it an active participant rather than backdrop. It constrains her experiment (she chooses this location for its magic and design) and the garden's reformation provides the closure image. The setting is essential across beats and shapes the ending's charge.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>N/A</grade>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Motivation—to discover the texture of time—is stated in paragraph four and drives Elara's use of the fragment. The desire is pursued through one escalating action (triggering visions and disintegration) and the ending reflects a shift ("time wasn't a texture...but a story"). However, the motivation is told rather than shown through conflicted choices: no competing want or fear creates friction. Elara succeeds without sacrificing another goal, so the desire's cost is conceptual rather than felt. Functional and closure-linked, but lacks on-page tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Quaking reverie" is named once in the penultimate paragraph ("The quaking reverie had passed") and evoked through the visions' intensity, the garden's shuddering, and Elara's disorientation. Tone is dreamlike and lyric, with elevated diction and sensory immersion, modulating appropriately during the climax. However, the tone is more atmospheric than structurally integrated—it describes the experience rather than constraining choice. The final shift to "quiet certainty" feels tonal rather than causal. Present in escalation and closure, but the tone could be replaced with "hallucinatory crisis" without breaking logic.</comment>
