<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to "harness the ephemeral" is declared but never dramatized through contradictory impulses or genuine struggle—she moves through the temple on rails. The vial-triggered memory flood (mother's lullaby, unseen shore, unworn crown) reads as ornamental rather than complicating her present choice. The final "letting go" arrives without visible cost; no live option is foreclosed on the page. Interiority leans on stock phrasing ("breath fogged," "pressure squeezing her ribs") and the epiphany about the temple being a memory-prison lacks prior character work to earn it.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors arrive clearly (underwater temple, distress signal, three days). The piece attempts a Causal lens but the core turn—Mara placing the vial and "letting it go"—is unmotivated by prior beats; she enters wanting to decode/harness and exits having released with no on-page reversal or trade-off that changes her stance. The hush "shattering" and voices dissolving happens to her rather than through her agency. Cost is asserted ("lesson remained") but not dramatized in a specific forfeiture or altered tactic. The closure reads as summary rather than a decisive change with visible price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The underwater temple supplies vivid, purposeful detail: algae-slick stone, bioluminescent dome, jagged fissure, shifting liquid symbols on the pedestal. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly through the descent and chamber entry. The vial's warmth and scent constrain Mara's tactical choice to uncork it at the pedestal, charging the climax. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency (pressure on ribs, salt-sting). The setting does meaningful work but stops short of the 7+ threshold because the final image (dawn piercing clouds) is generic and the pedestal mechanism feels convenient rather than seeded.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—decode the temple before the storm floods it—is signaled early but never tightens into a forced trade-off. Mara's instinct to smash the vial is overridden in one line without visible cost, and the storm above never materializes as on-page pressure. The "unsnarling" of voices is a told intensification rather than a dramatized escalation that narrows options. The protagonist's final act (placing the vial, swimming up) lacks agency; the hush dissolves on its own and she simply witnesses. No credible loss or forfeiture alters her tactics.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Theme—some things are meant to be released rather than trapped—emerges from the priests' backstory and Mara's final choice, avoiding overt moralizing. The vial and hush function as concrete anchors for the ephemeral/permanence tension. However, the ending's thematic statement ("some things are meant to be unsnarled, not held") edges toward on-the-nose articulation, and the priests' terror/regret montage is summary rather than earned through prior scene pressure. The final image (empty but radiant vial, dawn rays) offers lyric resonance but the conceptual cost remains abstract.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Mara with consistent psychic distance. Perceptual signature is character-specific (algae-slick, bioluminescence, salt-sting) and diction remains within her register. Filter verbs ("felt," "knew") are used sparingly and voice-motivated. The priests' vision sequence maintains clear focalization as received memory rather than head-hopping. Minor slips: "lonesome splendor" in the final paragraph reads as authorial intrusion rather than Mara's idiom, and the line "She'd harnessed the ephemeral, not by trapping it, but by letting it go" is over-articulated exposition that breaks the prior perceptual texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Line-level clarity is generally strong with varied syntax and concrete verbs. The opening anchors voice and stakes efficiently. Specific weaknesses: paraphrase loop in paragraph two ("hush wasn't empty—it pulsed" / "hush demanded patience" / "hush wasn't just silence") recycles the concept without added pressure (−0.3). The phrase "touches memories" appears as a label without embodied demonstration until the scent-triggered flood. Stock metaphors cluster in key beats ("secrets coiled like eels," "time was a river," "rock in its path") without fresh specificity (−0.4). Information density is adequate but falls short of high-band propulsion due to these artifacts.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The underwater temple + memory-perfume premise is a functional synthesis but not surprising—it maps closely to genre templates (ancient ruin, magical object, protagonist must decode before disaster). The vial's dual role (scent key and grief repository) adds a layer of specificity. The transformation test reveals vulnerability: swap "underwater temple" for "buried vault" and "perfume vial" for "music box" and the emotional arc runs unchanged. The priests' flashback and the hush-as-prison metaphor are earnest but not bold. Mara's choice to release rather than control offers a thematic inflection but arrives without prior friction that would make it feel inevitable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Mara (distress signal sender) is present throughout and her goal (decode temple) frames the opening. She makes one key choice—uncorking the vial at the pedestal—but the decision lacks visible alternatives or cost on the page; she's already decided to override instinct two paragraphs earlier. Her final swim upward is observation rather than agency. Setup and development gates are met, but payoff is weak because the hush dissolves on its own and her role at closure is witness rather than actor. Swappable with any explorer-protagonist with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The crystal perfume vial is seeded early, handled in three distinct beats (pressed to mask, mechanism resisted, uncorked at pedestal), and returns in the final image as "empty but radiant." Its scent unlocks the memory flood and its placement triggers the hush's unraveling. Causal pressure is present: the vial enables the climax. However, its properties (lavender + saltwater, memory-touch) are described rather than demonstrated through prior friction, and the final "empty but radiant" status shift is asserted without showing what changed. Strong development and payoff, but the mechanics remain abstract enough to lower irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The "gathered hush" is named early, described in three paragraphs as both weapon and prison, and recurs at the pedestal where it "unsnarls." It supplies the story's conceptual frame and the priests' motive. However, its mechanics are vague—it's alternately silence, whispers, and tangible pressure—without consistent rules that constrain Mara's tactics. At closure the hush "shatters" and "dissolves" off-page; Mara does not navigate its rules to force the outcome. It shapes stakes in setup but does not alter her options in the middle or require a visible trade-off at the end. Functional but swappable with "ancient curse" or "trapped souls."</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Touches memories" is attributed to the vial early and demonstrated once when the scent triggers Mara's memory flood (mother's lullaby, shore, crown). This moment enables the thematic insight and primes the pedestal action. However, the attribute does not constrain a choice with visible cost—Mara uncorks the vial without forfeiting another option—and it does not recur at closure with reweighted meaning. The priests' memory montage deploys the trait again but as backstory summary rather than live pressure. Setup and development gates met; payoff is descriptive rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Unsnarl" appears in the goal statement (paragraph two) and is enacted at the pedestal when the hush "began to unsnarl, unraveling into a thousand voices." This action triggers the climax and the priests' vision. However, Mara does not perform the unsnarling through technique or sacrifice—she places the vial and it happens. The verb could be replaced with "unlock" or "release" without altering story logic. Setup and payoff gates are met, but the action lacks embodied demonstration of means or cost that would make it irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"By overriding instinct" is named once when Mara resists the urge to smash the vial and chooses patience instead. This moment shapes one tactic (uncorking rather than breaking) and is echoed at the climax when she must "override her instinct to flee." However, the mechanics are vague—what instinct, how overridden—and no visible cost attaches to the override. The method does not recur with altered meaning at closure; Mara's final swim is relief rather than another override. Setup and development met weakly; payoff absent.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The forgotten underwater temple is anchored early, supplies pressure (collapsing dome, jagged fissure, tightening ribs), and constrains Mara's path through spatial obstacles. The pedestal at the chamber's center is the locus of the climax. The setting's dual function (memory vault + trap) drives both goal and theme. The storm above is declared as a time limit but never arrives on the page, weakening the pressure. Strong setup, development through obstacle, and payoff at the pedestal. The setting could be replaced with another ruin type (crypt, ancient library) with moderate edits, capping irreplaceability just below 7.5.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"As time runs short" is declared in the opening (distress signal silent three days, storm approaching) and restated twice ("time ran short"). However, the clock is never tracked in scene—no rising water, failing air, or escalating urgency that alters Mara's tactics. The storm "raged" at the surface when she emerges but did not breach the temple or force a trade-off. Setup gate met; development and payoff gates missed. Time functions as background assertion rather than live constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"To harness the ephemeral" is stated as Mara's motivation in paragraph two and reprised at closure ("She'd harnessed the ephemeral, not by trapping it, but by letting it go"). The desire frames her goal and the thematic question. However, it is never dramatized through conflicting impulses or a visible cost—Mara's choice to "let go" is asserted rather than shown as a renunciation of her original want. No on-page moment where she weighs capture versus release. Setup and thematic payoff met; middle friction and visible trade-off absent.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Lonesome splendor" appears explicitly in the final paragraph and is evoked through imagery throughout: solitary descent, bioluminescent beauty, desolate ruins, the vial's "radiant" emptiness at dawn. Tone is consistent and modulates from claustrophobic urgency (pressure, jagged edges) to lyric release (dawn rays, salt-sting fading). However, the phrase "lonesome splendor" in the penultimate sentence is an authorial label rather than embodied perception, breaking immersion at closure. Strong setup and coherent modulation; final-image charge is diluted by on-the-nose naming.</comment>
