<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lirael's professional competence is established through embodied action (adjusting spectacles, painting symbols, humming), and her stakes are clear. However, interiority remains thin—her fear of failure is told rather than shown through contradictory impulses under pressure. The triumph at the end feels unearned by prior struggle; the pool cracks and she fixes them with a vial and song without meaningful cost or foreclosed options. No genuine blind spots or compounding mistakes shape the arc.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation is clean by the opening paragraph. The closure unit—sealing the cracks and preserving the echo—lands on the page, but the cost is unclear: does the lullaby or moonlight painting exact a price, or does competence simply win? The reversal (pool cracking) arrives and resolves within two paragraphs without altering Lirael's options or forcing a trade-off. Under a Causal lens, the "embellish" solution feels convenient rather than motivated by prior constraint.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The grotto's sensory palette—bioluminescent moss, obsidian runes, liquid starlight—is vivid and filtered through Lirael's professional attention. The pool's surface cracking creates spatial consequence that briefly constrains her, and the aurora's "kiss of light" charges the final image. Spatial choreography is coherent throughout, and the setting feels purposefully textured rather than postcard.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving Elion's echo before dissolution—is signaled early and remains coherent. The pool cracking provides one pressure point, but the resolution (moonlight vial, lullaby) does not narrow options or force visible sacrifice. The "unconventional" embellishment reads as added skill rather than a desperate trade-off. One tightening occurs, but without felt cost the escalation remains mid-band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme—beauty enduring against oblivion—emerges from particulars (the emerald's transformation, the grotto's fragility) without overt moralizing. The final image of stillness as canvas offers resonance. However, "lucidly watchful" and "radiant hush" echo prompt language, and the closing reflection ("stillness was never truly still") edges toward statement rather than letting the image speak. The theme is coherent but not deeply transformed.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with a consistent register blending craft vocabulary and lyric diction. Perceptual signature is present in Lirael's professional gaze ("embalmer's precision and artist's intuition"). However, elevated phrasing—"swallowed by the radiant hush," "motes in the pool, their edges fraying"—occasionally drifts above her grounded work. No head-hopping, and narrative distance remains controlled.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully, and most lines advance story or atmosphere. However, stock phrasings recur: "sharp and clear as a bell," "chill of wonder," "slumped forward, exhausted but triumphant." Figurative density is high in the opening ("skyborne grotto suspended beneath the aurora's green-gold glow") without pattern-teaching, and adjacent sentences occasionally loop ("The chip flared… She guided… She worked…"). Clarity holds, but overwriting and template cadence prevent higher scores.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The premise—beautician mortician for celestials—synthesizes two roles freshly, and the grotto's mechanics (threshold of stillness, liquid starlight) feel specific. However, the arc itself (artisan completes difficult task, succeeds through skill) is familiar, and the resolution does not risk transformation or failure. Emotional specificity in Elion's echoes (laughter, fear, kindness) grounds the fantastical elements, but the ending's "strange peace" and "beauty could endure" lean generic.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lirael's choices—kneeling, channeling magic, painting symbols, humming—drive multiple beats and the ending. She is present throughout and her dual training enables the unconventional embellishment. However, the final act is competence-based rather than a forced trade-off with visible cost, limiting indispensability.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The emerald chip appears in the opening, is handled and infused across the middle, transforms from green to white under pressure, and rests as a "perfect sphere" in the final beat. Its changing state alters Lirael's tactics (adding moonlight, humming) and the closure image charges it with Elion's preserved spark. Strong beat involvement and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The threshold of stillness is named, framed as "not just a barrier but a lens," and its cracking forces Lirael's embellishment. It shapes the central conflict and is present in the final paragraph ("remained behind her, its surface smooth once more"). However, its mechanics are abstract; it does not constrain a specific micro-choice beyond "act fast," and the seal feels assured by skill.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Lucidly watchful" appears twice as a phrase, bracketing the story, but does not demonstrably enable or constrain an on-page action. Lirael's attention and precision are shown through other means (adjusting spectacles, synchronized breath). The attribute functions as thematic label rather than forcing a visible trade-off or altering tactics under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Infuse" is the core action: Lirael breathes the word, channels magic into the chip, coaxes echoes into the emerald's lattice, and the transformation drives the escalation and closure. The chip's flaring and the pool's cracking are direct results. Removing "infuse" would dismantle the plot; swapping it for a near-synonym would require structural rewrites.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Finding patterns in static" is signaled ("static around the pool was organizing itself… spirals, fractals, constellations") and enables Lirael to amplify Elion's echoes by focusing attention. It shapes one key middle beat and is causally linked to the emerald's intensification. However, it does not recur at closure or constrain later tactics; the moonlight and lullaby resolve the crisis without revisiting pattern-finding.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The skyborne grotto under aurora is anchored early, supplies obsidian runes and bioluminescent moss that texture the work, and the aurora's light interacts with Lirael's magic (dips low, brightens in approval). The pool's structure (edges lined with runes) matters to the mechanics. Setting participates in escalation (cracks threaten collapse) and charges the final image (aurora's kiss). Not purely postcard, but could be tightened to force more micro-choices.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>N/A</grade>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"To capture one last spark before oblivion" is dramatized through Lirael's urgency ("If she failed, the echo… would vanish forever"), drives her choices across all beats, and the ending confirms success with the velvet-lined box. The motivation is conflicted insofar as failure looms and the pool threatens, though internal doubt or competing desires are not shown. Strong causal linkage and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Radiant hush" appears explicitly in the opening ("swallowed by the radiant hush") and implicitly in descriptions of shimmer, twilight, and the aurora's quiet intensity. Tone is coherent and modulates slightly when the pool cracks (urgency) before returning to softness at the end. However, it remains largely atmospheric rather than shaping a key turn or reweighting the final image with new pressure.</comment>
