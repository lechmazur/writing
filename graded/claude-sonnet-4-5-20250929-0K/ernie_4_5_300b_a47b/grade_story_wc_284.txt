<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation crystallizes through her father's memory, and the pillbox anchors her emotional arc. However, interiority relies heavily on stock spy-thriller phrases ("burned spy," "networks she'd once infiltrated") and therapy-speak abstractions ("the hollow where her courage used to live"). The final micro-choice—touching the pillbox and quickening her pace—registers but lacks visible cost or internal contradiction that would lift characterization into higher bands.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the bluff visit deepens Mara's resolve through layered memory and ritual transcription. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): "the courage to seek it" crystallizes her stance with felt cost (acknowledging buried fears). However, the weather station coordinates and transcription ritual feel ornamental rather than causally essential—the story could close identically without them, weakening the cost proof.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The bluff's mist and isolation are vividly established and support thematic tone. The pillbox appears in multiple beats and the transcription uses quill and soil, satisfying micro-setting criteria. Spatial choreography (railing, path, fog below) remains clear. Yet the environment does not constrain a choice or alter tactics—Mara could perform this ritual anywhere isolated—preventing entry to the 9-band per the quick test.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reclaiming courage to pursue her father's truth) is signaled early. The transcription deepens her resolve, and the closing decision to continue toward the weather station provides one tightening. However, no on-page reversal narrows options or forces a trade-off with visible price—she kneels, transcribes, and departs without friction. The wind-creak false alarm deflates rather than escalates pressure, and agency remains contemplative rather than tested.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme (courage as rekindled flame rather than unearthed relic) emerges from concrete ritual and memory without overt moralizing. The pillbox's spiral motif recurs with shifted meaning. However, the final paragraph's explicit thematic summary—"not the truth, but the courage to seek it"—edges toward stating rather than dramatizing the answer. Strong thematic particulars (father's pipe tobacco, off-key lullabies) anchor universals, lifting the score despite the summary tendency.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Single-POV distance remains stable; filter verbs ("she'd realized," "she understood") are acceptable given the reflective mode. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("liminal space," "benediction," "festered, unspoken") that reads slightly above Mara's embodied present-tense urgency. The closing smile and quickened pace convey shift in stance, but perceptual signature under peak pressure (the false alarm) lacks the syntactic compression or rhythmic modulation that would demonstrate voice control at 9+.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout without taught pattern: "silver hush," "mist…like a second skin," "ink-soaked quill," "temporary tattoo," "void that mirrored her own uncertainties." Several adjacent sentences paraphrase the same content (e.g., courage-as-metaphor restated three ways in paragraphs 3 and 7). Template stems recur: "She'd come," "She'd been," "She'd woken." Deductions: density without payoff −0.6, paraphrase loops −0.4, template cadence −0.5. The overwriting obscures momentum and dulls the closure image, triggering cumulative penalty and disallowing 9+ globally per artifact rules.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Core premise (burned spy seeking father's final transmission at isolated bluff) follows a familiar intelligence-thriller template without transformation through world logic or moral calculus. The pillbox-and-codes setup, derelict weather station, and courage-rekindling arc are functional but replaceable with near-synonyms. Emotional specificity (father's lullabies, pipe tobacco) provides some freshness, but the story does not risk an unconventional structural or perspectival choice that would elevate originality.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Mara is present throughout and her spy background frames the transcription ritual. However, her "burned spy" status does not create key turns—she decodes the pillbox off-page before arrival, and no tactical choice on the bluff depends on spy skills. The railing false-alarm beat could test evasion training but deflates instantly. Setup present, middle touch minimal, closure observational. Swappable with "grieving daughter" without structural loss. Cap for missing middle development: 3.4; lyric reprise (burned → rekindled courage) lifts within allowed band to 4.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The pillbox appears early (pocket weight, paragraph 2), mid-scene (lid opens, parchment revealed), and in closure (touched in final paragraph). Its engraving drives the transcription ritual and its spiral motif recurs. However, it does not constrain a choice or create friction—Mara could carry the coordinates on paper with identical beats. Setup +0.7, two beats +0.9, closure touch +0.7, specificity (engraved spirals) +0.4; swappability (any keepsake) −0.6. Score 6.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Fixing what's broken" frames Mara's goal (paragraph 1) and recurs in paragraph 7 ("Fixing what's broken required more than deciphering codes"). The transcription ritual enacts repair symbolically. Yet the concept does not constrain tactics or alter options on the page—Mara's actions (kneel, transcribe, depart) would remain identical if the framing were "honoring a legacy." Setup +0.6, thematic reprise +0.5, causal pressure minimal +0.2; label-only middle use −0.3. Score 5.1.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Prudently daring" is introduced in paragraph 2 ("Prudently daring, she'd chosen this place") and echoed in paragraph 7 ("Prudently daring meant acknowledging her fears"). Both instances are label-only; no on-page action demonstrates the trait through visible trade-off (e.g., taking a calculated risk with consequence). Setup +0.4, closure echo +0.3; label-only treatment −0.3 twice = −0.6; swappable with "cautiously bold" −0.5. Cap for label-only: 3.8.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Vouchsafe" appears twice: paragraph 2 ("intended to vouchsafe his final transmission") and paragraph 4 ("To vouchsafe this information meant trusting someone"). The transcription ritual enacts the action, but the codes vanish with rain and Mara departs without transmitting them to anyone, undercutting the action's meaning. Setup +0.6, middle beat +0.4, specificity (trust calculus) +0.3; undercut payoff −0.8; swappable with "preserve" −0.4. Introduced early but lacks closure integration. Cap for missing closure participation: 4.6.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"Codes in accumulated snow" is introduced as metaphor in paragraph 3 ("weren't literal; they were metaphors for the way truth revealed itself in layers, like ice thawing") and the transcription uses soil, not snow. Meltwater is mentioned scenically but does not shape mechanics. The method is ornamental—Mara could write on parchment with identical outcome. Present +0.2, metaphor-only use −0.7, swappability −0.6. Score 2.9.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Zephyr Bluff in mist is established early (paragraph 1) and its isolation motivates location choice ("mist muffled footsteps," "eavesdropping impossible"). The bluff's edge and winding path structure departure. However, the setting does not pressure a choice—Mara could perform the ritual in any isolated location. Setup +0.7, causal pressure (isolation enables ritual) +0.8, closure touch (path descent) +0.5; swappability (any remote cliff) −0.7. Score 5.7.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"At the tilt of the earth toward spring" opens the story and "Spring was coming" appears in the closing movement (paragraph 8). The timeframe provides thematic texture (renewal) but does not tighten decisions or create urgency—no clock pressures Mara. Setup +0.6, closure reprise +0.5, thematic resonance +0.3; no tactical constraint −0.8; swappable with any transitional season −0.4. Score 4.3.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Unused courage" is introduced via dream (paragraph 3: father's words), recurs in paragraph 7 ("Her father's unused courage…wasn't a relic to be unearthed but a flame to be rekindled"), and shapes the closing realization. The motivation drives the bluff visit and ritual. However, the desire is told more than dramatized in conflicted choice—Mara's hesitation (paragraph 4) is brief and resolved without visible cost. Setup +0.7, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, causal pressure +0.6; told-only friction −0.8. Score 6.4.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Silver hush" appears in the title framing (paragraph 1: "shrouded itself in a silver hush"), mid-scene (paragraph 4: "the silver hush of the bluff seemed to whisper encouragement"), and closure (paragraph 9: "she walked in the silver hush"). Tone remains consistent (quiet, contemplative, mist-shrouded) and modulates subtly with Mara's lightening resolve. The reprise charges the final image. Setup +0.7, middle reinforcement +0.4, closure reprise +0.9, modulation +0.5; static mood (no sharp tonal shift under pressure) −0.4. Score 5.9.</comment>
