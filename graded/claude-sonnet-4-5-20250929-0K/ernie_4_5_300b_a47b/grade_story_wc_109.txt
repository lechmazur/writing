<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's "mild obsession" with silences is established early and her interior voice carries some specificity ("the pause before a wave crashes"), but her motivation remains somewhat abstract. The final moment—standing with the glowing map—lacks embodied tension or contradictory impulses; she "smiled, her lips trembling" reads as generic emotional notation. The choice to return to the pebble shore tomorrow feels declared rather than earned through visible cost or foreclosed alternatives on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation Test: who, where, and when anchor by the second paragraph; no penalty. Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: Mara layers silences to complete the map, and the final image (glowing scroll, gold flakes on hands) reweights the opening hush. However, the closure lacks clear cost—she "wasn't afraid," the task is simply "done," and tomorrow's return is asserted without dramatized consequence. The map's completion feels ornamental rather than a decisive change or reconfiguration that forecloses a live path.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The storm-tossed ridge fort anchors vividly ("stone teeth gnawing at the wind"), and micro-setting details—crumbling archway, pebbles skittering—are woven through action. The gold-flake booklet functions as a tactile object that Mara handles across beats, and its shedding flakes visually mark progression. The setting does not constrain a choice at closure (she completes the task unimpeded), capping the score below 9-band eligibility despite strong atmospheric specificity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—drawing the map of endless night—is signaled early, but escalation remains flat. Mara encounters no reversal or meaningful resistance; the fort groans "as if annoyed," a gust rattles the archway, yet she "didn't stop" without visible friction. The ending declares success ("She'd done it") with no on-page cost, trade-off, or tightening that narrows options. Under the Accumulative lens, one decisive intensification or cadence shift that reweights the stake is required; here the work proceeds smoothly to completion.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: silence as layered presence, mapping absence rather than light, the interplay of voice and void. The final image—gold flakes clinging like "stolen starlight"—offers a resonant answer without overt moralizing. The "silence would wait, patient and infinite, for the next oracle" gesture risks abstraction, yet the booklet's physical decay and Mara's bodily engagement (aching fingers, trembling smile) anchor the conceptual work in particulars. No thematic echo in the final paragraph; the piece earns its thematic charge.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV is stable; perceptual signature is consistent (Mara notices cracks, silences, gold flakes). Diction elevates in passages like "marbled hush" and "palimpsest of echoes," verging on ornamental lyricism that slightly distances the reader from embodied urgency. No dialogue. Psychic distance remains controlled, filter verbs are sparse, and the narrative voice maintains a distinct texture. Under pressure (final beats), the prose does not compress or modulate rhythmically to match stakes, holding a steady lyric register throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Line-level craft is competent with varied syntax and vivid imagery ("slow-motion snow," "wave's crest"), but overwriting clusters in descriptive passages: "ambered hush," "marbled hush," "palimpsest of echoes" stack figurative language without clear escalation or pattern payoff. The phrase "retell the silence" and "summarizing a silence" repeat conceptually across adjacent beats without added pressure. Paraphrase loop at "She'd done it. She'd drawn the endless night" (−0.2). No scaffold or template cadence, but density dips in middle paragraphs where reflection summarizes rather than advances.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The premise—mapping silence via collected hushes inscribed on a flaking booklet—offers a fresh lyric angle. Execution, however, follows a predictable arc: oracle alone, task signaled, task completed without complication. The "endless night" and "vanishing star" motifs risk generic fantasy abstraction; grounding detail (pebble shore, seashells-as-ink) adds specificity, yet the piece does not transform the template through a non-obvious turn or moral calculus. Risk-taking in structure (lyric accumulation) is present but does not fully elevate the familiar solitary-creator frame.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mara (pebble-shore oracle) is present throughout and her decision to sketch the map drives the central action. Setup: named and role-established in the opening. Development: she chooses to unwrap the booklet, begin sketching, and persist despite the fort's groans. Payoff: she completes the map and decides to return to the shore tomorrow. However, her choices lack friction or visible cost—no tactic shift, no foreclosed alternative. The oracle role could be swapped for "cartographer" or "scribe" with minor edits. Integration is functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The flaking gold leaf booklet appears in the opening backstory, is unwrapped and handled mid-scene, and its shedding flakes visually mark the map's progression and charge the final image ("sparkling like stolen starlight"). Setup, development, payoff all present. The booklet's dissolving symbols and physical decay are specific and irreplaceable. However, it does not constrain a choice under pressure; Mara's task proceeds smoothly. Strong causal involvement across beats and closure linkage, but lacks a moment where the booklet's properties narrow options or impose cost.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The "ambered hush" (and variant "marbled hush") appears as atmospheric descriptor and thematic echo but does not shape stakes or tactics. Setup: mentioned in paragraph one. Development: "marbled hush" recurs mid-scene. Payoff: implied in the final silence. The concept remains ornamental—Mara's actions (sketching, listening) do not change based on the hush's properties. Swappable with "thick silence" or "weighted stillness." Present but not causal; threshold integration only.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Mildly obsessed" is stated in the opening ("Her mild obsession with such hushes had begun years ago") but functions as label-only backstory. Setup present. Development: the obsession motivates her task conceptually but does not constrain or enable a specific on-page action with cost. Payoff: absent; the trait is not tested or reweighted at closure. The degree "mildly" does not differentiate her actions from a non-mild obsession. Functional motivation but replaceable with "fascinated by" or "drawn to."</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Retell" appears as Mara's murmured intention ("I must retell the silence") and structures her method—each stroke "required summarizing a silence." Setup and development present. Payoff: the map is described as "a spiral of silences, each one nested inside the next," implying retelling as accumulation. However, the mechanics of retelling versus other inscription methods remain vague; "summarizing" could substitute without loss. The action shapes the attempt but is not indispensable to the story's logic or final image.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"By summarizing silence" is signaled ("summarizing a silence: the pause before a wave crashes…") and recurs as the method for each map stroke. Setup and development present. Payoff: the completed map is "a spiral of silences," but the final image does not hinge on the summarizing mechanic—Mara could have "captured" or "traced" silences with similar effect. The method is thematic but functionally replaceable; it does not impose constraint or alter tactics under pressure. Lyric reprise without causal necessity.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The "storm-tossed ridge fort" provides vivid setting (crumbling archway, courtyard, barracks) and atmospheric pressure ("walls groaned," "gust rattled the archway"). Setup: opening paragraph. Development: Mara uses the archway's lee for shelter; pebbles scatter, adding sensory detail. Payoff: the fort's cracks are illuminated by the map's glow. The setting enables the scene spatially but does not constrain Mara's choices or supply a resource that affects outcome—she completes the task regardless of fort conditions. Functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"When only one star remains in a dimming sky" is stated as the trigger moment ("Tonight, when only one star remained…she knew the time had come"). Setup present. Development: the star's presence is implied but not tracked; no mid-scene reference tightens the clock. Payoff: "The last star winked out, and the fort plunged into darkness" marks completion. The timeframe brackets the action but does not impose urgency or alter Mara's tactics—she works at her own pace. Present as atmospheric marker; does not function as live constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"To draw a map of an endless night" is Mara's stated goal, signaled early and pursued on-page through sketching. Setup and development present. Payoff: the map glows, and Mara declares success. The motivation is dramatized in action (unwrapping booklet, dipping quill, sketching), but internal conflict is minimal—no friction between want and cost, no competing desire. She thinks "Let the map be imperfect" without visible consequence. The motivation drives the plot functionally but lacks the contradictory impulses or trade-offs that would elevate integration.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Marbled hush" (variant of "ambered hush") establishes tone early and recurs ("The ambered hush deepened"). Setup and payoff present. The tone is coherent and modulates subtly (tension rises with the gust, then settles into quiet triumph), supporting the lyric accumulation. However, the tone does not sharply shift under pressure or charge the final image with new meaning—the ending sustains the opening's contemplative register without inflection. Lyric consistency without dynamic reprise; functional but not indispensable to closure.</comment>
