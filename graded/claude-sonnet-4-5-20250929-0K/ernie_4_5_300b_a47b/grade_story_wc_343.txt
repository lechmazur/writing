<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lira's curiosity is clearly motivated and drives her through the cargo hold puzzle, but her leap into the void lacks earned internal conflict—she ignores the captain and jumps without wrestling contradictory impulses on the page. The "I'd charted the next great discovery—not just a place, but a truth" summary in the final beat tells rather than dramatizes her transformation. Jax and the captain remain functional but one-note, applying external pressure without revealing their own stakes. The diligently curious trait is label-claimed but not visibly traded against another value with cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Causal (hopscotch → coordinates → starling gap → portal leap), and orientation anchors early (airship, dusk, Lira's role). The closure—Lira's leap and return with visions—lands on the page, but the cost is asserted ("She'd charted...") rather than shown through a forfeited option or visible consequence that narrows her world. The coordinate-deciphering linkage is compressed ("by dawn, she'd deciphered it") and the phrasebook clue "when the murmurations part" resolves too conveniently without friction. One meaningful tightening occurs (gap revealed → leap), but the portal's mechanics arrive late without groundwork, weakening inevitability.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The airship's copper hull, rickety floors, and cargo hold anchor space early, and the starling murmurations create vivid atmosphere. However, the ship remains largely scenic—Lira kneels on "cold metal," but the floor plan, hatch access, and physical constraints never pressure her choices. The hopscotch board is described ("numbers worn thin by time") yet its tactile handling and spatial relationship to the crates and Lira's body remain vague. The portal void "coalesced into a shimmering tunnel" with constellation walls, but no sensory specificity (temperature, sound, resistance) grounds the crossing or charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—charting the next great discovery—is signaled early and Lira pursues it through decoding the hopscotch board and leaping into the void. One meaningful tightening occurs when the starlings part to reveal the gap, narrowing her options to act or retreat. Yet the leap itself is unopposed: no fear, no cost calculation on the page, no visible forfeit (stamina, safety margin, captain's trust dramatized as a tactical constraint afterward). The stranded luminance puzzle drives her forward, but its resolution (touching the orb, receiving visions) is a reward without resistance or trade-off, deflating escalation at closure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The theme of curiosity as compass and the search for hidden truths emerges organically from Lira's puzzle-solving and the "light trapped between worlds" motif. The hopscotch board and phrasebook anchor specificity, and the starlings as guides add layered meaning. However, the final beat tips into summary: "She'd charted the next great discovery—not just a place, but a truth" states the theme rather than letting the images (glowing orb, ancient cities, harmony of light and darkness) reweight prior material without narration. The visions flood her mind but remain abstract catalogs, not particular images that complicate or deepen the premise with a non-literal answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV remains stable with a distinct perceptual signature: "her mind that hummed with questions," "her handwriting slanting like a storm front." Dialogue carries subtext (Jax's skepticism softening, "You're mad" paired with a grin) and feels natural for the register. Psychic distance tightens appropriately during the leap. However, the phrasebook's dog-eared pages and the scholar's vanishing mid-voyage are introduced without Lira's emotional coloring or tactical weighting—she treats them as clues, not mysteries that unsettle her. The captain's "youngsters who don't know a sextant from a spoon" voice-color is vivid but remains a one-line flourish; his later barked orders lack distinct idiom.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies (short urgent beats during the leap, longer atmospheric passages at the opening), and sensory language is often vivid ("copper hull creaking like a sigh," "liquid darkness"). However, patterned scaffold appears: "Her curiosity had always been her compass" and "Lira's diligently curious nature" paraphrase the same trait within three paragraphs. Filter-verb reliance ("she noticed," "she'd seen," "she said") dulls immediacy in mid-pressure beats. The closure summary—"She'd charted the next great discovery—not just a place, but a truth"—abstracts the earned images (orb, visions) into a thesis statement rather than letting action close the arc. Minor template cadence in Jax's beats: "he said, leaning... he'd seen... he said."</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The antique airship and starling-guided navigation offer a steampunk-ish frame, but the hopscotch-as-constellation-map and portal-to-hidden-light premise lean on familiar YA fantasy templates (plucky apprentice decodes ancient puzzle, leaps into magical threshold, gains visionary knowledge). The specific synthesis—phrasebook clues, bird murmurations splitting to reveal a void—adds texture, yet the emotional arc (curiosity → puzzle → leap → visions → validation) follows a well-trodden outline without a transformative complication. Lira's leap is bold in action but not in moral calculus; no competing value (loyalty, safety, humility) creates friction. The ending grants her discovery without a visible sacrifice, reducing originality of consequence.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lira's curiosity drives every turn: she explores the cargo hold, decodes the hopscotch board, interprets the phrasebook, and leaps into the void. Present in setup, middle decoding beats, and the leap-closure. Her choices create the plot's causal spine. However, the leap itself is undertaken without on-page internal conflict or a visible cost decision, which keeps the role from reaching indispensable integration. The character is necessary, but the trait execution in the closure beat is told rather than dramatically enacted with friction.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The phrasebook appears in the cargo hold (Lira pulls it from her pocket), she consults it for clues mid-puzzle ("Stranded luminance seeks the key," "when the murmurations part"), and she stuffs it into her satchel before the leap. Three beats, all functional. Yet its dog-eared state and the vanished scholar backstory are ornamental—they set mood but do not constrain Lira's choices or reweight the ending image. The phrasebook enables rather than complicates; no misreading, no cost tied to using it. Swappable with any clue-source (journal, map annotation) without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Stranded luminance is named in the phrasebook clue, defines Lira's goal ("light trapped between worlds"), and manifests as the glowing orb she touches at closure. Present across setup, development, and payoff. However, its mechanics remain abstract: it grants visions but does not resist, demand sacrifice, or impose a tactical constraint on Lira's approach. The concept shapes the mystery but not the escalation or cost. Removing "stranded luminance" and replacing it with "hidden relic" or "lost knowledge" would require minimal edits—the narrative spine (decode → leap → gain insight) holds regardless.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Lira's diligence is mentioned twice ("diligently curious nature," working "through the night") and illustrated by her note-taking and persistence. Setup and middle development present. But the trait never constrains a choice or creates visible cost—she does not sacrifice sleep with consequence, miss a social opportunity, or ignore a danger she should heed. The label describes her method without forcing a trade-off. The leap and visions reward diligence rather than testing it against a competing value (caution, teamwork). Swappable with "determined" or "persistent" without rewriting beats.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Note-taking appears throughout: Lira jots notes in the phrasebook margin ("The fifth square..."), her notes pile up by dawn, she grabs her satchel with "the phrasebook and her notes" before the leap. Three distinct beats. The action enables her coordinate breakthrough ("by dawn, she'd deciphered it") and is causally necessary—without the accumulated notes, the leap lacks setup. However, the notes themselves are summarized rather than shown (we do not see the specific notation that unlocks the pattern), and they do not return at closure to charge the final image. Necessary mid-structure but not closure-active.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The hopscotch board is introduced early (cargo hold discovery), Lira traces and decodes its patterns ("numbers aligned with constellations"), and Jax calls it a map by midpoint. Setup and development solid; its coordinate system directly enables the leap by revealing the starling-guided location. However, the board does not reappear or reweight the ending—once decoded, it vanishes from narrative attention. The mechanics (how squares map to star positions, why a game board holds this secret) remain vague. Swapping "hopscotch board" for "star chart carved in floorboards" would preserve function with minimal edit, indicating mid-high integration but not indispensability.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The antique airship *Horizon's Whisper* frames the entire story: opening amber-plains drift, cargo hold as discovery site, deck as leap point, and return landing. Setup, development, and closure all occur aboard or launched from the ship. Spatial choreography (railing, ladder, cargo hold beneath crates, deck) is tracked. However, the ship supplies location without constraining tactics—Lira's puzzle-solving and leap are unaffected by airship-specific limitations (fuel, altitude, wind, captain's authority enforced). The vessel is vividly described but functionally a mobile stage. Swappable with "sky-train" or "floating observatory" without major structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Starling murmurations appear at dusk in the opening, their flight paths guide Lira's coordinate work, they split into V-shapes to reveal the gap, and they "screamed" twice (urging, encouraging). Present in setup and closure. However, the timeframe is loose—"by dawn" compresses Lira's all-night decoding without tactical pressure (fatigue, light loss, crew schedules). The murmurations' split is fortunate timing rather than a ticking constraint Lira races. The birds function as atmospheric guide and signal, not a clock that narrows her window. Removing the murmuration timing and replacing it with "a rare celestial alignment" would preserve closure with modest edits.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Lira's desire to chart the next great discovery is stated in the opening ("She'd joined this expedition to chart...") and restated at closure ("She'd charted the next great discovery"). Setup and payoff present. The motivation drives her into the cargo hold and sustains her overnight decoding. However, it is never dramatized in conflict—no competing desire (safety, approval, rest) creates friction, and the leap fulfills the want without visible cost or complication. The final summary tells us the motivation succeeded rather than showing a choice where charting the discovery forced her to forfeit something else. Functional but not tested under pressure with a felt trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Sociable isolation" is signaled obliquely: Lira works alone in the cargo hold while the crew remains elsewhere; Jax visits but lingers as observer, not collaborator; she leaps solo despite the captain's order. The tone of solitary curiosity amid a populated ship is consistent. However, the sociable dimension is thin—dialogue with Jax is brief and pragmatic, the captain a distant scold. The isolation does not modulate or charge the closure image; Jax waits when she returns, but the emotional resonance of aloneness-within-company is asserted ("but Lira didn't care") rather than woven into the final beat's texture. Present but not reweighted or used to intensify the ending.</comment>
