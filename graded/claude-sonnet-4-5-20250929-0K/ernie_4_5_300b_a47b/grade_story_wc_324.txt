<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Lila's professional competence is asserted rather than tested; her "persistently curious mind" and tools arrive conveniently without meaningful friction. The final choice to deliver the message feels externally motivated by job duty rather than earned through internal contradiction. The woman from the photograph materializes at the fountain without dramatized summoning or causal bridge, weakening agency. Embodiment is present in moments ("throat tightened") but interiority often defaults to smooth professional narration without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The piece establishes Lila's task and the photograph clue early, but escalation relies on convenient discoveries (identical hearing aid in cobwebs, woman waiting at fountain) rather than causally linked reversals. The man's ghost appearance and message delivery constitute a decisive change, but the cost—what Lila forfeits or risks to achieve it—remains abstract; the stakes never narrow her options on the page. The atrium's west wing journey functions as spatial transit rather than pressure sequence. Closure arrives through fulfillment of the stated job rather than transformation under constraint.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The mist-clad atrium at twilight is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (moss scent, violet light, cobwebs) and the hearing aid functions as a recurring small object. The atrium's galleries and fountain provide spatial anchors, though choreography during the ghost encounter remains vague. The photograph and hearing aids constrain Lila's method, meeting the micro-setting standard. Environment subtly mirrors the premise (forgotten promises, spectral atmosphere) but does not force a tactical choice at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—assuring the woman of her partner's love—is signaled early but remains abstract; no moment dramatizes what Lila risks or loses if she fails. The pulse intensifies as she moves deeper, yet this is atmospheric rather than a narrowing of options. The man's appearance and message arrive without Lila making a hard choice between competing goods; she executes her professional role smoothly. The ending delivers satisfaction without visible cost or tradeoff on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Theme of incidental heroism and bridging life/death emerges through the atrium setting and Lila's role, but the final paragraph states the thesis overtly ("incidental heroism... wasn't about grand gestures"). The hearing aid's synchronized pulse and the photograph's return carry symbolic weight, though the devices feel ornamental rather than causally indispensable. The woman's single tear and Lila's smile offer tidy emotional resolution without ambiguity or cost that reweights prior material. Resonance is present but softened by explicit moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable throughout with Lila as the consistent focalizer; no head-hopping. Diction is generally controlled, though occasional elevated phrases ("reeling hush," "spectral cats") feel slightly ornamental. Dialogue pursues goals and advances plot when present, with subtext in the final exchange ("But he meant it"). Psychic distance modulates appropriately during the ghost encounter. Some filter verbs ("felt," "knew") are voice-motivated, though a few ("seemed to exhale") drift toward convenient personification.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Line-level clarity is generally strong, but several runs of repetitive phrasing appear: "The woman looked up... For a heartbeat... Then she nodded" follows a template cadence. The phrase "persistently curious mind" and "incidental heroism" recur as label-only concepts without fresh embodiment. Stock metaphors cluster: "mist curling around her ankles like spectral cats," "voices faint as static," "heartbeat trapped in amber." The opening and closing paragraphs carry propulsion, but mid-story transit through galleries feels padded. Paraphrase loop in the final section: "She'd done what she came to do: protected a voice... honored a love..." restates the prior lines without added pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The premise—contact tracer for the dead using a hearing aid to capture echoes—offers a fresh genre synthesis, but execution leans on familiar ghost-story beats: the grieving woman, the unspoken love, the comforting message. Lila's role as "midwife to grief" is evocative but remains under-explored; her emotional stakes never complicate the professional task. The twin hearing aids and synchronized pulses provide a memorable image, yet the resolution follows a predictable arc of discovery → message → closure without transformation. Risk-taking is present in the concept but undercut by safe emotional calibration.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Lila as contact tracer is present throughout and frames the premise, but her choices do not create key turns—she follows clues in sequence (photo → pulse → hearing aid → ghost) without meaningful decision points that alter tactics. The role is functional but largely observational; the ghost's message resolves the case rather than Lila's agency.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The photograph appears in the opening beat (fountain discovery), drives Lila's investigation in the middle (she presses it to the hearing aid), and returns in the final exchange (handed to the woman). Its image—the man's mid-gesture hand—seeds the unspoken message, and its reappearance charges the closure. Edges "softened by algae" and tucked "safely in her bag" provide evolving physical handling. Strong presence across setup, development, and payoff, though the cost tied to the photograph itself is indirect.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Incidental heroism is named explicitly in Lila's interiority and the final paragraph moralizes it directly ("wasn't about grand gestures"). It shapes the premise thematically but does not constrain an on-page choice; Lila never faces a decision where stepping back or stepping forward costs her something tangible. The concept reads as a frame rather than a tactical force.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Persistently curious" appears as a label ("Lila's persistently curious mind noticed") but does not drive a choice with visible cost. Her curiosity motivates the investigation generally, but no moment dramatizes curiosity pulling her into danger or tradeoff. The trait is asserted rather than embodied through friction.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Assure" anchors Lila's goal from the opening ("assure their loved ones") and recurs in the ghost's plea ("Assure her I loved her") and Lila's reply ("Sometimes love is too big for words"). The action shapes the central stake and lands in the closure beat. However, the assurance is delivered rather than earned through a hard choice, limiting causal indispensability. Swapping "assure" for "tell" or "convey" would not break the structure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The hearing aid method is signaled early ("a relic from a previous case") and used in two distinct beats: pressing it to the photo to capture the pulse, then placing it beside the twin device to synchronize. The mechanics—vibrations, pulses, synchronized duet—shape Lila's approach and enable the ghost's appearance. However, the device could be replaced with another psychic tool (dowsing rod, EMF detector) without major structural change; specificity is present but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The mist-clad atrium at twilight is established early and sustained throughout; mist, violet light, and cobwebs create atmosphere. The west wing labyrinth provides spatial structure for Lila's search. The setting does not force a tactical choice—Lila moves through it smoothly—but the atrium's "reeling hush" and "exhale" at closure subtly charge the final image. Environment is present and purposeful but not a constraint that alters options.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"When the dead call" frames the premise in the opening paragraph and recurs in the closing line ("a place where the dead called, and the living answered"). Time of day is anchored (twilight) but does not tighten decisions; no clock or urgency shapes tactics. The timeframe is thematic rather than causal, mentioned at setup and payoff but not developed in the middle.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Lila's motivation to "protect vulnerable voices" is stated early and referenced at the climax ("The vulnerable voice she'd sworn to protect had finally spoken"). It drives her professional role and grounds the investigation. However, the motivation is never dramatized under friction—no moment shows Lila choosing this duty over a competing desire or risking something personal. Told more than tested.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Reeling hush" appears once mid-story ("the reeling hush of the atrium held") and the tone of quiet reverence is sustained through violet light, faint static, and soft beeps. Tone modulates subtly during the ghost encounter (air shimmers, voice crackles) but remains largely static—a single atmospheric mood rather than a dynamic that charges the final image with cost. Present and coherent but not integral to closure.</comment>
