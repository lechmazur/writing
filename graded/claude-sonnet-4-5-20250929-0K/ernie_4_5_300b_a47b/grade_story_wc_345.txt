<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara's altruism is asserted through labels ("altruistic," "pure," "never lied") rather than demonstrated through contradictory impulses or difficult micro-choices. Her consistency is declared as "strangely trustworthy" but no on-page moment forces her to choose between competing goods or pay a visible cost. The settlers are present only as an abstract collective; no individual friction tests her motives. The final materialization and speech feel more like exposition than earned character action under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive early, but the closure unit lacks visible cost: the arch is reinforced through collective effort summarized in a single paragraph, and Elara "fades into the twilight" without a decisive change or stance crystallization that forecloses a path. The causal chain is skeletal—messages appear, settlers mobilize, problem solved—with no meaningful tightening or reversal that narrows options. The inferred lens (Causal) weakens at closure when the resolution is told rather than dramatized, and no felt price lands on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The orchard planet, floating arches, and pearl-fruited trees are vivid in aggregate but remain postcard description; no environmental feature constrains a choice or alters tactics. The butterfly garden watering bell is mentioned three times but never handled on the page in a way that shapes action—it's suspended from the arch in the climax without prior setup showing how or why. Spatial choreography during the gathering is vague ("settlers stood beneath," "worked for hours") with no micro-setting detail that pressures the outcome.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake (save the arches to preserve the nebula) is signaled early but never tightens through agency or reversal; Elara's plan unfolds without friction, and the settlers' mobilization is summarized rather than dramatized. No on-page moment forces a trade-off or forecloses an option—doubt "gave way to determination" off-stage, and the climax compresses hours of work into generic description ("reinforced," "secured," "chanted"). Coincidence does not resolve, but neither does protagonist decision; the nebula "flared to life" as a declarative result, not a costly choice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Theme of collective effort and hope emerges from the premise but relies on summary and assertion ("hope was not a solitary pursuit—it was a garden") rather than particular images that reweight prior material. The nebula as "promise" is stated twice without specific dramatization that charges the concept. The final paragraph moralizes ("tended by many hands, watered by trust") instead of landing a resonant image, and the climax offers no ambiguity or counter-reading—stakes resolve into tidy affirmation without cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited omniscient distance is stable, and the perceptual signature ("whisper of calm," "shimmer in the air") suits Elara's ghostly presence. However, diction drifts into elevated register ("orchestrate collective effort," "brambled hope," "celestial phenomenon") that clashes with the immediacy of crisis, and the climax speech ("The nebula of respire is not just a phenomenon… it is a promise") reads as thematic lecture rather than character voice under pressure. Dialogue among settlers is absent, so no test of naturalism or subtext.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Line-level clarity is mostly intact, but scaffold and redundancy slow momentum: "never lied, never manipulated, and never asked" is a list; "Her actions were transparent, her motives pure" paraphrases the prior sentence; "their conversations shifting from fear to action" tells what should be shown. The climax compresses causally dense action ("worked for hours… reinforced… secured… chanted") into summary without propulsion. Stock metaphors ("candle flame," "morning frost") and template cadence ("She was not the kind of specter who…") reduce texture.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The premise (ghost orchestrates collective effort via chalk messages) offers a fresh method, but the emotional arc and resolution follow a familiar template: community mobilizes, hope prevails, threat is averted without ambiguity. The butterfly garden watering bell as symbol of renewal is asserted rather than transformed through specificity. No turn or final image reweights the setup in an unexpected way; the settlers' bond and Elara's role remain static from inciting incident to closure, and the ending affirms rather than reconfigures.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Elara is present across the story and her altruism frames the premise, but her key "decisions"—to send messages, to materialize at the gathering—are summarized rather than dramatized as choices with visible cost or friction. She "reexamined her approach" in a brief reflection but no on-page reversal or tactical shift follows. The closure ("faded into the twilight, her mission complete") is passive and cost-free, more symbol than causal action.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The watering bell appears three times: initial description, Elara's use to water plants (told, not shown), and suspension from the arch at the climax. No beat dramatizes Elara handling the bell or shows its mechanics altering a choice. The final reprise asserts it as "symbol of renewal" and claims it "chimed softly" somewhere in the nebula, but this is ornamental closure cameo, not causal payoff.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The nebula of respite is introduced early, frames Elara's belief system, and anchors the story's stakes (arches hold the sky, sky holds the nebula). It appears in Elara's climax speech and "flared to life" at resolution, shaping the dominant goal. However, it remains abstract—no scene shows how the nebula's mechanics or presence constrains tactics or alters a micro-decision on the page.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"Strangely trustworthy" is asserted as Elara's consistency and transparency, mentioned in exposition and echoed in the final line. No on-page beat shows her trustworthiness enabling or constraining a settler's choice, nor does it create friction or cost. The trait is label-only, swappable with "reliable" or "honest" without structural change.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Reexamine" appears once in a brief reflective sentence: "She reexamined her approach, wondering if her messages were clear enough." No on-page action follows; Elara's next move is to watch the settlers mobilize, which would have happened regardless. The verb is ornamental, easily cut or replaced without altering the plot.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The chalk-message method is introduced early and drives the middle sequence: messages appear at dawn, settlers debate, more messages shift their stance. The method shapes the settlers' gradual mobilization and is Elara's primary tactic. However, the mechanics (how a ghost chalks sidewalks, why sidewalks exist on an orchard planet) are not explored, and the messages' content is generic ("Strength in numbers") without specificity that charges the closure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The orchard planet and floating arches are central to the premise and stakes: arches crumbling threatens the orchards and nebula. The gathering occurs "beneath the largest arch," and the settlers "reinforced the arch with ropes." However, the setting remains scenic—no micro-detail (bramble, gravity anomaly, tool constraint) alters a tactic on the page, and the resolution is told in summary rather than shown through environmental pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"After strangers become family" is mentioned once as "a phrase etched into the planet's collective memory" and used to anchor the settlers' prior bonding. It does not shape the present timeline or tighten decisions; the story's events occur in an unspecified "now" with no pressure from elapsed or remaining time. The timeframe is ornamental backstory, not a constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation "to orchestrate collective effort" is stated explicitly and drives her tactic (chalk messages) and the climax (gathering). The motivation is consistent and frames the dominant stake. However, it is not dramatized through conflicting wants or visible cost—Elara's desire faces no friction, and her success is summarized rather than tested in a choice that forecloses an alternative.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Brambled hope" is named once in exposition ("the orchard planet's brambled hope was palpable") but does not modulate through the narrative. The tone throughout is earnest and aspirational, with no tonal shift or complication at peak pressure. The final image ("a sound as strange and trustworthy as the ghost who had rung it") gestures toward the phrase but does not charge it with new meaning or cost.</comment>
