<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Kael's motivation (caretaker bound by curse, obligated to save travelers) is clear and drives his choices under pressure. Interiority is concrete and embodied through physical detail ("ridges biting into his palm," frozen breath). Internal conflict surfaces in his hatred of the birds balanced against obligation, though the contradiction could press harder in the climax. The shift from reluctance to action is credible but the final moment lacks a visible personal cost that would elevate the arc.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: Kael's knowledge of the blueprint enables each tactic (marker placement, door discovery), and the traveler's rescue satisfies the curse. Orientation anchors cleanly in the opening paragraph. The closure delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis: the curse is satisfied "for now," paths will reset) with conceptual cost (endless recurrence) legible in the final beats. One meaningful tightening occurs when the birds converge and he slams the door, narrowing options and forcing the nut's use.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The labyrinth's frost-tipped gravel, dead vines, and crumbling fountain are vivid and purposeful. The mechanical birds supply immediate constraint (their circling forces Kael to freeze, altering his timing). The nut's ridged shell and the door's rusted hinges are tactile and specific. Micro-setting (the narrow tunnel, the fountain basin choked with ivy) charges the final sequence. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout the maze navigation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (guide traveler to safety or suffer the curse) is signaled early and drives every move. Pressure tightens when the birds dive lower and the traveler's whimper grows louder, forcing Kael to act despite risk. The door discovery and subsequent slam constitute one meaningful reversal that narrows options. The cost is felt (the curse satisfied temporarily, the labyrinth will reset) and the resolution is earned by Kael's agency. No second reversal, but one clean escalation suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme of cyclical obligation and imperfect rescue emerges through concrete particulars (the nut's cracked shell, the labyrinth's reset, the orchard's pulsing roots). The "graceless beauty" motif—tilted stones, snapped branches—anchors the notion of flawed but necessary intervention. The final image (nut cracked but intact, paths shifting like sand) resonates without stating a moral. However, the phrase "The curse was satisfied—for now" edges toward explicit summary rather than letting the image carry the weight alone.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable and Kael's perceptual signature is consistent (he notices the birds' brass eyes, the ridges of the nut, the frost blooming). Diction matches his wearied caretaker stance ("cursed under his breath," "shoved her inside"). The single line of dialogue ("Go") is terse and goal-driven, fitting the urgency. Free indirect style is clean, and psychic distance modulates purposefully (closer in crisis beats, wider in the opening survey). No filter-verb stacks or head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Sentence variety and rhythm support momentum; vivid concrete detail (brass eyes, sap like blood, gears spat sparks) carries high information density. Minor scaffold appears: "The birds were already circling" followed immediately by "The birds screeched, diving lower" repeats the subject without advancing new information. "Offhandedly exact" in paragraph two reads as exposition rather than dramatized trait. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes effectively. No major loops or muddle in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The combination of cursed orchard, mechanical birds, and a blueprint hidden in a nut offers a specific synthesis. The "leaving impressions without touching" constraint is fresh but underdeveloped on the page (only one stone and one twig are shown). The labyrinth-as-shifting-puzzle and the caretaker's obligation transform familiar guardian tropes through grounded detail. The ending image (nut cracked but intact, paths resetting) feels earned in hindsight. Risks are moderate; deeper exploration of the constraint method would elevate originality further.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kael's reluctant caretaker role drives every choice: he deciphers the blueprint, marks the path, opens the door, and accepts the curse's temporary satisfaction. His decisions create the key turn (rescuing the traveler) and the closure (accepting the cycle will continue). Early signal, multiple beats, causal pressure, and closure linkage all present.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The nut appears in paragraphs 2, 3, and 6, shaping three beats: Kael fumbles for it to guide placement, uses its map to justify markers, and twists it to lock the door mechanism. It enables tactics under stress and contributes to closure (cracked but intact in the final paragraph). However, the twist-lock feels introduced late without prior setup, reducing irreplaceability slightly.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The forgotten blueprint is introduced early (paragraph 2), shapes Kael's strategy throughout (marker placement, door discovery), and remains present in the final image (the nut's map "had held"). It enables the core conflict resolution and constrains his methods. The descriptor "offhandedly exact" is noted but not dramatized in action, keeping it from higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Offhandedly exact" is labeled in paragraph 2 ("as if the creator had scribbled it without care, yet known every turn by heart") but does not constrain or enable any on-page action with visible cost. The trait describes the blueprint's design rather than Kael's behavior or choices. It remains ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Assemble" appears in paragraph 2 ("assembling fragments of memory and myth") as backstory, not present action. The on-page work (placing stones, bending branches, opening the door) is immediate execution rather than assembly. However, the assembled knowledge enables all tactics, so the action's result drives the plot. The swappability (could be "decipher" or "reconstruct") and past-tense positioning reduce the score.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Leaving impressions without touching" is stated in paragraph 3 ("arrange stones, bend branches, let the wind carry his intent") and Kael presses a pebble and drops a twig. The method is signaled and used, but only two brief beats demonstrate it, and the door-opening at the end involves direct touch (pulling, slamming). The constraint shapes one middle passage but does not dominate tactics or closure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The cliffside labyrinth and mechanical birds are established in paragraph 1, constrain Kael's movements (he freezes when birds dive, their circling forces timing choices), and supply the arena for all action. The birds' brass eyes and gear-grinding create atmosphere and immediate threat. The labyrinth's crumbling fountain houses the hidden door that enables closure. Early signal, sustained pressure, and closure participation all strong.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Before the night frost forms" is named in paragraph 2 and returns in paragraph 6 ("Frost began to bloom on the stones"). The timeframe tightens Kael's urgency but is not tracked beat-by-beat; we do not see the clock narrow his choices dynamically. It frames the stakes and appears at closure, but the live pressure is more from the birds and traveler's cry than the frost deadline.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Kael's motivation (guide lost travelers to safety or wither under the curse) is established in paragraph 1, drives every on-page choice (answering the cry, marking the path, opening the door, shoving the traveler inside), and the closure confirms satisfaction of that obligation. The friction between his hatred of the task and the compulsion to act is embodied. Early signal, causal pressure, and closure linkage all evident.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The tone of "graceless beauty" is introduced in paragraph 4 ("the graceless beauty of his task lay in its imperfection—the way the stones tilted, the branches snapped at odd angles") and sustained through imagery (jerky movements, weary labyrinth, cracked but intact nut). The tone charges the final image (imperfect success, enduring cycle). Coherent through turns and modulated with pressure, though the explicit mid-story label reduces subtlety slightly.</comment>
