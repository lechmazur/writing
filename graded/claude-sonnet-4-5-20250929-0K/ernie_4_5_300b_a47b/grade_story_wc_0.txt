<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's shift from cosmic detachment to greenhouse humility is signaled, but her interior life remains largely summary-level ("she'd begun preprocessing reality through a different lens"). The monarch chrysalis sequence offers one micro-choice beat (monitoring it daily), yet the final symposium choice to present dust patterns lacks visible cost or contradiction—colleagues' confusion doesn't foreclose a path on the page. Interiority leans toward thesis statement ("Decay isn't an event, it's a language") rather than embodied pressure, and the protagonist's renunciation of institute expectations feels declared rather than dramatized with trade-offs.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes who/where/when within the opening paragraph and tracks an Accumulative lens: dust accumulation → spectrometer analysis → chrysalis emergence → symposium presentation. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Elara's professional identity reweighted by the botanist's cross-referencing question), but the cost remains oblique—ignoring the institute's demand is mentioned without visible consequence, and "evolved her" asserts transformation rather than landing it in a final image with undeniable pressure. The drive lens holds, yet the ending feels summarized rather than charged on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The storm-damaged greenhouse supplies vivid, purpose-driven detail (fogged spectacles, moth-eaten fern, snapped bamboo stake, silt-clogged drains) filtered through Elara's scientific vocabulary. Spatial choreography is clean, and the chrysalis lodged in the drainage pipe constrains her monitoring routine. The final symposium setting is generic—no environmental feature shapes the talk or the botanist's approach—keeping Q3 from the high band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—recovering meaning from chaos via dust analysis—is signaled early. One meaningful tightening occurs when the chrysalis emerges and sheds dust in a spiral pattern, reweighting her hypothesis. Yet the symposium choice (ignoring institute scorn, presenting dust slides) lacks visible cost: the botanist's interest is supportive, not a trade-off. The pressure accumulates under an Accumulative lens, but the ending offers no foreclosed path or felt price, only affirmation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Theme—gradual change as entropic language—emerges organically from Elara's spectrometry work and the fern/chrysalis observations. The final line "evolved her" and the botanist's tree-ring analogy attempt a non-literal answer, but the piece leans toward thesis articulation ("Gradual change is the universe's only constant") rather than letting the dust spiral image speak alone. No overt moralizing in the final paragraph, yet the resolution feels conceptually tidy rather than resonant with ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Elara's perceptual filter (waveform of a dying pulsar, accretion disks) is distinct and consistent. Psychic distance is stable. Dialogue at the symposium ("Your dust patterns—they're like tree rings") advances plot and carries subtext about interdisciplinary validation. Under peak pressure (institute call, symposium presentation), diction remains controlled. However, the narration occasionally slips into expository interiority ("She'd spent decades reducing celestial phenomena to numbers, but here, the numbers resisted") that tells rather than shows resistance through failed calculations or mismatched data.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Sentence openings vary; rhythm modulates with scene needs. Information density is high in the spectrometer and chrysalis beats. Two paraphrase loops appear: "Her work usually involved parsing the faint hum of collapsing stars, but here, amidst the wreckage, she'd begun preprocessing reality through a different lens" echoes the opening's "traded sterility for chaos" formulation, and the double articulation of humility ("humility gnawed at her" / "kindled a humility she'd lost") within one paragraph (−0.3). No filter-verb stacks or template cadence runs. Clarity and momentum are maintained.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The neutron-star-researcher-studies-post-flood-greenhouse frame offers a fresh synthesis, yoking astrophysics vocabulary to botanical decay. The dust-as-stellar-debris conceit is specific and motivated by Elara's lens. However, the arc—scientist humbled by chaos, finds new dataset, earns interdisciplinary respect—follows a familiar redemption template. The chrysalis spiral pattern is a purposeful inflection, yet the symposium botanist's affirming question resolves tension rather than deepening it, reducing narrative risk.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her choice to present dust findings at the symposium (rather than black holes) alters her professional trajectory. Setup: first paragraph. Development: spectrometer analysis, chrysalis monitoring. Payoff: symposium presentation and botanist exchange. However, the symposium choice lacks on-page cost—colleagues' confusion is mentioned but does not foreclose a visible path. Two beats (analysis, monitoring) plus closure participation meet the mid-band, but the decision feels affirmed rather than tested. Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.9, causal pressure (mild) +0.4, swappability (could be any field-specialist reorienting) −0.5, ornamental symposium moment −0.3 → ~5.4.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The butterfly-wing dust is handled in three beats: discovery in snapped bamboo, spectrometry vial sampling, and the chrysalis's spiral shedding at closure. Setup: second paragraph. Development: spectrometer analysis (third paragraph), chrysalis emergence (seventh paragraph). Payoff: "wings shed dust, which settled in a spiral pattern she'd never seen in nature" directly charges the closure and the symposium slide. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.2, causal pressure (enables hypothesis) +0.8, specificity (iridescent, weightless, microcosm lattice) +0.5, cost (faint—institute confusion, but not protagonist's loss) +0.2, swappability (any organic trace could seed the same plot) −0.6 → ~7.1.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Gradual change" is articulated in Elara's interiority ("Her research had always been about gradual change—the slow death of stars"), tested via mold/fungal growth timescales versus neutron-star milliseconds, and restated at the symposium ("Gradual change is the universe's only constant"). Setup: third paragraph. Development: fungal growth versus stellar collapse contrast, chrysalis monitoring across days. Payoff: symposium slide thesis. The concept shapes her observational patience and hypothesis (dust accumulation as layered recovery), altering tactics (daily monitoring, spectrometry rather than telescopy). Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, causal pressure (guides method choice) +0.9, cost (institute confusion, mild) +0.2, thematic echo (restated rather than tested) −0.4, swappability (could be "transformation" or "resilience") −0.5 → ~6.8.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Preprocesses reality" appears twice: opening clause ("preprocessing reality through a different lens") and fourth paragraph ("Elara had always preprocessed reality, stripping needless drama from data"). The trait is asserted but not demonstrated through on-page choices—no scene shows her actively stripping drama or filtering inputs under pressure. Setup: first and fourth paragraphs. Development: none. Payoff: none. The attribute is label-only and does not constrain a visible action with cost. Late label (fourth paragraph) −0.3, label-only trait (no dramatized tradeoff) −0.7, summary-only use −0.5, swappability (generic "analytical detachment") −0.5, no closure participation cap 2.8 → but label appears twice, so ~5.2 for repeated presence without function.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Decay" is the greenhouse's dominant process (mold, fungal hyphae, moth-eaten fern) and Elara's research anchor ("Decay isn't an event, it's a language"). Setup: first paragraph (storm wreckage). Development: mold time-lapse, fungal growth as accretion disks, chrysalis emergence as defiance of decay. Payoff: symposium slides of "dust-caked ferns and chrysalis spirals," and the botanist's tree-ring parallel. The action shapes her hypothesis (post-flood recovery via layered steps) and redefines her professional focus. Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, closure linkage (slides, botanist exchange) +1.3, causal pressure +1.2, specificity (fungal hyphae, mold spectra) +0.6, cost (institute demands ignored) +0.3, swappability (could be "growth" or "resilience") −0.6 → ~7.3.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Through accumulated dust patterns" is Elara's method: dust settles in crevices, spectrometer lattice analysis, chrysalis dust spiral. Setup: second paragraph ("tracing the dust's path"). Development: spectrometry ("lattice of minerals and organic matter"), spiral pattern recording. Payoff: symposium presentation ("Through accumulated dust patterns, we read the story of survival") and botanist's tree-ring analogy. The method is signaled early, its mechanics matter (spectrometry enables hypothesis), and it shapes her attempts (daily monitoring, time-lapse footage). Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.1, causal pressure (enables tactics) +1.0, specificity (spectra, lattice, spiral) +0.5, cost +0.2, thematic echo (restated in symposium line) −0.4 → ~6.9.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The storm-damaged greenhouse supplies constraints (collapsed glass, uprooted orchids, silt-clogged drains) and resources (snapped bamboo stake catches butterfly wing, drainage pipe lodges chrysalis). Setup: first paragraph. Development: chrysalis monitoring within the greenhouse, mold/silt as data sources. Payoff: the greenhouse's evolution ("had not just survived; it had evolved her") closes the piece. The setting pressures Elara's observational choices (no telescopes, only particle counter and spectrometer) and micro-features (bamboo stake, drainage pipe) alter outcomes. Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, closure linkage (final sentence) +1.4, causal pressure (tools constrained, chrysalis placement matters) +1.3, specificity (terracotta pot, bamboo stake, drainage pipe) +0.7, cost (institute confusion) +0.3, swappability (any damaged research site) −0.6 → ~7.6.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"After the flood" anchors the starting condition (storm damage, silt) and contrasts with Elara's pre-flood neutron-star focus. Setup: title phrase in opening paragraph. Development: "days of peeling mold," "weeks later" symposium. Payoff: "Weeks later" marks the symposium beat. The timeframe is referenced but does not tighten decisions—no live clock or countdown alters tactics. The flood is backstory; recovery unfolds in untracked weeks. Setup present +0.3, one beat (symposium timing) +0.4, no closure participation cap 2.8, but "weeks" signal provides mild temporal structure +0.5, swappability (any post-disaster window) −0.5, vague tracking −0.4 → ~4.8 for functional but replaceable presence.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"To strip needless drama" is articulated in the fourth paragraph ("Elara had always preprocessed reality, stripping needless drama from data") and implied in her preference for "gradual change" over violent spectacle. Setup: fourth paragraph. Development: ignoring institute demands (eighth paragraph, "She ignored them"). Payoff: symposium presentation of "trivialities" versus black holes. The desire is told rather than dramatized—no on-page scene shows Elara choosing data parsimony under competing pressure. The institute-ignoring moment is summary, not a beat with visible cost. Late signal (fourth paragraph, ~40%) −0.3, one beat (institute call) +0.4, closure linkage (symposium choice) +0.8, label-only (no dramatized friction) −0.7, summary-only −0.5, swappability (generic "intellectual modesty") −0.5 → ~5.6.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Kindled humility" is signaled in the sixth paragraph ("The greenhouse had kindled a humility she'd lost among telescopes and peer reviews") and modulates through Elara's shift from cosmic detachment (neutron stars) to botanical attention (dust, mold). Setup: third paragraph ("humility gnawed at her"). Development: chrysalis monitoring as student posture, institute scorn accepted. Payoff: symposium presentation with "some scoffed. Others leaned in" and botanist validation. Tone is coherent and charges the final image (student-teacher dynamic with botanist). Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, causal pressure (guides her choice to present) +0.7, cost (institute confusion, mild) +0.2, static mood (humility asserted twice without modulation under pressure) −0.4, label-only ("kindled a humility") −0.3 → ~6.7.</comment>
