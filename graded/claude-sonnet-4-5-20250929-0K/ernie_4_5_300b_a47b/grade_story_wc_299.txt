<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lenny's roadie-to-appraiser trajectory is established early, and the cloth triggers concrete memory work. However, the emotional arc relies heavily on diagnostic phrasing ("the hollow space where purpose used to live," "masking his terror") and the final epiphany—"resurrecting forgotten stories"—arrives as articulated insight rather than embodied cost. The phone-call resolution feels unmotivated by prior on-page struggle; Lenny's shift from appraisal to storytelling appears declared rather than earned through conflicting impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes Lenny, the trailer, and the cloth within the first fifth. Drive lens reads as Causal: cloth discovery → research → phone call → purpose shift. The closure unit—Lenny's realization about resurrecting stories—lands on the page, but the cost is conceptual rather than visible; no prior option is foreclosed, and the bassist's confirmation arrives as convenience rather than complication. The phone call functions as resolution-by-conversation, undermining earned escalation. Orientation is clean; one meaningful turn (research reveals *Echo Valley*) tightens knowledge, but the ending pivot lacks felt sacrifice.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The quarry trailer is anchored early with mildew, concert posters, and desk lamp flicker. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered (dust, mud on Gus's boots, rain). The cloth's texture returns at closure ("tucked into his jacket, its texture a balm"), charging the final image. However, the trailer itself does not constrain Lenny's choices; spatial choreography during the Gus scene is clear but the setting functions more as backdrop than tactical pressure. Micro-setting (the cloth as object-setting) meets the 9+ gate test by constraining memory and charging closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—finding purpose after failure—is signaled early. One tightening occurs when the phoenix logo is discovered, narrowing Lenny's understanding and raising emotional investment. However, escalation is passive: Google provides answers, the bassist confirms, and Lenny's epiphany arrives without forfeiting a live option or paying a visible price. The phone call resolves rather than complicates. Gus's "toss it" creates brief tension but Lenny's refusal costs nothing on the page. No trade-off or foreclosed path makes the cost legible at closure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The theme—what remains after applause—emerges through the cloth, blasts replacing applause, and the final realization. The phoenix motif and *Echo Valley*'s failure parallel Lenny's trajectory without overt statement. However, the final line ("After the applause, there was still music") restates the premise as a tidy moral rather than letting the image resonate. The bassist's tales are told, not dramatized, and the epiphany is articulated ("resurrecting forgotten stories") instead of enacted through a non-literal answer. Thematic echo in the closing sentence lowers the score by 0.5.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited, anchored in Lenny's perception. Diction is controlled ("confidently uncertain," "brittle laugh") and perceptual signature is consistent (music metaphors, focus on texture). Dialogue with Gus is naturalistic and goal-driven; the bassist conversation is summarized rather than dramatized, missing subtext opportunities. Filter verbs ("he'd tell himself," "he realized") appear but remain voice-motivated. No head-hopping. Psychic distance tightens appropriately during the cloth examination. Voice remains distinct throughout, though the final summary mode flattens immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies; opening anchors cleanly. Information density is high in the cloth-discovery beat. However, paraphrase loops appear: "He'd never connected his past to *Echo Valley*" restates prior exposition, and "The cloth was a puzzle" / "facts didn't explain the ache" cycle similar conceptual ground. Template cadence runs appear in backstory: "After failing publicly—a botched appraisal… he'd retreated here" uses list-like compression. "Toss it? The idea felt like betrayal" is clear but the subsequent paragraph recycles the insulation metaphor without advancing pressure. Deduct −0.6 for loops and cadence artifacts not touching closure, plus −0.2 for one filter-verb stack in reflective passages.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The ex-roadie / antiques appraiser pairing offers mild novelty, and the quarry setting is specific. However, the core arc—failed professional finds redemption through artifact discovery—is a widely used template. The cloth-as-talisman and phone-call confirmation follow familiar beats. *Echo Valley* as fictional prog-rock band adds texture but does not transform the premise. Emotional honesty is present but the resolution avoids risk: Lenny's purpose is declared, not tested. The story hedges by providing external validation (the bassist) rather than forcing Lenny to act on incomplete knowledge. Swappability is high; many objects and backstories could serve the same function.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lenny is present throughout and makes two key decisions: refusing to toss the cloth and calling the bassist. Setup is immediate; he drives the research beat and the closure insight. The roadie-to-appraiser trajectory shapes his perceptual filter and emotional stakes. However, the final epiphany is articulated rather than enacted, and the phone call resolves rather than complicates. Causal pressure is moderate; his choices narrow knowledge but do not foreclose a live option with visible cost. Three beats (cloth discovery, research, phone call) and closure linkage place this in mid-7s, but lack of on-page cost caps it at 6.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The cloth appears in the opening beat, is wrestled from the crate, examined for pattern, researched (phoenix logo), and returns at closure ("tucked into his jacket, its texture a balm"). Four distinct beats plus closure participation. The cloth's properties (frayed edges, gold/crimson threads, phoenix logo) drive Lenny's research and emotional arc. Its texture recharges at the end, reweighting the dominant stake. However, the cloth does not constrain a choice with visible cost; Lenny keeps it without sacrifice. Strong setup, beat involvement, and closure linkage elevate; swappability (any relic could serve) and lack of cost trade-off limit the score to mid-7s.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"After the applause" frames the quarry setting ("echoes of dynamite blasts replaced applause") and Lenny's internal question ("After the applause, what's left?"). The concept shapes stakes (finding purpose post-failure) and returns in the final line ("After the applause, there was still music"). Setup is early; closure participation is strong. However, the concept is stated rather than enacted; it functions as thematic frame rather than tactical constraint. The bassist's stories are told in summary, missing dramatization of what comes after performance. Early signal and closure reprise earn 5.9, but lack of causal pressure and on-page cost cap it there.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Confidently uncertain" is labeled once ("Roadie by default, appraiser by necessity, he'd mastered the art of insulating himself emotionally with facts. *Confidently uncertain*, he'd always been."). It does not constrain or enable an on-page action with visible cost. Lenny's hesitation with Gus ("Maybe. It's… unique.") could illustrate the trait, but the label is not earned through contradictory impulses acting in scene. Summary-only use and ornamental mention place this in low-4s.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Wrest" appears once: "He'd wrested it from the crate with a mix of reverence and frustration." The action initiates the cloth examination but is swappable (pulled, retrieved, extracted). It does not drive a key turn or redefine options; the cloth's discovery would unfold identically with a gentler verb. Setup is present; no middle or closure participation. Functional but replaceable places this at 5.1.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Insulating emotionally with facts" is signaled early ("he'd mastered the art of insulating himself emotionally with facts") and demonstrated when Lenny uses appraisal jargon to deflect grief ("This cloth is from a 1970s Marshall stack"). The research beat (Google search) enacts the method. However, the method does not fail or impose cost; the phone call validates rather than challenges it. Setup and one middle beat earn 5.6, but lack of escalation or closure cost caps it there.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The quarry office trailer is anchored early (desk lamp, mildew, concert posters, Gus's knock). It provides the crate and frames Lenny's isolation. The quarry blasts contrast with applause, deepening theme. However, the trailer does not constrain Lenny's choices or supply resources that alter outcome. Gus's "toss it" is deflected without spatial or resource cost. Setup, thematic participation, and closure context (the cloth stays in his pocket as he listens to blasts) earn 6.3, but lack of tactical pressure prevents higher scoring.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The timeframe—after the TV debacle—is established early and motivates Lenny's retreat to the quarry. The "next morning" marks a transition to the phone call. However, time does not tighten decisions; the research and call occur at Lenny's pace without urgency. No clock or deadline alters tactics. Setup is present; middle and closure participation are weak. Functional framing without escalation places this at 4.8.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Lenny's desire to discover purpose after loss is signaled early (the TV failure, "the hollow space where purpose used to live") and drives his refusal to toss the cloth. The phone call and epiphany directly address the motivation. Three beats plus closure participation. However, the desire is told more than dramatized; the epiphany is articulated ("he'd found his purpose") rather than enacted through a conflicted choice with visible cost. Setup, beat involvement, and closure linkage earn mid-6s; lack of on-page friction between want and cost caps it at 6.7.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Echo valley longing" reads as melancholy yearning for lost music and purpose. Tone is established through concert posters, the cloth's "hum of familiarity," and Lenny's brittle laugh. The quarry blasts and mildew underscore isolation. The tone modulates slightly when the bassist's stories offer connection. However, tone does not intensify under pressure; the phone call flattens rather than charges. The final line ("After the applause, there was still music") restates rather than reweights. Coherent setup and moderate modulation earn 5.8, but static resolution prevents higher scoring.</comment>
