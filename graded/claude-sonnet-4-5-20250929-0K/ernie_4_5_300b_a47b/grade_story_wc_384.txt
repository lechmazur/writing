<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lirael's motivation to "forgive the unfinished" is told rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses in scene. Her interior remains abstract—"tasting of iron and regret"—without embodied emotion or micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values under pressure. The backstory about the queen and her sister is summary-only; we never see Lirael's present stance shift through an on-page choice tied to this history. The final act of placing the scroll and walking away reads as resolved intention rather than a choice that forecloses a live path with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive clearly in the opening. The piece follows a single continuous scene in one location with Lirael as sole on-page character, meeting Track A defaults. Closure reads as Earned Stasis—she completes the forgery, places it, and departs—but the cost is abstract ("her purpose") rather than a legible trade-off or foreclosed option on the page. Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the final image of her vanishing "leaving only the echo of her purpose" gestures toward reconfiguration but lacks the felt price or cadence shift that would constitute a Resonant Reconfiguration with cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The marble sanctuary, stalactites, aurora, and moss-veined floor are vivid and selective. The thorn and parchment function as micro-setting elements that constrain her ritual action—pricking her thumb, sealing with blood. The aurora's shifting hues modulate with her work, and the hidden alcove serves as the closure destination. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout, and the setting charges the final departure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—creating a treaty forgery to offer warring heirs a choice—is signaled early but remains abstract throughout. No on-page opposition or reversal tests Lirael's commitment; she works alone, finishes, places the scroll, and leaves without a tightening choice or visible cost that narrows options. The "key with no apparent lock" and "calibrated treason" are asserted concepts, not pressures that force trade-offs. Under the Accumulative lens, we need a cadence shift or deepening that reweights the stake with cost; the ending recapitulates her resolve without altering it.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The theme of forgiveness and reconciliation emerges from Lirael's stated purpose and the queen's backstory, but it is asserted rather than earned through specific on-page friction. The final image—vanishing, leaving "only the echo of her purpose"—gestures toward resonance but remains abstract; it does not reweight prior material through a non-literal answer. The "key with no apparent lock" is introduced as metaphor but never tested or transformed by event, limiting thematic payoff.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Single-POV narration is clean with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent—Lirael's attention to ritual, material, and history—though diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("treason with a calligrapher's precision," "mosaic of broken promises") that feels authorial rather than character-rooted. The whispered phrase "Calibrated treason" and interior declarations ("approval meant nothing") read as thematic placeholders rather than voice-specific thought under pressure. Filter verbs and stance remain controlled throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but several lines loop or paraphrase without advancing pressure: "Her forgeries were never meant to deceive the living. They were keys with no apparent lock, designed to open doors in the aftermath of war" states the concept twice. "The key with no apparent lock was her method" repeats the metaphor without deepening it. Stock metaphors—"liquid time," "velvet" silence, "iron and regret"—cluster in the opening third, and the phrase "calibrated treason" is invoked without concrete embodiment. Minimal scaffold, but figurative density in early beats slightly dulls momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The premise—calligrapher forging a treaty to offer reconciliation—is fresh in its ritual specificity (the thorn's blood, the spiral cipher). However, the emotional arc and thematic beats follow a familiar template: lone artisan performs symbolic act to heal historical wounds, departs into twilight. The "key with no apparent lock" metaphor is intriguing but remains abstract; no on-page event transforms it into a surprising realization. The ending recapitulates the opening stance without a non-obvious turn.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Lirael is present throughout and her craft drives the scene's action—dipping quill, tracing treaty, pricking thumb, rolling scroll. However, her choices are predetermined; no on-page decision alters tactics or stakes. She completes the work as intended and places it without friction, reading as execution of prior resolve rather than a choice that narrows options.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The heritage rose thorn appears in three beats: lying beside her, pricking her thumb to seal the forgery, and tucked into her sleeve at the end. Its curse—"it remembered every wound it had inflicted"—charges the blood-sealing moment and its final dismissal ("Its curse would fade with time") reweights it as penance released. The object constrains her ritual action and receives a purposeful reprise, though its curse mechanics are told rather than dramatized in pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The phrase "calibrated treason" is whispered once and declared thematically ("tasting of iron and regret"), but the concept does not constrain on-page tactics or force a trade-off. Lirael's act is framed as forgiveness rather than rebellion, softening the treason premise. The concept is present and consistent but swappable with "calibrated mercy" or similar abstractions without structural change.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The phrase "wisely enduring" modifies "perfection was a lie she'd learned to wield" in the opening paragraph. It labels her approach but does not constrain a choice or create visible cost. Endurance is asserted rather than tested; no on-page moment forces her to persist against friction where the cost of endurance is felt.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Unlink" appears once in the motivation sentence: "to unlink the chains of vengeance that bound the living to the dead." It names her goal but does not drive a turn or choice. The act of placing the scroll might metaphorically "unlink," but the verb is not invoked at that moment and could be replaced with "sever" or "dissolve" (which also appears: "let it dissolve like ink in rain") without altering structure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The "key with no apparent lock" is introduced early as her method—a spiral symbol in the margin—and reappears in her reflection ("had been her compass") and the closure paragraph. It shapes her design of the cipher, meeting setup and closure gates. However, its mechanics remain abstract; no on-page beat shows the key enabling a tactic or foreclosing an option, limiting causal participation.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The marble sanctuary is anchored early with vivid sensory detail (stalactites, aurora, moss-veined floor, carved walls). It supplies the hidden alcove niche where Lirael places the scroll, directly affecting her closure action. The aurora's shifting light modulates with her work, and the sanctuary's silence and architecture charge the final departure. The setting pressures her ritual through its sacred, isolated atmosphere and provides the closure destination.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Stalactites dripping appears three times: in the opening description, at the scroll's completion ("As stalactites dripped, Lirael finished"), and in the penultimate paragraph ("The stalactites dripped, each drop a tick of the clock she'd been racing all her life"). The motif signals duration and ritual patience but does not tighten a decision or alter tactics. Time remains unmarked and unthreatening; no countdown constrains her choices.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"To forgive the unfinished" is named explicitly in paragraph seven as her motivation and tied to the queen's unreconciled death. It frames the scroll's purpose and her willingness to use the cursed thorn. However, the desire is told rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses; no on-page friction tests her commitment to forgiveness over another want (safety, recognition, revenge). The motivation anchors the premise but does not constrain a choice with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Pearl twilight is seeded in the opening phrase ("aurora's pearl twilight") and returns in the final paragraph ("In the pearl twilight, she vanished"). The tone—hushed, ritualistic, elegiac—remains coherent and modulates subtly as she moves from work to completion to departure. The aurora's shifting hues (rose, violet, silver) charge the final image with luminous ambiguity. The tone supports the closure reconfiguration without static repetition.</comment>
