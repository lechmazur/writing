<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is stated abstractly ("teach silence how to comfort") rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses under pressure. Her "method was fluidly logical" arrives as a label without showing tactical choices constrained by competing needs. The vial-watching sequence feels observational rather than choice-driven; the epiphany ("silence itself was speaking") lands as sudden insight rather than earned through on-page struggle with visible cost. Interior voice relies on elevated diction ("vaulting hush," "catalyze a solution") that reads more authorial than gondola-operator particular.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors clearly (gondola operator, prism terrace canal, post-whistle night). The dominant stake—understanding silence to heal the terrace's anxiety—is signaled early. However, the closure hinges on a realization ("silence itself was speaking") that arrives through passive observation of the vial rather than a decision or renunciation that forecloses options. The conceptual repricing is present but the felt cost is unclear; Elara's tomorrow plan feels additive rather than a foreclosure of a prior path, weakening the closure's charge under a causal or accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Sensory detail is vivid and layered (onyx gondola, glass-still canal, kaleidoscopic spires refracting moonlight into fractals). The storm glass vial functions as a micro-setting object that shapes Elara's observation method and charges the final image when its liquid stills. Spatial choreography remains clear across moves. The prism terrace's drifting districts and canal network anchor the world convincingly, though occupational detail (gondola operation mechanics) remains light and the terrace's "perpetual motion" constraint doesn't visibly narrow a choice on the page.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake (teaching silence to comfort) is signaled early but remains abstract; no live alternative or trade-off pressures Elara's observational method. The vial's stillness is a discovery moment, not a tightening that forecloses options—she doesn't renounce a prior tactic or pay a visible price to gain the insight. The resolution ("adjust her routes") feels like an add-on plan rather than a consequence of foreclosed paths. Escalation under the inferred accumulative lens requires a deepening or cadence shift that reweights cost; here the pressure flattens into contemplation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Theme (the presence of silence versus absence of noise) emerges through the storm glass as prism metaphor and Elara's shift from teaching silence to noticing it. The final image reweights prior material without overt moralizing. However, the conceptual answer arrives through a told epiphany ("she'd always thought silence needed to be taught, but perhaps it only needed to be noticed") rather than a non-literal image that lets the reader construct meaning. The train whistle as "bridge between worlds" reads close to abstract thematic statement rather than earned from scene particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with consistent psychic distance. Diction elevates beyond the gondola-operator register in peak beats ("vaulting hush," "catalyze," "liminal space," "canvas for comfort") without clear voice motivation, creating register drift. Perceptual signature is present (Elara notices vibrations, froth patterns, crystalline calm) but the narrator's way of processing tilts toward authorial lyricism rather than character-particular syntax. No dialogue on the page to judge. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops in adjacent lines damage momentum: "The quiet that followed the whistle's death throes" / "The prism terrace was a place of perpetual motion" both summarize rather than advance pressure. "She'd chosen this shift deliberately, hoping the solitude would help her catalyze a solution" is scaffold exposition. Figurative density in the opening (glass-still canal, liquid fractals, storm glass vial, vaulting hush, kaleidoscopic spires) clusters without pattern-teaching, triggering overwriting penalty. Elevated register ("catalyze," "undercurrent," "liminal," "resonance of stillness") clashes with gondola-operator lexicon in peak beats. Template stems ("Elara's role was… Elara believed… Elara smiled… Elara knew") recur across the text. Applying patterned-artifact penalty pack: −1.2 in Q7; artifacts touch closure paragraph, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The gondola-as-vessel-for-contemplation frame and the storm-glass-as-emotional-barometer are familiar tropes executed without sharp transformation. The "teach silence" premise reads close to a meditation-workshop template; the resolution (noticing versus teaching) is a stock insight from mindfulness discourse. Specific world detail (prism terrace, obsidian gondola, iridescent quartz bridge) offers surface texture but the emotional arc and thematic turn could transplant to a monastery garden or therapy office with minor edits, signaling insufficient particularity. No bold structural risk or non-obvious synthesis that redefines prior material.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout but her key "choice" is observational (watching the vial still) rather than a decision that narrows options. She plans to adjust routes tomorrow, but that intention doesn't foreclose a path on the page. Her role as gondola operator frames the setting but doesn't constrain a pivotal action with cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Storm glass vial appears in opening paragraph (lap), is consulted multiple times (beneath the bridge, tilted, raised to moonlight), and its stillness triggers the realization at closure. It shapes two distinct beats (monitoring froth in market, crystalline calm in gardens) and charges the final image. However, its use remains observational tool rather than constraining a choice with visible trade-off, capping score below 7.0 threshold.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"In transit" is present (gondola gliding, ferrying between districts, drifting beneath bridge, propelling toward terrace's heart) but functions as setting descriptor rather than shaping stakes or altering tactics. The closure realization could occur in a stationary observation post with minor edits; transit doesn't create the pressure that forces the insight.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Fluidly logical" appears once as a label ("Her method was fluidly logical") without demonstrating how that trait constrains or enables action. No on-page moment where fluid logic trades off against another approach or incurs cost. The monitoring method itself is straightforward observation, not a dramatized logical maneuver.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Catalyze" is mentioned twice (hoping to "catalyze a solution," storm glass "catalyzed this revelation") and names the method of achieving the insight. However, the action is passive observation rather than an intervention; Elara doesn't actively catalyze a chemical or social reaction, she watches the vial still. The verb choice reads more metaphorical than causal, and the insight arrives through the vial's independent change rather than her catalytic act.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Monitoring noise levels is signaled early ("monitor noise levels across the terrace, then correlate spikes with emotional states") and shapes two beats (crowds frothing the liquid, solitude leaving it crystalline). The method's mechanics (vial reacting to vibrations) matter to the discovery. However, it remains observational rather than forcing a tactical choice under pressure; Elara doesn't adjust her monitoring in response to resistance or cost.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Drifting prism terrace is vividly described (kaleidoscopic spires, floating districts, shifting tides, labyrinth of canals) and anchors all action. Its "perpetual motion" and "dazzling chaos" motivate Elara's search for silence. However, the terrace's drift doesn't constrain a choice on the page—Elara moves freely without the shifting geography altering her tactics or imposing cost. It functions as atmospheric backdrop rather than active pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The timeframe ("quiet that follows a train whistle's echo") is named in the opening line and establishes the contemplative window. Midnight market closing is noted, creating temporal anchor. However, the whistle's aftermath doesn't tighten decisions or create a deadline; Elara has open-ended solitude. Time progresses passively (stars wink, gondola glides on) without pressure that would alter her moves.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Motivation "to teach silence how to comfort" is stated early and frames the weeks-long data collection. The final realization shifts the approach (noticing versus teaching), creating a lyric reprise. However, the desire is told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants—no on-page friction between teaching silence and another competing need, no visible cost when she pivots her understanding. The motivation guides observation but doesn't force a choice that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Vaulting hush" appears twice (opening and near closure) as signature phrase and colors the contemplative tone throughout (glass-still canal, breath-holding air, enveloping cocoon). Tone modulates subtly from tension ("gnawed at her for weeks") to revelation calm. However, the hush remains consistent atmosphere rather than shifting under pressure beats; no tonal break or intensification that charges the closure image beyond the lyric reprise of the phrase itself.</comment>
