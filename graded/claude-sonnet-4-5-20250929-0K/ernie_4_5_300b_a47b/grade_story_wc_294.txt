<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias's interior is labeled rather than embodied—"polished calm" and "perceptively calm" appear as assertions without contradictory impulses acting in scene. His motivation to "discover why some paths circle back" remains abstract; the crucial choice to leave territorial markers emerges from reflection rather than pressure-driven stakes. The father's drunken burning of money is vivid backstory, but Elias's present micro-choices (placing bills, watching from a distance) lack visible cost or internal friction. The final peace feels declared rather than earned through on-page struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The piece signals a hybrid lens (reflective accumulation leading to a conceptual repricing at closure). Orientation is clear early. The closure—Elias finding peace and "breaking the cycle" via symbols—lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis: renunciation of force), but the cost is conceptual rather than felt on the page; his calm is never tested by direct confrontation or failure. The startup collapse happens off-page and Marcus's restlessness is summarized, not dramatized, weakening causal linkage. One meaningful deepening occurs (realization that choices, not fate, drive cycles), meeting the minimum for this length, but the final image restates the theme rather than charging prior material with new pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The circus train anchor is vivid and specific (ivy, rusting carriages, crumbling trapeze poster), and the dusky-to-night transition provides atmospheric progression. However, the train functions as backdrop rather than constraint—Elias's choices are not shaped by the environment's affordances or limits. The foreign bills are handled across beats but do not constrain action; they serve as symbols deployed at will. Spatial choreography inside the train and at the startup offices is vague (no sense of Marcus's desk location, break room proximity, or Elias's vantage when "watching from a distance"). The final image ("sounds of the abandoned train settling") is mood, not a charged environmental detail that alters the closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Elias seeking to understand cyclical paths and dissuade the founders—is signaled early but remains abstract. The "dissuasion" unfolds off-page (Marcus grows restless, founders argue) without on-page confrontation or reversal that tests Elias's agency. The one tightening is conceptual: Elias realizes choices drive cycles, not fate. However, this insight arrives via reflection rather than pressure; no live option is foreclosed with visible cost. The startup's collapse is a parallel illustration, not a consequence of Elias's intervention, and his success (founders shaken, trust frayed) is summarized rather than dramatized. Agency is decision (placing bills) but the trade-off or price is not legible on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The theme—paths circle back through choices (greed, ambition, fear) rather than fate—emerges from Elias's reflection and the symbolic use of the foreign bills. The Cuba and Zimbabwe notes carry subtext (revolution/betrayal, hyperinflation collapse), and the father's burning of money is a vivid particular. However, the final paragraph moralizes explicitly: "some paths, if walked with wisdom, need never circle back" reads as thesis statement rather than image-driven resonance. The startup collapse functions as allegory (transparent stand-in for Elias's own cycle-breaking) without narrative friction. The ending reconfigures meaning but states rather than shows the answer to the central question, lowering thematic charge.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>POV distance is stable, focalized through Elias with consistent third-limited. Voice texture is present ("collection of foreign paper money pressed tight," "dusky harmony") and diction stays within Elias's reflective register. However, at peak beats—"He'd discovered why some paths circle back"—the narration slips into summary that tells the realization rather than dramatizing it through embodied perception or micro-choice. No dialogue appears (policy: judge only if present). The perceptual signature (noticing old wood, trapeze smiles, worn bill edges) is selective but static; under emotional pressure (finding peace), the prose does not tighten or shift rhythm. Free indirect style is clean, no head-hopping. Minor filter-verb reliance ("He remembered," "He wondered") dulls immediacy in reflective passages but remains voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Line-level clarity is generally high, with vivid images (ivy-swallowed carriages, fistful of bills into fire). However, paraphrase loops appear: "He'd come here not for nostalgia, but to discover why some paths circle back" in paragraph one is restated in paragraph three ("he wondered if his father had been right") and again in the penultimate paragraph ("He'd discovered why..."). Template cadence runs through reflective beats: "He reached... He began... He'd learned..." across adjacent paragraphs. The final two paragraphs summarize rather than propel, with redundant thematic claims ("He'd found his answer," "some paths... need never circle back"). No egregious artifacts touch the closure image itself, but density sags in the ending. Sentence rhythm is competent but uniform; peak beats (placing the bills, realization of peace) lack syntactic variation to heighten pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The core premise—using symbolic currency as "territorial markers" to dissuade without confrontation—offers a fresh angle, and the circus-train frame is specific. However, the execution follows a familiar template: protagonist reflects on father's crimes, uses father's lessons to break a cycle, finds peace via wisdom rather than struggle. The startup collapse as parallel to Elias's journey reads as illustrative rather than causally integrated. Emotional specificity is present (father's drunken rage, worn bill edges) but the arc—reflection leading to epiphany and calm—is a well-worn path. The "territorial markers" mechanic is under-dramatized (bills appear, Marcus reacts off-page) and could be replaced with any symbolic gift without altering the emotional or thematic resolution. Risk-taking is minimal; the piece stays in the safety middle, avoiding bold structural choices or moral ambiguity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elias (highway robber's son) is the focalizer and his backstory (father's robberies, his own cultivation of calm) frames the piece. However, his key decision—to place foreign bills as dissuasion—happens off-page in summary ("He began by leaving a single foreign bill...") rather than as a dramatized turn. His observation of Marcus and the founders is told, not shown, and his final realization (paths circle back through choices) arrives via reflection rather than a choice that alters tactics. Present in setup, middle reflection, and closure, but agency is mostly observational. Two gates (setup, payoff) met; middle development is weak (no on-page choice under pressure). Late-penalty does not apply (present throughout). Causal pressure is low (his choices do not narrow options on the page). Closure linkage is moderate (he returns to the train and finds peace, but the bills do not reappear in the final image). Swappability is moderate (another reflective protagonist could serve the same function). Estimated: setup +0.5, one beat +0.4, closure moderate +0.5, causal pressure minimal +0.2, cost not visible on page 0, swappable −0.6, total ~4.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The collection of foreign paper money appears in setup (pressed in coat pocket, paragraph one), middle (bills from Prague, Marrakech, Barcelona; father burning them; Elias spreading them in the train), action beats (placing Cuba and Zimbabwe bills as territorial markers), and closure (spread before him in the train, reweighted as "talisman"). Three beats: intro, deployment, final reprise. Early signal +0.6. Three beats +1.4. Causal pressure moderate (bills enable the dissuasion tactic) +0.8. Closure linkage strong (final image: bills spread, meaning reweighted) +1.2. Specificity high (Cuba = revolution/betrayal, Zimbabwe = hyperinflation) +0.6. Cost connection weak (no visible price tied to using them) +0.1. However, the bills are symbolic rather than constraining—Elias could use any objects as markers with minor edits (swappable −0.7). The father's burning is vivid backstory but does not constrain present action. Summary-only deployment (we do not see Elias place the bills in real time, only told "He began by leaving...") −0.5. Total ~6.1. Rounding down: 6.1.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"A polished calm" is stated as Elias's cultivated trait in paragraph two and recurs as label throughout ("his polished calm unbroken," "a sense of calm he'd never thought possible"). However, it remains assertion rather than constraint—his calm is never tested by confrontation, failure, or contradiction on the page. It does not narrow options or force a trade-off. Setup: present by paragraph two +0.5. Development: no middle scene where calm enables or costs him a choice (missing gate, cap at 4.6 applies). Payoff: mentioned in closure ("content," "at peace") but not causally active there +0.3. One beat (label in reflection) +0.4. Causal pressure absent (calm is state, not tactic) 0. Closure linkage weak (peace is declared, not dramatized via calm under pressure) +0.2. Label-only trait −0.3. Total ~4.2 before cap; with missing-middle cap at 4.6, score 4.2. Rounding: 4.2.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Perceptively calm" is stated in paragraph two as demeanor that "let him slip through crowds unnoticed, his mind always a step ahead." It is a label for Elias's method but does not constrain or enable a specific on-page action with cost. Setup: present early +0.5. Development: no middle beat where being perceptive costs him or alters a choice (missing gate, cap 4.6 applies). Payoff: the trait is implied in his watching of the startup founders, but this happens off-page in summary, not dramatized. One beat (initial description) +0.4. Causal pressure minimal (the trait is background, not tested) +0.1. Closure absent (not present in final image). Label-only −0.3. Swappable (any observant protagonist could serve) −0.5. Total ~4.2; capped at 4.6 for missing development gate. Rounding: 4.6.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Dissuade" is Elias's stated goal (paragraph five: "dissuade the founders from ever returning to their old ways"). However, the action unfolds off-page—we are told Marcus grows restless and founders argue, but no scene dramatizes Elias's attempt or the founders' reactions. Setup: goal declared by mid-story +0.4. Development: the placing of bills (Cuba, Zimbabwe) happens in summary ("He began by leaving...") rather than as a dramatized beat with resistance or cost −0.5. Payoff: closure reflects on success ("He'd dissuaded the founders... through subtlety") but the moment is told, not shown. One weak beat (summary of bill-placing) +0.3. Causal pressure low (the dissuasion is claimed, not proven on the page) +0.2. Closure linkage moderate (success is asserted in reflection) +0.4. Summary-only execution −0.6. Swappable (any indirect influence could replace it) −0.6. Total ~5.3. Rounding: 5.3.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Through territorial markers" is the method Elias chooses (paragraph five: "territorial markers, small signs that would speak louder than words"). The bills function as these markers. Setup: method signaled by paragraph five +0.4. Development: the mechanics are stated (leave bills as reminders) but not dramatized—we do not see Marcus discover a bill, react in real time, or Elias adjust tactics based on the markers' effect. Payoff: the final paragraph reflects that markers "were doing the work," but this is assertion, not on-page proof. One beat (method described and executed in summary) +0.4. Causal pressure weak (we are told the markers work, not shown) +0.2. Closure linkage weak (markers are not present in the final image or action) +0.2. Mechanics not demonstrated on the page −0.5. Swappable (any symbolic objects could serve as markers) −0.6. Summary-only −0.5. Total ~4.9. Rounding: 4.9.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The abandoned circus train appears in setup (title location, opening paragraph's vivid description), middle (Elias moves through carriages, pauses by trapeze poster), and closure (returns, sits by window, listens to sounds). Three mentions across the piece. Early signal +0.6. Three descriptive beats +1.0. However, the train is backdrop, not constraint—it does not shape Elias's choices, supply resources, or create obstacles. Causal pressure absent (he could reflect anywhere) 0. Closure linkage moderate (final image is in the train, but the train itself is not causally active) +0.5. Specificity present (ivy, rusting, trapeze poster) +0.4. Swappable (any abandoned structure could serve the same function with minor edits) −0.7. Ornamental use (postcard description without action pressure) −0.8. Total ~3.8. Rounding: 3.8.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Across a startup's rise and fall" is stated as the timeframe Elias observed (paragraph two: "tracked the rise and fall of a local startup"). However, this happens entirely off-page—no scenes show the startup's operations, peak, or collapse. The time span is background context, not a live clock or constraint. Setup: mentioned early +0.4. Development: the startup's ruin is a past event by the time the story opens; "days passed" (paragraph seven) is vague. Payoff: closure reflects on the lesson learned from the collapse, but time does not tighten decisions. One mention (background summary) +0.3. Causal pressure absent (time does not force choices) 0. Closure absent (timeframe not present in final image). Summary-only −0.6. Swappable (any observed failure could replace the startup) −0.7. Total ~3.6. Rounding: 3.6.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"To discover why some paths circle back" is Elias's stated motivation (paragraph one, end). It frames his return to the circus train and his reflection on cycles. Setup: present in opening +0.7. Development: the question drives his observation of the startup and placement of bills, though these beats are summarized rather than dramatized. Payoff: closure delivers the answer ("not because of fate, but because of the choices we make"), reweighting the opening question. Two beats (opening question, closure answer) +0.9. Causal pressure moderate (the desire to understand shapes his tactics, though loosely) +0.6. Closure linkage strong (final realization directly answers the motivation) +1.0. Friction between wants and costs weak (no on-page struggle to reach the insight) +0.1. Summary-driven (discovery happens via reflection, not dramatized conflict) −0.6. Total ~5.7. Rounding: 5.7.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Dusky harmony" appears in the opening line ("last light of day painting everything in dusky harmony") and recurs in the closure paragraph ("the dusky harmony deepening into night"). It signals a reflective, twilight mood. Setup: early signal +0.6. Payoff: tone returns in final paragraph, reweighted as the world "grew darker" alongside Elias's peace +0.8. However, the tone is static—no modulation with pressure or emotional turns. The mood remains contemplative and elegiac throughout, without tension or contrast. One reprise (opening → ending) +0.4. Closure linkage moderate (tone present in final image) +0.6. Coherence high (no tonal breaks) +0.4. Static mood (no escalation or shift under pressure) −0.6. Single-note application −0.4. Total ~5.4. Rounding: 5.4.</comment>
