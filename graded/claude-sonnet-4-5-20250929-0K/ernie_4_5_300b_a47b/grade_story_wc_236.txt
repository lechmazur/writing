<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lira's interiority is detailed but floats at one diagnostic remove—"fractured perception," "emotional terrain"—without embodied contradiction acting in scene. The climactic recognition (Eleanor as miracle) is told through clever deduction rather than earned through conflicted choice with visible cost. Mrs. Voss remains off-page, reducing relationship pressure to inference. Minor: "humanize the inanimate" and "occluded views" read as thematic labels rather than character-specific cognition under stress.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors arrive cleanly (shop, fog, protagonist role). The closure unit—Lira writes the note connecting screw to Eleanor—lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), reweighting the screw's meaning. Cost is conceptual (unveiling another's redemption) but felt faintly rather than unmistakably on the page. The final paragraph's summary ("unveiled an ordinary miracle") tells the reconfiguration instead of letting the image hold it, blunting closure charge. One meaningful deepening occurs (engraving discovery → photo match), meeting length requirements, but the resolution hinges on off-page material (Mrs. Voss's reaction is deferred).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The water-clock shop is vivid and specific (glass vats, algae-clogged gears, fog seeping through cracked windows). Fog and dripping water recur to frame the atmosphere. The screw and mainspring comparison constrains Lira's interpretive method, charging the final image with physical metaphor. Occupation detail (aromatherapist who repairs clocks) is present but the repair mechanics remain ornamental; the algae cleaning and gear assembly do not alter tactics or choices. Sensory hierarchy reflects Lira's lost smell, tilting toward touch and sight.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake: decode Mrs. Voss's unresolved guilt and return the screw with meaning. Pressure accumulates through clues (engraving, photo, trembling hands) but remains investigative rather than agonistic—Lira faces no friction, constraint, or trade-off. The tightening (engraving → Eleanor connection) deepens knowledge but does not narrow Lira's options or force a sacrifice. No visible loss or renunciation alters tactics. The resolution is a gift (polished screw, note) without cost to Lira, trending toward wish-fulfillment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme (ordinary miracles, resilience through objects) emerges from the screw's history and Lira's interpretive lens. The final image (water clock chimes, river reflection, tapestry of resilience) reaches for resonance but the last paragraph's thesis statement ("unveiled an ordinary miracle… quiet art of reading between lines") names the theme overtly, undercutting earned emergence. The screw as talisman and the fog as metaphor for fractured perception work well. Lira's loss of smell anchors the thematic question in lived particulars, though her arc skips internal conflict.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization is stable; perceptual signature emphasizes tactile and visual detail (screw threads, engraving, fog) filtered through Lira's interpretive practice. Diction occasionally drifts into essay register ("humanize the inanimate," "labyrinth," "occluded views") but remains mostly voice-consistent. No dialogue on the page. Psychic distance is controlled. The final paragraph's summative tone ("She'd unveiled… learning to weave") shifts into retrospective certainty that flattens present-tense immediacy, creating mild narratorial drift at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Prose is clean and rhythmically varied with strong sensory anchors (algae, brass glow, fog diffusing light). Paraphrase loop: "The shop's trembling calm—a hush punctuated…" echoes "gentle tick… muted by fog" without added pressure. Stock metaphor: "tapestry of resilience" in the final beat. Register drift: "humanize the inanimate," "occluded views," "emotional terrain" elevate diction beyond grounded shop-work idiom. The final paragraph stacks summary telling ("She'd unveiled… quiet art… threads in a tapestry") where a single image would carry more weight. Information density is moderate; some sentences paraphrase prior content.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The aromatherapist-who-lost-smell premise offers a fresh disability angle, and the water-clock repair shop is具体 and unusual. The midwife's screw as emotional talisman transforms a mundane object. However, the detective-solve structure (clues → engraving → photo → revelation) follows a familiar template, and Lira's arc is frictionless—no competing need or renunciation complicates the gift. The fog-as-metaphor and screw-as-tension devices are competent but not surprising. Emotional honesty is present but the ending's tidy satisfaction (polished screw, light chest, learning to weave) leans toward safe resolution.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Present throughout; Lira's lost smell motivates her tactile, interpretive method and frames the thematic question. Setup clear. Development: the trait enables her reading of the screw but does not constrain a choice or create friction—she never struggles or sacrifices due to the loss. Payoff: mentioned in the penultimate paragraph ("navigating loss… through scent") but does not shape the closure image. Swappable with another interpretive disability without structural change. Functional but mid-replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Setup: introduced early (paragraph 2). Development: handled in multiple beats (tracing threads, cleaning, engraving discovery, polishing, return). The engraving discovery is the investigative pivot. Payoff: the polished screw anchors the note and final gift, directly shaping closure. Causal pressure: narrows Lira's interpretive task and enables the Eleanor connection. Cost link: faint—Lira's effort is care, not sacrifice. The screw is irreplaceable (engraving specificity) and charges the ending, meeting two gates strongly and touching the third.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Setup: named in paragraph 2 ("reading between lines"). Development: Lira interprets Mrs. Voss's unspoken emotions through the screw, trembling hands, avoidance—method shapes middle investigation. Payoff: the concept is named again in the final paragraph ("quiet art of reading between lines"), telling rather than showing. The concept enables tactics but does not create friction or cost; it is more interpretive lens than stake. Swappable with similar hermeneutic methods. Present across beats but remains thematic claim rather than causal engine.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Setup: "mapping emotional terrain" appears paragraph 2 as descriptive label. Development: Lira uses this method to interpret clues but the trait itself (mapping) is synonym for "reading between lines"—no distinct constraint or enabling cost. Payoff: invoked in paragraph 4 ("emotional terrain was a labyrinth") but ornamental. The attribute is label-only; removing it would not alter any on-page action. Functional overlap with 9C dilutes necessity. Cap at setup-only range.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Setup: paragraph 2 mentions "humanize the inanimate." Development: Lira humanizes the screw by reading its history and connecting it to Eleanor. Payoff: the final paragraph names "humanizing the past" as her method. The action is present but abstract—could be replaced with "interpret," "honor," "restore" without structural loss. The screw's return is the concrete act; "humanize" is the thematic label draped over it. One strong beat (polishing and note-writing) but the verb itself is swappable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Setup: "occluded views" introduced paragraph 2, repeated paragraph 4 ("navigated through occluded views"). Development: Lira infers from partial cues (lingering, avoidance, tight grip) but the method is indistinguishable from ordinary inference. Payoff: echoed in the final paragraph ("seeing through occluded views"). The phrase is a thematic label; the mechanics (reading body language, connecting engraving to photo) do not require or demonstrate unique "occluded" optics. Swappable with "indirect," "subtle," "hidden." Present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Setup: paragraph 1 establishes the shop vividly (glass vats, gears, fog, workbench). Development: Lira disassembles the water clock and uses the space for reflection; the lantern and fog frame the interpretive work. Payoff: the shop's windows reflect the river in the penultimate paragraph; the water clock chimes at closure. The setting supplies atmosphere and a workplace but does not constrain choice or alter tactics—Lira could perform the same deduction elsewhere. The water-clock metaphor (ebb and flow, tension/release) enriches theme. Two gates met; causal pressure mild.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Setup: "morning fog" paragraph 1, "dawn's pale light" paragraph 3. Development: fog thickens (paragraph 6), Lira lights a lantern; "by noon, the fog began to lift" (paragraph 8). Payoff: the lifting fog at closure mirrors resolution and is woven into the final image. The timeframe creates a natural arc (dawn → noon) but does not tighten tactics or decisions—Lira works at her own pace with no urgency. The hush and fog charge atmosphere but remain ambient. Lyric reprise with mild reweighting; one gate strong (payoff), setup/development functional.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Setup: paragraph 5 introduces "ordinary miracle Mrs. Voss sought to unveil." Development: Lira seeks to decode the screw's significance and connect it to Mrs. Voss's redemption. Payoff: the final paragraph declares "She'd unveiled an ordinary miracle." The desire is consistent but frictionless—Lira faces no competing want or cost in pursuing it. The motivation is told more than dramatized; no moment where unveiling requires sacrifice or difficult choice. Present across beats but lacks on-page friction. Two gates (setup, payoff) met; development is claim-level.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Setup: paragraph 3 names "trembling calm—a hush punctuated by dripping water and creak of old wood." Development: tone holds through investigative beats (cleaning, reading, lighting lantern) with restrained lyricism. Payoff: "her chest light" and the water clock's chimes extend the calm-but-charged register into the ending. The tone is coherent and modulates gently (fog thickens → lifts) without rupture. It does not sharpen under pressure—Lira's mood remains steady—but it charges the final image with muted resonance. Two gates met; causal pressure mild but tonal integrity strong.</comment>
