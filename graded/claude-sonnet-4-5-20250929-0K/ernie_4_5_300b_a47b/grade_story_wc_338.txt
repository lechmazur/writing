<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's methodical curiosity drives reconnaissance moves (collecting film, comparing frames), but his interior life remains abstract—"chest tightened," "breath fogged"—without embodied contradiction or visible trade-offs. The grandfather's journal and years of archive work are told, not dramatized, so the urgency feels inherited rather than earned. The final "smile" and reframed understanding land as epiphany-by-arrival, lacking the on-page struggle or foreclosed path that would constitute felt cost. Competence is high, but genuine flaw or ambiguity that complicates the closure choice is absent.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—details layer (map tear, film comparison, henge carvings shifting, hum resolving into chant) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where silence becomes language. Orientation is clear by the vault opening. The closure unit is Conceptual Repricing: the tear shifts from barrier to bridge, and the henge from ruin to puzzle. Cost is oblique—Elias "understood now" and will "frame this map differently"—felt conceptually but not viscerally paid on the page. One meaningful deepening (silence reinterpreted as hymn) satisfies the length, though the final image ("other silences waited") gestures forward rather than anchoring present consequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Vault, henge, rain, and frescoes are vivid and purposeful; the sextant alignment with the vault window and the holy water on stone both constrain tactics and charge the middle beat. Spatial choreography is clean (mile east, staircase descent, altar center). The rain-scoured frescoes recur intact below, a strong callback that reweights the opening image. Sensory hierarchy reflects Elias's perceptive bias (parchment creak, moss, stone hum). The micro-setting (stone as interface, crack as threshold) qualifies and reaches the 9-band gate; no occupation-level depth is required here.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: unlock the henge's silence. One meaningful tightening occurs when the film comparison reveals shifted carvings, narrowing Elias's hypothesis. The stone-ear-hum-water sequence is a single escalation beat with visible agency (he acts on the sextant alignment and holy water). Closure reconfigures the chapel from barrier to bridge, but the move feels more conceptual discovery than forced trade-off—no live option is foreclosed, no visible price paid (he simply "understood"). Situational pressure is coherent but does not compel a high-cost choice on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—silence as language, empathy in the unsaid—emerges through particulars: the vowel-less hymn, carvings that shift, hum resolving to chant, frescoes waiting. The altar's etched tear and the map's tear form a tight reprise. The final image ("frame this map differently—not with borders, but with questions") reweights the opening without stating a moral. No thematic echo or diagnostic label intrudes. The chapel-as-bridge lands as a resonant answer to the central question. Slight dock: "find empathy in the unsaid" in the penultimate paragraph edges toward statement, though embedded in scene pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited with stable distance and a perceptive, scholarly filter (parchment "creaking," "methodically curious," sextant alignment). Diction is controlled and purposeful throughout. No dialogue to judge. Perceptual signature is consistent—Elias notices angles, carvings, frequencies—but peaks under stress default to generic interiority ("chest tightened," "breath visible"). The narrative certainty for ancient carvings and hymn origins ("millennia," "vowel-less") exceeds what Elias can plausibly infer on first encounter, a modest inference leap that does not break coherence but nudges distance. Free indirect thought is clean; no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies; sentence openings are mostly distinct. Information density is high in the film-comparison and henge-approach beats. Line-level clarity is strong. Minor artifacts: "as if" recurs six times across the story (stones "as if begging," henge "as if absorbing," chapel "as if waiting"), a stock connective that trends into template cadence under high-pressure moments. "The silence enveloped him—not cold, but warm" is a tidy emotional toggle. No paraphrase loops; no major scaffold. Figurative density is high but coherent (tear as threshold, serpents' eyes guarding, suns' fractures as broken halos). Proofreading is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The archaeologist-henge-ancient-puzzle frame is familiar, and the silent-film-comparison method offers a fresh mechanical angle. The shift from barrier to bridge and silence-as-language are non-obvious thematic moves. Emotional specificity (perceptive map framer, "reopen the silence") grounds the premise. The vowel-less hymn and carvings that shift between eras are imaginative particulars. Transformation test: swapping names and updating props would not gut the arc, suggesting mid-range freshness. The final image ("frame this map differently—not with borders, but with questions") feels earned in hindsight. No proximity echoes or template plots detected.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias as perceptive map framer signals early (opening paragraph, "trained to see borders where others saw blankness") and drives two key beats: comparing film frames (middle) and aligning the sextant (ending). His perception enables the closure realization (tear as threshold, henge as puzzle). The trait is causally active but the final choice—pressing ear to stone, dabbing holy water—does not foreclose a live option with visible cost; it unlocks rather than trades off. Two gates met (setup, middle development, payoff present in sextant alignment), causal pressure moderate, closure linkage strong, irreplaceability moderate.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Ancient henge appears early (second paragraph, "Whispered Chapel"), anchors the middle reconnaissance (film comparison, carvings shift), and the climax descent (stones grind apart, staircase revealed). Used in three distinct beats. Causal: its shifted carvings narrow Elias's hypothesis; its hum becomes the hymn; its opening grants access to the chapel. Closure: the henge's function as bridge (not barrier) is the conceptual repricing. Irreplaceability high; swapping for "temple" or "altar" would require structural edits. Cost connection moderate (conceptual rather than visceral).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Whispered chapel named early (second paragraph) as local lore, returns as the discovered underground chapel at closure. The concept shapes stakes (reopen the silence) but is more atmospheric anchor than tactical constraint—Elias's moves are driven by the henge and film, not the chapel itself until the reveal. Two gates (setup, payoff); middle development weak (chapel mentioned but not engaged). The final chapel scene reweights the opening lore (intact frescoes, warm silence) with moderate resonance. Swappable with "hidden sanctuary" or similar without major rework.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Methodically curious appears explicitly ("methodically curious, scouring archives") and implicitly (years of research, frame-by-frame comparison, sextant alignment). The trait enables reconnaissance but does not constrain with visible cost—Elias never faces a trade-off between patience and urgency, method and intuition. Two gates (setup, middle comparison beat); closure participation indirect (curiosity leads him there, but the final act is more perceptive leap than methodical process). Functional but mid-replaceable with "diligent scholar" or "persistent researcher."</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Reopen signals early (grandfather's note "Reopen the silence") and defines the dominant stake. The action structures the arc: Elias interprets what "reopen" means (not moving stones but confronting silence), then enacts it (sextant alignment, holy water, stones grind apart). Payoff clear (chapel reopened, silence interpreted). Two beats (hypothesis refinement, climax execution). Causal pressure moderate; the action is dramatized but the cost is conceptual rather than visceral. Swapping "unlock" or "awaken" would require only minor edits to dialogue framing.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Comparing silent footage signals early (Elias carries "two reels," one 1923, one modern) and drives the key middle beat: frame-by-frame comparison reveals shifted carvings, the crack widened, serpents' eyes reoriented. This discovery narrows the hypothesis and enables the sextant alignment. Three gates (setup, middle development, payoff implied in the understanding that the henge is a puzzle). Causal pressure strong in the middle; mechanics matter (threading film, rewinding, comparing). Irreplaceability moderate (could substitute "overlaying maps" or "photo comparison" with moderate rework). Closure linkage indirect (method leads to insight but does not appear in final image).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Rain-scoured fresco vault opens the story, anchors orientation (who, where), and supplies a tactical resource (projector light, highest window for sextant alignment). The frescoes recur intact below, a charged callback that reweights the opening. Two beats (opening reconnaissance, final chapel discovery). Causal: the vault's window angle matches the crack, enabling the sextant move. Closure: intact frescoes "now smiling" reprice the eroded opening image. Irreplaceability moderate (vault function could shift to another ruin). Cost connection weak (setting pressures but does not constrain with visible trade-off).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Map tear as threshold signals early (opening paragraph) and defines the conceptual frame (known/unknown divide). Returns at closure (altar etched with the same tear, final image "beyond the tear, other silences"). Two gates (setup, payoff); middle development absent (tear mentioned but does not constrain a middle choice). Timeframe element is weak—no live clock or deadline tightens decisions; the journey is untimed. Lyric resonance moderate (early seed → final reprise reweights premise from barrier to invitation). Swappable with "border," "edge," or "rift" with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Interpret silence with empathy surfaces explicitly late ("to find empathy in the unsaid," penultimate paragraph) but is implicit in Elias's patient archive work, film comparison, and ear-to-stone listening. The motivation structures the arc but is more told than dramatized—no on-page conflict between empathy and another want (speed, recognition, fear). Two gates (implicit setup, explicit payoff statement); middle development weak (motivation assumed, not tested). Closure: the chapel's warm silence and reframed map are consistent with the motive. Friction absent (no competing desire creates cost).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Shielded openness: the tone balances mystery (chill vault, eroded saints, threshold ambiguity) with scholarly calm (methodical comparison, sextant precision, "perceptive map framer"). Modulates under pressure: rain intensifies as Elias departs, hum grows louder, silence becomes warm rather than cold. The final image ("other silences waited to be heard") extends the tone's blend of closure and invitation. Coherent through turns; no tonal breaks. Charges the ending by sustaining both wonder and rigor. The phrasing "shielded openness" itself is abstract; the story enacts guarded curiosity meeting revelation without stating the label.</comment>
