<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and her role functional, but interiority relies heavily on therapy-speak ("the scent of hope," "raw, sacred chaos") and stock phrasing ("her throat tightened," "her chest ached") that flatten embodied emotion. Internal conflict is minimal—she executes her method without meaningful obstacles or contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The parallel to her mother provides backstory weight but doesn't create on-page friction that alters Mira's tactics or forces a visible cost at closure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the hymn's repetition and vinyl motif aim to deepen meaning through recurrence. Orientation anchors adequately (Mira, hospice, sunrise, Elias's impending death by ~150 words). Closure is a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant)—Mira witnesses Elias's peaceful passage and passes the vinyl shard to Clara, reweighting the legacy motif—but the cost is implied rather than viscerally legible on the page; we infer continuation of her work rather than see a path foreclosed. The final paragraph's "pulsing stillness" and humming gesture gesture toward reconfiguration but lack a sharp before/after that makes cost undeniable.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The "radiant haven above the clouds" and floor-to-ceiling windows establish a distinct hospice setting with sensory anchors (lavender scent, sunrise gold, clouds drifting). Spatial choreography is clear. However, the environment functions primarily as backdrop; it does not constrain Mira's choices or supply resources that alter tactics. The vinyl turntable is the closest the setting comes to enabling action, but its mechanics are glossed ("placed the vinyl shard on the turntable")—no consideration of how a fragment plays or what technology allows it—so the object rather than the room does the work.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—Elias achieving a peaceful, articulated goodbye—is signaled early and pursued consistently. One meaningful tightening occurs when Elias's voice joins the hymn, a micro-turn that shifts Clara from despair to connection. However, Mira faces no obstacles, adapts no tactics, and pays no visible price; the hymn works as intended without friction. Escalation under the Accumulative lens requires a deepening or cadence shift that reweights cost; here the intensification is emotional (Clara's sobs, Elias's final "Rest") but the cost to Mira or the method remains abstract, not dramatized on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Theme of music as bridge to acceptance emerges through concrete particulars (vinyl shard, hymn lyrics, shared breath). The vinyl's transfer to Clara and the "pulsing stillness" motif attempt resonance, but the final paragraph over-articulates the thematic question ("the joy of witnessing reunification") rather than letting the image speak. The phrase "hymning the mundane" and "scent of hope" are prompt-label echoes that assert theme rather than earn it through action. The ending gestures toward a non-literal answer (continuation of work, humming under breath) but lacks the charge needed to reweight prior material without a stated moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV remains stable, no head-hopping. Diction is generally consistent but lapses into elevated, sometimes clinical register ("alchemy of melody," "raw, sacred chaos," "pulsing stillness") that reads more authorial than character-filtered. Dialogue is sparse but functional; Mira's "He's exactly where he needs to be" and Clara's raw responses feel natural. Free indirect style is clean, though filter verbs ("seemed," "felt like") cluster in reflective passages. Perceptual signature is present but not sharp—Mira's professional lens does not distinctly color syntax or rhythm under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear and moves forward, but suffers from paraphrase loops ("Her motivation burned fierce: to execute a flawless goodbye, to bridge the chasm" restates the stake unnecessarily) and stock metaphor strings ("the scent of hope," "alchemy of melody," "vessels of meaning"). Template cadence appears in reflective beats: "She'd seen this dance...," "She thought of her mother...," "She touched her own pocket..." forming repetitive stems. Mixed metaphors and register drift touch peak beats ("pulsing stillness that made time seem to both quicken and slow"). Figurative density in high-pressure moments ("bleeding orange into the clouds," "thread that stitched their fractured goodbyes") occasionally obscures rather than clarifies. Apply −0.8 for paraphrase/template patterns and stock metaphor strings; artifacts touch the closure paragraph ("the pulsing stillness of it all"), disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Premise—hospice music therapist using a hymn to guide a patient's final moments—follows a familiar template (caregiver witness to peaceful death). The vinyl-shard motif and "haven above the clouds" setting offer specificity, but the emotional arc and thematic beats (music heals, legacy continues, caregiver finds meaning) are well-trodden without transformation. No fresh inflection or non-obvious synthesis; the story executes its template competently but predictably. The "scent of hope" and "pulsing stillness" phrases feel ornamental rather than organically character-driven. Risk-averse choices throughout; no bold structural or perspectival moves.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Mira (serene hospice music therapist) is present throughout and drives the action (selects the hymn, hums along, reassures Clara, transfers the vinyl shard). Setup is immediate (paragraph 1). Development: she executes her method in the middle beats. Payoff: she comforts Clara post-death and accepts the next patient. However, her choices do not create key turns—the hymn works as intended without adaptation or obstacle—so her role is observational facilitation rather than decision that alters tactics. Causal pressure is low; her professional competence prevents friction. Apply −0.5 for limited causal involvement and observation-dominant stance.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The broken vinyl record shard appears in three beats: pocket mention (paragraph 1), placed on turntable to play hymn (paragraph 3), and transferred to Clara (final third). Setup, development (enables the hymn), and payoff (symbolic transfer) are present. The object enables the central action and is reweighted at closure as a legacy token. However, its mechanics are vague (how does a shard play?), and the transfer feels more thematic gesture than causal necessity—the story could substitute a full record or digital file with minor edits. Specificity is moderate; the "frayed edge" and "crackle" add texture but the fragment's brokenness does not constrain tactics. Score 6.2 for three-beat presence and closure participation with moderate swappability friction.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>The "scent of hope" (lavender and impending peace) is mentioned twice: paragraph 2 setup and paragraph 8 ("scent of hope intensified"). It functions as atmospheric description and thematic label rather than a stake-shaping element. It does not change Mira's options, alter Clara's or Elias's tactics, or constrain the method. The concept is told, not dramatized as a decision pressure. Apply ornamental-use and label-only deductions; late thematic echo in paragraph 8 does not rescue it. Score 3.1 for functional presence without causal work.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Decisively kind" is labeled once ("her voice decisively kind," paragraph 3) but never demonstrated through a choice with visible cost or tradeoff. Mira's actions are uniformly gentle and reassuring; no moment where decisiveness conflicts with kindness or where the trait enables an action another disposition could not. The attribute is ornamental. Apply label-only and swappability deductions. Score 4.2 for single mention and no causal constraint.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Reunify" appears as Mira's framing goal (paragraph 5: "the reunification she'd hoped for") and is echoed in the final paragraph ("witnessing reunification"). Setup and thematic payoff are present. The action itself—Elias joining the hymn and Clara connecting—occurs on the page and constitutes the story's emotional peak. However, the term is more thematic label than distinct action; the story could frame the goal as "facilitate peace" or "guide goodbye" with minimal edits. Development beat is solid (Elias sings, Clara gasps), but the verb "reunify" does not uniquely define the mechanics or stakes. Score 5.9 for shaping one key turn with moderate swappability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Hymning the mundane" is explained in paragraph 6 ("Turning ordinary moments—a shared breath, a familiar melody—into vessels of meaning") and demonstrated via the hymn's use in paragraphs 3–8. Setup (paragraph 1, headphones and vinyl), development (hymn plays, Elias sings), payoff (Mira hums at the end). The method is signaled and its mechanics—music to bridge fear and acceptance—shape the central action. However, the phrasing "hymning the mundane" is prompt-label language; the method itself (playing a familiar hymn) is not distinctive or irreplaceable. Score 5.3 for three-beat involvement and causal work with moderate swappability and ornamental phrasing.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Radiant haven above the clouds" is established in paragraph 1 (floor-to-ceiling windows, sunrise, clouds). The setting is visually vivid and atmospherically consistent (paragraph 10: "sun now hung low, bleeding orange into the clouds"; paragraph 12: "haven's radiance seemed to hum"). However, it functions as postcard backdrop—it does not pressure Mira's choices, supply resources, or alter tactics. The windows allow symbolic cloud imagery at closure but do not constrain action. Apply ornamental-use deduction and micro-setting absence (body/tool/object could substitute). Score 4.6 for setup, closure cameo, and decorative function.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"After the blood work came back" frames the time anchor (paragraph 2: "Today...she knew her patient, Elias, had only hours"). The clock is live and tightens Mira's urgency ("hours," "breathing grew shallow"). Setup, development (real-time scene), and payoff (monitors flatline, "hours later") are present. The timeframe shapes the dominant stake (final goodbye before death) and is tracked on the page. However, the ticking clock does not force tactical adaptation—Mira executes her plan without time-driven complications. Score 5.7 for clear setup, one-beat causal pressure, and closure participation with moderate friction (passive time pressure rather than active constraint).</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"To execute a flawless goodbye" is stated explicitly (paragraph 2) and pursued throughout. Setup, development (hymn attempt), and payoff (Elias's peaceful death) are present. The motivation drives Mira's method choice and frames the stakes. However, it is told rather than dramatized through conflicted micro-choices—Mira wants perfection and achieves it without friction between desire and cost. The word "flawless" implies high standards but no on-page moment where imperfection threatens or where Mira sacrifices another value to maintain the goal. Score 6.4 for clear setup, beat involvement, and closure shaping with limited friction dramatization.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Pulsing stillness" is labeled three times: paragraph 3 ("pulsing stillness that made time seem to both quicken and slow"), paragraph 8 (hymn's crescendo and muffled sobs), and final line ("The pulsing stillness of it all"). The tone is consistent—reverent, suspended, contradictory—and modulates subtly with Elias's breathing and the hymn's dynamics. However, the phrase is ornamental and over-explained rather than embodied through rhythm or image. The tone does not constrain Mira's choices or charge the final image with undeniable pressure; it asserts atmosphere. Apply label-only and static-mood deductions. Score 4.9 for coherence and thematic presence without causal work or closure charge.</comment>
