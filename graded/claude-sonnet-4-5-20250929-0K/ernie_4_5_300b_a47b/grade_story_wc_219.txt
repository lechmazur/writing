<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lirael's skepticism and obsession are clearly established, and her interiority moves from intellectual resistance to embodied longing at the end. The final beat—"her skepticism unravel like a frayed rope"—shows internal shift, but the change feels asserted by spectacle rather than earned through prior contradictory impulses acting in scene. Kael functions primarily as exposition vehicle; her copper skin and mercury eyes are ornamental labels rather than pressure points.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story anchors who/where/when adequately and attempts Accumulative/Textural mode via sculptures and amber catalyst. However, the closure—Lirael's ache of longing and Kael's mirror metaphor—remains abstract; the visible cost is not legible on the page in concrete terms. The amber dissolves, the world inverts, then nothing changes except Lirael's internal state, which is told rather than shown through a choice or forfeiture that narrows options.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The rainwashed tower, spring drizzle, sculptures, and bronze quiet establish strong atmosphere. The amber in the sculpture's hands triggers the resonance field, a micro-setting interaction that constrains the climactic beat. Spatial choreography is mostly clear, though the footprints vanishing into amber dust and Kael's sudden appearance lack tight positional logic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—exposing or uncovering the Enclave's truth—is signaled early. The amber placement tightens pressure in one beat, but the dissolution and inversion produce spectacle without a visible tradeoff or tactic shift. Lirael's final longing is asserted by the event rather than forced by her choice; coincidence (the amber's effect) resolves rather than complicates.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The theme of artificial versus authentic homecoming emerges through the Enclave's chemistry claim and Kael's insistence on collision. The final image—mirrors, convergence, seeing oneself—gestures at insight but remains abstract; "you finally saw yourself" is a stated moral rather than a resonant image that reweights prior particulars. The bronze quiet recurs but does not shift meaning at closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, and Lirael's perceptual signature—"luminous skeptic," "mind sharper than the storm's edge"—is distinct. Dialogue feels natural and advances plot; Kael's lines carry subtext about belief. However, elevated diction ("unyielding present," "collision—of memory, desire") intrudes in peak beats, and "a sound like breaking glass" is a stock metaphor that dulls specificity under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear and rhythmic, with vivid images: "wolf with moth wings," "oxidized copper skin." Figurative density is high but mostly coherent. Minor loop: "artificial pilgrimages" and "chemistry of homecoming" are paraphrased without added pressure. Template cadence in the sculpture list ("a figure...a child...a wolf") spans three items without taught pattern. The final line—"a door creaked open"—attempts resonance but lands as generic stock.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The premise—Enclave manufacturing spiritual journeys via chemistry—offers a fresh angle on homecoming themes. The sculptures and amber catalyst are specific rather than generic. However, the emotional arc (skeptic confronts longing) follows a familiar template, and the resolution (mirrors reveal self) echoes well-worn epiphany tropes without a non-obvious inflection that reweights prior particulars.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Lirael (luminous skeptic) is present throughout and her choice to place the amber in the sculpture's hands drives the climactic beat. However, skepticism is a label more than a trait that constrains choices; her rebellion against professors is backstory told rather than dramatized. The decision to trust Kael and use the amber feels prompted by the moment rather than by a sustained pattern of academic defiance shaping tactics. Two gates (setup, payoff) are met; middle development is thin. Swappable: a curious or earnest seeker could make the same move with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The fly amber appears early (setup), is handled in two beats (clutched, placed), and dissolves at closure to trigger the resonance field. It enables the climactic event and is tied to the Enclave's concept. However, its unique properties—preserved insect, iridescent wings—do not matter; any "catalyst" resin could serve. The amber does not return with reweighted meaning; it simply vanishes. Three gates met, but specificity and irreplaceability are low.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Artificial pilgrimage is named early, frames the Enclave's claim, and Kael's dialogue develops the idea (chemistry versus collision). The amber ritual enacts the concept at closure. However, the concept shapes theme more than tactics; Lirael's choices are not constrained by pilgrimage mechanics on the page. The distinction between artificial and authentic is told rather than dramatized through a choice where the two paths diverge with cost. Three gates met but causal pressure is thin.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Academically rebellious is told in backstory ("academically rebellious to her core") but never shown in scene through a choice where rebellion constrains or enables an action. Lirael's vow to expose fraud could belong to any investigator; the trait is a label without visible tradeoff. Setup only; no middle or closure participation. Late penalty does not apply (introduced early), but swappability and label-only use cap the score.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Converge: footprints leading to the tower signal someone else's arrival; Lirael and Kael meet. The convergence is spatial, not a collision of goals or paths that forces a turn. The footprints vanish into amber dust, a detail that hints at prior ritual but does not shape Lirael's tactics. Kael's arrival enables exposition but could be replaced by a note or recording. Two gates (setup, middle guide); closure participation is indirect. Swappable with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Dusty footprints are signaled early and lead Lirael to the seventh sculpture where they vanish into amber dust. The method (following footprints on the path) enables spatial progression but does not constrain a choice under pressure. The footprints are replaced by Kael, whose guidance supplants the method; mechanics do not shape attempts. Two gates (setup, middle); closure does not turn on this element. Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The rainwashed tower is anchored early, its resonance field is named by Kael, and the amber's placement at the tower's base triggers the climactic inversion. The tower pressures the ending beat; its "bronze quiet" recurs. However, the tower itself is a backdrop; the sculpture path does more causal work. Three gates met, and the tower enables the ritual, but its specific properties (stone, moss, spring setting) are ornamental. Mid-band for setting that participates but could be swapped for another ritual site.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>After making first contact is told in exposition and sets the frame (Lirael has met the Enclave once). The timeframe does not tighten decisions or tactics on the page; no clock or urgency tied to "after" is dramatized. The Enclave's gift (amber) is a result of first contact but the temporal constraint does not shape the present scene. Setup only; no middle pressure or closure participation. Functional frame but replaceable with "recently met" or similar.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>To understand the chemistry of homecoming is stated early and Lirael's obsession ("vowed to expose their fraud… or uncover their truth") frames her goal. The desire drives her to place the amber and confront the ritual. However, the motivation is abstract; Lirael's longing at the end ("familiar longing, the kind she'd buried beneath equations") is asserted rather than earned through prior beats where understanding and personal need visibly conflict. Three gates met but friction (want versus cost) is thin. The final ache is felt but not chosen.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Bronze quiet is introduced early ("The air hummed with a bronze quiet") and recurs at closure ("The bronze quiet lingered"). The tone—contemplative, eerie, restrained—is coherent through the sculpture path and inversion beats. However, the tone remains static; it does not modulate with pressure or charge the final image with a shift. The final sentence ("a door creaked open") gestures at suspense but does not deepen the bronze quality. Two-beat reprise reweights slightly but does not transform prior material.</comment>
