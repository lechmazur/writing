<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Alaric's motivation to forgive himself is established early and his internal conflict—guilt versus redemption—drives key choices. However, the resolution feels unearned: the epiphany "some threads couldn't be untangled—only woven into something new" arrives through passive reflection rather than a difficult on-page choice that tests competing impulses. The prince memory is vivid but the pivot from self-blame to acceptance lacks dramatized cost or friction. Interiority leans toward therapy-speak ("mistakes were moves, not endings") without embodied contradiction acting simultaneously in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph. The piece follows a causal lens: Alaric decodes threads → memory surfaces → hidden path revealed → pedestal glows → village unfreezes. However, the closure's cost is abstract—"weight on his chest lifting" and walking away feel like relief without visible forfeiture or a path foreclosed with felt price. The final image (tapestry whole, village reborn) reconfigures the premise but the cost remains conceptual rather than undeniable on the page, limiting Resonant Reconfiguration strength.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The platinum labyrinth, time-frozen tableau, and frayed tapestry are vivid and specific. The labyrinth's walls "absorbing faint light" and threads that "pulsed like living veins" are filtered through Alaric's chess-tutor perspective (strategic, pattern-seeking). The pedestal at center and its carved threads constrain the final choice—Alaric must place his palm to trigger the resolution—qualifying as micro-setting that charges closure. Spatial choreography (kneeling, following platinum lines, approaching pedestal) remains coherent throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (self-forgiveness and breaking the curse) is signaled early. One meaningful tightening occurs when Alaric plucks the black thread and the memory surfaces, narrowing his path to separating guilt from redemption. The pedestal moment crystallizes the choice, but the resolution—threads weaving into one strand, village unfreezing—feels driven by the labyrinth's magic rather than Alaric's agency under pressure. No visible trade-off or foreclosed option at closure; the world simply "shifts" and time resumes without cost that alters later tactics.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme (forgiveness requires weaving failure into something new rather than erasing it) emerges from the tapestry metaphor and Alaric's chess lesson callback. The prince's "every choice has consequences" line gains irony when Alaric realizes his mistake was woven into systemic corruption. However, the final insight—"some threads couldn't be untangled—only woven into something new"—is stated rather than shown through a non-literal image or action. The "new pupil to find" ending offers mild resonance but lacks the charged ambiguity or conceptual cost that would reweight prior material without a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Single POV remains stable; Alaric's perceptual signature (chess-tutor habit of "fidgets productively," strategic framing) is consistent. Diction is controlled—"fierce repose," "woven hush"—and purposeful compression in lyric moments ("a tapestry of soundless forgiveness") reads as voice-motivated. Free indirect style is clean. The prince's dialogue carries distinct cadence ("Then I choose to win") and subtext (arrogance, foreshadowing betrayal). Minor register drift: "the world was vast, and he had all the time in the world to play" feels slightly glossy for peak closure but does not obscure the lens.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies; sentence openings and paragraph lengths create visual texture. Information density is high—most lines advance character, atmosphere, or symbolic texture. However, several figurative constructions cluster without payoff: "second shadow," "woven hush that bound time and silence," "threads split into smaller strands" within the same beat. "Fierce repose" and "winnow" recur but their mechanics remain abstract. Minor paraphrase loop: "The labyrinth's platinum walls gleamed faintly" near "platinum labyrinth etched into the cobblestones" and later "platinum lines etched into the ground." Propulsion is strong but figurative density in the middle third slightly dulls momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The exiled chess tutor + time-frozen village + tapestry-decoding premise combines familiar fantasy elements. The chess metaphor ("every move is a choice") and guilt-driven quest follow well-worn templates. Transformation is modest: the frayed-threads-as-memory mechanic and "woven hush" concept add texture, but the core arc (protagonist confronts past mistake, forgives self, breaks curse) does not offer a non-obvious angle. The final image (tapestry whole, village reborn, tutor departing) feels predictable. Specific details (platinum labyrinth, silver ring) are vivid but the emotional and thematic resolution lands on familiar ground without a fresh inflection.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Alaric is present throughout and his choices (approaching tapestry, plucking black thread, following labyrinth, placing palm on pedestal) create key turns. However, the pedestal moment—where threads glow and weave—feels more like the labyrinth acting than Alaric deciding. His final choice to walk away and seek a new pupil is stated but not tested by friction. Present in setup, middle, and ending; drives two beats (thread-plucking, pedestal); but agency at closure is passive reception rather than a high-cost decision.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The platinum labyrinth is etched into cobblestones (setup), Alaric follows its lines to center (middle), and its walls dissolve into light at closure. Handled across three beats with evolving function: first as puzzle/map, then as path, finally as transformative threshold. However, its properties (why platinum? how does it absorb light?) remain ornamental; any labyrinth could serve the same function. Specificity (platinum gleam) does not constrain choice—removal would simplify but not break the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Woven hush" appears as phrase (setup: "the woven hush that bound time and silence") and closure image ("tapestry of soundless forgiveness wrapped around him"). Functions thematically (forgiveness as weaving) but does not shape stakes or tactics—Alaric's actions (decode threads, follow path, touch pedestal) would work identically if the concept were named differently. Present and lyric but swappable; no causal pressure tied to "hush" versus another metaphor.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Fidgets productively, twisting the silver ring" appears twice: setup ("habit from years of pacing classrooms") and ending ("not out of nervousness but anticipation"). Label-only trait; the fidgeting does not constrain or enable any on-page action with cost. The ring could be any object. No visible trade-off or tactical consequence. Mentioned but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Winnow" is named in setup ("To winnow the truth from the lies") and middle ("He winnowed deeper, separating the threads of guilt from those of redemption"). The act of separating threads enables the hidden path to appear—a causal turn. However, the mechanics are vague (how does he winnow? what is the cost of choosing one thread over another?). Present across two beats and enables closure path, but easily swappable with "decode" or "unravel" without loss. Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The method is signaled early ("decode those threads") and enacted in the middle beat (plucking black thread, separating crimson/gold/black strands). Decoding the frayed border reveals the hidden labyrinth path—a causal mechanic that shapes attempts. The pedestal's carved threads complete the method at closure. Present in setup, constrains middle choice, and shapes ending. Specificity (frayed threads, border detail) matters to the tapestry's function. Could not easily swap with another method without restructuring the labyrinth mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The time-frozen village frames stakes (Alaric seeks to unravel the curse) and supplies the visual tableau that charges opening atmosphere. The village's stillness creates urgency (people trapped mid-gesture) and its unfreezing at closure provides the decisive change that validates Alaric's arc. The setting does not constrain Alaric's tactical choices during the labyrinth sequence, but it bookends the narrative and the final image (child's laughter, people gasping) delivers felt consequence. Present in setup and closure with causal weight; removal would eliminate the story's primary stake.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"During the lull of distant thunder" appears in setup ("thunder rumbled, a low growl") and recurs twice ("The lull of the thunder deepened," "The thunder rolled again, closer now," "The thunder faded"). Functions as atmospheric accent but does not tighten decisions or impose a deadline. Time remains vague—no clock pressures Alaric's choices. The thunder's approach does not alter tactics or escalate stakes. Present but ornamental; easily removable without structural impact.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Self-forgiveness is dramatized in the prince memory ("The prince's last look—a mix of betrayal and fear—had burned into Alaric's soul") and the closure epiphany ("To forgive himself, he had to accept that some threads couldn't be untangled"). The desire drives Alaric's choice to enter the labyrinth and decode the tapestry. Friction appears when he confronts guilt (black thread) versus hope (gold thread). However, the final acceptance feels reflective rather than tested by a high-cost choice. Present across setup, middle, and ending; drives key beats but resolution tilts toward told insight rather than embodied friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Fierce repose" is named once in the middle ("he moved with fierce repose, each step deliberate"). The tone—calm determination under pressure—is coherent through Alaric's methodical approach (kneeling, tracing threads, following lines). However, the tonal register does not modulate with escalation; the village's unfreezing and Alaric's final smile ("the weight on his chest lifting") feel relieved rather than fiercely poised. The tone charges early and middle atmosphere but does not recur or intensify at closure. Present and functional but static.</comment>
