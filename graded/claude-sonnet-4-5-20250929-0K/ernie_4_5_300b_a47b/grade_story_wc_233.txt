<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The queen's motivation to end her dreams and feel again is established, but her internal contradiction remains mostly stated rather than acted in scene—she claims disenchantment yet climbs eagerly without meaningful cost until the figure lectures her. The final turn (understanding and climbing down) lacks embodied hesitation or visible price; the epiphany arrives via exposition rather than a micro-choice that forecloses a path. Interiority leans toward label-only ("disenchanted," "afraid") without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Causal-Situational hybrid: the queen climbs to confront the dream source, and the grotto figure forces stance crystallization. Closure form is Charged Poise—she understands the bleeding starlight mirrors her own fear and turns back—but the cost is implied rather than made undeniable on the page (no visible forfeiture, injury, or tactical shift). Orientation is clean by ~60 words. The figure's monologue delivers the turn rather than protagonist agency, which weakens causality at the peak beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The ember grotto's glowing walls and pooled starlight are vividly rendered and constrain the queen's movement (she kneels, dips her fingers). The cobalt grotto and mist-covered ridge anchor early. However, the fireflies and the grotto's shifting light serve atmospheric decoration more than tactical constraint at closure; the queen's climb down is not shaped by environmental obstacle or resource.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—unraveling recurring dreams—is signaled early and drives the climb. One tightening occurs when the figure confronts her with self-knowledge, but that pressure arrives via dialogue lecture rather than protagonist agency narrowing her options. The queen's decision to descend reads as acceptance without visible trade-off or foreclosed alternative; no price is paid on the page (no injury, lost resource, or altered tactic).</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme of self-confrontation and the cost of emotional avoidance emerges clearly, and the bleeding starlight functions as effective metaphor. However, the figure's final speech ("The starlight bleeds because you bleed") borders on thematic summary, and the queen's realization lacks a non-literal final image that reweights prior material—she simply turns and climbs down. The ending gestures toward resonance but stops short of delivering a charged, particular image that embodies the theme without stating it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on the queen; diction is elevated and consistent ("lacy menace," "softly commanding"). The figure's dialogue carries distinct register but occasional overwriting ("a rumble like distant thunder," "wind chimes in a storm") inflates rather than sharpens. Perceptual signature is present (she notices condensation, tastes iron) but does not degrade under peak stress; the final beat maintains the same lyric cadence without modulation tied to her decision.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Figurative language is dense and occasionally mixed: "cobalt grotto above clouds stretching like a bruise beneath her feet" places a bruise below when the grotto is above, creating spatial confusion. Paraphrase loops appear ("She waited…Then, a shared exhale…as the first fireflies…flickered to life. They drifted upward…guiding her…She smiled…and resumed her climb") where adjacent sentences restate momentum without adding pressure. Rhythm is generally controlled, but the closure beat ("She turned, her cloak billowing…and began the climb down") compresses the ending into summary rather than a charged final image with line-level payoff.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The premise—disenchanted queen climbs to confront bleeding starlight and her own fears—rests on a familiar template (symbolic journey, self-realization via mystical guide). The grotto and bleeding starlight offer vivid texture, but the emotional arc (denial → lecture → acceptance) follows a well-worn path without a non-obvious synthesis or risk that heightens stakes. The figure's exposition-heavy dialogue and the lack of a specific, irreversible choice at closure reduce freshness.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The disenchanted queen is present throughout and her choice to climb drives the first half, but the peak turn (understanding her fear) is delivered by the figure's monologue rather than her own on-page decision that alters tactics. Her final choice to descend is signaled but not dramatized with visible cost or foreclosed alternative, making her agency more passive reception than active turn.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The ember grotto appears in setup (dreams, three nights prior), is the destination of the climb (middle development), and houses the confrontation at closure. Its glowing walls and pooled starlight constrain her movement (she kneels, dips fingers) and the chamber's voice delivers the thematic challenge. The grotto is causally indispensable across all three gates and charges the ending, though the final image does not spotlight the grotto itself—she turns away.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Bleeding starlight is seeded in dreams (setup), appears as pooled light in the grotto (middle), and is explained metaphorically at closure ("the starlight bleeds because you bleed"). It shapes the queen's goal (unravel the mystery) and the figure's thematic diagnosis, but does not constrain an on-page tactical choice or impose visible cost; it functions more as symbolic stakes than causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Softly commanding" appears twice as label-only descriptor (attendants' voices, the figure's tone) without constraining or enabling an on-page action with cost. The attribute is ornamental rather than causal; removing it would not alter any choice or outcome.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The climb is signaled early, occupies the middle third with physical detail (slick stones, moss-covered boulder, narrow path), and delivers the queen to the grotto where the confrontation occurs. Removing the climb would eliminate spatial progression, the firefly guide beat, and the physical embodiment of her goal pursuit. The descent at closure mirrors and completes the climb arc, making the action indispensable to structure and theme.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"A shared exhale spotting the first fireflies of summer" appears once in the middle as a transition beat that guides the queen upward. The fireflies do not recur at closure or constrain a later choice; the "shared exhale" moment is atmospheric rather than mechanically causal. The method functions as one purposeful beat but lacks development or payoff.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The cobalt grotto above clouds is anchored early and frames the journey; the ember grotto's interior (glowing walls, pooled light) provides vivid spatial detail and houses the climax. However, neither grotto imposes a tactical constraint at closure—the queen's decision to descend is not shaped by environmental obstacle or resource. The setting is essential to atmosphere and destination but does not alter final options.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"After the final warning" anchors the timeframe early and the "three nights prior" dream timeline adds urgency. However, time does not tighten tactics during the climb or confrontation; no clock pressures her choices in the grotto, and the ending does not reflect elapsed consequence. The timeframe establishes stakes but does not actively constrain decisions.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The motivation to unravel recurring dreams is stated early and drives the climb; the queen's goal is tested when the figure offers an answer she resists ("That's… that's nonsense"). The friction between wanting answers and fearing their cost is present but remains mostly in dialogue rather than enacted through conflicting micro-choices. The motivation is essential to the journey but the final turn (acceptance) lacks visible cost tied to abandoning or fulfilling the dream quest.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Lacy menace" appears once as descriptor for the air's scent and is not sustained or modulated across beats. The tone mixes lyric elevation (bruise-like grotto, wind-chime laughter) with expository clarity (figure's dialogue) without coherent pressure arc. At closure, the tone does not shift to charge the final image; the ending remains in the same register as the opening without tonal payoff.</comment>
