<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias's guilt over the blight provides clear motivation, and his shift from "editing is control" to "collaboration" is signaled. However, the change arrives via Lira's exposition rather than through embodied struggle; his peak choice—to apologize and listen—feels compliant rather than contradictory. Internal conflict remains mostly told ("guilt gnawed at him") instead of acted in scene. The mantra "confidently uncertain" is label-only and never constrains a specific micro-choice with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece anchors who/where/when early and delivers a clear Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias moves from fixer to witness, forgoing control with a visible cost (walking away from the anomaly's certainty to face the farmer). The drive lens reads Causal, and the holographic projection provides a motivated ellipsis that changes knowledge. The ending offers Charged Poise—he commits to apology and listening, and "the girl's fever broke" signals consequence. However, the key reversal ("Trust the web") is handed to Elias by Lira rather than earned through his own on-page struggle, softening the closure's agency.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The gravitational anomaly is vivid and purposeful: stones hang midair, leaves spiral, and gravity flickers during the climactic exchange, grounding abstract stakes in sensory pressure. The pen's nib is handled twice (cold, then warm) and its temperature shift charges the final image. Spatial choreography remains clear (crater's edge, uphill walk). The micro-setting (anomaly + pen) constrains Elias's choice to unbend the timeline and charges his departure, meeting the 9+ gate test for Q3.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—fixing the blight and the girl's fever—is signaled early and tightens when Lira shows the fractured timeline. The holographic projection narrows options (he sees alternatives, understands the web), and the anomaly's stabilization provides on-page consequence. However, escalation is driven by Lira's guidance rather than Elias's agency; he watches, listens, and complies. The cost (walking away, committing to apology) is legible but mild, and the fever breaking happens off-page in the web rather than as a trade-off Elias visibly pays.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The theme—history as web, not line; collaboration over control—emerges from the anomaly, the projection, and Elias's final choice to witness rather than write. The seed metaphor recurs with purpose ("wrong seeds" → "turning mistakes into seeds") and the pen's hum charges the ending. Yet the final paragraph ("editing history wasn't about erasing mistakes. It was about turning them into seeds") states the theme rather than letting the image resonate alone. The web of contingent relationships is shown concretely but also over-articulated by Lira.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>POV remains stable, anchored in Elias's perception. Diction is generally consistent, with purposeful compression in sensory moments ("prickled," "teeth ache," "nib cold"). Lira's dialogue carries subtext ("You edit the what"), and the pen's warmth shift reflects emotional progression. However, dialogue occasionally tilts expository ("Through contingent relationships... thresh meaning from experience"), and Elias's internal voice flattens under Lira's instruction rather than sharpening with stress. Brief filter-verb stacks ("reached," "closed," "saw") in the projection beat dull immediacy slightly.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose is clear and purposeful, with strong opening imagery ("prismatic shards that prickled") and concise scene work. Rhythm varies, and most lines advance character or atmosphere. The final beat—"the pen felt lighter... its nib humming softly"—carries earned density. However, paraphrase loops appear: "History isn't a line... It's a web" restates the projection's show; "confidently uncertain" recurs as scaffold without new work. Template cadence in Lira's exposition ("You're here to unbend... I edit the why... You edit the what") and the therapy-speak "thresh meaning from experience" lower momentum in a high-pressure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The gravitational anomaly + time-editing + holographic projection offers a fresh synthesis, and the pen-as-listening-tool inverts the writing metaphor. The "history as web" theme is specific to Elias's role. However, the core frame—protagonist fixes mistake via mystical guide's wisdom—follows a familiar template. Lira arrives precisely to deliver the solution, and the "let history bend you" epiphany is achieved through her exposition rather than Elias's embodied discovery. The fever breaking off-page and the seed metaphor turning explicit in the final paragraph lean toward safe, tidy closure rather than bold risk.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elias is present throughout, frames the inciting problem (blight), and makes the final choice to apologize and listen. However, his role as "celestial signal interpreter" is mostly backdrop; tracking anomalies does not constrain his key decisions. The peak turn—trusting the web—is Lira's instruction, not his discovery. His choice to walk to the farmer is legible but reactive. Early setup, one weak middle beat (projection viewing), closure participation via departure: two gates, functional but replaceable. Late-penalty avoided, but causal pressure is modest (−0.5 swappability, +0.4 one beat, +0.5 closure linkage).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The pen appears early (setup), is plucked by Lira to trigger the projection (middle beat), returns warm in Elias's pocket at closure, and hums in the final line—charging the ending image. It enables the holographic timeline and reweights meaning (cold → warm = shift from control to witness). Three beats, closure linkage strong, specificity high ("gold filigree etched with constellations"). However, the pen's exotic nib is "for listening" only via Lira's tell; its mechanics are asserted, not dramatized through Elias's use. Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, closure +1.2, irreplaceability +0.5, told mechanics −0.4.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Editing history frames the inciting problem (rewritten logs → blight) and the central tension (unbend the timeline). The holographic projection dramatizes the concept (fractured timeline, alternatives visible), and the ending pivot—from erasing to witnessing—shifts tactics. Setup clear, middle beat (projection) uses it, closure reweights it. However, the editing itself happens off-page (three days prior); on-page work is watching Lira's projection and accepting her instruction. The concept shapes stakes more than enabling tactics. Early signal +0.6, one beat +0.4, closure linkage +0.9, swappability −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Confidently uncertain" appears twice as a label ("his mantra," Lira echoes it) but never constrains or enables an on-page action with cost. It describes Elias's general stance without altering a specific choice or tactic. Setup present (early mention), no middle beat, no closure participation. Label-only −0.6, ornamental use −0.8, late-middle mention −0.2. Functional floor only.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Unbend" appears in the title and Lira's first line ("You're here to unbend the timeline"), frames the goal, and the anomaly's stabilization at the end suggests success. Setup early, participates in closure (gravity returns to normal). However, the action itself—what "unbending" mechanically requires—remains abstract; Lira does the projection work, and Elias's contribution is acceptance. Swappable with "fix," "reset," "restore." Early signal +0.5, closure linkage +0.7, swappability −0.7, summary-only −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Contingent relationships" is introduced by Lira in exposition ("Through contingent relationships... every action ripples"), demonstrated via the projection's branching alternatives, and Elias whispers it as recognition. It shapes his understanding but not his tactics; he does not enact the method on-page, only absorbs Lira's lesson. Setup mid-scene, one beat (projection), closure echo ("Thank the web"). Told mechanics without protagonist enactment. One beat +0.4, closure echo +0.4, late intro −0.3, summary-only −0.6.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The gravitational anomaly anchors setting, pressures Elias physically (teeth ache, knees buckle), and its stabilization marks the resolution. Stones and leaves shifting provide live feedback on the timeline's state. Setup immediate, middle beat (flickering gravity during peak exchange), closure participation (anomaly stabilizes, air stills). However, it functions more as backdrop and consequence-indicator than as a resource Elias uses tactically. Early signal +0.7, two beats +0.9, closure +1.0, passive role −0.6, causal pressure +0.4.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"After planting the wrong seeds" frames the inciting guilt (three days prior) and the farmer's daughter's fever, tightening urgency. The timeline exists as backstory and projection rather than a live clock; no on-page countdown or time-driven tactic shift. Setup clear (backstory block), middle beat (projection of alternatives), closure (walks to farmer, fever breaks in the web). Time orients rather than pressures. Early signal +0.5, one beat +0.4, closure linkage +0.6, vague clock −0.4, backstory-only origin −0.3.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Thresh meaning from experience" is Lira's instruction, not Elias's expressed desire. His on-page motivation is guilt and the need to fix the blight; "threshing meaning" is outcome, not driving want. It appears mid-scene in Lira's dialogue, echoes in the ending reflection, but does not create friction or constrain choices. Introduced late, no early setup, closure echo only. Late intro −0.7, told-only −0.7, ornamental use −0.5, closure echo +0.4.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Strange comfort" appears once ("the strange comfort of the anomaly lingered") after the resolution, naming the tone rather than building it through modulation. The anomaly is eerie and destabilizing early, then supportive; Lira is calm. Tone shifts from dread to relief but lacks purposeful tension with events. Single late mention, no early setup, no mid-scene modulation. Closure mention +0.4, static mood −0.6, told-only label −0.5, late intro −0.5, ornamental use −0.5. Rounding down to 5.3.</comment>
