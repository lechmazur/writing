<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Mara's gift of "spatial imagination" is labeled but never shown constraining a choice; it functions as flavor text. The psychometry reading produces vivid backstory images but Mara makes no difficult decision under pressure—she simply witnesses Elise's past, then decides to "find" the love with no visible cost or foreclosed path. Elise and Thomas are vivid in flashback, but their drama remains sealed in the past; Mara's present-tense emotional arc (throat tightens, tears prick) is summarized rather than embodied in contradictory action. The final whisper "I'll find you" and the smile are declarations of intent without on-page stakes or trade-off.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: Mara gathers sensory fragments (dust, film, crystal hum, lilac scent) toward a thematic reconfiguration. Orientation anchors clearly by the first paragraph (Mara, projection booth, night, rain). However, closure lacks visible cost: the crystal flares, lilacs appear, Mara smiles and descends "her steps light"—a tidy affirmation without foreclosing a path or reweighting prior material through sacrifice. The flashback to Elise and Thomas is causally inert in the present; it informs Mara's understanding but does not narrow her options or impose a price. The ending gesture (tucking the film strip, descending stairs) reads as setup for future action rather than a decisive change or charged poise on this page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The projection booth is vividly rendered with concrete detail (dust, decayed film stock, scarred wooden table, single flickering bulb, rattling window) that grounds the reader spatially. The booth functions as a container for Elise's grief and provides the film canister as a key object. However, setting does not constrain Mara's choices: she enters, reads the film, experiences the vision, and departs without environmental friction. The lilac scent at closure is atmospheric but does not alter tactics or impose a material consequence. Spatial choreography is clean (booth, table, stairs, lobby) and the vintage theater milieu is consistent, yet the setting remains backdrop rather than active pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"to find where unused love is stored"—is signaled early but remains abstract and uncontested. Mara encounters no obstacles; the psychometry reading succeeds immediately, the crystal behaves as expected, and the final revelation (love "just waiting to be noticed") arrives without requiring a difficult choice or trade-off. No reversal or tightening narrows her options. The flashback supplies emotional texture but does not escalate present-tense pressure. Mara's agency at closure is a whispered declaration and a smile, both affirming rather than transformative. The story reads as a sympathetic unveiling rather than a conflict arc with earned cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Theme (unused love as latent potential, grief as containment) emerges clearly from the Elise/Thomas backstory and the motif of hidden letters. The ending gestures toward resonance: "unused love wasn't lost; it was just waiting," reweighting the grandmother's whispers and the film canisters. However, the insight is stated rather than embodied in a final image or action that surprises the reader; Mara's smile and descent illustrate the theme without complicating it. The lilac scent and the building's approving creak risk symbolic convenience. The piece avoids overt moralizing but does not offer a non-literal answer or ambiguity that lingers beyond the immediate plot.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable; Mara's focalization remains consistent with no head-hopping. The prose carries a controlled, slightly elevated register ("lattice of memories," "theater of light") that fits the crystal-gazer premise. Psychic distance is managed well during the psychometry sequence, layering Elise's voice and images into Mara's perception. Diction is consistent and purposeful, with brief dialogue tags (Elise's murmured words) integrated cleanly. However, under peak emotional pressure (Mara's throat tightening, tears pricking), the narration remains externalized and declarative rather than fragmenting or compressing in ways that mirror stress. No filter-verb stacks or convergence issues, and the voice is distinct enough to avoid generic committee tone.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high; the opening paragraph anchors efficiently. However, minor loops and scaffolding appear: "The goodbye letters—her grandmother's, the ones she'd found after her death—had mentioned" recaps known information, and "She stood… She closed her eyes… She gathered… She descended" stacks four identical sentence stems in the final third, creating template cadence. The psychometry sequence is vivid but leans on passive constructions ("images flashed," "the scene shifted") where active syntax would propel more forcefully. Figurative language ("lattice of memories," "theater of light") is clear but borders on stock in the genre. No major grammar errors or clarity breaks; proofreading is clean. The final paragraph's lilac scent and building's creak risk symbolic convenience but do not obscure causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The premise—psychometry in a vintage movie palace, hidden love letters in film canisters—synthesizes familiar paranormal-romance and haunted-archive tropes without a sharp transformative angle. The emotional truth (unspoken love, wartime separation, grief as containment) is genuine but broadly rendered; the Elise/Thomas backstory hits expected beats (usherette meets projectionist, *Casablanca* nod, draft separates them). Mara's gift and her grandmother's letters are introduced but not leveraged in a way that forces a non-obvious moral calculus or structural risk. The ending's affirmation—love "just waiting to be noticed"—resolves into a reassuring universal rather than a specific, hard-won insight. The piece is competently executed within its genre but does not challenge or subvert the template; swapping Mara for a similar empathic protagonist would not fundamentally alter the arc.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Mara (crystal gazer) is present throughout but makes no key turn through choice; she observes the past, affirms a conclusion, and descends stairs. Setup present, development is witnessing only, closure is affirmation without cost—two gates at best, and observation without decision trends low.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Film strip is handled in multiple beats: unwound, pressed, rewound, crumpled, tucked into coat. It triggers the psychometry vision (middle) and is carried away at closure, reweighted as a container of grief. Three gates met; causal pressure moderate (enables vision); specificity moderate (celluloid, sprocket holes). However, swappable with any relic (letter, photo) without major restructuring, limiting irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Goodbye letters are seeded early (grandmother's letters mentioning "theater of light"), central to the Elise backstory (hidden letters in canisters), and thematically charged at closure ("unused love… waiting"). Three gates met. However, the letters are recounted rather than handled on the page; Mara never reads or interacts with them directly. Causal pressure is indirect (they frame Mara's quest but do not narrow her options in scene). Moderate thematic integration but weak physical presence.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Spatially imaginative" is labeled in paragraph two ("see the world as a lattice of memories") but never constrains or enables a dramatized choice. Mara's ability to sense emotion in objects (psychometry) is active; spatial imagination is ornamental. Present by setup, absent in middle action, no closure link—one gate at best. Label-only trait, zero on-page cost or tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Incubate" appears once in paragraph one ("to incubate an idea—to find where unused love was stored") as a metaphor for Mara's reflection. It does not recur, shape action, or constrain tactics. The booth serves as a static container, not an active incubation process with stages. Setup mention only, no middle development, no closure participation—one gate, ornamental use.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Psychometry reading is signaled early (paragraph two: "method she'd honed"), executed in the middle (pressing palm to film, flooding images), and drives the central revelation. Two distinct beats (first vision, rewound deepening), causal pressure strong (unlocks Elise's story), closure linkage moderate (enables Mara's final affirmation). Three gates met; specificity high (touch-based, crystal aids). Irreplaceability moderate (could swap for another divination method with edits, but mechanics are clear and consistent).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Vintage movie palace projection booth is established early with vivid detail (dust, reels, scarred table, single bulb), provides the film canister and crystal work surface, and the lobby creak at closure signals building approval. Three gates met. However, setting does not constrain Mara's choices or supply friction—she performs psychometry without environmental obstacle. Micro-setting (table, canister) is present but does not alter tactics. Specificity high, causal pressure low.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>1.4</grade><comment>"While forgotten lyrics search for tune" appears once as metaphor in paragraph two, disconnected from any dramatized timeframe or clock. No urgency, no tracked duration, no tactical pressure from elapsed time. Ornamental phrase, zero causal involvement, no closure link—absent in function.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Motivation "to find where unused love is stored" is seeded early (grandmother's letters) and thematically resolved at closure ("wasn't lost; just waiting"). However, the desire is never conflicted on the page—Mara pursues it unopposed, with no cost or friction between want and obstacle. Setup and closure present (two gates), but middle development lacks dramatized choice or trade-off. Told and affirmed more than tested under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Hushed thunder" appears in paragraph one (rain's "hushed thunder") and recurs implicitly in the quiet, charged atmosphere (air thickening, storm holding breath, lilac scent). Tone is coherent and modulates from tension (rain, rattling window) to affirmation (smile, light steps). However, the tonal shift at closure is gentle rather than decisive; no sharp modulation that reweights pressure. Setup and development present, closure link moderate—two gates plus minor lyric reprise.</comment>
