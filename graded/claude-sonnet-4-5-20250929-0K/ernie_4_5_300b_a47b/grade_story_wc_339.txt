<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent—mapping grief through physics—but her interiority leans heavily on abstract concepts ("phase transition," "half-life of memory") rather than embodied contradiction. The snow globe functions well as an anchor object that reveals character through handling, and her choice to pack it at the end signals a shift in stance. However, the final turn feels more intellectually declared than dramatized through conflicting impulses acting simultaneously under pressure. Minor penalty for therapy-adjacent phrasing ("the quiet, analytic ache") that edges toward diagnostic self-awareness.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes a clear Accumulative/Textural lens: Elara's investigation accrues discoveries (tape loop, tuning fork frequency, snow globe motor match) that reweight her understanding of "letting go" as transmission rather than release. Orientation anchors arrive promptly (sunken ship library, weeks after Earhart discovery). The closure unit is a Conceptual Repricing—the final image of learning to "feel the resonance in her own bones" reframes the premise with a felt cost (private work vs. publication, holding on vs. transmission). One meaningful deepening occurs when the hum's match to the snow globe shifts her physics metaphor. Cost is legible but somewhat abstract; the "ache of holding on too tight" remains more conceptual than viscerally paid on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The sunken ship library is vividly anchored with selective sensory detail (salt-crusted spine, warped shelves, lantern light, pressure-warped environment). The snow globe and tape recorder constrain choices—Elara cross-references frequencies, isolates patterns—and the setting pressures her work through its archival nature and deep-ocean isolation. The final beat mentions "corridors pulsing with ghost of Earhart's voice," which charges atmosphere but doesn't alter a concrete choice. Spatial choreography is clean, and the setting's specificity (1937 aviation manual, reel-to-reel recorder, tuning fork in galley) filters through Elara's physicist lens. Meets the 9+ gate test: the library and snow globe both constrain investigation and charge the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding how memories persist and dissolve—is signaled early and tightens through accumulative discovery: white noise loop, 440 Hz match, realization of quantum communication experiment. One meaningful deepening occurs when Elara grasps the loop as deliberate signal rather than glitch, reweighting "letting go" as transmission. Agency is present in her analytic choices (transcribing, cross-referencing, isolating pattern), and the final decision to replay and map the hum to a decay rate forecloses the simpler path of solving Earhart's disappearance. Cost is visible in her shift from public findings to private resonance work. Under the Accumulative lens, escalation reads as density increase that reweights the stake; one tightening is sufficient for this length. Pressure coheres throughout.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The theme—grief as a phase transition, memory as transmission rather than erasure—emerges organically from Elara's investigation and the snow globe motif. The final image of "learning to shake the globe not to watch the storm, but to feel the resonance" offers a non-literal answer to the physics of letting go without moralizing. Subtext operates in the snow globe's return with reweighted meaning and in Elara's choice to prioritize private work over public closure. The quantum-communication premise integrates with theme through the specific discovery of encoded signals. Minor slip: "the quiet, analytic ache of holding on too tight" edges toward summary statement rather than letting resonance arise purely from image and action. Theme resists tidy resolution; the ending remains open yet charged.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV remains stable; psychic distance is controlled and intimate ("her breath caught," "her hands trembled"). Diction is mostly character-appropriate—physicist's lexicon (entropy, wavefunction collapse, ionosphere) blends with personal grief register. The perceptual signature is selective: she notices frequencies, decay patterns, the snow globe's motor hum. Compression is purposeful ("the physics of letting go" is character-coined jargon, not authorial intrusion). Minor register slip: "the ghost of Earhart's voice, urging her onward" reads slightly elevated for a moment of private perception. Free indirect style is clean; no filter-verb stacks. Narrative stance modulates with discovery beats, maintaining rhythmic control. No dialogue present to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings and lengths create visual interest. Information density is high—most lines advance investigation, character, or atmosphere. Minor loop artifacts: "The library's corridors seemed to pulse" echoes the earlier "time seemed to pool" construction without adding pressure; "not to watch the storm, but to feel the resonance" is effective parallelism but sits close to summary. Figurative density is controlled except in the final third, where metaphors stack ("orbit like electrons," "phase transition," "half-life of memory") without full dramatization. Clarity remains high; no pronoun confusion or tense drift. Technical terminology (440 Hz, ionosphere, quantum decay) reads accurate and voice-appropriate. Propulsion is steady, though the penultimate paragraph shifts into reflective summary that slightly slows momentum before the final beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of quantum physics, Earhart mystery, and personal grief through the snow globe motif is specific and non-obvious. The premise—using sound-wave frequencies to map memory persistence—feels fresh within the grief-investigation genre. Transformation test: the story's emotional arc depends on these exact particulars (physicist, sunken library, tuning fork frequency match). However, the quantum-communication twist arrives late and resolves neatly without prior seeding of Earhart's experimental angle; this convenience lowers ingenuity slightly. The snow globe's mechanical hum matching the tape frequency is a bold causal choice that heightens stakes. Emotional specificity avoids generic grief templates through the physicist's analytic lens. Risk-taking in blending speculative science with intimate loss is evident, though the closure edges toward conceptual elegance over messier human complexity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara is established as "first-name basis with Death" early and this trait shapes her motivation (investigating decay, resonance, and memory persistence). The phrase appears in the opening and colors her entire approach—she treats grief analytically rather than emotionally. However, the trait itself doesn't constrain a specific on-page choice with visible cost; it describes her general stance. Present in setup and informs the ending's private research decision, but doesn't create a distinct middle turn. Functional across beats but not indispensable; a similar investigator without this exact framing could pursue the same arc. Two gates met (setup, closure participation); causal pressure is present but indirect.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The snow globe appears in three distinct beats: introduction as mother's memento, cross-reference discovery (motor hums at 440 Hz matching the tape), and final packing/shaking decision. It constrains Elara's investigation—the frequency match is a key causal link—and charges the closure image ("learning to shake the globe...to feel the resonance"). Specific cost: choosing private resonance work over solving Earhart's mystery. Early signal, middle development (frequency discovery), and closure participation all present. Irreplaceable: its exact mechanical property (440 Hz motor) drives the central discovery. Strong integration across all three gates with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Last transmission" is established in setup (tape recorder with Earhart's final logged transmission), drives the middle investigation (isolating the 12-second loop and hum), and redefines the stakes at closure (transmission as preservation rather than distress call). The concept shapes tactics: Elara replays, cross-references, and ultimately plans to map the hum to a decay rate. Specific cost: realizing the transmission wasn't a mystery to solve but a method to emulate shifts her life's work from public answers to private resonance. Present in all three gates; causal pressure is strong; the realization that it was "a test" and "quantum communication" transforms the premise. Essential and irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Quietly, analytically" appears as descriptor in the opening ("she'd begun calling, quietly, 'the physics of letting go'") and shapes her method throughout—she "worked quietly, analytically" and chooses methodical investigation over emotional reaction. The trait enables her discovery process (cross-referencing algorithms, isolating patterns) and constrains her final choice (private lab work vs. dramatic reveal). However, it's mostly shown through method rather than creating a visible tradeoff or friction. Present in setup and ending; informs multiple beats but doesn't force a specific high-cost decision. Functional integration with moderate causal pressure; somewhat replaceable with "methodical" or "reserved" without major structural change.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Note" appears explicitly in "as she transcribed her notes by lantern light" and governs the method: she maps, records, transcribes, and plans to "replay the tape, note by note." The action enables her key discovery (noticing the hum match while transcribing) and shapes the ending commitment (mapping hum to decay rate). Signaled early (transcription scene), drives middle turn (frequency observation), and defines closure tactics (note-by-note replay in lab). Specific to her physicist approach; swapping for "measure" or "record" would weaken the accumulative texture. Two-to-three gate satisfaction with causal role in escalation. Essential to method but not absolutely indispensable to the core realization; still, strong integration with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Untangling threads" is introduced as her research focus ("her mind untangling threads of decay and resonance") and becomes the concrete method: isolating the 12-second loop from white noise, cross-referencing naval logs and algorithms, tracing the hum to the tuning fork. The mechanics matter—she doesn't stumble on answers; she systematically parses signal from noise. Present in setup, drives middle escalation (pattern isolation), and shapes ending work (mapping note by note to decay rate). The method constrains her investigation: she must cross-reference, must isolate, must transcribe. Irreplaceable for this character; a different method (intuitive leap, archive search) would alter her arc. Strong causal pressure; visible across multiple beats; charges the closure commitment.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The sunken ship library is anchored early (opening line), supplies essential resources (1937 aviation manual, reel-to-reel tape recorder, tuning fork in galley), and constrains Elara's investigation through its archival isolation and pressure-warped preservation. The setting enables the middle discoveries—she works "by lantern light," the shelves "warped by pressure" hold the tape, and the environment's deep-ocean stasis mirrors her grief work. At closure, "the library's corridors seemed to pulse" charges her final realization. Specific cost: the setting's remoteness and silence shape her decision to pursue private resonance work rather than public answers. All three gates met; irreplaceable (no other location holds these exact artifacts); strong causal and atmospheric pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"After finding Amelia Earhart's plane" anchors the broader timeline (wreck discovered weeks after) and provides narrative urgency (Elara came "not for history, but for a different kind of truth"). However, the timeframe doesn't tighten on-page decisions—no countdown, no competing deadline. The "weeks after" establishes context but remains static throughout; Elara's investigation proceeds without time pressure. Present in setup, mentioned at closure ("decades later"), but doesn't constrain middle choices or escalate tactics. Functional framing device but largely replaceable; the investigation could occur under different temporal circumstances without altering core beats. Missing middle development; closure participation is thematic, not causal. Cap at 4.6 for missing setup participation (mentioned but not pressuring).</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"To understand the physics of letting go" is established early as Elara's coined phrase and dominant stake. It drives every beat: she came to the wreck for this truth, her research into entropy and decay serves this question, and her final realization redefines it (transmission vs. release). The motivation is dramatized through choices—isolating the hum, packing the snow globe, committing to private lab work—and encounters friction (the urge to solve Earhart's mystery vs. the pull of personal resonance). Specific cost: forsaking public answers and "half-drowned speculation" for private, un-publishable grief work. Present in all three gates; irreplaceable; drives escalation and charges closure image. Strong integration with visible emotional and professional trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Sophisticated melancholy" coheres from the opening (mother's vanishing, snow globe, "unspoken grief") and modulates with pressure: curiosity and focus during investigation, trembling hands at discovery, quiet resolve at closure. The tone integrates diction (entropy, wavefunction, ionosphere) with intimate loss (snow globe as memento, "ache of holding on too tight") and remains consistent through turns without flattening into uniform sadness. The final image—choosing to "feel the resonance in her own bones"—charges the tone with earned cost and acceptance. Tone shapes reader experience and supports theme without mechanical mood enforcement. Present across all beats; irreplaceable for this exact emotional register; minor slip toward summary statement in penultimate paragraph but recovers at closure. Strong tonal control under the Accumulative lens.</comment>
