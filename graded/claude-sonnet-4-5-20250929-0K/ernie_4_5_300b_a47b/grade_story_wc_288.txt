<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lirael's motivation to translate isolation into independence is clear and stated early, but her interiority leans heavily on abstract metaphor ("consciousness had splintered from the collective soul") rather than embodied contradiction. The final choice to write her own story feels declared rather than earned through prior micro-choices under pressure; we see her observing and receiving rather than struggling with competing impulses. The line "I see you, but I am not you" offers a stance, but the cost of this renunciation remains largely conceptual—no visible forfeiture or tactical shift follows on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who (Lirael), where (tidal library), and when (after reincarnation memory) within the opening paragraph. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the hum crescendos, images coalesce, and the library transforms in response to Lirael's stance. Closure arrives as Charged Poise when she begins writing again after placing *Brittle Awakenings* on the shelf, reweighting her from "contemporary of the dead" to "pioneer of the living." However, the felt cost is oblique—no on-page forfeiture or tactical constraint is visible; the transformation happens through environmental response rather than protagonist sacrifice, weakening the cost-proof test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The tidal library is vividly specific (coral walls from extinct oceans, floors that shift like tides, shelves swaying with the moon's breath) and the brass sundial functions as a recurring anchor. The sundial constrains Lirael's recognition at the climax ("placed her palm flat") and the library's transformation supplies new tools that alter her final choice to document. The micro-setting charges the closure image when the shelves and chambers respond to her stance, lifting the score into the 7-band despite some ornamental description early on.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—translate isolation into independence—is signaled early and remains coherent. One meaningful tightening occurs when the sundial glows and Lirael speaks aloud, narrowing her options from passive observation to active stance. Yet the escalation relies on environmental response (the hum shifts, the library changes) rather than protagonist agency under pressure; coincidence supplies the tools and chambers without Lirael paying a visible on-page price or making a trade-off that forecloses a path. The cost remains felt but not dramatized through action.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The theme—surviving the past by letting it flow through rather than fighting it—emerges from the sundial's images and the library's tidal rhythm. The line "atomically reflective meant to see oneself in the fragments of the past without being shattered by them" borders on explicit statement, lowering thematic resonance. The final image of writing and placing the book offers a non-literal answer, but the conceptual cost is not made undeniable; the spiral symbol and the shelf's appearance feel convenient rather than earned from prior friction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-person limited to Lirael; no head-hopping. Diction is controlled and purposeful, with sentences like "their forms dissolving like smoke" and "her reflection in the sundial's surface wavering but steady." However, register occasionally drifts toward exposition ("Its gnomon cast no shadow, for the sun here was a myth") and elevated metaphor stacks in high-pressure beats ("liquid starlight," "ghostly chorus," "brittle moment") without clear voice-motivated urgency. The lack of dialogue removes an opportunity for subtext and distinction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear and propulsive, with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm modulation. However, several adjacent lines restate the same content: "leaving her alone but unbound" followed by "to prove that survival did not require the ghostly chorus of her kin" is a paraphrase loop. Template cadence appears in the opening ("where the shelves swayed…and the ink…shimmered") and elevated metaphor density ("liquid starlight," "smoke," "primordial") in the first two paragraphs without pattern-teaching or payoff at closure. Deduct −0.6 for paraphrase loop and figurative density in setup beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The premise—a lone survivor in a fantastical library documenting her independence—echoes familiar tropes (last of her kind, magical archive, self-discovery arc) without a sharp transformative angle. The tidal library and brass sundial offer vivid particulars, but the emotional arc (isolation → independence through writing) follows a predictable path. The stone circle hum and reincarnation memory introduce intriguing elements yet remain underdeveloped; swapping them for other mystical mechanisms would not fundamentally alter the resolution. No bold risk-taking that heightens stakes beyond the median.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Lirael is identified as "a contemporary of extinct species" in the opening paragraph (setup gate met). Her choices to trace the sundial, speak aloud, and place her palm drive the middle and ending beats (development and payoff gates met). However, her "contemporary" status is largely ornamental—her decisions are motivated by isolation and independence, not by any unique trait or cost tied to being a contemporary of the extinct. The attribute could be swapped for "last survivor" or "reincarnated soul" with minimal structural impact, capping the score below 5.0.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The brass sundial appears in the opening line (setup gate met), Lirael touches it twice (tracing its edge, placing her palm flat; two distinct beats, development gate met), and its glowing symbol and fading images directly shape the closure (payoff gate met). The sundial's "atomically reflective" surface and the spiral symbol enable Lirael's recognition and decision to write, providing causal pressure. It is handled on the page and its meaning shifts from relic to key. Strong integration across all three gates and two beats with closure linkage; swapping it for another relic would weaken the logic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Brittle awakenings" appears in the narrative as "the reincarnation memory—a fragile, brittle moment when her consciousness had splintered" (setup gate met) and becomes the title of her first book at the closure (payoff gate met). However, it does not constrain a middle choice (development gate missing). The concept functions as thematic label rather than actionable stake; Lirael does not grapple with brittleness as a tactical problem or trade-off. The title feels like a retrospective echo rather than a driver of on-page decisions, capping the score below 4.0.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Atomically reflective" is assigned to the sundial in the opening paragraph (setup gate met) and explained as "to see oneself in the fragments of the past without being shattered by them" near the climax. However, this is delivered as exposition rather than demonstrated through an on-page action with cost; Lirael does not use the reflective property to enable or constrain a choice. The attribute remains ornamental description without causal pressure or visible tradeoff, capping the score below 3.0.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Coexist" is signaled early ("learned to coexist with this energy, to let it wash over her"; setup gate met), explicitly chosen at the penultimate beat ("she would coexist with her own future"; development and payoff gates met). The action shapes the resolution—her stance to coexist rather than fight the past enables the library's transformation and her decision to write. However, the verb is used as theme statement rather than dramatized through a specific on-page trade-off or constraint; swapping "coexist" for "accept" or "embrace" would not break the logic. Early signal, closure linkage, but moderate causal pressure and some swappability keep it mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The "hum of an ancient stone circle" is introduced in the opening paragraph ("replaced by the hum of an ancient stone circle buried deep in the library's foundation"; setup gate met). The hum crescendos, shifts to melody, and softens to whisper, shaping the middle and closure beats (development and payoff gates met). It enables the sundial's glow and the library's transformation, providing causal pressure. However, its mechanics remain abstract—how the hum causes these effects is never specified—and it could be replaced with another mystical energy source (e.g., ancient crystals, ley lines) without altering the structure. Present across all three gates with beat involvement, but moderate specificity and swappability cap it below 5.0.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The "tidal library above clouds" is anchored in the opening line (setup gate met). The library's architecture (coral walls, shifting floors, swaying shelves) supplies sensory texture and the library transforms to provide new tools and chambers that enable Lirael's decision to write (development and payoff gates met). The setting constrains choices (the sundial's presence, the hum's influence) and charges the final image ("looked out through the coral walls, past the clouds"). Strong causal pressure, beat involvement, closure linkage, and irreplaceability—removing this exact setting would break the story's logic and tone.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"After the reincarnation memory" is named in the second paragraph (setup gate met) as the moment Lirael awakened alone. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions or tactics in the middle or closure; the story unfolds in a single continuous scene with no live clock or deadline. The phrase functions as backstory label rather than temporal constraint, missing development and payoff gates. Swappable with "after her people vanished" or "after the awakening" without structural impact, capping the score below 3.5.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The motivation "to translate isolation into independence" is stated explicitly in the second paragraph (setup gate met). Lirael's actions—touching the sundial, speaking aloud, placing her palm, writing the book—pursue this desire through the middle and closure (development and payoff gates met). The motivation shapes the dominant stake and the final image reweights it ("no longer a contemporary of the dead; she was a pioneer of the living"). However, the want is told rather than dramatized through friction; no visible cost or competing impulse complicates her pursuit. Strong setup, beat involvement, and closure linkage, but low friction keeps it mid-band.</comment>
