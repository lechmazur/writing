<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Kael's motivation to learn why some echo is stated but never tested through contradictory impulses or visible cost. The discovery scene with the hooded figure delivers exposition rather than forcing a choice that forecloses a path. Interiority leans on stock phrasing ("breath caught," "melancholy swelling") and the final decision to "keep singing" arrives without dramatized struggle or renunciation. No embodied emotional contradiction acts simultaneously in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who and where by the second paragraph, but "when" remains vague throughout. The closure unit—Kael understanding his purpose and singing while the canyon answers—reads as Resonant Reconfiguration, but the cost is asserted rather than shown; no visible forfeiture or altered tactic appears on the page. The reveal from the hooded figure is purely expository and does not narrow options or force a trade-off. Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural, but the final cadence shift lacks a felt price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The serpentine nexus is vividly rendered with sensory specificity (stone coiling, wind carrying whispers, fissure like a scar). The seashell half pressed against the wall guides the ascent and constrains Kael's path, charging the final image when pressed to his heart. Spatial choreography during the climb is clear. The micro-setting (shell, stones, ledge) shapes one key choice and returns at closure, meeting the 9+ gate requirement for constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—learning why some echo—is signaled early but never tightens through a reversal or choice that narrows options. The hooded figure's explanation is delivered without resistance or complication. No on-page cost alters tactics; Kael's decision to "keep singing" is a continuation, not a trade-off. The ascent provides physical escalation but not pressure escalation under the inferred lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the recurring image of echoes as trapped stories and the seashell as listener, avoiding overt moralizing. The final image—canyon singing back "not in echo, but in answer"—offers a resonant non-literal close. However, the hooded figure's dialogue ("They are proof that even in silence, something remains") edges toward thematic summary. The seashell's symbolic recurrence charges the ending without the piece over-relying on it mid-story.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present but not character-particular; phrases like "reed-blown melancholy" and "webs of intrigue" feel imposed rather than earned through Kael's idiom. Dialogue from the hooded figure is expository and lacks subtext. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("serpentine nexus," "progressive disclosure") without clear voice motivation. Free indirect style is clean where used.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Density is uneven: the opening paragraph front-loads metaphor ("stone coils like a sleeping serpent," "threads in the webs of intrigue") without pattern-teaching or payoff at closure. Template cadence appears in the middle section: "He began his ascent… He paused… He continued upward." The final paragraph loops the seashell motif cleanly. Clarity remains high and no causality is obscured, but overwriting in the first third and repetitive stems in the middle drag momentum. Propulsion recovers at the summit scene.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The canyon-echo-singer premise and seashell-as-cosmic-listener offer a fresh synthesis, but the hooded-figure-atop-standing-stones frame is stock fantasy. The explanation of echoes-as-trapped-stories is conceptually appealing yet arrives without a non-obvious moral calculus or risky choice. Emotional specificity in the final beat (canyon singing "in answer") elevates the ending. Transformation test is borderline: the arc of seeking-wisdom-from-a-guide could transfer to other settings with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Kael is present in all beats but makes no choice that alters tactics or forecloses a path. His ascent is goal-directed but unopposed. The decision to "keep singing" at the end is a continuation of prior behavior rather than a reversal. Setup and closure participation are present; middle development involves observation, not decision.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The whispering seashell half is handled in three distinct beats: pressed to ear at opening, pressed against the fissure wall to hear the voice, and held by the hooded figure to trigger the vision, then pressed to Kael's heart at closure. It enables the middle ascent choice and charges the final image. Irreplaceability is moderate; a similar "listening device" could substitute with edits. Cost linkage is indirect.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>Webs of intrigue is mentioned in the opening paragraph but never shapes stakes or tactics on the page. No intrigue or competing factions appear; the story is a solo quest for knowledge. The concept functions as thematic dressing without altering options or creating friction.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Richly perceptive is asserted in the opening line but not demonstrated through a choice or tradeoff. Kael hears the canyon's secrets and deciphers symbols, but no moment shows perception as a liability or enabling constraint. The trait is label-only without visible cost or enabling pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Ensure appears as Kael's stated motivation ("to ensure the truth would rise") and in the hooded figure's acknowledgment ("You've come to learn, to ensure the truth is heard"). The action does not create a major turn; Kael's singing at the end fulfills the stated goal but does not redefine options. Swappable with "discover" or "preserve" with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>Through progressive disclosure is mentioned in the opening paragraph ("a slow unraveling of the mysteries") but the mechanics do not shape attempts. The reveal arrives in a single exposition block from the hooded figure. The method is asserted rather than demonstrated through layered beats.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Serpentine nexus under starlight frames the entire story, providing vivid spatial anchors (ledge, fissure, summit, standing stones) that guide Kael's ascent. The setting supplies the fissure that enables the mid-story voice revelation and the summit circle that houses the closure. Micro-setting (shell, stone) alters tactics. Pressure is atmospheric rather than resource-based; no environmental constraint blocks or redirects a choice.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>1.9</grade><comment>While the universe hums its secret song bookends the story (opening and closing paragraphs) but does not tighten decisions or create urgency. The timeframe is descriptive mood rather than a tracked clock. No tactic changes due to temporal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>To learn why some people echo is stated early and pursued through the ascent and summit conversation. The motivation is dramatized in action (climbing, listening, asking) but lacks internal friction or competing desire. The hooded figure's answer satisfies the question without forcing Kael to pay a visible cost or confront a tradeoff. Setup, middle pursuit, and closure answer are present; conflicted choice is absent.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Reed-blown melancholy is named in the opening and sustained through diction ("each note a thread," "hum felt frayed") and the lullaby heard in the fissure. The tone coheres but does not modulate under pressure; the summit revelation and final singing maintain the same register. The final image ("canyon sing back") shifts from melancholy to answer, charging the close. Static through the middle section.</comment>
