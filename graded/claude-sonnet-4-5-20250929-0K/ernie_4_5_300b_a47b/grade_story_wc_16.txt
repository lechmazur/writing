<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to restore trust is clear and her work with languages embodied through concrete tasks (tracing spines, translating fragments). However, the character leans heavily on type—the ink-stained arcane linguist with a "carefully reckless" grin—without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The translation work functions more as symbolic parallel than genuine struggle; Henrik's midnight question about vulnerability arrives as externalized therapy rather than emerging from Elara's own friction. The final phone call to Mira feels resolved too smoothly given years of silence, with no visible cost or foreclosed path on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land cleanly in the opening paragraph. The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens: Elara's research discoveries (love letter, manuscript) pattern toward the call to Mira. However, the closure lacks felt cost—she simply calls, Mira answers warmly, and they agree to meet. The "river finally unblocked" is asserted rather than demonstrated through a renunciation or visible price. The research scenes function as illustrative work rather than because/therefore escalation; Henrik's midnight appearance and the restricted-section manuscript feel convenient rather than causally motivated.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The archive is vivid and specific: mothball scent, sagging shelves, brittle parchment, the glass ink well with runes. The setting supplies resources (the restricted manuscript, hydronyms, tax records) that enable Elara's research path. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout. However, the archive does not constrain a choice or complicate tactics; it functions primarily as atmospheric backdrop. The glass ink well recurs but operates as symbolic marker rather than a tool that alters options under pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—restoring trust with Mira—is signaled early via the crumpled invitation. Elara's research provides thematic deepening (the love letter's "Do not dam it with silence" mirrors her own situation), but this remains parallel illustration rather than escalation that narrows options. No on-page reversal or tightening choice forces a trade-off; the path from archive work to phone call is smooth and unobstructed. The ending offers no visible price: Mira answers readily, agrees to meet, and Elara's smile suggests resolution without cost. Coincidence (Henrik offering the sister manuscript at midnight) facilitates rather than complicates.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme—languages as trust, silence as blockage—emerges clearly through the love letter translation and the sisters' manuscript. The "symphonies of truth" and "interconnected promises" concepts thread through the research beats. However, the final passage directly states the theme ("Even when we're silent, our hearts speak in the language of belonging"), and Elara's phone explanation to Mira ("It's about… promises. And trust. And how even silence can be a kind of language") functions as overt thesis delivery. The ending smile and "river finally unblocked" resolve the question tidily rather than offering resonant ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-person limited on Elara; no head-hopping. The prose carries some texture ("labyrinth" mind, "lace"-like script) but drifts toward writerly abstraction ("symphonies of truth," "weaver of forgotten words") that flattens specificity. Dialogue feels goal-driven in Henrik's exchanges but Elara's final phone speech ("A symphony of truth. It's about… promises") sounds like pitch copy rather than lived speech under emotion. Filter verbs ("she thought," "she knew") appear frequently without voice motivation. The narrative maintains consistent psychic distance but lacks a perceptual signature that makes Elara's noticing feel character-particular.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The prose is generally clear with varied syntax and no major grammatical errors. However, several loops and scaffolds weaken density: "symphonies of truth" appears three times, "interconnected promises" twice, with identical phrasing. Template cadence runs appear ("She worked," "She'd been at it," "She packed," "She hung up"). Stock metaphors recur: "heart is a river," "dam it with silence," "river finally unblocked." The restricted-section manuscript reveal and Henrik's perfectly timed midnight appearance read as convenient staging. Information density is modest; several beats (the mead recipe, Cadogan descendant) illustrate method without advancing pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The premise—linguist translating extinct languages to repair sisterly silence—offers thematic resonance but follows a familiar template: work-obsessed professional neglects relationship, symbolic work provides epiphany, phone call initiates repair. The "via interconnected promises" research method (hydronyms → tax records → prayer book → mead → weddings) demonstrates ingenuity in the telling but functions as illustrative puzzle rather than high-stakes choice. The carefully reckless trait and glass ink well feel like assigned ornaments. No turn or final reconfiguration feels non-obvious; the emotional arc tracks a predictable redemption path without risk or subversion.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elara is on-page throughout and her translation work occupies multiple beats. However, her choices are largely observational (cross-referencing records, translating) rather than decisions that alter tactics or narrow options. The climactic choice—calling Mira—arrives smoothly without visible cost shaped by her arcane-linguist identity. The trait is present and functional but replaceable; a historian or archivist could follow the same arc with minor edits. Two gates clear (setup, closure cameo) but middle development lacks causal pressure tied specifically to her linguist skills under stress.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The glass ink well appears in three moments: opening desk description ("its surface etched with runes only she could decipher"), midnight scene ("half-empty"), and final packing ("clutched in her hand," "runes glowing faintly"). All three mentions are static description; the object is never used on the page (no writing, no action enabled by its presence). The "runes only she could decipher" detail is never dramatized or leveraged. It functions as inherited symbolic marker (grandmother's relic) without reweighted meaning at closure; the glow in the final line is decorative. Setup and closure cameo achieve two gates but no middle development and no causal work.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The "symphonies of truth" concept is named in Elara's realization ("languages weren't just tools… they were harmonies") and recurs in her phone explanation to Mira. It frames her thematic lens but does not constrain tactics or alter options on the page. The research beats (cross-referencing records, translating manuscripts) proceed via standard archival method; "symphonies" remains metaphorical overlay rather than operational principle that changes how she works. Setup and thematic echo achieve two gates but the concept does not drive a middle turn or shape the closure choice with cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>The "carefully reckless" attribute is labeled twice: opening paragraph ("Her carefully reckless nature had led her here") and response to Henrik ("her carefully reckless grin"). Neither instance demonstrates visible cost or tradeoff on the page. The trait does not constrain a choice or enable a risky move under pressure; it functions as characterization shorthand. The phone call at the end could read as cautiously bold but the text does not tie that action explicitly to this attribute. Present as label but ornamental in execution.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Unsnarl" appears structurally: Elara "unsnarled the first knot" (the love letter) and later "unsnarled it via interconnected promises" (the sisters' manuscript). Both beats are central to her arc and occupy substantial page time. The action is specific to her work and not easily swappable. However, the unsnarling itself is summary-level; we are told she cross-referenced and translated but do not witness tactical friction or failure. The ending hinges on the unsnarled manuscripts providing thematic epiphany rather than the act of unsnarling creating a turn with cost. Three gates met but causal pressure is modest.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The "via interconnected promises" method is signaled mid-story ("She worked via interconnected promises") and illustrated through the love letter chain (river → hydronyms → tax record → Cadogan → prayer book → mead → weddings → vows → trust). The mechanics are shown in one extended example and the method shapes her research tactics. However, it does not create friction or narrow options; each link lands smoothly. The method is specific and not easily swappable but functions more as thematic demonstration than high-stakes constraint. Two gates clear (middle development, thematic payoff) but closure participation is indirect.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The extinct language archive is established immediately and anchors all action: shelves, desk lamp, Henrik as curator, restricted section accessed by key. The setting supplies essential resources (manuscripts, tax records, prayer book) that enable Elara's research path and the restricted-section reveal. It recurs in the final invitation ("Meet me at the archive"). However, the archive does not pressure a choice or impose constraint; it functions as richly described but passive container. Three gates met (setup, middle resources, closure location) and specificity is high, but the setting does not alter tactics or complicate under stress.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The "before paths diverge" timeframe appears in opening context (Mira's wedding invitation) and closing line ("Meet me at the archive… before paths diverge"). The wedding is imminent but no on-page clock tightens Elara's choices; she works "through the night" and "by dawn" but without visible time pressure or deadline friction. The timeframe provides thematic framing (act before estrangement becomes permanent) but does not constrain tactics or escalate urgency. Two gates (setup, closure echo) but the time element remains static backdrop rather than live pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Elara's motivation—"to restore trust after years of silence"—is signaled early (crumpled invitation, years of ignored calls) and drives the dominant stake throughout. The research beats (translating the love letter's "Do not dam it with silence") mirror her situation and Henrik's question ("Do you trust enough to be vulnerable?") forces brief reflection. The motivation culminates in the phone call to Mira. However, the friction between want and cost is minimal; Elara moves smoothly from realization to action without visible sacrifice or foreclosed path. Three gates met with solid causal thread but the final choice lacks felt price.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The tone blends caution (Elara's years of avoidance, hesitant phone call) and exuberance (the archive "hummed," "reckless precision," final smile of relief). The phrase "cautious exuberance" appears once directly ("her tone a blend of caution and exuberance"). Tone modulates appropriately: scholarly focus during translation, tightness when confronting silence, warmth at closure. However, the blend feels more alternating (cautious in some beats, exuberant in others) than simultaneous. The final image leans heavily toward exuberance ("river finally unblocked," "alive with the ghosts") without the counterweight of ongoing caution or cost. Setup and closure presence achieve two gates but coherence under pressure is moderate.</comment>
