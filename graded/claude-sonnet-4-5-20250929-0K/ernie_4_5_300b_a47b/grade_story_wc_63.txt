<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lirael's role and dedication are clearly established, and her grandfather's wisdom provides some depth. However, her interiority relies heavily on abstract resolve ("ethically diligent mind") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The climax choice—pressing her palm to the bob and whispering the inscription—feels more ritualistic than earned by competing impulses; we see her steady execution but not the internal cost or friction that would make the moment irreversible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece operates under a Situational/Accumulative hybrid lens: the Hush creates coherent pressure, and the rake inscription deepens Lirael's understanding, leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration when she restores the pendulum's swing. Closure lands on the page with visible relief (ridge cracks sealing, tide surging gently), and the cost is legible in her "raw hands" and the embodied struggle. The structure is clean—single POV, continuous scene—but the escalation is more additive than causal; the solution arrives through recognition rather than a choice that forecloses alternatives.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The tidal obsidian ridge is vivid and integral: its shuddering and cracking directly pressure Lirael's task, and the algae-covered rake handle becomes a functional object. Sensory detail is strong ("slick with salt and time," "air thickening like syrup") and filtered through Lirael's professional attention. The tower and ridge constrain her choices and charge the final image when the obsidian seals "smooth as glass," meeting the 9+ gate requirement.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—restoring the pendulum to prevent chaos—is signaled early and remains coherent. Pressure escalates when the Hush deepens and Lirael aligns the rake handle with the bob's runes, a meaningful tightening. However, the resolution lacks a visible trade-off or foreclosed path; the bob simply "remembers its purpose" without Lirael sacrificing an option or enduring a cost that alters her stance. The ending relief feels consequential but not earned through a high-stakes choice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The theme of incremental absolution emerges organically through the inscription, the grandfather's teaching, and Lirael's patient correction. The final image—cracks sealing, tide surging in relief—offers a resonant answer to the question of balance without stating a moral. The rake inscription and rune glow accumulate meaning across beats. A minor slip: "tiny, persistent acts that held the world together" in the final paragraph edges toward thematic summary, though it remains rooted in Lirael's embodied experience.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and close, with strong perceptual signature ("her face fractured into a thousand pieces," "the air thickening like syrup"). Diction remains consistent with Lirael's focused, patient mindset. One minor slip: "searing reverie that clouded her vision" feels slightly overwritten for the moment's clarity, and the phrase "ethically diligent mind" is more label than lived texture. No head-hopping; psychic distance is controlled throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear and rhythmically varied, with strong imagery ("blackened spine," "scales"). However, several artifacts lower the score: "ethically diligent mind" is abstract register drift; "her throat tightened" is a stock gesture; "the bob itself were remembering" uses passive construction where active would sharpen. The final paragraph's "her heart light" and "tiny, persistent acts" edge into summary where a concrete image would serve better. Density is solid but not exceptional; some lines do only one job.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The tidal ridge and clock tower premise is striking, and the rake inscription as a message from a predecessor adds a fresh angle. However, the core situation—restoring balance through a ritual object—leans on familiar mystical-task templates. The inscribed rake and rune alignment feel more symbolic convenience than lived specificity; we don't see why this exact method works, only that it does. Emotional truth is present but not deeply individuated; Lirael's journey could transfer to a different setting with minor adjustments.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lirael's role as clock tower winder frames all her choices: she climbs the ridge, traces the tower's veins, interprets the inscription, and enacts the restoration. Her decision to use the rake handle and press her palm to the bob drives the climax. The character is causally active in setup, middle, and closure, with visible cost (raw hands, embodied struggle).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The pendulum bob appears in the opening (stalled mid-swing), is central to Lirael's diagnosis ("The bob's arrest wasn't mechanical"), is handled at the tower when she aligns the rake carvings with its runes, and its stirring and swing constitute the climax and closure. Its "iron surface scarred by centuries" and rune glow are specific, irreplaceable details that drive the resolution.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Incremental absolution" is inscribed on the rake, echoed in the grandfather's teaching ("a dance"), and enacted when Lirael whispers the words and the bob stirs "in a slow, deliberate arc." The concept shapes her understanding and tactic (patience over force), but its mechanics remain abstract; we don't see how small acts accumulate pressure on the page, only that the final act succeeds. Present in all three gates but more thematic than tactical.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Ethically diligent" is mentioned once as a label ("her ethically diligent mind rejecting haste") but never constrains a choice with visible cost. Lirael's patience is shown through her nights of tracing and her steady execution, but the attribute itself doesn't create friction or enable a specific on-page action. Functional but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>"Emerge" anchors the closing beat ("Lirael emerged from the tower at dusk") and signals the resolution: she returns to the villagers, the pendulum swings, the cracks seal. The action is causally tied to the restoration and redefines the situation from crisis to relief. It also bookends her earlier climb ("Lirael climbed its glassy slopes"), charging the final image with earned return. Removing "emerge" would require structural rewrite.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The broken rake handle with tiny inscriptions is discovered mid-scene, its carved message ("Incremental absolution is the tide's true tide") guides Lirael's understanding, and she places it against the bob to align the carvings with the runes at the climax. The method is signaled, handled, and causally active in the resolution. One friction: the mechanics of why the alignment works remain mystical rather than dramatized, but the specificity (rake + runes) is irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The tidal obsidian ridge pressures every beat: its cracking during the Hush creates urgency, the algae-covered surface yields the rake, its humming resonates in Lirael's bones, and its cracks sealing smooth constitutes the closure image. The ridge is not postcard description but a dynamic force that supplies the tool, embodies the problem, and registers the solution. Essential to stakes and closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The pause in the pendulum's swing creates the Hush, frames the entire crisis ("the pendulum's pause lengthened"), and Lirael acts "during the pause" when she presses her palm to the bob. The timeframe tightens her window and is explicitly invoked at the climax. One friction: the duration of the pause isn't tracked with a live clock, so urgency is asserted more than felt. Still, it shapes tactics and participates in closure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Restoring balance is Lirael's explicit goal from the opening ("her duty was to restart the swing before chaos seeped in"), dramatized through her climb, diagnosis, and ritual act. The motivation is tested when the Hush deepens and she feels "the ridge's pain," creating friction between her steady resolve and the embodied cost. The final relief (villagers' worry, her raised hand, sealed cracks) confirms the stakes were real and shared.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Searing reverie" appears once ("the searing reverie that clouded her vision") at the climax, modulating the tone toward mystical intensity. Elsewhere, the prose is steady and patient, matching Lirael's professional focus. The tone shifts purposefully under pressure but doesn't pervade or charge the final image, which resolves to relief and light ("her heart light," "gentle pulses"). Present in one key beat but not woven through turns.</comment>
