<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear (protect father, secure asylum) but her shift from hiding to confrontation feels unmotivated—no on-page pressure or micro-choice forces her to step out. The ink pot's "clarity" effect reads as convenient mind-reading without embodied cost or trade-off. Her confidence in the negotiation lacks internal friction or visible doubt under extreme stress. The agents' capitulation after one conversation spanning "the next hour" (told, not shown) undercuts earned change.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Orientation anchors within 120 words (funeral home, Elara hiding, agents arrive). Closure unit is a Decisive Change (asylum secured, corrupt system to be dismantled) but the agents' reversal lacks on-page causality—they go from guns drawn to promising systemic reform in a single elided hour. The dummy-in-casket reveal is a setup paid off, but it doesn't narrow Elara's options or impose cost; she already controlled the scroll. Cost at closure is asserted ("find the mathematics of a fair trade") but not felt on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Funeral home prep room is anchored early (lilies, mahogany casket, fluorescent lights) and the casket is used as physical cover and reveal-prop. Spatial choreography is clear. However, the setting does not constrain Elara's choices—she could negotiate anywhere. The prep room functions as backdrop rather than pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (asylum for Elara and her father) is signaled early. One reversal occurs (Elara steps out, reveals the dummy) but it's a reveal rather than a tightening born of her agency—she had control all along. The agents' guns-to-negotiation shift lacks on-page escalation or visible trade-off. The one-hour negotiation is summarized ("she traded the scroll for asylum papers") without dramatized cost or friction, so the escalation curve flattens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Theme of systemic fairness versus corruption emerges through the "mathematics of equity" premise. The final image ("find the mathematics of a fair trade") restates theme rather than answering it through particulars. Elara's insight that "you're scared" tells rather than shows power dynamics. The ending's promise to "make sure no one ever has to fake their death again" reads as explicit moralizing rather than earned resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited on Elara. Diction is generally clear, though "liquefying rigid thinking" and "mood ring" mix registers awkwardly. Dialogue carries goal pursuit (Elara demands asylum) but agents' speech lacks distinct idiom—both agents sound identical. The phrase "waiting actively—not passively, but alert" in the final paragraph over-explains the method rather than trusting the image.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Paraphrase loop: "Trust the math, kid" and later "No body. No crime. Just math" recycle the same beat without deepening. Template cadence in the setup: "Her father had taught her... Her father had said... Her father's last lesson echoed." Figurative muddle: ink pot liquid as mood ring, then chemistry, then mind-reading clarity—three incompatible metaphors. The "next hour" summary is scaffold that substitutes for scene. Clarity is mostly maintained but density suffers.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Core premise (child of con artist uses inherited tool to outwit government agents) is functional but derivative of heist and YA thriller templates. The ink pot's shifting properties (mood ring, chemistry, mind-reading) read as convenient rather than internally consistent. "Mathematics of equity" as MacGuffin is abstract and underdeveloped. The funeral home setting and dummy-in-casket are familiar tricks. No inflection feels inevitable in hindsight; the resolution depends on agents' off-page compliance rather than a synthesis of prior particulars.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara (con artist's honest child) is present throughout and her honesty contrasts her father's deception. She makes two key choices: stepping out from hiding and trading the scroll for asylum. However, her honesty does not constrain her—she uses deception (withholding the scroll) as leverage, so the "honest" trait is more label than driver. Present in closure but does not create a key turn; her agency is diluted by the agents' convenient capitulation.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Ink pot appears in opening (Elara's fingers tighten around it), middle (she unscrews top, tastes ink, gains "clarity"), and ending (she clutches it leaving). It enables her to "see the agents' thoughts," a functional beat. However, its mechanics shift (mood ring → chemistry → mind-reading) without coherent rules, reducing irreplaceability—any "insight tool" could substitute. Not indispensable, but shapes two beats and is present at closure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Political asylum is the dominant stake, named early ("secure political asylum for her father") and drives Elara's tactics (withholding scroll, demanding papers). The ending delivers asylum documents on the page. However, the concept does not constrain her approach or impose visible cost—negotiation is summarized, agents comply off-page. Essential to goal structure but the mechanics of asylum as a legal/political pressure are not dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Liquefies rigid thinking" is described as the ink pot's effect when "those who dared sip it" use it, but only Elara tastes it on-page. The result is convenient clarity (she "saw the agents' thoughts") rather than a visible trade-off or constraint. The trait is labeled ("liquefying rigid thinking") but its mechanics are vague and do not shape a costly choice. Mentioned and functional in one beat, but swappable with any "insight potion."</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Breach" appears in two senses: Elara's plan to "breach the funeral home's secrets" and her declaration "it's a breach point" when revealing the dummy. The action of stepping out from hiding and confronting the agents is a turn, but "breach" itself is more metaphorical than mechanical—she could "confront" or "reveal" with identical effect. Present at closure metaphorically ("breach of all") but not irreplaceable as an action verb.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Waiting actively" is introduced early ("Wait actively. Let the world come to you") and Elara counts seconds while hiding. The method is named again in the final act ("waiting actively was the boldest breach of all"). However, the mechanics are not demonstrated—Elara steps out on her own timing, not in response to an opening the agents provide. The method is labeled and framed but does not shape her tactics on the page; she acts assertively rather than waiting for leverage.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Funeral home prep room is anchored early (lilies, mahogany casket, fluorescent lights) and provides the dummy-in-casket reveal location. Elara hides behind the casket, a spatial choice. However, the setting does not constrain her negotiation or enable a resource she couldn't access elsewhere. The prep room stages the scene but does not pressure the outcome. Present across beats and at closure but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>N/A</grade>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Find the mathematics of a fair trade" is stated as the father's goal and Elara's closing promise. It frames the stakes (scroll of equations, threat to powerful interests) and motivates her demand for asylum. However, the desire is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choices—Elara never hesitates or trades fairness against survival. The motivation is asserted and present at closure but not embodied in friction or visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Deathly vitality" is not coherently maintained. The opening invokes death imagery (funeral home, faked death, casket) but Elara's narration is straightforward and explanatory rather than charged with morbid energy. The tone does not modulate with pressure—her confidence remains steady rather than intensifying. The closing image ("scent of lilies and the echo of a con artist's honest child") gestures toward the phrase but does not earn it through tonal arc. Static rather than charged.</comment>
