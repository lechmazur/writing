<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Lirael's motivation (renewal of fading constellations) is declared but her interior life remains abstract and label-dependent. The dance sequences describe movement but lack embodied contradiction or micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values under pressure. Emotional states are asserted ("her heart full of obsidian grace") rather than dramatized through specific perception and action. The final choice to linger feels unearned because no prior scene shows her weighing competing costs or forfeiting a live option.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first paragraph. The piece attempts a causal arc—steal dust, dance, inscribe verse—but the closure unit lacks visible cost: Lirael completes her goal without dramatized trade-off or consequence that alters her options. The nostalgia ban is declared but never tests her on the page; she dances, writes, and walks away with only the abstract promise that "the verse will fade by dawn." No meaningful tightening or narrowing of choices occurs, rendering the ending a summary rather than a resonant reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The twilight garden is vividly rendered with luminescent mist, pulsing moss, and star-spangled canopy. Sensory detail is selective and atmospheric, though it remains largely decorative. The moss and stylus constrain one action each (kneeling, writing), but the environment does not materially shape tactics or force a choice. Spatial choreography is clear throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake (renewing her skin's constellations) is signaled early but never tested by meaningful opposition or cost. Lirael performs each step—stealing, dancing, inscribing—without friction, adaptation, or trade-off. The nostalgia ban "wavers" without consequence, and her elective exile means she faces no enforceable pressure. No on-page reversal or tightening narrows her options; the resolution declares success without dramatized price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Theme (the tension between abandonment and rootedness, cosmos and earth) is declared through exposition ("to fledge and anchor") rather than emerging from dramatized choices. The nostalgia ban and elective exile remain abstract backdrops; no concrete action tests their cost. The final image ("her heart full of obsidian grace") restates the premise without reweighting it. Thematic statements replace scene pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The third-person limited POV is stable and the prose carries a consistent lyric register. However, diction often drifts into elevated abstraction ("a study in contradictions," "the in-between") that feels writerly rather than character-rooted. Perceptual signature is generic; Lirael's way of noticing does not reveal specific priorities or biases. Filter verbs ("she knew," "she felt") cluster in reflective passages without voice motivation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout without pattern-teaching or payoff: "cosmic verse," "obsidian grace," "celestial cloak," "map of constellations." Mixed metaphors appear ("mist that pulsed like a second heartbeat" beside "darkness that shimmered like polished onyx"). Paraphrase loops recur: the fledge is defined three times in similar terms without adding pressure. Template cadence runs ("She was a tide dancer…," "She began her dance…," "She stood…") flatten rhythm. Register drift into abstract philosophical diction ("the fabric of the garden," "the infinite") clashes with embodied action.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The premise (forbidden cosmic inscription by a tide dancer) combines familiar fantasy elements—mystical art form, oppressive decree, stolen relic—without a transforming angle. The nostalgia ban is not dramatized as enforceable threat, rendering it ornamental. The elective exile means Lirael chooses her isolation, removing the tension between desire and cost. Transformation test: the emotional arc (seeking renewal, performing forbidden act, accepting impermanence) could transfer to many settings without loss.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Lirael is present throughout and performs the dance, but her skill as a tide dancer is described rather than tested by meaningful opposition or adaptation. She executes each move without visible struggle or trade-off, so the attribute shapes atmosphere more than choice.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The moonstone dust appears in three beats: Lirael holds it, presses it to her collarbone, and it dissolves after the verse is complete. It enables the inscription but does not constrain choice or return with reweighted meaning. The dust resolves a problem it did not help create, and its mechanics are asserted rather than tested.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Elective exile is declared in the final third as a thematic label ("Her exile was elective") but does not shape on-page stakes or tactics. Because the exile is chosen rather than imposed, it lacks causal pressure. The concept is told, not dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"Spontaneously anchored" is introduced mid-story as a descriptor of the fledge dance: "Lirael was spontaneously anchored, her feet rooted in the moss even as her spirit soared." It explains the dual state but does not constrain a choice or create visible cost. The attribute is present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The fledge (dance of abandonment and ascent) is introduced early, performed in the central beat, and revisited at closure ("She had fledged and anchored"). It drives the middle sequence and is inseparable from Lirael's goal. However, the act is described rather than tested by opposition, limiting causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Observing gaps" is introduced in the dance: "She observed the gaps between breaths, the pauses between heartbeats, the silence between notes." The method is named but its mechanics do not materially alter tactics or outcomes. It functions as atmospheric detail rather than constraining tool.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The twilight garden is vividly established in the opening and remains the continuous setting. The moss provides tactile grounding (kneeling) and the stars shift at closure, but the garden does not constrain choice or supply resources that alter outcome. Strong atmospheric presence without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The nostalgia ban is introduced early ("three cycles ago") and revisited at closure, but it does not tighten decisions or tactics on the page. The decree is declared but never enforced; Lirael violates it without immediate consequence. Time is framed but not pressured.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The motivation to pen a cosmic verse is declared early ("her skin, etched with fading constellations, ached for renewal") and drives the middle and final beats. Lirael completes the inscription at closure. However, the desire is told rather than dramatized through conflicting choices or visible friction, and the cost is abstract ("the verse would fade by dawn").</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Obsidian grace" appears in two beats: "The garden's air hummed with obsidian grace" and the closing line, "her heart full of obsidian grace." The tone is lyric and elevated throughout, cohering across turns. The reprise charges the final image but does not modulate with pressure or embody visible cost, remaining a thematic label.</comment>
