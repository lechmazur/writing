<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to expose Cole is clear, but her internal process relies heavily on label-driven interiority ("watchfully calm" repeated without embodied contradiction). The lantern visions provide moments of embodied pressure, but the final stance—"done being controlled"—arrives without visible cost or foreclosed path on the page. Secondary characters (Cole, Eliza) exist only in summary or vision, never applying immediate pressure in scene. The climactic decision to "expose his secrets" is declared rather than dramatized with micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story establishes a causal lens: Mara investigates, lights the lantern, receives visions, discovers files, resolves to act. Orientation anchors arrive early (who, where, when). However, closure lacks visible cost—Mara's decision to expose Cole is announced in final-paragraph summary ("She'd use the lantern one last time... through empirical observation") rather than shown through an on-page action that forecloses a path. The "done being controlled" stance reads as Charged Poise, but the price (professional risk, loss of the lantern's power, confrontation consequences) remains offstage. Cost proof test fails: no exact sentence shows what Mara sacrifices or loses in the ending beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The subway tunnel is grounded with concrete sensory detail (mildew, old metal, slick walls, stagnant water) and the lantern's light creates atmosphere throughout. The hidden compartment provides a spatial goal that constrains Mara's movement. However, the tunnel does not meaningfully alter tactics or charge the final image—Mara's resolve could form in any location. The lantern (object-as-setting) recurs but its physical properties (brass, flame pulse) do not constrain a choice at closure. Train rumble in the final beat is atmospheric but does not shift stakes.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (expose Cole's cover-up) is signaled early and pursued consistently. The discovery of classified files constitutes a meaningful tightening that narrows options. However, escalation is cognitive (Mara realizes Cole manipulated her) rather than enacted through on-page choice under pressure. The final beat declares intent ("She'd expose his secrets") but does not dramatize the decision's cost or trade-off. No visible price paid; no foreclosed alternative shown. The stake remains abstract ("justice") without a concrete on-page test that forces Mara to sacrifice something specific.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Theme of memory as weapon versus chain emerges through the lantern's dual function. The piece attempts complexity (Mara sees herself "not as a victim, but as a survivor"), but the final paragraph lapses into near-thesis statement: "she'd use the lantern... not to entangle herself in the past, but to sever the threads... through empirical observation—the cold, hard facts he couldn't refute." This thematic echo restates the premise in prompt-like language rather than letting the final image resonate. The Eliza vision (courage, defiance) is gestural rather than causally integrated into Mara's present choice. Subtext is limited; most conflict is internalized and explained.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-person limited throughout. Mara's perceptual signature is moderately consistent (investigator lens on corrosion, stress fractures) but lapses into elevated register during visions ("reverberating in Mara's skull," "fierce, unyielding thing"). Psychic distance shifts are purposeful during lantern flares. However, the final paragraph over-explains Mara's resolve in summary rather than trusting scene work. Filter verbs ("she felt the weight," "she saw," "she knew") stack in high-pressure beats without voice justification, dulling immediacy. No dialogue on the page to assess naturalism or subtext.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear with moderate momentum, but several artifact patterns accumulate. Template cadence runs: "She'd been told... but Mara knew better," "She'd always been... but now she felt," "She'd use... not to entangle... but to sever." Paraphrase loop: "The lantern's memories weren't a gift—they were a chain" immediately follows "she'd been a pawn in someone else's game." Stock metaphors cluster without fresh specificity: "smooth as oil," "writhe like living things," "fierce, unyielding thing." Filter-verb stacks in peak beats ("she felt," "she saw," "she knew") dull immediacy. Figurative density in the final third (tunnel shrinks, walls press, flame blazes) reads effortful without clear payoff. Apply patterned-artifact penalty: −1.0 in Q7 for template cadence, paraphrase loop, and stock metaphor concentration across the ending.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The premise (investigator with memory-channeling lantern uncovers supervisor's conspiracy) follows a recognizable investigative-thriller template without transforming it through lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The lantern's historical Underground Railroad provenance is ornamental rather than thematically integrated—Eliza's courage does not causally shape Mara's present choice. "Entangled memories" and "empirical observation" coexist as prompt elements rather than synthesizing into a fresh angle. The climactic realization (Cole used the lantern to manipulate her) arrives through convenient discovery (hidden files) rather than earned investigation. Derivative premise guardrail applies: −0.8 for template adherence without transformation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Mara (preventable death investigator) is present throughout and her occupation frames her investigative lens (checking hinges, stress fractures). She makes two decisions: lighting the lantern and resolving to expose Cole. However, neither choice alters tactics with visible cost—the final decision is declared in summary rather than enacted. Her investigative work (empirical observation) is announced as method but not dramatized in the ending. Functional role, but decisions do not create key turns with on-page consequences. Setup present, middle development weak, closure participation is summary-only. Cap at 4.6 for missing dramatized middle development; lift slightly for setup and occupation integration to 4.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The lantern appears in four beats: introduction (paragraph 1), lighting (paragraph 4), second flare (paragraph 9), final blazing (paragraph 11). Its physical properties (brass frame, flickering flame pulsing with heartbeat, symbols) are established early. It enables two visions (Eliza, young Cole) that provide knowledge. However, its use is passive—Mara lights it and receives visions; she does not manipulate it tactically. The final beat ("lantern's flame sputtered, then steadied") accompanies her resolve but does not causally shape the decision. Reweighted meaning is declared ("not a gift—a chain") but this insight does not alter her use of it. Setup strong (+0.8), two distinct beats (+0.9), closure linkage present but weak (+0.4), swappability moderate (−0.5 for generic magical-object function). Lands at 6.2.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Entangled memories (core concept) shapes stakes: Mara seeks to understand the lantern's visions and realizes Cole manipulated her through them. The concept provides the knowledge turn (discovering Cole's prior use). However, "entangled" as a specific mechanism is under-dramatized—memories simply "project fragments" without clear rules or cost. The concept does not constrain tactics (Mara lights the lantern without consequence). Setup present (paragraph 1), middle development weak (visions inform but do not force choice), closure linkage moderate (Mara decides to "sever the threads"). Functional but not deeply causal. Lands at 5.1.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Watchfully calm" appears three times as a label (paragraphs 3, 6, 11) but is not embodied through contradictory action or visible tradeoff. Mara's calmness does not constrain her—she investigates methodically, but no beat shows her suppressing panic or choosing observation over reaction with cost. The trait is told rather than enacted. Ornamental use (−0.8), label-only (−0.6), no visible cost tied to the trait (−0.5). Lands at 3.2.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>"Reverberate" appears twice: Eliza's voice "reverberating in Mara's skull" (paragraph 5) and Cole's voice "reverberating through time" (paragraph 9). The action describes the lantern's memory transmission but does not drive major turns—those turns arise from Mara's realization (cognitive) rather than the reverberation itself. Swappable with "echo" or "resonate" with minor edits. Functional but not indispensable. Setup present, weak beat involvement, no closure participation beyond atmospheric mention. Lands at 4.4.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Empirical observation" is declared twice: paragraph 3 ("Mara's empirical observation told her otherwise") and paragraph 11 ("through empirical observation—the cold, hard facts"). However, the method is not shown—Mara's investigation involves lighting the lantern for visions, not systematic evidence collection. The files she discovers are convenient plot devices, not the result of empirical process. The method is told at closure rather than enacted. Setup weak (mentioned in passing), no middle development, closure participation is declaration-only. Missing dramatized setup and middle; cap at 2.8.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The subway maintenance tunnel is present throughout, grounded with concrete detail (rusted ladder, grated floor, slick walls, stagnant water, hidden compartment). It supplies the investigation goal (checking for hazards) and contains the key discovery (files). However, it does not constrain tactics—Mara moves freely without spatial pressure. The tunnel's physical properties (cracks, leaks, collapsing panel in backstory) frame her occupation but do not alter her final choice. Setup strong (+0.8), one beat involvement (file discovery, +0.4), weak closure linkage (+0.2), does not constrain choice (−0.6). Lands at 5.9.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"After the drought ends" is mentioned twice (paragraphs 2, 2) and provides context (renewed water pressure, groaning infrastructure, tunnels as "labyrinth of hidden dangers"). However, this timeframe does not tighten decisions or create urgency—Mara's investigation proceeds without time pressure. The drought's end is atmospheric backdrop rather than causal force. Setup present, no middle development tied to time, no closure participation. Functional context but replaceable. Lands at 3.6.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Mara's motivation (to break free from Cole's controlling influence) is signaled early (paragraph 2: "motivation to break free... had grown sharper") and drives the investigation. The discovery of files dramatizes the extent of control. However, the final break is declared ("She was done being controlled") rather than enacted through a specific choice with visible cost. Friction between want (justice) and cost (professional risk, loss of lantern access) is implied but not shown. Setup strong (+0.8), two beats (realization paragraphs 7–9, resolve paragraph 11, +0.9), closure linkage moderate (+0.5), cost visibility weak (−0.6). Lands at 6.4.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Fortified vulnerability" as tone is attempted through Mara's "watchfully calm" stance and her exposure to visions that "press in" while she remains grounded. However, the tone does not modulate meaningfully under pressure—Mara maintains consistent resolve throughout without contradictory impulses or visible fragility. The final image ("Mara didn't flinch") asserts fortification but does not charge vulnerability. Tone is more uniformly determined than layered. Functional but static. Lands at 4.7.</comment>
