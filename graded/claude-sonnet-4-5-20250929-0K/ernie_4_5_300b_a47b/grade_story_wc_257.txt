<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation (atonement for failing to save his wife) is clear and his ritual work is embodied through concrete actions—folding origami, lighting lanterns, tracing the stencil. However, his interior remains largely declarative rather than contradictory; the prose tells us he "sought to redeem himself" without showing impulses that pull against this goal. The final turn—wearing the pendant and understanding rock bottom as foundation—arrives as epiphany rather than earned through on-page struggle. Emotional progression reads as smooth ascent without the irrational friction that would raise the score into the 7+ band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes orientation (Elias, observatory, post-loss timeframe) within the opening and holds a hybrid lens blending Accumulative (curtains ritual, origami accrual) and Causal (his nightly work leads to the pendant closure). The ending offers Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias reweights grief as "refracted—not diminished, but transformed" and the final inscription "Light the way" charges prior imagery. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral—he empties his pockets of origami, his hands bleed—but the price feels abstract; no live option is foreclosed on the page. The closure lands but without sharp felt consequence, capping the score in the mid-6s.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The observatory is vividly rendered—rusted telescopes, yellowed charts, glass dome with constellation etchings—and the stencil's alignment with the dome creates a purposeful spatial constraint. The lanterns, vellum, and origami are handled across beats. However, the setting functions primarily as atmospheric backdrop; no environmental feature narrows a choice or supplies a tactical resource that alters outcome. The micro-objects (stencil, lanterns) charge the final image but do not constrain agency in a way that would push the score above 6.5.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Elias's need to atone by mending others' grief—is signaled early but remains declarative. Pressure is announced ("subdued thrill," "burning certainty") rather than dramatized through reversals or forced trade-offs. The night's work (folding cranes, adjusting lanterns) reads as ritual execution without complication; no live obstacle tests his commitment or narrows options. The ending reconfigures his understanding, but the path from hollowed shadow to steady hands is smooth summary, not escalation with visible cost. One meaningful tightening is absent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme—grief as light that can be refracted, the art of mending what cannot be unbroken—emerges through the curtains ritual, the stencil motif, and the coordinates tucked into origami. The final image (pendant with vellum sliver, inscription "Light the way") reweights prior material without stating a moral. However, the piece leans toward thematic assertion: "The curtains of intention were not a cure for grief, but a language for it" reads as authorial summary rather than inference from particulars. The rock-bottom-as-foundation conclusion borders on platitude, preventing entry into the 7.5+ band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Elias; no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and consistent ("mercury," "ardor," "twilight"), though at peak beats the prose edges toward literary ornament ("grief had hollowed him into a shadow of his former self"). Free indirect style is clean. However, perceptual signature is generic; the narrative does not filter the observatory or ritual through Elias's jeweler's eye in character-specific ways. Dialogue is absent. The voice is competent and controlled but lacks the idiosyncratic texture that would justify 7.5+.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is high in descriptive passages. However, line-level artifacts accumulate: paraphrase loops ("the curtains of intention" appears as summary in three adjacent paragraphs without added pressure), synonym churn ("mourning jewelry maker" / "mourning jewelry" / "pendant"), and scaffold phrasing ("He realized, with a subdued thrill" / "his heart full of a quiet, burning certainty"). The final paragraph stacks conceptual restatements: "not an end but a foundation—a place to build curtains, to fold cranes, to illuminate the dark" reads as list rather than propulsion. Template cadence ("He had failed... he sought... he'd learned") across multiple beats. Baseline −0.8 for loops, −0.4 for scaffold, routing to Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The premise—grief-stricken artisan creates light-based portals to guide strangers to origami coordinates—combines familiar elements (mourning craftsman, symbolic objects, redemptive mission) in a moderately fresh synthesis. The "curtains of intention" and tattoo-stencil projection offer some ingenuity. However, the emotional arc (despair → ritual work → realization → renewed purpose) follows a well-worn template. The ending—wearing a pendant, smiling, ardor burning brighter—resolves into safe uplift without risk or ambiguity. Transformation test: swap observatory for lighthouse, stencil for compass rose, and the arc holds unchanged. Derivative Premise Guardrail: −0.8 for template emotional journey without lived specificity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elias is present throughout and his ritual actions (tracing stencil, folding origami, lighting lanterns, crafting pendant) span multiple beats. However, his choices do not create key turns; the work proceeds as planned without complication. The final decision—to wear the pendant—is symbolic gesture rather than causal pivot. The character trait "mourning jewelry maker" supplies his craft but does not constrain or enable a pivotal choice with cost. Setup and development gates met; payoff gate weak. Functional but swappable with "grieving sculptor" or similar artisan role. Mid-band functional use, no causal pressure at closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The tattoo stencil on vellum appears in the opening (Elias traces it), is aligned with the dome to project the curtains (middle beat), and returns in the ending as a sliver worn in the pendant with the inscription "Light the way." Three beats; early signal; closure linkage present. The stencil's fractal design ("stars and roots") charges the final image and the shadows it casts become "invitations." However, the stencil does not narrow options or impose tactical constraint; it is used rather than confronted. The material (vellum) and the tattoo origin (found in wife's sewing box) do not alter tactics. Strong beat involvement and closure presence lift the score to mid-6s, but lack of causal pressure or felt cost caps it below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The "curtains of intention" concept is named and described repeatedly but functions as thematic label rather than dramatized mechanic. The curtains are projections of light; their creation involves lighting lanterns and aligning the stencil, but no on-page stakes hinge on whether the curtains succeed or fail. The ritual is presented as already effective ("the dome glowed," "travelers spoke of"), bypassing tension. The concept echoes at closure ("curtains of intention had shown him that grief... could be refracted") as summary rather than enacted cost. Present across beats but ornamental; no choice turns on the curtains' success. Functional mention without causal constraint; swappable with "beacon of hope" or similar metaphor.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>The attribute "genuinely artificial" appears once in the fourth paragraph as descriptor: "the genuinely artificial (the lanterns, the origami, the stencil itself) became a bridge." It is not dramatized as a trait that constrains or enables action; it is an authorial assertion about the ritual's nature. No on-page choice turns on artificiality versus authenticity. The attribute is ornamental and label-only. Present but does not shape tactics or closure; easily removed without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The action "illuminate" drives the central ritual: Elias lights the first lantern (beat), the beam casts shadows that shift and become "invitations" (development), and by dawn "the dome glowed like a second sky" (payoff). The illumination enables the curtains' projection and transforms the observatory into a beacon. The final pendant also catches this motif ("his subdued ardor burning brighter than any lantern"). Three beats; early signal; causal role in creating the curtains; closure linkage via the burning-light imagery. The action is specific and irreplaceable—"project" or "activate" would not carry the same sensory and symbolic weight. Strong integration across setup, development, and payoff; causal pressure present.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The method "leaving origami figures with coordinates inside" is introduced in paragraph three, executed during the night's work ("He worked through the night, folding cranes"), and mentioned at closure ("origami figures left like breadcrumbs," "his pockets empty of origami"). Three beats; early signal. However, the origami are created and dispersed without complication; no choice hinges on the folding or placement. The coordinates inside (Sahara, Syria, Japan) are told rather than shown affecting tactics. The method matters thematically (physical manifestation of atonement) but does not constrain agency or impose cost. Functional across beats but swappable with "letters" or "tokens" without major revision. Mid-band functional use.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The timeless observatory is vividly described and present throughout: perched atop a crumbling mountain, rusted telescopes, glass dome with constellations, cold stone floor. It provides the tools (lanterns, dome) that enable the curtains ritual. The setting charges the final image ("the observatory became a beacon"). However, the observatory does not constrain a choice or supply a tactical resource that alters outcome; Elias's work proceeds as planned. The dome's alignment with the stencil is setup rather than obstacle. Strong atmospheric presence and closure linkage, but no causal pressure or felt constraint. Solid integration shy of essential.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The timeframe "after hitting rock bottom" is signaled in the opening ("After hitting rock bottom, when grief had hollowed him") and reprised at closure ("rock bottom was not an end but a foundation"). It frames Elias's emotional arc from despair to renewal. However, the timeframe is past tense and declarative; no on-page clock or sequence tracks the recovery. The night's work is continuous but the story does not dramatize how proximity to rock bottom tightens decisions. The attribute provides emotional context but does not constrain present tactics. Functional framing; weak development and payoff; swappable with "after the funeral" or similar temporal marker.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The motivation "to teach withering to bloom again" is stated in paragraph two and echoed at closure ("in teaching withering to bloom again, he'd learned to speak it himself"). It drives the curtains ritual and the origami dispersal. However, the motivation is presented as resolved intent rather than conflicted desire; no on-page friction tests whether Elias prioritizes his own healing over others' or vice versa. The desire is told and enacted but not dramatized under pressure. Functional across beats; closure linkage present; but lacks the friction between want and cost that would justify 6.5+.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The tone "subdued ardor" is introduced in the opening's close-focus on the stencil and sustained through measured, elevated diction ("pooled like mercury," "quiet, burning certainty"). The tone modulates appropriately: restrained in the ritual description, slightly elevated at the discovery of shifting shadows ("subdued thrill"), and warming at closure ("his subdued ardor burning brighter"). The final line's smile and brighter ardor charge the ending. However, the tone remains static through pressure; no tonal shift marks escalation or complication. Coherent and purposeful but does not dynamically charge the closure under pressure. Mid-6 integration.</comment>
