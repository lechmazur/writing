<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's interior monologue is concrete and specific ("his serifed verses smooth as lies"), and the tycoon eulogy backstory generates genuine moral tension. However, his transformation from complicit calligrapher to subversive artist feels more asserted than dramatized—the puppet show itself proceeds smoothly without internal contradiction or visible cost in the moment. The "uncommonly serene" attribute functions as a label rather than a constraint that shapes choices under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land cleanly in the opening. The closure offers a Conceptual Repricing—"a campfire, flickering in the dark, inviting you to lean in"—that reweights the ethical-storytelling premise through image rather than statement. Cost is conceptual (accepting half-truths as "the only kind worth telling") but legible. The middle deepening (reversing the puppet roles, crowd laughter as release) provides one meaningful tightening under the accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The radar dome's "skeletal ribs piercing the dusk" and "curved floor" are vivid and specific. The dome's isolation and fractured light actively support Elias's thesis: "Because here, in the hush after an argument, people are raw." The story stick's glow and the projections onto the curved wall integrate setting into action. Spatial choreography (cross-legged audience, Elias kneeling, stepping into light) remains clear throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (exploring ethical storytelling through performance) is signaled early and sustained. The puppet-role reversal provides one meaningful tightening that shifts the crowd from skepticism to nervous laughter—a visible reaction. However, Elias's serene confidence never wavers; no live option is foreclosed, no tactical adjustment forced by resistance. The drifter's scoff is deflected, not engaged, so the escalation reads more as illustration than pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Theme (ethical storytelling as coexistence of dark and light) emerges through the puppet show's mechanics and the campfire metaphor. The closing image—"a campfire, flickering in the dark, inviting you to lean in"—offers resonance without stating a moral. However, Elias's final realization ("The ethical story...wasn't a tidy package") edges toward explicit thesis. The "half-truths are the only kind worth telling" line risks thematic echo, though it's delivered in dialogue rather than narration.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Elias. Voice is distinct: "Stories are thieves," "his serifed verses smooth as lies." Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven; Mara's campfire metaphor and Elias's response carry subtext. Minor slips: "uncommonly serene" and "meteor hush" feel imported rather than voice-organic, and the nurse's scarf detail (mentioned once, unused) suggests light scaffolding. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose is mostly clean with strong images ("rusted crown above the scrubland," "runes...pulsing like a heartbeat"). Two paraphrase loops: the "half-lit epiphanies" vs. "full-blown revelations" and "seedy bars" recur without added pressure. Template cadence in the middle: "He knelt...began to speak...murmured...intoned" stacks similar constructions. The closing paragraph's "through...through...through" repetition reads purposeful but edges toward overwriting. Information density is solid; no major clarity breaks.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The calligrapher-turned-puppeteer and decommissioned radar dome as performance space offer fresh specificity. However, the ethical-storytelling premise and the "stories as campfires" metaphor are familiar craft-workshop tropes, and the story does not deeply transform them through Elias's lived detail or a non-obvious moral calculus. The puppet-show mechanics (holographic projections from runes) feel more decorative than integral. Emotional arc is legible but predictable: guilt → redemption-seeking → method-found.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elias frames the story and makes the decision to reverse the puppet roles mid-show, prompting the crowd's laughter. However, his choices are reactive illustrations of his thesis rather than turns that narrow options or alter stakes. Present in setup, middle, and closure, but not indispensable—a similar performer could execute the same arc.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story stick appears in setup (carved with glowing runes), is used to project the puppet show in the middle, and returns at closure ("clutched...its warmth a comfort"). Its runes "pulsing like a heartbeat" charges the final image. However, it functions primarily as a prop—removing it would require only minor edits (e.g., a different projection device). Solid integration across three beats, but swappable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Half-lit epiphanies" is invoked once in exposition ("whether half-lit epiphanies could outshine full-blown revelations") but does not shape on-page tactics or choices. The puppet show demonstrates ethical storytelling, not a half-lit approach. The concept echoes thematically but remains abstract rather than operational.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Uncommonly serene" is stated twice ("his voice uncommonly serene," "his serenity unbroken") but never constrains or enables a choice with visible cost. Elias's unbroken calm is label-only; it does not create friction, force a tradeoff, or alter tactics under the drifter's challenge. Ornamental attribute.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The reversal of puppet roles (pauper wears crown, king scrubs floors) is the story's pivotal turn, shifting the crowd from unease to laughter and embodying Elias's thesis. It appears in the middle and directly shapes the ending's thematic charge. Swapping "reverse" for another transformation (e.g., merge, erase) would alter the meaning. Causal and specific, though not indispensable to all story logic.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>"Subversive puppet shows in seedy bars" is signaled in setup as Elias's established method and grounds the dome performance as a new test. The mechanics (shadow-plays, holographic projections) matter on the page. However, the seedy-bar context is told rather than shown; the dome performance could stand alone. Present in setup and shaping middle attempts, but the "seedy bars" half is ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The radar dome provides atmospheric specificity (skeletal ribs, curved walls for projections, isolation) and Elias explicitly credits it: "here, in the hush after an argument, people are raw." The dome's architecture enables the shadow-play and charges the final image. However, a similar abandoned structure could serve with minor edits. Present across all three gates and purposeful, but not structurally indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"In the hush left behind by a heated argument" sets initial atmosphere and is referenced once in dialogue ("in the hush after an argument, people are raw"). It does not tighten decisions or create a live clock; the show proceeds at Elias's pace with no time pressure. Functional setup and thematic echo, but replaceable and not operationalized in escalation.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Elias's drive to explore ethical storytelling is dramatized through the tycoon-eulogy guilt and tested via the puppet show. The reversible roles and the "half-truths" dialogue reflect friction between his want (redemption) and the method's ambiguity. Present in setup, middle choice, and closure realization. However, the show succeeds without visible cost—no failure or rejection forces a tradeoff. Shaped but not conflicted enough for higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Meteor hush" appears once as a descriptor ("meteor hush of the projections") and does not modulate with pressure or charge the final image. Tone throughout is contemplative and controlled, consistent but static. The phrase feels decorative rather than a tonal anchor that shapes the ending's emotional register. Lyric mention without development or reprise with reweighted meaning.</comment>
