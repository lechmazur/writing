<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The philanthropist's contradictory impulses—engineering drought while treasuring the extinct bird's song—operate simultaneously on the page through the egg placement ritual and water vial gesture. Internal conflict is embodied in concrete actions (kneeling in salt, pouring river water) rather than therapy-speak. However, the character's motivation remains largely told through exposition ("drawn not by greed but by a secret sentimentality") rather than dramatized through on-page micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. The final choice to "move on to his next project" undercuts the cost of release, reading more as character summary than earned renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land within the opening paragraph. The piece operates under an Accumulative lens: the salt flat ritual gathers density through layered gestures (placing egg, pouring water, hearing phantom song) that reweight the philanthropist's manufactured destruction. However, closure lacks on-page cost—the protagonist "never checked" the egg's fate and immediately moves to a luxury resort, which reads as soft reset rather than Earned Stasis or Charged Poise. The final paragraph's "that was enough" is asserted rather than made undeniable through a final image that forecloses options. Orientation Test penalty waived (anchors present early); lens holds but closure RR/CR is weak.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The salt flat constrains and charges action throughout: salt crunches under knees, grains scatter like confetti, the depression holds the egg, and the storm's rain dissolves or buries it by dawn. The map drawn by cracks functions as both artifact and spatial guide, its shifting fissures mirroring the sky. Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through the philanthropist's priorities (iridescent shell, "ghostly blue," salt's texture). The recurring storm pressure modulates from distant rumble to midnight hammer, shaping the ritual's urgency and the egg's fate. Micro-setting (the body kneeling, the vial, the egg rolling) charges the final act.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving the extinct bird's echo—is signaled early and tightens through the placement ritual. However, escalation under the Accumulative lens requires a meaningful deepening or cadence shift that narrows options with visible cost. The philanthropist's actions (placing egg, pouring water, walking away) form a sequence but lack a turn or price that forecloses a path. The immediate pivot to "his next project: a luxury resort" undercuts any felt sacrifice. The thunder's approach and retreat provide atmospheric pressure but do not force a choice with on-page consequence. One meaningful pressure point is present (the release gesture) but cost legibility at closure is insufficient for higher bands.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: the iridescent egg, the map of cracks, the vial of final river water, the looped bird recording. The piece explores grace within amorality without stating a moral, allowing the protagonist's twisted sentimentality to resonate without redemption or condemnation. The final image of the yellowed map admired for "abstract beauty" while visitors remain unaware offers a resonant answer to the central question—preservation of echo over substance. However, "Some truths were better left cracked" and "that, he decided, was enough" edge toward thematic statement rather than letting the image alone speak. Recurrence (egg, map, recording, bird's call) reweights prior material without forced symbolism.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Voice maintains a distinct perceptual signature: the philanthropist notices iridescence, mirage shimmer, spiral fissures "like ancient scripts," and the egg "catching the fading light." Diction remains elevated but consistent ("tailored suit clung," "fragment of memory buried beneath layers of cynicism"). Psychic distance stays stable in third-person limited with purposeful compression at key moments. Filter verbs ("he imagined," "he wondered," "he swore") appear frequently but read voice-motivated rather than cluttering immediacy. The piece avoids head-hopping; all perception remains bound to the protagonist. Minor slips: "Critics called him a monster; admirers, a visionary" shifts briefly into external consensus without grounding in his present awareness, though it recovers quickly.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies effectively between long atmospheric builds ("The salt flat stretched endlessly, a blank canvas save for the fissures that spiraled like ancient scripts") and short declarative beats ("He turned to leave, then paused"). Information density is high; most lines advance setting, character, or pressure. However, paraphrase loops appear: the bird's song is described as "haunting his childhood" early, then "the bird's call looping in his private study" mid-story, then "he heard the bird's song" near the end—three restatements of the same content without added pressure (−0.4). Template cadence in the mansion paragraph: "He'd play... He'd drink... He'd already moved on" (−0.3). Stock phrasing: "blank canvas," "monument to extinction" (−0.2). Total artifacts −0.9 in Q7; no touch to closure beat, so Non-closure Accumulation Cap applies.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of amoral destruction and secret sentimentality through the extinct bird motif offers a fresh angle on environmental villainy, avoiding simple condemnation. The map drawn by drought cracks is a specific, non-obvious detail that integrates premise and action. However, the core emotional arc—cynical man performs futile sentimental gesture—follows a recognizable template without full transformation through lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The luxury resort finale and "preserve nothing tangible" framing edge toward stating the irony rather than earning it through inevitable hindsight. The piece's specificity (iridescent egg, salt flat ritual, crack-drawn map) elevates execution within familiar territory but does not break new ground structurally or thematically.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Setup: present in opening paragraph. Development: the philanthropist's choices drive the middle beats—placing the egg, pouring water—but these are enacted without on-page conflict or trade-off. Payoff: walks away and moves to next project without visible cost tied to his agency. His amorality shapes backstory (funding the dam, buying land, stealing the egg) but on-page decisions feel ritualistic rather than constrained by that trait. Two beats (placement, departure) but causal pressure is moderate; swapping for "conflicted developer" would require only minor edits. Mid-band: functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Setup: introduced paragraph one, held in gloved hand with vivid description (iridescent, ghostly blue). Development: placed in depression marked by map (middle beat), rolled slightly catching light, receives water from vial. Payoff: dissolves or is buried by dawn; mentioned as absent but not causally active in final image. Three beats (held, placed, dissolved) with evolving state. However, the egg's fate is narrated rather than shown to reweight the closure. Strong presence across structure but closure linkage is summary-only rather than charged image. Caps at 6.9 for missing active closure participation; placed at 6.7 for solid causal work through middle.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Setup: mentioned in opening paragraph (dam that choked the river, drought he'd engineered). Development: echoed in the salt flat setting and the map of dried riverbeds, but does not constrain or enable a middle choice. Payoff: the luxury resort "where the river once flowed" is summary in final section, not a closure image. The drought is backstory context rather than a live stake or tactic-shaping force on the page. Functional but swappable; "manufactured disaster" could replace with minor edits. Two gates (setup, payoff-summary) allow ~6.0 ceiling, but ornamental use and swappability lower score.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Setup: stated directly in paragraph two ("secret sentimentality"). Development: manifest in on-page actions (placing egg, pouring water, playing recordings at night) but the trait is told rather than constrained. Payoff: "even amoral men could crave grace" is a thematic echo, not a choice. The attribute enables the ritual but does not create visible trade-off or cost—he performs sentiment without sacrifice. Two beats (ritual actions, nightly recordings) but label-only presentation and lack of on-page friction keep it in mid-band. Present in closure thought but not causally active in final image.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Setup: anticipated by the map and egg in hand. Development: the release (placing egg, pouring water) occurs mid-story and is the ritual's center. Payoff: the egg is gone by dawn, but the philanthropist "never checked"—closure is his decision not to verify, which ties to the action's aftermath. The release is the central gesture but its outcome is narrated rather than shown to redefine options. Two beats (enactment, narrated result) with causal linkage to theme. However, easily swappable with "burial" or "abandonment" without major structural change. Mid-band for solid but not irreplaceable role.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Setup: introduced paragraph three ("map drawn by cracks in the dried riverbeds"). Development: consulted to find the spot (middle beat), its cracks "shifted slightly" under wind, and it flutters during the ritual. Payoff: hangs yellowed in his office where visitors admire its "abstract beauty." Three beats (consulted, flutters, displayed) with recurring presence and reweighted meaning at closure (misunderstood artifact). However, the map's mechanics—geologists decoding fissures to find "where the river's ghost still lingered"—are told rather than shown to alter tactics. Lyric reprise (early → final) with thematic charge earns mid-6s despite summary development.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Setup: anchored in opening line and paragraph one. Development: salt crunches under knees, depression holds egg, wind scatters grains, storm hammers the flat and dissolves/buries the egg by dawn. Payoff: the salt flat "seemed to shudder, as if the earth itself were mourning"—though this is metaphor, the physical setting's transformation (dry → storm-soaked) causally determines the egg's fate. The flat constrains movement (endless expanse, specific depression) and supplies the dissolving agent (salt + rain). Three beats with causal pressure and closure participation. Strong integration; setting is indispensable to outcome.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Setup: opening line ("lull of distant thunder"). Development: thunder rumbles closer (low growl vibrating bones), retreats, then returns louder as he walks away. Payoff: "storm broke at midnight" is summary, not a live clock altering the ritual. The thunder provides atmospheric pressure and marks the ritual's duration but does not tighten decisions or force tempo changes—he completes the gesture regardless. Two beats (approach, retreat) with mood contribution but no tactical constraint. Timeframe is present but does not shape choices; swappable with "dusk" or "dawn" without structural impact.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Setup: stated in paragraph two (bird's song "haunted his childhood") and manifest in theft of egg years ago. Development: the motivation drives the ritual (placing egg, pouring water) and nightly recording playback. Payoff: "preserve nothing tangible. Only the echo... And that, he decided, was enough." The desire is told more than dramatized—no on-page friction between preserving echo and funding destruction that forces a choice. Two beats (ritual, nightly recordings) with thematic payoff, but "secret sentimentality" and the recordings are summary rather than conflicted action with cost. Lyric reprise (early desire → final acceptance) with felt continuity earns mid-6s despite told-only development.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Setup: established through imagery (iridescent egg, mirage shimmer, ghostly blue) and contradictory action (destruction + sentimentality) from opening paragraphs. Development: tone modulates with thunder's approach/retreat, the "absurd ritual," the "rare, genuine curve of his lips," and the phantom trill that may be wind. Payoff: "fractured, faint, but unmistakable" and "Some truths were better left cracked" crystallize the tone in the final section. The fractured quality (broken ecology, splintered motives, cracked map) is coherent and charges the closure image of the yellowed map misunderstood by visitors. Tone is sustained and purposeful, reaching for grace without redemption. Strong coherence through turns; minor dip for "that was enough" which asserts rather than embodies.</comment>
