<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lirael's interior life is enacted through the whittling ritual, but her blankness as a trait flattens rather than complicates her choices—there's no visible internal contradiction or competing impulse within the carving scene itself. The backstory exposition (mandate enforcement, lost family) is told rather than dramatized through present micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. Embodied emotion is present in the crumbling petals and steady knife work, but the performance conceit keeps her at a distance; the final whispered line about carrying darkness feels asserted rather than earned through on-page struggle with a foreclosed path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors quickly (farmhouse, turbines, Lirael at table). The dominant stake—honoring grief through creation under the mandate—is signaled early. The piece reads as Accumulative/Textural: the whittling process accumulates density and the final spoon placement next to the bouquet offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis: she will continue carving despite the mandate). However, the mandate itself remains abstract backdrop with no on-page enforcement pressure or tactical constraint that tightens options; the cost of her defiance is implied rather than legible in a specific forfeiture or consequence within this scene. The closure image reweights prior material but the felt cost is muted.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The farmhouse, turbines, and dried bouquet are vividly rendered with purposeful sensory economy (petals crumbling like ash, turbine hum, oil-rubbed wood). The turbines function as atmospheric constant but do not constrain a choice or alter tactics within the scene. The bouquet and spoon—micro-setting objects—charge the final image when placed together, satisfying the 9+ gate partially. Spatial choreography is clear; Lirael's movements at table and window track cleanly. Wood grain as "memory" and the turbines as "giants stealing the wind's voice" are poetic but do not pressure the present action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake (cultivate lightness through creation) is present throughout. Pressure is lateral rather than escalating: each step of the whittling—finding grain, shaping bowl, smoothing, polishing—advances the ritual but no reversal or tightening forces a new choice or forecloses an option. The mandate as antagonist remains off-page; no enforcement team arrives, no internal temptation to stop surfaces and is overcome. The final act (placing spoon beside bouquet, vow to carve again tomorrow) is Earned Stasis with felt resolve but minimal on-page cost—no visible sacrifice, stamina limit, or tactical shift under pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme (grief as transformation, imperfection as human, defiance through mundane ritual) emerges organically from the whittling beats and the dried flowers. The final image—spoon beside bouquet, vow to continue—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without overt moral. However, explicit thematic statements proliferate: "Grief is like these flowers," "Lightness is not the absence of darkness," "Polishing is an act of defiance." These meta-commentaries replace scene pressure at peak moments, lowering the score. The piece invites reflection but leans on articulated thesis rather than letting the carved spoon and withered petals carry full weight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Lirael's voice is distinct—blank performer narrating her own task—and POV distance is stable throughout. The performance frame (flat monotone, "Today I will carve a spoon") is purposeful but creates slight emotional distance that prevents deeper perceptual signature under stress. Diction is controlled and literary ("pall of gray," "blades slicing the sky into fractured shards") without register drift. No dialogue present; monologue beats are clean. The narration of each whittling step has strong rhythmic control, though some metaphoric density (turbines as giants, grain as memory) borders on over-explanation within the performed frame itself.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high in the whittling sequence; each line advances ritual and thematic charge. However, repetitive syntactic stems appear: "Now," "Next," "Finally" structure the process mechanically. Metaphoric density is heavy in early paragraphs (weathered planks "color of old bone," blades slicing sky into "fractured shards," petals scattering "like ash") without always serving immediate pressure. No paraphrase loops or clarity-breaking artifacts, but the turbines' description recurs with slight synonym churn (hum/whine/drone). The spoon-polishing beat—"Polishing is an act of defiance"—crosses into expository self-commentary that tells rather than shows the stakes.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The happiness-mandate dystopia is a familiar template (emotion policing, enforcement teams, rebellion through small acts). The whittling-as-performance frame offers a modest fresh angle, and the dried-flower/carved-spoon pairing has thematic coherence. However, the core emotional arc (grief ritualized into mundane creation) does not deviate from well-worn ground, and the mandate itself remains abstract rather than uniquely imagined through specific enforcement mechanics or social texture. The transformation test is borderline: swap "spoon" for another craft object and the arc holds unchanged. Proximity check clears; no close echoes of famous lines, though "Joy is a Choice!" poster and therapy-speak enforcement read as stock dystopian shorthand.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Lirael is present throughout and her performance/whittling frames every beat. She makes the decision to carve and to continue tomorrow, but these choices do not create a key turn—no option is foreclosed, no tactic shifts. Her blank-faced performer trait is label-only; it constrains observation but not decision. The ending vow is a stance crystallization (Earned Stasis) but grows from resolve rather than a choice that alters prior tactics. Gates: setup ✓, development (whittling beats) ✓, closure (vow to continue) ✓. Functional across beats but decisions do not create reversals. Mid-band for presence without causal turn.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The bouquet appears in paragraph one (crumbles at touch), is examined mid-scene ("touching a petal. It disintegrated"), and returns in the final image beside the carved spoon, reweighted as symbol of grief remade. Three beats, lyric reprise, closure linkage. However, the bouquet does not constrain a choice or enable a tactic—it is observed and placed, not used to solve a problem or alter an option. Gates: setup ✓, development (brief touch) ✓, closure (placed beside spoon) ✓. Charged reprise with thematic weight but no causal pressure. Upper mid-band for lyric integration without tactical necessity.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Remade hush" appears once as a phrase in paragraph ~11 ("The remade hush of the farmhouse settled around her"). It does not shape stakes, constrain tactics, or alter options—it labels the atmosphere after the performance ends. The concept of remaking (grief into spoon, flowers into memory) operates thematically but the specific phrase "remade hush" is ornamental. Gates: setup ✗ (arrives late), development ✗ (no middle pressure), closure ✗ (not present in final image). Late, single-mention, label-only. Low functional band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Moral ambiguity is declared in paragraph 5 ("morally ambiguous—a rebellion against the mandate, yet a surrender to its demands") but not dramatized through an on-page choice with competing costs. Lirael performs mundane tasks as defiance, but no moment shows her choosing between enabling harm and accepting complicity, or any other visible tradeoff. The ambiguity is thematic claim rather than enacted friction. Gates: setup (declared early) ✓, development ✗ (no constrained choice), closure ✗ (not tested at end). Present, claimed, not operationalized. Cap 4.6 for setup-only.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Whittling structures the entire narrative: finding grain, shaping bowl, smoothing, polishing. Each beat advances the ritual and the final spoon placement beside the bouquet is the closure image. Removing whittling breaks story logic and thematic spine. The action is irreplaceable and causally central. Gates: setup (paragraph 3) ✓, development (all middle beats) ✓, closure (spoon on table, vow to carve again) ✓. Indispensable to structure and ending. High band for full integration and closure charge, though the whittling itself does not face obstacle or cost within the scene—it proceeds smoothly without material constraint.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The method—dramatically narrating mundane tasks—is signaled early ("Today, I will carve a spoon") and structures every beat through monotone performance framing. Each whittling step is announced and enacted: "First, I must find the grain," "Now, I shape the bowl," etc. The method is the story's formal spine and shapes how Lirael enacts her defiance. Gates: setup (paragraph 3) ✓, development (all narrated steps) ✓, closure (method persists in vow to continue) ✓. The method matters mechanically and thematically. Essential across beats and ending, though it does not impose cost or obstacle—it simply is the mode of the piece.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Farmhouse and turbines are vividly established in paragraph one and recur as atmospheric anchors (turbine hum, shadows, wind). The turbines are metaphorically charged (giants stealing wind's voice, mother's words) but do not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome. The setting frames the scene but does not pressure Lirael's tactics—she could whittle anywhere. Gates: setup ✓, development (ambient throughout) ✓, closure (turbine shadows lengthen) ✓. Present across beats, thematically coherent, but does not affect the whittling action itself. Mid-band for atmospheric integration without tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the happiness mandate" anchors the dystopian context and explains Lirael's loss and defiance. However, "after" is vague—no on-page enforcement, no ticking clock, no escalation from mandate pressure within this scene. The mandate shapes backstory and motivation but does not tighten present decisions or tactics. Gates: setup (paragraph 2) ✓, development ✗ (no live mandate pressure in middle), closure ✗ (not invoked at end). Present as context, not as active temporal constraint. Mid-band for framing without escalation.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The desire to cultivate lightness in grief is Lirael's core motivation, dramatized through the whittling ritual and voiced in the final whisper: "Lightness is not the absence of darkness. It's the courage to carry both." The motivation drives her on-page action (carving, touching flowers, vowing to continue). However, friction between want and cost is muted—no moment shows her tempted to stop, fatigued, or forced to trade one value for another. Gates: setup (implied early, stated late) ✓, development (whittling enacts it) ✓, closure (final line voices it) ✓. Desire is present and consistent but lacks dramatized internal conflict or competing pull. Upper mid-band for integration without on-page friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Emotional void is established early (blank face, monotone voice, "forced smiles and hollow laughter") and sustained through Lirael's flat performance style and the farmhouse's hush. Tone is coherent and modulates subtly: clinical in the whittling beats, elegiac when touching the bouquet, resolute at the end. The final image (spoon beside flowers, vow to carve again) charges the void with quiet defiance. Gates: setup ✓, development (stable through whittling) ✓, closure (ending carries the void forward with resolve) ✓. Tone is consistent and shapes the ending's charge, though the emotional register does not deepen under pressure—it remains level throughout. Solid integration with thematic payoff.</comment>
