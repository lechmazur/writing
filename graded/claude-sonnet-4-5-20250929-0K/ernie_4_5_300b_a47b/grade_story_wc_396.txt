<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's interior life is heavily filtered through abstract meditation ("calmly intuitive," "shadow-laced peacekeeper") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The mirror-walking sequence offers glimpses—sailor's terror, mother's clutch—but these remain viewed artifacts rather than internal conflicts acting simultaneously in scene. The final choice to "give the storm a heart" reads as a conceptual win without foreclosing a live path or showing what Elara sacrificed to achieve it. Motivation remains thematic (mapping empathy onto action) without visceral cost that alters her later options.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors by the second paragraph (lighthouse orchard, shifting ice, Elara). The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: Elara collects mirror-glimpses, weaves empathy threads, and the fragment glows—culminating in the ice stilling and aurora brightening. However, the closure lacks legible cost; the storm gains "a heart" and the floes still, but no on-page price (a forfeited path, a visible trade-off, or a felt consequence) is paid. The resonant reconfiguration is asserted rather than dramatized with cost, preventing full closure validity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The lighthouse-orchard-above-ice-floes setting is vivid and consistent, with frost-heavy branches and groaning ice that pressures the opening stakes. The vintage mirrors in the attic guide Elara's method and return as a concrete spatial anchor. The crystal fragment placed on the ground channels the storm's resolution, charging the final image. The setting constrains Elara's approach (she must climb to the attic, walk the circle) and supplies the mirrors as a resource, meeting the 9+ gate for environment shaping tactics and closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—quelling a fear-born storm by reconstituting empathy—is signaled early and maintained. Elara's mirror-walk provides a tightening sequence (terror → love → hope) that deepens the empathy thread. Yet the storm's resolution arrives without a visible trade-off or foreclosed option: the fragment glows, the ice stills, the aurora approves. No on-page cost (stamina, risk, renunciation) alters Elara's later state. The escalation reads as accumulation without a price paid, capping the score below high bands.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the weaving of broken empathy threads and the fragment's reconstitution, avoiding overt moralizing until the final line's statement: "courage wasn't in the absence of fear, but in the choice to act anyway." This thesis-echo dilutes the thematic resonance that the mirror sequence and aurora approval had built. The sailor/mother/lover glimpses offer concrete particulars, but the ending toggles toward assertion rather than letting the glowing fragment speak for itself. The core question—can empathy quiet collective fear—receives a visible answer (yes, via light and warmth) yet without ambiguity or lingering cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV maintains stable distance, with Elara's perceptual signature ("dark as midnight ice," "calmly intuitive") filtering the orchard and mirrors. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("shadow-laced peacekeeper," "manifestation of collective fear") that reads slightly imposed rather than voice-native. No dialogue appears; the piece relies on narrated interiority and external action. Psychic distance remains controlled, and the mirror-glimpses are cleanly framed as viewed artifacts rather than head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear with purposeful sensory detail (frost-heavy branches, fogged mirrors, groaning ice). Minor overwriting appears in figurative clusters: "shadow-laced," "midnight ice flickered with quiet fire," "silence felt like a language," "gave it a heart" within a compressed span. Template cadence emerges in the mirror-walk sequence ("In the first mirror… In the second… In the third…") without dramatic pressure escalation across those beats. The final paragraph's "She hadn't stopped the storm, but she'd given it a heart" leans on metaphor where a concrete image would sharpen the closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The lighthouse-orchard-above-ice premise and aurora-empathy linkage offer a specific synthesis, yet the emotional arc—collect glimpses, mend fragment, calm storm—follows a familiar template of symbolic object repair leading to external resolution. The transformation test is soft: swapping mirrors for another scrying method or empathy for another virtue would leave the structure largely intact. The courage-despite-fear closer echoes common wisdom without a sharp, non-obvious inflection that reweights prior material.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her decisions (climbing to the attic, walking the mirror circle, placing the fragment on the ground) drive the sequence. However, these choices feel prescribed by the method rather than creating key turns with visible alternatives. She does not face a competing option or trade-off that would elevate her agency into the high bands.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The crystal ball fragment appears early (coat pocket), is examined and placed on the attic table, glows at the ending beat, and is planted on the ground to resolve the storm. It participates in three distinct beats (introduction, attic ritual, climax) and its mended state ("cracks mended by the light of shared humanity") signals transformation. Yet the fragment's mechanics—what specifically within the glimpses repairs it—remain abstract, limiting irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Courageous anomaly" is asserted as theme ("She was a courageous anomaly in a world that valued conformity") but does not constrain on-page tactics or choices. The story shows Elara's empathy-mapping method, not a moment where her anomaly status creates friction or a trade-off. The concept functions as thematic label rather than a live pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"Calmly intuitive" is mentioned twice as a trait label but does not enable or constrain a specific action with visible cost. Elara's mirror-walk and insight-weaving could be executed by a character without this attribute, as no on-page beat shows intuition foreclosing a methodical alternative or imposing a price.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Reconstitute" is signaled early ("she needed to reconstitute the fragment's power") and the ending shows the fragment glowing with mended cracks, linking setup to closure. However, the action is abstract—viewing glimpses somehow repairs the crystal—without mechanical specificity. The turn to resolution depends on it, but the exact causal mechanism (how does empathy reconstitute crystal?) remains untethered, capping the score in mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The vintage store mirrors are introduced in paragraph four, occupy the attic ritual (middle beat), and supply the glimpses (sailor, mother, lover) that Elara weaves into the fragment's repair. The method is signaled and its mechanics (walk the circle, merge reflections) shape the middle sequence. Yet the mirrors could be replaced with other scrying tools (pool, stones, lantern visions) with minor edits, limiting irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The lighthouse orchard above shifting ice floes is established early and pressures the opening stakes (groaning ice, storm manifestation). The orchard's attic houses the mirrors; the ground receives the fragment at closure. The ice stilling at the end provides spatial payoff. The setting supplies resources (mirrors, attic space) and its instability (shifting floes) frames urgency, meeting two gates solidly and touching closure, though the setting could be replaced with another isolated elevated space without breaking logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"The weighted breath before reply" appears once in paragraph seven as a metaphorical marker, not as a ticking clock that constrains Elara's choices. The story unfolds across an indeterminate span (climb, mirror-walk, fragment glow, descent, storm gust) without temporal pressure tightening decisions. The timeframe is ornamental rather than functional.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"To map empathy onto action" is stated in paragraph three and drives Elara's mirror ritual and fragment-planting. The motivation is clear and shapes the dominant stake, appearing in setup and middle beats. However, it is not dramatized through conflicting wants or visible friction; Elara pursues it without cost or temptation to abandon the path. The desire lacks a trade-off that would elevate it into high bands.</comment>
