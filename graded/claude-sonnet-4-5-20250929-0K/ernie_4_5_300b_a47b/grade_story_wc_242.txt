<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Mara's interiority is labeled rather than dramatized—"cultivated estrangement" and "melodically haunted" read as prompt echoes, not lived psychology. The callers dissolve into interchangeable vessels for thematic lessons; David's grief about Lila and the child's tears function as narrative props without contradictory impulses or embodied cost. The final smile and finger-tracing gesture feel performative rather than earned by prior struggle, and the protagonist never faces a choice that forecloses a path with visible price.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation Test penalty: who/where/when emerge gradually across the first ~200 words without deliberate pattern-teaching, harming comprehension (−0.4). No on-page closure unit; Mara ends where she began—tomorrow she'll "start again"—without decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing with felt cost. The piece cycles through vignettes (David/Elise, crying child, teen/poet, man/clown) in accumulative mode but never tightens options or reweights the premise with undeniable pressure at the ending.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The subway utility tunnel supplies vivid sensory anchors—rusted pipes, flickering bulbs, damp earth, old copper—and the glass disc returns with physical detail. Spatial choreography remains coherent across phone-booth moves. However, the setting never constrains a choice or charges the final image; it functions as atmospheric backdrop without altering tactics, preventing entry to higher bands.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—connection through wrong numbers—is signaled early but never escalates or narrows options. Each call resolves smoothly without reversal: David gets Elise, the child stops crying, every misdirection finds its match. No tightening or deepening occurs; pressure remains flat across beats, and Mara faces no trade-off or cost that forecloses a path, leaving the piece without meaningful escalation under any lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The "cultivated estrangement → connection" motif recurs but remains abstract; the glass disc as mirror and "melodically haunted" souls are stated rather than discovered through specific events. The final paragraph moralizes overtly: "even wrong numbers could lead somewhere right" replaces scene pressure with thematic summary. The piece gestures toward transformation of loneliness but never earns a non-literal answer through particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited holds stable with controlled psychic distance and no head-hopping. Dialogue (David, Elise, the child) feels functional and advances connection beats. However, perceptual signature is generic—Mara's way of noticing lacks character-specific bias, and diction ("frayed at the edges," "flicker of purpose") relies on stock metaphor. Register remains consistent but lacks the rhythmic compression or idiosyncrasy that would distinguish voice under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops appear: "cultivated estrangement... the art of nurturing distance" repeats the concept without pressure. Template cadence in the call sequence (man asks → Mara responds → outcome) flattens rhythm. Stock metaphors ("frayed at the edges," "weaving through the tunnel's hum," "lullaby for the lost") and the phrase "melodically haunted souls" echo prompt language without fresh embodiment (−0.8 cumulative in Q7). Clarity remains high, but density and propulsion sag under ornamental phrasing.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>The underground operator connecting wrong-number callers offers a fresh frame, but execution relies on familiar beats: lonely man finds baker, child hears story, teen meets poet—each pairing resolves without friction or cost, reading as median template choices. The glass harmonica disc and "cultivated estrangement" label feel ornamental rather than lived through specific world logic or moral calculus. Transformation test fails; plot and arc could transfer to any empathy-broker premise with minimal change.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Mara is present throughout and spins the disc, but her choices do not create key turns—she facilitates every match without facing cost or altering her own stance. Setup present, no middle constraint, cameo in closure (finger tracing) without causal participation.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The glass harmonica disc is found early, spun in multiple beats (David call, child call, final paragraph), and returns in the ending image. However, its function remains static—atmospheric accompaniment—and swapping it for any talismanic object would leave structure intact. No specific property constrains choice or charges closure with cost.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Cultivated estrangement" is stated twice but never dramatized as a tactic that shapes on-page choices. It reads as thematic label rather than a method that narrows options or imposes trade-offs, appearing only as reflective claim without beat involvement or closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>1.9</grade><comment>"Melodically haunted" appears once as a descriptor for callers' souls in reflective narration. No on-page action constrained or enabled by this trait; it functions as ornamental metaphor without cost, absent from setup and closure beats.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Looping conversations is central to Mara's method and recurs across beats (David→Elise, child→story, teen→poet, man→clown). The action is signaled early and shapes multiple attempts. However, each loop succeeds without complication, making the action's mechanics interchangeable—any connection method would yield the same outcome—and it does not redefine options at closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Wrong number friendships" drives the plot structure and is signaled early (first call at 11:47 p.m.). The method shapes all middle beats and appears implicitly in the ending reflection ("even wrong numbers could lead somewhere right"). Development involvement is strong, but the method never faces friction or cost, and swapping it for intentional matchmaking would require only minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The subway utility tunnel is anchored early with vivid detail (rusted pipes, flickering bulbs, damp earth) and remains the stable location. However, it never pressures Mara's choices or supplies resources that alter tactics; the phone booth could exist anywhere underground without changing story logic. Present in setup and closure image but functionally replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>"Between the hum of streetlamps" frames the opening poetically but does not constrain decisions. The first call timestamp (11:47 p.m.) and "by dawn" provide vague brackets without tightening tactics. Time remains ambient rather than a live clock that alters moves; swappable with "one night" without structural impact.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"To teach endings how to begin" is stated early and recurs in reflection ("shown them how to turn endings into beginnings"). However, the desire is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choices. Mara never faces a cost or friction that tests this motive; it reads as thematic claim without on-page struggle or trade-off.</comment>
