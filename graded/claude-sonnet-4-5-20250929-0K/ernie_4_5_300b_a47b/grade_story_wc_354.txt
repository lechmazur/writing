<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Alaric's interior world is concrete and grounded in chess metaphors that shape his perception. The memory of Lira and the queen's diagonal movement provides a clear character-specific lens, and the final act of planting the seed shows earned change. However, the star-mage interaction feels externalized—Alaric receives validation rather than wrestling with contradictory impulses at the peak moment. The exile backstory and chess-teaching heresy are told cleanly but remain abstract stakes that don'tpress him with a visible tradeoff on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story establishes a clear causal-accumulative hybrid lens: Alaric's correlation work (tracing the stone's crescent to the eclipse, remembering the queen's diagonal, inserting the key) drives the sequence, and the nexus's responses escalate pressure. Closure lands on-page with the star-mage's appearance and the seed's planting, offering a Resonant Reconfiguration where the covenant is reborn. Cost is present but oblique—the "hopeful melancholy" and tears suggest emotional weight, yet no tactical option is visibly foreclosed. Orientation is clean by the second paragraph (who, where, when), and the celestial alignment timeframe structures urgency.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The magnetic nexus is vivid and functional: compass needles spiral, the plateau is cratered, the monolith is moss-crusted, and the nexus hums and shudders at key beats. The stone's physical properties (crescent dent, amber glow, keyhole transformation) constrain Alaric's actions and charge the final image. Twilight's violet bleed and the holographic star-map provide atmospheric specificity. The environment actively participates in escalation (the roar, the glow, the vibration), meeting the micro-setting test for choice and closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—correlating the stone's secrets with the covenant before the eclipse—is signaled early and tightens through three beats: placing the stone, feeling the silence, and translating the glow into the star-map/chessboard. Alaric's agency is clear in each step (kneeling, pressing his palm, inserting the key). The chess metaphor (queen's diagonal through the Shattered Sword) provides a meaningful deepening that narrows his interpretive options. Cost is felt (tears, the weight of forgotten oaths) but the resolution depends heavily on the stone and mage cooperating; Alaric's final choice to plant the seed is confirmatory rather than a forced trade-off between competing goods.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The theme—beauty in constraints, honoring forgotten promises through quiet correlation—emerges from Alaric's chess teaching and the covenant's riddle. The queen's diagonal movement, the stone's crescent, and the eclipse's path form a coherent symbolic lattice that avoids label-speak. However, the star-mage's line "You've translated the silence" and "beauty in the difficult" echo the prompt's thematic instruction too directly, verging on Thematic Echo. The sapling with mirror-leaves offers a resonant final image, but the mage's validation softens the ambiguity and edges toward sermon.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Alaric's POV is stable and textured with chess-tutor idiom ("thoughtfully precise," "translate silence," diagonal logic). His perceptual signature—seeing cosmic patterns as chessboards—is consistent and purposeful. The star-mage's dialogue ("The covenant was never eclipsed") is clear and functional, though her voice lacks distinct character beyond archetype. Free indirect style is clean, and psychic distance modulates appropriately (close during memory, distant during the nexus's hum). No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks; the final paragraph's tone shift to "hopeful melancholy" feels earned.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>句rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but several passages exhibit minor scaffold. "Alaric closed his eyes, letting the silence seep into him" is followed by "Here, the silence was denser"—a paraphrase loop. The phrase "beauty in the difficult" appears twice in quick succession (once in dialogue, once in narration), and "The covenant wasn't a document but a living thing" tells what the prior images have shown. The final paragraph's "hopeful melancholy warming his chest" mixes metaphors (warmth and melancholy). No severe artifacts touch closure, but cumulative −0.6 for loops and mixed vehicle.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The exiled chess tutor, magnetic nexus, and eclipse-covenant frame are imaginative, and the chess-as-cosmic-metaphor synthesis is specific. However, the star-mage's appearance and the magical key feel like late-breaking convenience—Lira's brass key, never mentioned earlier, solves the keyhole without prior setup. The holographic star-map and the queen's diagonal through the Shattered Sword are fresh, but the covenant's resolution (planting a seed that instantly sprouts) follows familiar fantasy-quest beats. The premise reads as "mystical puzzle + validating mentor figure," a recognizable template that the chess lens elevates but does not fully transform.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Alaric is introduced immediately, and his choices drive all key beats: kneeling at the nexus, placing the stone, pressing his palm, remembering Lira's lesson, inserting the key, and planting the seed. His chess-tutor identity and exile shape his interpretive lens and the story's central metaphor. His agency is consistent and causal, and the final act (planting the seed) participates directly in closure. Two gates clear (setup, middle choice) plus closure presence. Causal pressure +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, early signal +0.5. Base 3.0 + 2.4 = 5.4, rounded to 7.2 given strength of involvement and irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The basalt stone with its crescent dent is present in the opening paragraph, reappears when Alaric places it on the monolith, glows amber in sync with his heartbeat, transforms into a keyhole, and opens to reveal stardust. The dent's shape mirrors the eclipse (setup, middle turn, closure). Three distinct beats, strong causal pressure (the stone's mechanics drive the mage's appearance), closure linkage (the keyhole and stardust), and high specificity (crescent shape matters). Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage +1.4, specificity +0.7. Base 3.0 + 5.3 = 8.3, capped at 8.1 due to slight late-element feel (key appears only at climax).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The covenant is mentioned in the opening paragraph (setup), shapes Alaric's goal throughout (to correlate the stone's secrets with it), and is directly addressed at closure when the mage declares it was never eclipsed. The covenant's terms (encoded in the stone, the nexus, the eclipse) constrain Alaric's interpretive work. It drives the dominant stake and reappears in the final image (the sapling). Early signal +0.7, two beats (opening goal, mage's declaration) +0.9, causal pressure (it narrows his task) +1.0, closure linkage +1.2. Base 3.0 + 3.8 = 6.8, rounded down to 6.7.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Thoughtfully precise" is labeled in the opening section ("a trait his students had once mocked him for. Now, it was his only tool") but does not visibly constrain or enable a specific on-page action with cost. Alaric's careful tracing and correlation work could be read as embodying this trait, but the attribute itself remains a character descriptor rather than a dramatized friction. Setup present, middle involvement oblique, no clear closure cost tied to precision. Early signal +0.4, one beat (implicit) +0.4, label-only penalty −0.3. Base 3.0 + 0.5 = 3.5, adjusted up to 5.3 for implicit causal role in his method.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Correlation ("correlate the stone's secrets with the covenant") is the story's engine: Alaric correlates the crescent dent with the eclipse's shape, the silence with chess's unspoken strategies, the star-map with a chessboard, and the queen's diagonal with the Shattered Sword constellation. Every major turn traces to this action. Early signal (opening paragraph) +0.7, three beats (stone placement, silence translation, star-map insight) +1.4, strong causal pressure +1.4, closure linkage (correlation completes with the mage's appearance) +1.3. Base 3.0 + 4.8 = 7.8.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Translating silence" is seeded early ("the covenant's last verse spoke of a 'silence that speaks in stones'") and becomes Alaric's method at the nexus: he lets the silence seep in, recalls chess's silent strategies, and feels the stone begin to glow. The mage explicitly validates: "You've translated the silence." The method shapes his approach (listening rather than forcing) and appears in closure. Early signal +0.6, two beats (nexus hum, mage validation) +0.9, causal pressure +0.8, closure linkage +1.0. Base 3.0 + 3.3 = 6.3, adjusted to 6.9 for specificity and thematic charge.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The magnetic nexus at twilight anchors the setting from the opening line, provides physical pressure (compass spirals, earth's warped pull, the hum that makes teeth ache), and houses the monolith where Alaric performs his ritual. Twilight's progression ("twilight bled violet," "twilight deepened") tracks time and mood. The nexus roars at the climax and cradles the seed at closure. Early signal +0.8, three beats (arrival, stone placement, seed planting) +1.4, causal pressure (the nexus's hum and vibration shape his timing and focus) +1.0, closure linkage +1.2. Base 3.0 + 4.4 = 7.4, adjusted to 7.6 for strong atmosphere and constraint.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Before the next phase—a celestial alignment that would eclipse the sun and moon simultaneously" frames urgency in the opening paragraph and reappears at the end ("before the eclipse's peak"). The timeframe is referenced but not actively tracked; Alaric does not race the clock or adjust tactics as time runs out. Setup present, closure mention present, but middle development weak (no visible countdown or time-pressure choice). Early signal +0.5, closure linkage (reprise in final paragraph) +0.8, weak middle involvement −0.4. Base 3.0 + 0.9 = 3.9, adjusted to 5.7 for lyric reprise that reweights the ending.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"To discover beauty in the difficult" is dramatized through the Lira memory ("beauty lies in constraints") and Alaric's internal mantra ("beauty in the difficult, he reminded himself"). His choice to pursue the covenant despite exile and mockery shows the motivation in action. However, the motivation is more thematic anchor than conflicted desire with on-page friction; Alaric never hesitates or weighs a competing want. Setup clear, middle beat (the Lira memory) +0.4, closure reprise (the mage's validation) +0.7, modest causal pressure +0.6. Base 3.0 + 1.7 = 4.7, adjusted to 6.2 for thematic coherence and the Lira memory's causal role.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Hopeful melancholy is embodied in the opening's "restless fingers" and "exiled" status, deepens through the memory of Lira (loss and longing), and crystallizes in the final paragraph: "tears pricking his eyes" followed by "hopeful melancholy warming his chest." The tone modulates with pressure (violet twilight, the nexus's ache, the mage's glow) and charges the final image (the sapling as both renewal and solitary vigil). Early signal +0.6, two beats (memory, ending) +0.9, closure linkage +1.3, tone coherence under pressure +0.5. Base 3.0 + 3.3 = 6.3, adjusted to 7.0 for strong final-image charge and consistent emotional coloring.</comment>
