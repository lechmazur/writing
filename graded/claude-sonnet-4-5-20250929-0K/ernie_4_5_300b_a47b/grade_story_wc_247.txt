<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Kael's motivation to translate silence into music is stated but never tested against competing needs or believable obstacles. His "quietly charismatic presence" remains label-only; we see no micro-choices where his manner enables or constrains action with cost. Lira's arc from skepticism to collaboration occurs too smoothly—her interiority is thin, her shift unmotivated by internal contradiction. The crowd's emergence and rapt attention feel convenient rather than earned through prior character work.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchors establish harbor, moonlight, and Kael's presence quickly. The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens: Kael's solo mapping → Lira's arrival and collaboration → crowd gathering → dawn reflection. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration (the silence spoken, world listened), but cost is asserted rather than dramatized—no visible forfeiture, no path foreclosed on the page. The final "twinge of sadness" and "small smile" gesture toward felt cost without grounding it in a concrete choice or loss that alters Kael's options going forward.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The luminous harbor by moonlight is vivid and atmospherically coherent, with selective sensory anchors (waves whispering, creak of ropes, mist). Spatial choreography is clean across Kael's positioning, Lira's approach, and the crowd's gathering. The camera functions as a micro-setting object but does not constrain a key choice—it frames his gestures without imposing cost or altering tactics. The setting supports tone but does not pressure the protagonist's decisions at the closure beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—translating silence into music—is signaled early but never tightened by opposition or scarcity. Kael's intent to "disrupt the harbor's quiet rhythm" meets no resistance; Lira joins willingly, the crowd assembles without friction, and the music succeeds effortlessly. The night's achievement is declared to fade "like all things," but no on-page reversal or trade-off narrows Kael's options or exacts visible cost. Escalation is atmospheric rather than driven by protagonist agency under pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Theme—silence as language, loneliness transformed—emerges from concrete imagery (the filmless camera, signing to water, violin weeping and laughing). The final paragraph drifts toward overt thematic summary: "silence wasn't emptiness—it was a canvas" and "The silence had spoken, and the world had listened" declare the theme rather than letting the ending image hold it. Thetwinge of sadness gestures toward complexity but does not reweight prior material with undeniable cost. Subtext operates effectively in Kael's gestures and Lira's hesitant bow before the final explanatory drift.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited to Kael is stable with no head-hopping; psychic distance is consistent. Perceptual signature is present but generic—"quietly charismatic," "rare expression"—without idiosyncratic filtering. Dialogue and signing feel natural and goal-driven when present; Lira's signed "Show me" and spoken reply demonstrate voice-motivated register mixing. The prose carries a lyric texture ("liquid silver," "symphony of stillness") that fits the tone but occasionally drifts toward stock poeticism ("joyful sorrow," "beauty of loneliness"). Internal voice remains coherent under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings diversify across the harbor description and action beats. Information density is moderate—many lines advance atmosphere but some recycle concepts (silence as language is restated multiple times without adding pressure). Minor template cadence in the climax: "Kael's signs grew faster… Lira's playing matched his pace." Stock metaphors cluster in the opening ("liquid silver," "whispering secrets") and resolution ("canvas, waiting to be painted"). No loops or scaffold obscure causality, but figurative density in descriptive passages slows momentum without pattern-teaching or payoff.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The core synthesis—signing as musical transcription, a filmless camera framing silence—offers a fresh angle on synesthesia and translation themes. Execution follows a predictable arc: solitary artist meets skeptical collaborator, demonstration wins crowd, bittersweet reflection at dawn. Kael's role as "whispering advisor" and the vintage camera are specific details, but the emotional terrain (loneliness transformed by shared creation) and the frictionless collaboration trend toward familiar templates. The piece commits to its premise but does not transform the arc through non-obvious moral calculus or structural risk.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Kael is present throughout and initiates the harbor visit, but his role as "whispering advisor" (the specified character attribute) does not create key turns—he demonstrates his method, and others join without friction. His occupation is mentioned in setup but does not constrain or enable a pivotal choice. Two-gate presence (setup, ending) with moderate beat involvement but low causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The vintage camera with no film appears in three beats: Kael removes and aims it at the water, gestures with it as Lira watches, and it dangles at his neck in the final paragraph as "a reminder that some truths are felt, not seen." The camera frames his gestures but does not alter tactics or impose cost—it is handled but functionally ornamental. Three-gate presence with lyric reprise, but low irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Sign language is dramatized on the page: Kael signs to the camera/water, Lira signs her questions, and their exchange drives the collaboration beat. Signing shapes the method of "mapping silence" and appears in the closure reflection, but it does not constrain options or impose cost—Kael could have conducted or gestured without signing and the arc would hold. Three-gate presence, moderate beat involvement, but swappable for other non-verbal methods.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Quietly charismatic" is asserted in the opening ("His quietly charismatic presence drew strangers close") but never demonstrated through action with visible cost. Lira is drawn by the camera's light, not his manner; the crowd gathers for the music, not his presence. Label-only mention; no on-page constraint or enabling tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Disrupt" is stated as Kael's intent ("to disrupt the harbor's quiet rhythm") and enacted when he begins signing, drawing Lira and then the crowd into sound where silence had been. The action is present in setup, middle (collaboration), and implicit at closure (the harbor "came alive with sound"). It drives the central beats, but the disruption is smooth—no friction, no cost, no reversal—making it functionally replaceable with "awaken" or "animate."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Mapping silence" is signaled early ("mapping silence, translating the harbor's unspoken melodies") and demonstrated in two beats: Kael's solo signing and the collaborative performance. The method is described rather than mechanically constrained—how signing "maps" silence into playable notes is asserted, not shown to impose a process cost or enable a tactic that another method would not. Two-gate presence with moderate beat involvement but low specificity.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The luminous harbor by moonlight is vividly established in the opening and recurs at dawn in the closure paragraph. It supplies atmosphere and spatial anchors (docks, water, moon's reflection) but does not pressure choices—Kael could perform this demonstration in any quiet outdoor space. The setting supports tone and provides the "silence" to be mapped, but does not constrain tactics or supply a resource that alters outcome. Two-gate presence with strong atmospheric contribution but low causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"When no one remembers you" appears once in Kael's reflection mid-story ("When no one remembers you, your silence becomes a prison") and is implied at closure ("the harbor's forgetfulness"). It frames his motivation but does not tighten decisions or create a ticking clock—the night's performance changes nothing about being forgotten, and no on-page event tests this timeframe with cost. Thematic mention without tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"To translate silence into music" is Kael's explicit goal, stated early and pursued on the page through signing and collaboration with Lira. The desire drives all three major beats (solo mapping, collaboration, crowd performance) and appears in the closure reflection. Friction is minimal—Lira's skepticism melts immediately, and the translation succeeds without struggle or cost. Three-gate presence with strong beat involvement but low conflict between want and obstacle.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>"Joyful sorrow" is named explicitly in Lira's music ("a melody that captured the beauty of loneliness, the ache of things unsaid") and echoed in the closure's "twinge of sadness" alongside Kael's "small smile." The tone is coherent and modulates with the performance's swell and the dawn reflection. The explicit labeling of the tone mid-story reduces subtext; the final image carries the bittersweet register but does not deepen it with undeniable cost. Two-gate presence with coherent modulation but overt statement.</comment>
