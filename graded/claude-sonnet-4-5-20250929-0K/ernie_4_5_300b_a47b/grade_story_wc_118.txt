<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to collect wall-stored stories is clear and consistent, and his probing actions show character-particular perception. However, the final "recognition" that shifts the axis feels asserted rather than earned through prior contradictory impulses or visible internal conflict. The tapestry's dragons "stirring" and voices rising read as exterior validation rather than a choice that forecloses a path with felt cost. Embodied emotion is present in "trembled" and "breath caught," but the climactic moment lacks a micro-choice that reveals hierarchy of values.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—density increases through Clara's diary fragments, the tapestry's hidden symbols, and the final chorus of voices. Orientation is anchored early (silo library, Elias, post-dream world). The closure—axis shifting back "by recognition"—qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), but the cost remains conceptual and oblique; no concrete forfeiture is visible on the page. The piece coheres under its lens, but the final image's pressure could be sharper.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The silo's steel ribs, fireplace debris, and tapestry create a vivid, selective sensory anchor. The setting constrains Elias's investigation spatially (fireplace, worktable, walls) and the tapestry's embroidered symbols charge the final image when the dragons "unfurl." Micro-setting (tapestry, brass poker, railroad spikes) functions well. The bronze quiet modulates subtly but does not sharply alter under peak pressure, keeping this shy of the 8+ band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: restoring the displaced axis by acknowledging ignored stories. One meaningful deepening occurs when Elias realizes the axis is "the line between hearing and ignoring." However, escalation is largely cognitive—transcription, cross-reference, realization—without a visible trade-off or foreclosed path. The protagonist's final act (placing palm on wall, opening mouth to speak) lacks agency-driven cost; the tapestry's autonomous stirring grants closure rather than Elias's decision forcing it.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—stories require listeners to live—emerges organically through Clara's ritual, the embroidered symbols, and the final chorus. The displaced axis metaphor deepens across beats without overt statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: recognition restores the axis. Clara's line "To restore it, we must first acknowledge" risks thematic echo but stays character-voiced. The final image reweights prior material (walls as repository, dragons as symbol) with undeniable conceptual pressure, though emotional cost remains oblique.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV remains stable; Elias's perceptual signature (tracing fingers, "sensitively perceptive gaze," magnifying glass) is distinct and consistent. Diction is controlled—"displaced axis," "bronze quiet," "probed"—with purposeful vocabulary. No dialogue is present to judge. Filter verbs ("wondered," "realized," "noticed") appear frequently but remain voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy. Psychic distance is consistent; no head-hopping. Minor: "he'd found" and passive constructions slightly dilute propulsion in a few beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high in the diary-fragment and symbol-transcription beats. However, scaffold phrases recur: "The dragons' eyes glowed faintly" / "The dragons seemed to stir" and "Elias wondered" / "Elias's breath caught" / "Elias placed his palm." Paraphrase loop in paragraph 4: "The axis shifted" restated as "displaced axis" without added pressure. Template cadence: "He knelt," "He unfolded," "He returned," "He stood" across multiple beats. Apply −0.6 for template runs and −0.2 for paraphrase; total −0.8 from a mid-7s anchor.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The premise—walls retain memories, stories as dragons—offers a fresh metaphorical synthesis. The silo library and Clara's diary-burning ritual are specific and non-generic. However, the "last human dream" frame and the protagonist-historian-collecting-fragments arc trend toward familiar speculative templates. The tapestry's animated response at closure risks convenience; the turn is seeded but feels slightly externalized rather than character-forced. Transformation is present but not fully inevitable in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias appears in every beat and his choices (probing ashes, transcribing symbols, placing palm on wall) drive the investigation. Setup: opening paragraph. Development: transcription and cross-reference narrow options. Closure: his act of recognition triggers the shift. However, the final turn is granted by the tapestry's autonomous stirring rather than a decision that alters tactics with visible cost. Causal pressure is moderate; swapping for "archivist" would require minor edits but not fundamentally break logic.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Setup: discovered in paragraph 3. Development: Elias secures it, notices embroidered symbols (paragraph 6), transcribes them (paragraph 7). Closure: dragons unfurl wings in the final beat, enabling the axis shift. Three distinct beats with evolving use. The object constrains investigation (symbols require magnifying glass) and charges the final image. However, the tapestry's autonomous animation slightly reduces Elias's agency at closure. Strong causal involvement but not fully indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Setup: opening paragraph and Clara's diary fragment "The axis shifted." Development: Elias realizes "the axis isn't physical...it's the line between hearing and ignoring" (paragraph 7). Closure: "The displaced axis had shifted back" in the final beat. The concept frames the investigation and reweights meaning at the end. However, it functions largely as theme and metaphor rather than a concrete constraint that narrows on-page options with visible cost. Lyric reprise with conceptual closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Setup: "sensitively perceptive gaze" in paragraph 2. The trait colors Elias's observation ("noticed something new," "using a magnifying glass") but does not constrain or enable a choice with visible cost. It remains label-level; a less perceptive character could perform the same actions with minor edits. No distinct beat where the attribute forecloses a path or creates trade-off. Ornamental use without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Setup: paragraph 2 ("probed the ashes with a brass poker"). Development: probing yields Clara's diary fragments (paragraph 4), which lead to the axis realization. Closure: the probing action seeds the investigation that culminates in the final shift. Two distinct beats with causal linkage. The action enables the escalation; swapping for "searched" would dilute specificity but not fundamentally break logic. Essential across beats but not fully indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Setup: paragraph 2 (fireplace, half-burned diaries). Development: Elias sifts through diaries to find Clara's handwriting (paragraph 4), cross-references symbols with a diary passage (paragraph 7). Closure: the method shapes the investigation and primes the realization. Two distinct beats with causal involvement. The mechanics matter (fire-damaged entries, partial text) and constrain what Elias can learn. However, the final shift depends more on recognition than on the diaries' mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Setup: opening line ("reclaimed silo library"). Development: fireplace, worktable, walls with scribbled poetry provide spatial anchors and Clara's embedded stories. Closure: Elias places palm on wall, feeling "vibrations of decades of secrets," and the walls release the chorus. The setting's unique property (walls as repository) charges the final image. However, spatial choreography is loose; the silo's constraints do not visibly narrow tactics. Lyric reprise with closure linkage but minimal causal pressure mid-scene.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Setup: opening paragraph ("After the last human dream was dreamt"). The timeframe colors atmosphere and stakes (silence, drained collective unconscious) but does not tighten decisions or impose a live clock. It functions as backstory context rather than a constraint that alters tactics on the page. Elias's investigation proceeds without temporal pressure. Present but ornamental; swappable for any post-collapse frame.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Setup: opening paragraph ("to collect the stories walls have heard"). Development: Elias's actions (probing, transcribing, cross-referencing) pursue this goal across multiple beats. Closure: placing palm on wall and opening mouth to speak dramatizes the motivation. However, no friction between want and cost appears; the motivation is stated and pursued without internal contradiction or visible sacrifice. Functional with causal involvement but lacks the complexity for higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Setup: paragraph 5 ("bronze quiet deepened"). The tone—reverent, hushed, textural—is coherent and modulates subtly (lantern glow, low hum in final beat). Closure: the hum and chorus fill the bronze quiet, reweighting it from absence to presence. The tone charges the final image and reflects the thematic shift from silence to acknowledgment. However, it does not shift sharply under peak pressure; the mood remains elegiac throughout. Solid closure linkage but static mid-scene.</comment>
