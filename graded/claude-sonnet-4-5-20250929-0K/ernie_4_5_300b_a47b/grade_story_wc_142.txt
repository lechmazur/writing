<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lira's motivation (preserve carnival soul vs. appease suits) is clearly stated but rarely embodied in contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The stone chip handling and graffiti decoding show purposeful action, yet her internal conflict feels summarized rather than lived—she moves smoothly from doubt to plan without visible cost or mistake. The final choice (standing before the Council) lacks a dramatized trade-off; the Council simply withdraws without Lira foreclosing a path or paying a price on the page. Jax and the vendors remain functional props rather than sources of immediate relational pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads Causal with some Accumulative texture (graffiti symbols accruing meaning). Orientation anchors who/where/when adequately by the opening paragraph. The closure unit—Council withdrawal after Lira's visual argument—occurs on the page but the cost is abstract: "The fight wasn't over" tells rather than shows a forfeited option or altered relationship. The spiral-square symbol discovery and vendor map construction provide one meaningful tightening, but the Council's retreat feels coincidental (they "withdrew" without Lira's action forcing a trade-off), weakening causal closure. The chip's role as historical anchor is set up but its presence at the confrontation does not decisively alter tactics or cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The carnival's layered sensory detail (fried dough, diesel, striped tents, neon) grounds the opening vividly. The Alley of Whispers and the drowning-clown mural provide purposeful micro-setting that Lira touches and decodes, shaping her plan. The stone chip—polished, mounted, handled—recurs with tactile specificity and charges the final confrontation image, qualifying as object-as-setting. Spatial choreography (raft walkways, gilded barge arrival) remains clear. However, the carnival's floating mechanics and vendor zones are told more than shown constraining choices; the setting enriches atmosphere but does not force a physical trade-off at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>One dominant stake (preserve carnival autonomy vs. privatization) is signaled early. Pressure tightens through the graffiti-mapping plan and the Council confrontation, but escalation lacks a visible price: Lira's reorganization succeeds without apparent cost, and the Council's withdrawal is narrated passively ("withdrew") rather than forced by a sacrifice or tactical gamble on Lira's part. The spiral-square symbol provides one reversal (deadline warning) that narrows options. Jax's torch-lit solidarity adds texture but does not impose a new complication. The ending offers hope without foreclosing a path or dramatizing what Lira has given up to achieve this temporary victory.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Theme (chaos needs structure to survive; rebellion vs. efficiency) emerges from the graffiti reorganization and the stone chip as historical anchor. The drowning-clown mural with dollar-sign eyes carries clear subtext without over-explaining. However, the final exchange—"You can't privatize rebellion"—edges toward thematic declaration, and the last paragraph's "chaos tempered by purpose, its future unwritten but possible" summarizes the question rather than leaving it resonant in image. The stone chip's return to Lira's pocket offers a quiet reprise, but the conceptual repricing lacks bite; no counter-reading complicates the hopeful close.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Lira; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature (orderly intuition, decoding symbols) is consistent and character-specific. Dialogue feels goal-driven: Jax's "You're a madwoman" and the Council leader's icy scoff carry subtext and advance conflict. However, several exchanges ("She's right. This isn't just a market. It's a home.") flatten into thesis statements at the climax, reducing indirection. Free indirect style is clean, and diction stays within Lira's register. Psychic distance remains controlled, though the final paragraph's reflective summary ("dual allegiance had never been easy") tells rather than showing her stance under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Sentence variety and clarity are generally strong; no major loops or template cadence. The opening paragraph packs setting, conflict, and the chip's significance efficiently. However, several beats rely on summary where scene would sharpen: "Over the next week, Lira reorganized the carnival's visual language" compresses the central action into a single sentence, losing dramatized struggle. The phrase "dual allegiance" appears twice as a thematic label, bordering on scaffold. The Council's withdrawal ("their barge retreating into the mist") uses soft, generic imagery that dulls the closure beat. Proofreading is clean; no grammar or continuity errors noted.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The floating carnival and graffiti-as-resistance map offer a fresh synthesis, and the "culture shock absorber" role adds occupational specificity. However, the core conflict (gentrification resistance via collective art) closely tracks familiar activist-narrative templates without a non-obvious moral calculus or lived detail that transforms the premise. The Council's retreat feels predictable, and the ending's hopeful note ("the carnival held") resolves tension without risk or surprise. The stone chip as historical anchor and the spiral-square symbol system show ingenuity in execution, but the emotional arc and plot beats do not offer a turn that reweights prior material in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lira's role as "culture shock absorber" is named early, shapes her mediation tactics (reorganizing vendor graffiti), and drives the Council confrontation. She appears in all major beats and her occupational lens (decoding symbols, balancing old vs. new) directly enables the graffiti map plan. However, her choices do not impose a visible cost or force a trade-off at closure; the Council withdraws without Lira sacrificing a relationship, resource, or tactic. Setup, development, and payoff gates are met, but causal pressure and cost connection remain moderate.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The foundation stone chip appears in four beats: opening (clutched in pocket), Alley tracing, polished and mounted, held up at Council confrontation, and returned to pocket at close. It anchors the carnival's history and symbolizes Lira's dual allegiance. However, its presence does not constrain a choice or alter tactics—Lira could argue her case without it. The chip's meaning remains static (historical link) rather than reweighted under pressure. Setup, development, and closure participation are present, but causal necessity and cost are low.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dual allegiance (preserve carnival soul vs. appease investors) is stated early and frames Lira's stakes throughout. It shapes her reorganization plan (amplify vendor voices while demonstrating order) and her argument to the Council ("You call this chaos, but it's order"). The concept drives the central conflict and informs the final image (chip in pocket, hope flickering). However, the allegiance is told more than dramatized in contradictory impulses; Lira does not visibly sacrifice one loyalty for the other at closure. Setup, development, and thematic payoff are present, but on-page cost tied to the duality is absent.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Orderly intuitive" is named once ("Lira's orderly intuition told her this balance was fraying") and shown in her graffiti decoding and layout reorganization. The trait enables her plan but does not impose a visible trade-off or constraint—her intuition succeeds without error or cost. It shapes one beat (symbol interpretation) but does not reappear at closure or create friction. Setup gate met, development weak, closure absent. Swappable with "analytical" or "strategic" without structural change.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Reorganize" appears in the title of Lira's role (reorganizing layout for years), her core plan (reorganize the carnival's visual language via graffiti map), and the closing image (walking through reorganized alleys). The action drives the middle turn (vendors' graffiti becomes cohesive design) and enables the Council argument. It is signaled early, shapes two major beats, and charges the final line. However, the reorganization itself is summarized ("Over the next week...") rather than shown in a single dramatized choice with cost, limiting irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Graffiti messages are introduced early (protests scrawled on tent walls, mural with spiral-square symbol) and analyzed across multiple beats (Lira decoding, meeting vendors at dawn, translating into banners). The method enables her argument to the Council ("Every symbol, every color, has a purpose") and shapes the middle escalation (rallying cry). Setup, development, and payoff gates met. However, the mechanics remain abstract—how symbols constrain Council choices or impose cost on Lira is told, not shown. Causal pressure is moderate; specificity and irreplaceability are present but do not reach high bands.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The Perpetual Carnival is anchored vividly in the opening (raft city, striped tents, neon, floating bazaar) and recurs in the Alley of Whispers, vendor zones, and the gilded barge arrival. The setting provides atmosphere and grounds Lira's mediation work. The raft structure and layered docks supply backstory (original docks buried beneath tourist traps). However, the carnival's floating mechanics do not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters the outcome—Lira's plan works regardless of the raft-city setting. Setup strong, development atmospheric, closure linkage weak. Swappable with any contested public market without breaking plot.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The privatization threat is named early ("new-money investors threatening to privatize") and frames all conflict. The spiral-square symbol warns of a "looming deadline," and the Council's arrival on a barge marks the confrontation beat. However, the timeframe remains vague—no explicit clock tightens decisions, and the "next week" summary elides pressure. The element is present in setup and payoff but does not visibly accelerate tactics or impose a time-based trade-off. Functional across beats but replaceable with "during negotiations" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Lira's desire to navigate gentrification (balance carnival preservation with investor demands) is stated early and drives every major beat: decoding vendor resistance, creating the graffiti map, confronting the Council. The motivation shapes her argument ("You can't privatize rebellion") and the final image (carnival still afloat). However, the friction between wants and costs is told rather than dramatized—Lira does not visibly give up a relationship, resource, or belief to achieve the temporary victory. Setup, development, and thematic closure met; on-page cost low.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Tone blends desperation (drowning-clown mural, vendors' protests, privatization threat) and hope (Lira's plan, vendors' solidarity, carnival holds). The mix is coherent and modulates through escalation (symbol discovery intensifies urgency, Council confrontation peaks tension, withdrawal restores hope). The final line ("its future unwritten but possible") lands squarely in the tone. However, the balance tips toward uplift without maintaining desperation's edge at closure—the Council simply leaves, deflating stakes. Tone is present and consistent but does not charge the final image with unresolved pressure.</comment>
