<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elias is given occupational color ("disaster-relief logistician") and a quirk ("desperately jocular"), but both remain labels rather than shaping on-page choices. His motivations are declared ("cure for loneliness") yet never face a genuine internal conflict or trade-off; he follows Lira's instructions without meaningful resistance. The final "chest didn't ache as much" is asserted relief rather than earned transformation through prior contradiction. Lira functions as exposition delivery rather than applying relationship pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors arrive within the first paragraph (who, where, when). The piece attempts a Hybrid lens—Causal setup (moon rock as catalyst) blending into Accumulative/Textural closure (the station "lighter," ivy "less suffocating")—but the conductor's speech resolves the conflict through explanation rather than on-page cost or action. The closure unit reads as Conceptual Repricing ("loneliness is a language"), yet the conceptual cost remains abstract; no visible forfeiture or tactical shift anchors the repricing. The rumor-chain method is mentioned but never dramatized as a constraint or tactic.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The disused station, ivy, and graffiti are vivid and atmosphere-rich, but setting details do not constrain choices or alter tactics. The chamber, tracks, and signal lever are named yet remain inert props; Elias and Lira move through the space without the environment pressing back. The ivy "shivering" and the station "breathing" at the climax are sensory flourishes that do not shape the outcome, missing the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake ("cure for loneliness") is signaled early, but Elias never faces a meaningful tightening or trade-off. The conductor's arrival shifts the scene from quest to lecture; the ghost "negotiates" off-page, and the rock simply "flares" without Elias making a decisive choice. The resolution hinges on the conductor's monologue rather than protagonist agency, and no visible price (time, stamina, opportunity) is paid on the page to earn the repricing.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The theme of loneliness-as-language emerges through the conductor's speech, but this is direct statement rather than dramatized particulars. The moon rock's "reciprocity" is told rather than shown through constrained choices. The final image (station "lighter," chest "didn't ache as much") gestures toward resonance, yet the repricing lacks the on-page cost or specific earned insight that would elevate it beyond a gentle assertion. "Polite anarchy" remains a label without thematic friction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, and Elias's perceptual filter is present (boots, moon rock warmth). Dialogue carries some subtext ("Ghosts don't eat rocks. They eat regrets"), but the conductor's speech shifts into expository register ("Loneliness is a plague? No. It's a language.") that reads as thematic delivery rather than character-specific idiom. Lira's voice ("Polite anarchy, remember?") leans on prompt-echo phrasing. Diction remains controlled, but rhythmic pressure does not escalate at the climax; the conductor's monologue flattens momentum.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Opening anchors voice and stakes cleanly. However, multiple paraphrase loops appear: "choked with ivy" / "overgrown with ivy" / "wall of ivy"; "loneliness" recurs in adjacent beats without added pressure. Template cadence is visible in "She led… She said… She paused…" and "Elias stared… Elias realized…" runs. The conductor's climactic speech uses elevated, abstract diction ("language," "space between") that sits above the POV's texture. Filter-verb stack ("felt a surge," "realized his chest didn't ache") dulls immediacy at closure. Stock metaphor: "static" face, "dervishes" shadows.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The premise (moon rock as catalyst for a station ghost; rumor-driven quest) combines familiar genre elements without a fresh synthesis. "Polite anarchy" and "improbable truths" are prompt tokens rather than transformative angles. The conductor's reveal ("loneliness is a language") restates a therapeutic commonplace. Lira's botanist-turned-truth-chaser backstory is mentioned but not integrated into causality. The emotional beat (chest ache relief) follows a median resolution arc without risk or specificity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Elias is present throughout and holds the moon rock, but his occupation ("disaster-relief logistician") does not shape tactics or choices. He follows Lira's instructions without invoking logistical knowledge or experience. "Elusive" and "vanishing before paperwork" are setup color that do not constrain action. His decision to step forward and speak to the conductor is not a turn; the conductor's monologue resolves the conflict. Missing middle development and causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The moon rock is introduced early (paragraph 1), handled across multiple beats (Lira identifies it, Elias places it on the lever, it pulses and flares), and returns with reweighted meaning ("reciprocity binds everything"). It participates in the closure beat (the flare and the conductor's nod). However, the rock's mechanics are told rather than shown; Lira explains its purpose, and it activates passively. Removing it would require plot substitution, but it does not constrain Elias's choices or impose cost.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Reciprocity" is named three times (geologist's gift, Lira's explanation, conductor's acknowledgment) and frames the conceptual stakes. Yet it remains thematic assertion rather than shaping on-page tactics; Elias does not weigh a reciprocal cost or make a trade-off. The conductor's "You give, you take" articulates the concept but does not dramatize it. Functional theme marker, but swappable with "balance" or "exchange" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Desperately jocular" is named in paragraph 1 and appears twice more ("jocular bark," "jocularity no longer a shield but a bridge"). The trait is labeled rather than embodied in specific speech or gesture; Elias's one joke ("Ghosts don't eat rocks") is clever but not desperate. The final line claims transformation ("no longer a shield") without showing the prior defensive use or the cost of dropping it. Ornamental trait.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Catalyze" appears in Lira's line ("to catalyze a reaction") and the ending ("We catalyzed a conversation"). The action structures the quest, but the catalysis itself occurs off-page: the rock flares, the conductor appears, and the resolution is delivered through his speech. Elias does not perform a catalyzing action; the rock does. The word frames intent but does not drive a decisive turn. Mid-band functional use with closure mention but low causal agency.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Improbable rumor chains" are mentioned in the opening and Lira's backstory ("The rumor started here," "rumor to find us"). The method is named but not demonstrated; we do not see a rumor travel, mutate, or impose a constraint. Lira explains the conductor's rumor origin, yet this does not alter tactics. The ending nods to "rumor chains" again, but the method remains decoration rather than a shaping constraint.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The disused railway station is anchored early and used across multiple beats (platform, tunnel, chamber, tracks, signal lever). Ivy recurs and "shivers" at the climax. However, the setting does not pressure choices; Elias and Lira navigate it without spatial obstacles or resource constraints. The "wall of ivy" does not block or cost them. The station's final state ("lighter," "less suffocating") signals change but does not impose closure cost. Functional scene container with atmospheric charge but low tactical necessity.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"When the story changes" is not dramatized as a timeframe. Elias has been at the station "three days," but this duration does not tighten decisions. "Minutes ticked by" before the ghost appears, yet no clock pressure is felt. The narrative is sequential but not time-bound; removing all time references would leave the plot unchanged. Ornamental temporal mentions.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>"Cure for loneliness" is named as Elias's goal in paragraph 1 and repeated in his speech to the conductor. The motivation frames the quest and the thematic question. However, Elias's loneliness is asserted ("chest didn't ache as much") rather than dramatized through conflicted choices or visceral cost. The desire is present and closure-adjacent but not tested against a competing want or fear. Functional stake with thematic closure mention but low friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Polite anarchy" is named twice by Lira and claimed in the ending ("Polite anarchy wins again"). The tone blends whimsy (ivy as "second heartbeat," bioluminescent graffiti) with conversational wit, but does not modulate under pressure; the conductor's climactic monologue is earnest rather than anarchic. The final image (Elias's grin, "no longer a shield but a bridge") softens into warmth rather than charged rebellion. Tone is coherent but static, not reweighted at closure.</comment>
