<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elias's claustrophobia is asserted multiple times but never meaningfully constrains a choice—it "flares" then is "forgotten in the thrill." The compass-point stabbing feels unmotivated; we're told he's "prudently adventurous" but his actions read as generic fantasy-hero moves without internal contradiction or embodied cost. The final walk through the gateway carries no visible price or foreclosed path; the "wistful rebellion" label appears only in the closing line without prior dramatization.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story establishes who/where/when within opening lines (waiving orientation penalty). Drive lens reads Causal but linkage weakens: the compass spins wildly, then inexplicably "stills" when jabbed into a wall, delivering the key without clear because/therefore logic. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration ("prison" becomes "gateway") but the cost is asserted rather than felt—Elias walks forward with the same stance he held at the start, and no option is visibly foreclosed on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The cathedral's "shadowed nexus under starlight" and stained-glass blues/golds offer vivid anchor detail. The corridor's spatial warping ("walls bending like rubber") provides one moment where environment complicates movement. The compass point's stabbing stills the corridor, a micro-constraint, but the ending's dissolution of walls feels ornamental rather than a choice-shaping pressure. Spatial choreography remains mostly coherent.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (retrieve the key) is signaled early. One reversal occurs when the corridor twists and the key flickers, forcing the compass-stab tactic, but that choice feels convenient rather than costly—the compass works because the plot requires it. The cathedral's "shuddering" after he takes the key hints at consequence but dissolves into the gateway moment without on-page cost or tightened options. No visible trade-off at closure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Wistful rebellion" is declared in the final line without prior embodiment in choices or images. The organ and starlight recur but function as atmospheric set-dressing rather than images that accumulate pressure or reweight at closure. The theme of "prison to gateway" is stated rather than earned through particulars; the ending offers a label ("It was a gateway") instead of a resonant final image that answers the central question without exposition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Elias. Diction stays consistent (no head-hopping), though phrases like "spatial mutiny" and "transfixing force" feel elevated beyond the character's lexicon during high-pressure beats. Interior access is clean; no unmotivated filter-verb stacks. The organ "as if guided by an invisible hand" leans toward cliché, and the final "wistful rebellion in his heart" imports a tone not established in prior interiority.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and clarity is mostly maintained. Several template stems appear: "He'd come... He'd prepared... He'd earned..." clusters in the middle third, creating minor cadence monotony (−0.4). "Prudently adventurous" repeats as a label without embodied action. The organ's "mournful note" and "dirge" paraphrase emotion rather than specify sound or effect. No severe loops touch closure, but density sags in expository beats ("The fallow period had left...") that summarize rather than advance.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The cathedral-organ-key quest reads as a familiar fantasy template without sharp transformation. "Spatial mutiny" is an intriguing phrase but remains abstract; the corridor's bending and the compass-stab solution feel generic rather than inevitable. The "prison to gateway" final reframe echoes threshold-crossing conventions without a non-obvious synthesis or lived specificity that would make the turn feel fresh.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elias is present throughout and makes the compass-stab decision, but "claustrophobic" is asserted three times without altering a tactic. His choices (lunge, stab, walk through) are not visibly constrained by claustrophobia; it "flares" then vanishes for convenience, making the trait ornamental rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The compass appears in three beats: pocket-touch anchor (first third), erratic spinning (middle), and wall-stab (climax). It enables the key's delivery, but the mechanics are vague—why does stabbing the wall still the corridor? The compass seeds early and participates in closure, meeting two gates, but its causal logic feels convenient rather than irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Spatial mutiny" is named once mid-story as a label for the corridor's twisting. It describes the cathedral's resistance but does not shape Elias's tactics beyond the single compass-stab; the concept could be replaced with "labyrinth" or "trap" without altering the plot. Present but not causal.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Prudently adventurous" is stated twice as a summary label. Elias's actions (lunging, running, stabbing) read as standard hero moves without visible friction between caution and boldness. No on-page moment where prudence constrains an impulse or adventure overrides caution with cost; the trait is ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Transfix" appears once as "a transfixing force" that lets Elias glimpse the key, creating one reversal (the vision then dissolves). The organ's effect enables the corridor-of-light chase, but the verb itself is not central—"compel" or "draw" would function equivalently. Contributes to one beat but is not structurally indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The church organ is seeded early (silent cathedral, then "low mournful note"), drives the middle vision-beat ("transfixing force"), and its song follows Elias into the corridor before cutting off at the climax. It appears in setup, middle, and near-closure, shaping two beats. Mechanics remain abstract ("reverberation") but presence across the arc and role in triggering the vision lift it above mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The "shadowed nexus under starlight" is named in the opening line and closing paragraph, forming a frame. Starlight filters through glass and becomes a "guiding path" in the corridor, but the nexus itself does not constrain a choice—Elias moves freely. The reprise reweights (prison→gateway) but only through assertion; the setting is evocative yet functionally passive.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>1.2</grade><comment>"Fallow period" is mentioned once in the second sentence as historical context (centuries of silence). It does not create urgency, tighten a decision, or alter Elias's tactics. Time is vague throughout; no clock pressure. The timeframe is ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The desire to "uncover a vital key lost to time" is stated in the opening, motivates Elias's presence, and pays off when he seizes the key at climax. The goal drives two beats (vision-glimpse, corridor-chase) and closure delivers the object. Friction between want and cost is thin—he obtains the key without visible sacrifice—but the motivation anchors the arc and participates in all three gates.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"Wistful rebellion" is declared in the final sentence without prior embodiment. The organ's "dirge" and "lament for lost causes" hint at melancholy, and "rebellion" might map to defying the cathedral, but neither tone is woven through Elias's interiority or choices. The label is imported at closure rather than modulated across pressure; tone remains generically tense until the final assertion.</comment>
