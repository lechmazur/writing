<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Lirael's motivation ("discover the texture of borrowed time") is asserted rather than rooted in scene pressure, and her interior reads as a vehicle for world-building rather than contradictory impulse. The "furiously tranquil" label is declared but never embodied in a micro-choice that shows competing drives in action. The grandmother's voice and the creature's hiss offer texture, but Lirael herself remains static—her actions proceed without visible internal friction or hierarchy of values under test. The ending laugh feels unearned; no prior beat dramatized the cost or forfeiture that would make wild joy legible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive clearly in the opening. The egg hatching provides a structural through-line, and the vortex demands a sacrifice, but the closure—sprouting seeds, creature vanishing, sapling appearing—unfolds via assertion rather than causal linkage the reader can trace. The stated paradox (introduce disorder to decrease entropy) is told, not dramatized through on-page choices with visible tradeoffs. The final image (melting ice, diamond dust, wild laugh) offers lyric resonance but no legible cost that forecloses a path or reweights prior stakes. Under a Causal lens the closure unit lacks visible because/therefore; under Accumulative the pattern does not tighten or break with pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The icebound atrium, starlight dome, and ice are vividly rendered and the acorn cap's spirals return with charged meaning at the climax. Spatial choreography (egg at center, seeds scattered, creature rearing) remains coherent. The setting does not constrain a choice—Lirael's actions proceed unimpeded by environment—but the melting ice and diamond dust charge the final image. Sensory detail (frost, breath fog, glaciers grinding) is selective and POV-filtered, supporting tone without catalog padding.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake (reopen the path via vortex sacrifice) is signaled early, but escalation reads as a sequence of described transformations rather than narrowing options. Lirael faces no on-page obstacle or adaptive pressure; the creature cooperates, the seeds sprout instantly, and the vortex "pulls" her without resistance. The final state (sapling, melting ice) arrives without a legible trade-off or foreclosed alternative. Under the inferred lens (Causal/Accumulative hybrid), one meaningful tightening or deepening is required; here the protagonist's actions do not force a choice with visible cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The central question—what is the texture of borrowed time—receives an answer ("gritty like sand, smooth like water") but it arrives as abstract summary rather than emerging from concrete scene particulars. The paradox of decreasing entropy by introducing disorder is stated twice but never tested through a micro-choice that reveals thematic friction. The oak sapling and melting ice offer a non-literal closing image, but the connection to prior material (heirloom seeds, generational inheritance) is ornamental rather than reweighted by the ending. The "furiously tranquil" motif is declared, not embodied or charged at closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Lirael; no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and consistent ("vortex inheritance," "wild serenity," "frozen lake clarity") but approaches stock fantasy register in peak beats ("twin voids that swallowed the starlight"). The creature's dialogue ("You are the keeper") and Lirael's reply feel scripted rather than goal-driven. Psychic distance holds, and the closing laugh modulates tone, but perceptual signature is generic—Lirael's way of noticing (spirals, frost, starlight) could belong to any fantasy narrator. Free indirect style is clean; no filter-verb stacks.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Sentence openings vary and paragraph rhythm supports visual pacing. Clarity is adequate, but several beats carry paraphrase loops: "the vortex inheritance was not a force to be controlled but negotiated with" echoes the prior paragraph's sacrifice logic without added pressure. Stock metaphors cluster in the climax ("tunnel of swirling light," "sea of borrowed moments," "green flames"). The egg-crack sequence and seed-scattering beats advance with propulsion, but the vortex dive summarizes rather than dramatizes. Template cadence appears in adjacent lines ("It was like… the shock, the breathlessness, the sudden clarity" / "It was a paradox, a tension…"). No major loops touch the closure image, capping deduction at −0.8 under the artifact pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The premise (seed-saver guarding time-vortex via entropy manipulation) synthesizes familiar elements (heirloom keeper, mystical egg, ice cavern) without a non-obvious inflection. The entropy paradox is stated but not transformed through a specific choice or moral calculus unique to this protagonist. The ending (creature → sapling) follows a predictable rebirth arc. Emotional honesty is present in the "wild and free" laugh, but the core turn (scattering seeds triggers vortex reopening) could swap for many other ritual acts with minor edits. No bold structural risk or close echo of famous material; the piece stays in the safety middle of fantasy tropes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Lirael's profession (heirloom seed saver) is present throughout and motivates her possession of the acorn cap and beans. She makes two key on-page choices: placing the acorn cap and scattering seeds. Both are setup/ritual moves that do not face adaptive pressure or visible cost; she decides to act but the narrative does not hinge on a difficult choice between competing goods. The role is functional but the seed-saver identity could swap for "artifact keeper" or "ritual guardian" without deep revision. Present in closure (sapling), but the sapling is result rather than choice.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The oak acorn cap appears in paragraph one (inheritance anchor), is placed on ice at the climax (ritual focus), and its spirals spin as the vortex opens. It is handled in three distinct beats and returns with reweighted meaning as the sapling emerges. The cap does not constrain a choice—Lirael uses it as intended—but it charges the closure image by transforming into the oak sapling. Setup and payoff are clear; middle development (the cap vibrating, spirals spinning) adds causal texture. Specificity (spirals "older than the stars") distinguishes it from a generic token.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The vortex inheritance is declared as a force shaping the premise and named repeatedly, but its mechanics remain abstract. The stated rule (decrease entropy by introducing disorder) is told rather than dramatized through on-page choices with visible tradeoffs. The vortex pulls Lirael into a tunnel of light, but the experience is summarized ("time lost meaning," "sea of borrowed moments") without tactical constraint. It functions as a setting for the climax but does not alter her options in a way the reader can trace. Functional but replaceable with any mystical portal/force.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Furiously tranquil" is declared as a mindset ("act with precision while riding the edge of chaos") and mentioned twice, but no on-page beat shows contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Lirael's actions proceed smoothly without friction between calm and fury. The attribute is label-only; removing it would not alter the plot or her choices. No cost or constraint tied to this trait appears on the page.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Reopen the path" is the dominant goal stated in paragraph one and restated at closure. The action structures all beats: egg hatching triggers the need, placing the cap and scattering seeds are the means, the vortex dive is the climax, and "reopened the path" is the final claim. The creature, seeds, and sapling all serve this action. Removing "reopen" would require fundamental rewrites; swapping for "seal" or "guard" would invert the arc. Causal spine is clear; cost (what path was foreclosed) is not.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The method "decrease entropy" is stated explicitly as the vortex's demand, and the paradox (introduce disorder to decrease entropy) is declared twice. The mechanics appear on the page (seeds sprouting and dying will fuel the vortex), but the process is explained rather than tested. Lirael does not grapple with how much disorder is safe or face a miscalculation. The method shapes the ritual logic but does not constrain a mid-action choice or show visible cost. Functional but summary-only; swappable with "increase order" or "offer life-force" with modest edits.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The icebound atrium under starlight is vividly established and appears in every beat: frost, ice, crystalline dome, melting ice at closure. The setting provides the ritual stage and the ice's melting charges the final image. It does not constrain a choice—Lirael's actions are enabled, not hindered, by the space—but the visual contrast (cold ice, green flames, diamond dust) supports tone and theme. Early setup, sustained presence, strong closure linkage. The atrium is irreplaceable as the visual anchor but does not pressure tactics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the egg hatches" anchors the opening ("had begun to crack three nights prior," "the final shard fell away") and the hatching triggers Lirael's action. The narrative proceeds in one continuous sequence with no clock pressure; Lirael waits, then acts when ready. The timeframe sets the premise but does not tighten decisions or force trade-offs. Functional as a story anchor but swappable with "when the moon rises" or "at the appointed hour" without deep revision.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The motivation "discover the texture of borrowed time" is stated in paragraph two and answered in the vortex dive ("gritty like sand, smooth like water"). It is told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants or costs. No on-page beat shows Lirael weighing this desire against another value or paying a price to pursue it. The motivation frames the premise but does not create friction or alter her tactics. Summary-only; removing it would not break the plot.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Wild serenity" is invoked explicitly and echoed in descriptions (starlight hues, cold seeping into the soul, "furiously tranquil"). The tone is coherent across beats and modulates at closure (wild laughter). The paradoxical pairing (wild + serenity) mirrors the entropy paradox and charges the final image, but the tone does not constrain a choice or deepen under pressure—it remains decorative. Present in closure (wild laugh), but the tone could shift to "cold determination" or "fierce clarity" with surface edits. Lyric resonance without causal necessity.</comment>
