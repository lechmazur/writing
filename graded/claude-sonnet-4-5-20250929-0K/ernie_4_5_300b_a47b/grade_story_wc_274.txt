<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lirael's motivation to awaken Kael is established, but her internal conflict is largely told rather than shown through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The phrase "bravely conflicted heart" is a label that replaces embodied tension. Her decision point arrives with minimal on-page struggle—she trembles, but the weight of crossing this threshold isn't dramatized through micro-choices that reveal competing values. Kael's awakening and their exchange feel rushed, with his immediate understanding skipping the confusion or anger that would test Lirael's resolve.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The story anchors who/where/when adequately early. Drive lens reads as Causal: Lirael's decision to activate the chamber triggers Kael's awakening and sets revolution in motion. However, the closure beat—their silent pact and the revolution's beginning—asserts consequence rather than dramatizing a felt cost on the page. The final image tells us "the revolution began" without showing what Lirael or Kael forfeit or risk in that exact moment. One meaningful tightening occurs (chamber activation), but the ending relies on declaration ("there was no going back") rather than a visible, irreversible act or realization that reconfigures their options.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The echoing library under snow is vividly rendered with cryo-chambers, frosted glass, and liquid nitrogen, establishing atmosphere. Spatial choreography is mostly clear, though the library's scale and Lirael's movements within it remain somewhat generic. The setting pressures Lirael's choice by housing the frozen truths and Kael, but doesn't constrain her tactics—she accesses the chamber without obstacle. The cryo-chamber itself (a tool/object) enables the key turn, which lifts the score, but the broader library environment functions more as backdrop than active constraint on the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether to awaken Kael and risk Council wrath—is signaled early. One meaningful tightening occurs when Lirael slides the letter into the control panel, narrowing her options. However, the escalation lacks a visible price at closure: the story asserts the Council will come and the revolution begins, but no on-page consequence or trade-off is dramatized in the final beat. The coincidence of Kael's immediate understanding and cooperation resolves tension too smoothly. Agency is present in Lirael's decision, but the cost remains projected rather than paid.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme of truth versus censorship emerges organically from Lirael's conflict and the contraband letter. The final exchange—"Because the truth matters"—states theme directly, bordering on thematic echo, though it's brief and rooted in her action. The "revolution began" framing offers a resonant answer to whether one person can challenge institutional silence, but the ending leans toward summary ("spread the word," "ignite a fire") rather than a concrete image that reweights prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates in the "unspoken conversation" motif, though it's somewhat over-explained.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited on Lirael; no head-hopping. Voice carries a measured, slightly elevated register ("ghostly plume," "dizzying quiet") that fits an archivist's perspective but occasionally drifts toward generic literary diction. The phrase "bravely conflicted her way into this moment" is a forced construction that disrupts naturalism. Kael's single line of dialogue ("Why?") is functional but thin; Lirael's response is clear but lacks subtext. Psychic distance is consistent, though filter verbs ("she knew," "she could hear") appear frequently without harm. Internal texture is present but not highly distinctive.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Several prose artifacts weaken momentum: "bravely conflicted" as a verb is a strained coinage; "within the blink that follows surprise" is ornamental phrasing that doesn't anchor time concretely; "dizzying quiet" recurs without accumulating pressure. Paraphrase loops appear: "The library's echoes seemed to hold their breath" and "the dizzying quiet of the library" restate atmosphere without advancing action. Template cadence is mild but present in mid-section exposition about the Council and rebels. Information density is moderate; some sentences (e.g., the rebels spreading word) summarize rather than dramatize. No major clarity breaks, but cumulative scaffold and figurative excess in non-peak beats lower the score.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The cryogenic archivist and frozen radical setup is familiar sci-fi/dystopia territory; the transformation is minimal. The "contraband truths" and Council censorship follow a recognizable template without a fresh angle on surveillance or historical erasure. Lirael's choice to awaken Kael is straightforward, lacking a non-obvious moral calculus or risk that would distinguish the premise. The ending's "revolution began" is a stock conclusion. Emotional specificity is present in Lirael's trembling and heartbeat, but the arc—lone dissenter sparks uprising—reads derivative without lived detail or world logic that would make this exact synthesis feel inevitable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Lirael is present throughout and her decision to activate the chamber is the key turn. However, much of her arc is observational or reflective; the single decisive action (sliding the letter into the panel) drives the plot, but her choices don't alter tactics or reveal a hierarchy of values across multiple beats. She appears in setup, middle, and closure, meeting all three gates, and the final handoff of the letter adds a second beat, but the causal pressure is limited to one major choice.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The letter is introduced early (setup gate met), smuggled "through dormant networks," and contains the contraband truths that motivate Lirael's action (development gate met). It's physically handled twice: inserted into the control panel and handed to Kael at the end (closure gate met). However, its properties don't constrain choice—any evidence could serve the same function. The letter's meaning doesn't reweight across beats; it remains a static token of rebellion. Two beats plus closure participation lift it to mid-band, but swappability and lack of evolving significance cap the score.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Contraband truths are mentioned repeatedly and frame the central conflict: the Council erased history, the letter contains evidence, Lirael believes truth matters. The concept is present in setup and development, and the ending asserts the truths will spread. However, the concept operates more as thematic backdrop than a force that changes on-page options. Lirael's tactics aren't shaped by the specific nature of the truths—she awakens Kael because he represents them, but we don't see her weigh which truths to reveal or how they constrain her choices. Closure participation is weak; the revolution is declared but not dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Bravely conflicted" appears twice: once as a descriptor of Lirael's heart and once as a forced verb ("bravely conflicted her way into this moment"). Neither instance constrains an on-page action with visible cost; the phrase labels internal tension rather than dramatizing contradictory impulses. Setup gate is met (early mention), but development and closure participation are absent—no specific choice is enabled or foreclosed by this trait. The attribute reads ornamental, closer to theme echo than actionable character dimension.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Lirael's awakening of Kael will "scandalize the city" according to the text, and the ending asserts her actions are "scandalizing the city." However, the scandal itself is told rather than shown on the page—no Council reaction, no public outcry, no on-page consequence that defines the scandal's shape. Setup and development gates are met (Lirael fears Council response, takes the risk), and closure mentions it, but the action's major turn is the awakening itself, not the scandal. The scandal could be replaced with "provoke" or "ignite rebellion" with minimal edits; it's a consequence rather than a dramatized event.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Through dormant networks" appears twice: the letter was smuggled through them, and at the end "through dormant networks, the rebels would spread the word." The method is mentioned in setup and closure but never shapes on-page attempts or constrains tactics. We don't see Lirael use the networks, navigate their risks, or have her choices limited by their mechanics. The phrase functions as world-building flavor rather than a means that matters to escalation. Development gate is missing; closure participation is a summary mention only.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The echoing library under snow is present throughout: "The echoing library under snow held its breath" opens the story, shelves and cryo-chambers populate the middle, and the final paragraph returns to "the echoing library under snow" where "the revolution began." All three gates are met. The library provides the cryo-chamber that enables Lirael's key action, giving it some causal pressure, and the setting charges the final image through its recurrence. However, the environment doesn't constrain Lirael's choices—she accesses the chamber without obstacle—and the snow/echo motifs are atmospheric rather than tactically relevant. The reprise reweights mood but not stakes.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"Within the blink that follows surprise" appears once, describing the moment Kael will be awakened. The timeframe is metaphorical rather than a live clock that tightens decisions; Lirael doesn't race against time or alter tactics under temporal pressure. The phrase is ornamental, present in the middle beat but absent from setup and closure. No gate is fully satisfied—it doesn't frame expectation early, doesn't constrain a middle choice (Lirael proceeds at her own pace), and doesn't appear in the ending. The story's pacing is leisurely, not urgent.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Lirael's desire "to provoke an unspoken conversation" is stated explicitly and frames her motivation: the Council buried conversations, the letter could "provoke an unspoken conversation," and Lirael believes it's time someone spoke. Setup and development gates are met, and closure references the conversation's beginning. However, the motivation is told more than dramatized—we don't see Lirael wrestle with competing wants (preserving the archive vs. provoking change) in a way that creates on-page friction. Her decision arrives with minimal visible cost, and the "unspoken conversation" remains abstract rather than a specific exchange or confrontation that tests her commitment.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Dizzying quiet" appears three times: "the dizzying quiet of the archive," "the dizzying quiet of the library," and "the dizzying quiet now filled with the promise of change." The tone is present in setup and closure, and modulates slightly at the end (quiet "filled with promise"). However, the repetition is somewhat mechanical, and the tone doesn't vary with pressure—Lirael's peak stress (activating the chamber) and the calmer reflection receive similar atmospheric treatment. The phrase charges the final image by shifting from oppressive to hopeful, but the effect is asserted ("now filled with") rather than enacted through rhythm or sensory shift. Mid-band for recurrence and mild closure participation, but static execution limits the score.</comment>
