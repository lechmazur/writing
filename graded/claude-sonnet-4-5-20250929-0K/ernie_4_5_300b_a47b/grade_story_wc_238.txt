<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Clara's interior voice shows controlled specificity ("regret was her currency"), and the final choice to guide Elias through completion feels earned by her professional stance. However, the sister Lila remains a narrative convenience rather than a felt presence, and Clara's motivation shifts from skeptical exorcist to metaphor-wielding facilitator without visible internal friction. Elias's guilt is declared rather than embodied in contradictory micro-choices under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: Hybrid (causal setup with accumulative/textural closure through the charged musical performance). Orientation anchors arrive cleanly within the first paragraph. The closure—Elias finishing the song to release the resonance—lands on the page with a visible cost (the bottle emptied, the chainsaws resume), but the causal link between the perfume drop and the sister's voice feels introduced rather than set up, weakening the because/therefore chain at the pivotal beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The archive is anchored early with sensory detail ("dust smelled of regret," "yellowed scores") and the piano's soundboard becomes a micro-setting that channels the climactic action. The orchard and chainsaws frame temporal pressure. The perfume bottle's copper wings and the piano's wood constrain the magical logic, charging the final image when the bottle empties and the chainsaws roar.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Elias reconnecting with his sister's memory—is signaled by midpoint. The escalation through Clara's metaphor ("music is vibration... energy can be channeled") and the glowing drop narrows options toward completion of the piece. However, the tightening relies on a late-introduced magical mechanism (the drop's glow and voice) rather than building pressure from established constraints, and the cost (finishing imperfectly) is more stated than felt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The theme of imperfect completion emerges through Clara's refrain ("Imperfect miracles require imperfect methods") and the final instruction to play "imperfectly, like all miracles." The perfume bottle as conduit for memory and the music as resonance create a coherent metaphor system. Yet the thematic statement is articulated rather than discovered, and the final paragraph's "Imperfectly. Like all miracles" risks moralizing the earned scene work.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Clara's voice is distinct and controlled, with a specific idiom ("gossip-column exorcist," "currency" of regret) and perceptual bias toward metaphor and prop. Dialogue carries subtext and goal pursuit ("I had to outrun a rumor"). The psychic distance remains stable in third-limited, and the final beats maintain Clara's forensic attention without head-hopping. No filter-verb stacks or voice convergence at peak pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high in the opening and climax. The prose remains clear through the magical beats, with no paraphrase loops or template cadence. Minor overwriting appears in the metaphor explanation ("Music is vibration. Vibration is energy. Energy can be channeled"), which reads as scaffolding for the reader rather than Clara's natural thought, and "two bruises in the dim light" strains for effect. No artifacts touch the closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The gossip-column exorcist premise offers a fresh angle, and the copper-winged perfume bottle as electrical conduit synthesizes magic and metaphor in a specific way. The music-as-resonance frame transforms the ghost-story template. However, the core emotional arc—guilt-ridden sibling seeking closure through a facilitator—follows a familiar structure, and the "finish the piece to release the trapped memory" resolution is well-worn. The transformation is present but modest.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Clara is introduced in the first line and drives two key beats: diagnosing the sister as "resonance" rather than ghost, and instructing Elias to finish imperfectly. Her occupational lens (metaphor, props, regret-as-currency) constrains her tactics and charges the closure instruction. She appears in the final beat with the decisive "By finishing the song" guidance, making her choices causal to the ending.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The bottle is handled in four beats: flea-market backstory, Clara pulling it free and explaining the copper wings, unscrewing and dropping liquid onto the soundboard, and lying empty with still wings at closure. Its copper-winged mechanics enable the central turn (the glowing drop and voice), and its emptied state charges the final image. Irreplaceability is high—the dove/copper detail matters.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Imperfect miracles" is articulated twice by Clara and shapes her instruction to play imperfectly at the climax, altering Elias's tactic from perfectionism to completion-with-flaws. However, the concept is delivered as statement rather than discovered through failed attempts or visible cost, and the "imperfection" itself is not dramatized on the page—Elias simply resumes playing without a specified flaw.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Clara's metaphor-advising trait appears in her explanation of the bottle's copper wings as conductor and music as vibration/energy. This unlocks the magical method and enables the climax. However, the trait is demonstrated once and primarily as exposition to Elias (and the reader) rather than constraining her choices or creating friction; her metaphor facility is convenient rather than costly.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Reconnect" is Elias's stated goal ("I want you to help me reconnect") and the entire plot hinges on achieving it through the musical performance. The sister's voice emerging and Elias resuming play constitute the reconnection on the page. The action is signaled early, drives the middle explanation beat, and defines the closure—the story's logic would collapse without this exact verb.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Induced currents" is named by Clara midway ("Through induced currents?") and explained via the copper wings conducting electricity. The glowing drop and voice rely on this mechanism. However, the method is introduced and used within a single beat without setup or friction, functioning as a late explanation rather than shaping prior attempts. Swappable with "channeled energy" or similar.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The archive is present from the first line and provides the piano, the dust of regret, and spatial pressure. The stacks of scores and the piano's soundboard enable the climactic drop. The setting's silence and "forgotten melodies" motif return in the sister's voice cutting through static, reweighting the space. Early anchor, closure participation, and thematic charge elevate the score.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The orchard timeframe brackets the action: workers with idle chainsaws wait outside, and at closure the chainsaws "roared to life," marking completion. The hush is named in the opening line and the cutting creates an implicit deadline. However, the clock is not tracked mid-scene, and the threat of interruption is not leveraged to tighten Elias's choices—time pressure is framing rather than forcing.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Overdue apology" does not appear on the page. Elias expresses guilt ("We were arguing... She stormed off") and the sister's voice accuses ("You left me here"), but no apology is offered or withheld. The stated motivation is reconnection, and the resolution is completing the song rather than delivering words of contrition. Present only as implicit subtext without dramatized conflict.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>"Ethereal grit" coheres through the piece: the archive's dust and regret (grit), the glowing drop and radio-static voice (ethereal). The tone modulates from Clara's forensic opening to the charged musical climax and holds through the chainsaws' roar—grounded magical realism without sentimentality. Diction ("two bruises in the dim light," "prismatic shards") supports the dual texture, and the final image balances stillness (empty bottle) with harshness (chainsaws).</comment>
