<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lira's core motivation is clear—pacifist confronting shadow work—but her interiority leans heavily on abstraction ("stitch the fraying edges of reality," "quantum-engineered DNA") rather than embodied contradiction. The gravitational-lightness trait is mentioned repeatedly but never constrains a choice with visible cost; it reads ornamental. The final turn ("You wore it like a cloak") tells rather than shows the integration of shadow, and the meditation-chamber sequence summarizes confrontation rather than dramatizing contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Minor: "steadfast pacifist" becomes the key without on-page struggle between engagement and refusal at the closure beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Causal with strong Accumulative/Textural accents (memory layering, locket ritual). Orientation anchors arrive promptly (ship, role, relic by paragraph two). The closure unit—door opens, garden appears, ship stabilizes—lands on the page, but the cost remains abstract: "shadows coiled...dissolved into light" and "locket shattered" do not foreclose a live option or impose a felt sacrifice tied to Lira's prior choices. The turn is more revelation than renunciation. One meaningful tightening occurs (meditation chamber forces confrontation), but the mechanics of "stitching with words, memories, truth" bypass dramatized struggle. The ending reweights her pacifism conceptually yet the price paid feels summarized rather than embodied.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The *Eirenicon* is vividly particular: patched asteroid metal, ghostly hum, hologram forests, bioluminescent garden beyond. Spatial choreography is clean (corridors, core, meditation chamber, door). The locket constrains the opening of the door, fulfilling the micro-setting test, and the garden charges the final image. Minor deductions: the ship's "breathing its last" shudder and systems rebooting feel mechanical rather than sensory; the meditation chamber's holograms serve backdrop more than tactical pressure. The gravitational quirk is mentioned but never alters movement or choice on the page.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: open the locked dimension to stabilize the ship. One tightening: Lira must face her shadow to activate Kwan Yin's Tear. The escalation is largely internal (memories wash over her) rather than a sequence of narrowing tactical choices. The door's resistance dissolves when she "begins to stitch...with words, memories, truth"—a solution that feels declared rather than fought for. Cost is present (locket shatters, shadows coil) but abstracts the price; no live option is visibly foreclosed. Agency at closure reads more as acceptance than decision with trade-off. Under the Causal lens, the because/therefore chain holds but the final turn lacks friction.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Theme—peace as courage, engagement vs. avoidance, grief/love as twins—emerges from particulars (mother's erased face, crew's uploaded minds, long-dried tears on photographs). The AI's question ("what if engagement is the only way to prevent monstrosity?") verges on thematic statement but is offset by the meditation sequence and garden payoff. The final image (bioluminescent trees, laughter echoing as "ghostly resolve") offers a resonant, non-literal answer. Minor slip: "to hold it together long enough for others to see its beauty" edges toward moralizing summary in the penultimate paragraph. The faint shimmer motif charges the closure but "via" in the prompt element reads more method than integrated symbol.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Lira. Voice carries a lyric, slightly elevated register ("gravitationally lighter," "裂缝 (fissures)," "viscous shadows") that fits the SF-mystical premise but occasionally drifts into abstraction ("stitch the fraying edges of reality") without grounding in Lira's sensory present. Dialogue is minimal (AI whispers, Lira declares readiness); the AI's lines lean expository. Perceptual signature is present (memories as shimmer, happiness as lightness) but not deeply idiosyncratic. Psychic distance is consistent. The inclusion of a Chinese character mid-sentence ("stitch the裂缝") is a slight register hiccup—token rather than voice-motivated—and the final "ghostly resolve" echo feels authorial more than character-particular.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies; opening establishes voice and stakes cleanly. Information density is high in exposition (ship, locket, shadow work). Scaffold check: "It was said to hold the power" and "She had always believed" are mild telling but efficient. "Quantum-engineered DNA" and "collapsed star" risk genre-placeholder vagueness but remain legible. Paraphrase loop: "stitch the fraying edges of reality" / "stitch the裂缝 (fissures)" repeats the concept without added pressure. Template cadence: "She closed her eyes...She saw...She was gravitationally lighter...She did not flinch" runs a pronoun-verb stack across the climax, flattening propulsion (−0.4). The final paragraph mixes "steadfast pacifist...had become the key" summary with "corridors echoed...ghostly resolve"—echo loops the opening phrase. Minor: "via the faint shimmer of long-dried tears on faded photographs" appears once as parenthetical aside, not woven into action.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Premise—android-born human on failing ship uses mystical relic and shadow work to open dimension—combines familiar SF-fantasy tropes. Particulars (Kwan Yin's Tear, gravitational DNA quirk, bioluminescent garden) add texture but do not transform the core arc of reluctant hero facing inner darkness to unlock the way forward. The "steadfast pacifist must engage" question is explored but resolved cleanly without ironic complication. The closing garden and stabilized ship feel like reward rather than cost-laden discovery. Proximity check: no direct echoes, but the meditation-chamber revelation and locket-shattering door-opening beat follow well-worn genre moves. Fresh details (quantum lightness, 裂缝, android midwives) are present yet do not compel a transformation test pass—swap names and the emotional arc remains intact.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Lira is on-page throughout. Her pacifism frames the opening stake and the AI's challenge ("to engage is to become the monster"). The meditation-chamber confrontation is her decision, and pressing her palm to the door is her final act. However, the story tells us she is a "steadfast pacifist" more than it dramatizes her choosing non-violence under pressure; the central conflict is internal/mystical rather than an on-page choice between violence and peace. She avoids the duty for years (summary) and then accepts it in one beat. Two gates: setup (paragraph one) and closure (door press). Missing: a middle choice where pacifism constrains or enables a tactic with visible cost. Caps: introduced immediately, participates in closure, but middle development is thin—cap guideline ~4.6. Causal pressure is present (her choice to enter the chamber and face the shadow), but the pacifist trait itself does not narrow options or create a trade-off; it is context, not lever. Score: low 5-band for functional presence with limited causal work.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Kwan Yin's Tear appears in paragraph two (ship's core relic), is clutched and its glow noted, floats during meditation, flares when Lira declares readiness, shatters and soaks into the door at the climax. Three beats (core, meditation, door) with evolving use: from passive symbol to active key. Setup ✓, development (floats, senses turmoil) ✓, payoff (shatters, door opens) ✓. Causal pressure: the locket must be activated by shadow work, and its shattering is the cost that opens the door. Closure linkage strong. Specificity: "liquid light," "collapsed star locket" are vivid. Swappability: could be any mystical key, but the name and liquid-light detail add texture. Deductions: the object does not constrain an earlier choice (she simply takes it to the chamber); it resolves the problem but was present from the start. High 7-band for essential multi-beat presence and closure participation with one cost (shattering), but limited mid-story constraint.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Shadow work is named in paragraph two ("confronting the parts of oneself one most wished to deny") and shapes the meditation-chamber sequence: AI projects her memories, she sees her refusal to hold a weapon, she lets memories wash over her, shadows pool and dissolve. Setup ✓ (paragraph two), development ✓ (meditation beats), payoff ✓ (shadows dissolve, door opens). Causal pressure: without facing the shadow, the locket won't activate and the door won't open. Cost: facing the memories and shadows is the trial. However, the mechanics remain abstract ("stitching...with words, memories, truth"); the shadow is encountered via montage rather than a choice that forecloses a path. The concept charges the stakes but is more thematic frame than on-page tactic. Mid-6-band for shaping one key turn (meditation) with setup and payoff, but limited irreplaceability—"inner journey" could substitute with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Gravitationally lighter when happy" is introduced in paragraph one ("a quirk of her quantum-engineered DNA"), mentioned again when she laughs in the meditation chamber ("her body humming with joy...gravitationally lighter"), and at the ending ("floated, laughing...gravity adjusted"). Setup ✓, closure reprise ✓, but missing: a middle beat where lightness constrains or enables an action with cost. The trait is label-only; it does not alter her movement, choice, or tactics on the page. The final "floated, laughing" could be metaphorical joy without the DNA quirk. Swappability high. Ornamental use across three mentions. Caps: present early and at end, but no development beat—cap ~4.6 per gate model. Deductions: label-only −0.3, ornamental −0.5. Low 3-band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Stitch" appears as Lira's role (paragraph one: "mend...stitch the fraying edges of reality"), her past work (hull, android code), and the climactic action (paragraph five: "she began to stitch. Not with needle and thread, but with words, memories, truth"). Setup ✓ (role anchor), development (past stitching summarized, not shown), payoff ✓ (door stitching is the key act). Causal pressure: the door requires stitching to open. Cost: she uses truth and memory as tools, shattering the locket. Specificity: the metaphor is extended but remains abstract—what does "stitching with words" look like in physical action? The action is present in two beats (past summary, climax) but the past use is told, not dramatized. Closure linkage strong. Swappability moderate ("repair," "heal" could substitute). Mid-to-high 6-band for essential presence at closure with some abstraction limiting irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Via the faint shimmer of long-dried tears on faded photographs" appears once in paragraph four, parenthetically: "She saw, via the faint shimmer of long-dried tears on faded photographs (the only images left of humanity's past), that grief and love were not opposites but twins." Setup absent (not mentioned until midpoint), development ✓ (one beat: the memory montage), closure: the method is not reprised in the final image. Single functional beat. Causal work: the shimmer is the lens through which she sees the truth, enabling the insight that charges her readiness. Cost: none visible; the shimmer is a perceptual detail, not a constraint. Caps: introduced past 40% → cap 4.6. Swappability: "through memories" or "in hologram images" could replace it. One beat involvement +0.4, causal seed +0.3, late intro −0.5, ornamental reprise absence −0.3. Low-mid 4-band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The *Eirenicon* is introduced in the title and opening line, with vivid detail (patched metal, ghostly hum, android midwives, crystalline archives, core housing the relic, meditation chamber with hologram forests, corridors). Setup ✓ (immediate), development ✓ (ship shudders, systems dim, reboots), payoff ✓ (ship stabilizes, corridors echo laughter). Causal pressure: the ship's failing state is the inciting problem; its core houses the locket; its meditation chamber is the arena for shadow work; its stabilization is the resolution. The setting supplies resources (holograms, archives) and pressures (decay, alarms). Closure linkage: ship stabilization and corridor echo are the final beats. Specificity: "recycled," "patched asteroid metal," "ghostly resolve of systems" are irreplaceable details. Swappability low. Three-plus beats, closure participation, high specificity. High 7-band for essential, multi-faceted presence across the arc.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"After the last human" (timeframe) is stated in paragraph one ("born after the last human, in a time when humanity's genetic code was stored"). Setup ✓ (immediate world-anchor), development: the timeframe does not tighten decisions or create urgency within the story's present action; it is context, not clock. Payoff: the garden and ship's reboot do not hinge on the post-human era; the same plot could occur in any era. The timeframe charges the atmosphere (loneliness, archives, android midwives) and supports theme (humanity's legacy), but it does not constrain a choice or alter tactics. Causal pressure: none on decision-making. Closure linkage: the new garden is an "invitation—to live, to love, to engage," thematically resonant with post-human rebirth, but the timeframe itself is not active. One beat (setup) plus thematic reprise. Mid-5-band for atmospheric grounding without tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"To push open a locked dimension" is the named goal: opening the door between worlds to stabilize the ship. Setup ✓ (paragraph two: door sealed, requires shadow work). Development ✓ (meditation chamber: Lira grapples with the requirement, faces memories). Payoff ✓ (paragraph six: presses palm to door, stitches it open, door splits). Causal pressure: the goal drives every beat from inciting shudder to final act. Cost: Lira must face her shadow and shatter the locket. Friction: the AI challenges her avoidance; the door is "cold, smooth, unyielding" until she stitches. Specificity: "locked dimension" is unique to the premise. Swappability low. Three beats, closure linkage, visible cost. High 7-band for essential goal with on-page friction and sacrifice, though the final "stitching with words" remains somewhat abstract.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>"Ghostly resolve" appears in the opening line ("ghostly resolve of centuries-old systems") and closing line ("a ghostly resolve that would echo through the stars"). Setup ✓ (immediate tonal anchor), development: the tone of eerie determination holds through the shuddering ship, AI whispers, and shadow confrontation. Payoff ✓ (echo reprise charges the final image). Coherence: the tone is consistent and modulates subtly (from haunted past to active courage). The reprise reweights the phrase from systems' persistence to Lira's laughter as legacy. Closure linkage strong. Specificity: "ghostly" balances melancholy and determination in a way generic "somber" or "determined" would not. Swappability moderate. Two beats (opening, closing) with coherent middle holding. Mid-to-high 6-band for purposeful tonal frame with charged reprise, but limited development beats between bookends.</comment>
