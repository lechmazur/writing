<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and her meticulous nature shapes her approach, but internal contradiction is thin—she experiences frustration and exhaustion without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final success feels too clean; the cost of her years of struggle doesn't visibly foreclose options or alter her stance. Embodied emotion is present (humming the tuning fork, slamming her fist) but the arc from gently meticulous to frantic doesn't show a character trade-off with lasting consequence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors promptly (who, where, when). The drive lens reads Causal: sampling frequencies reconstructs vows, which reignites the library's magic. One meaningful tightening occurs when the warrior's vow flares and then dims, forcing Elara to sample faster. Closure lands on-page with a Decisive Change (the illusions brighten at dawn), but the cost is implied rather than viscerally felt—no visible path foreclosed or renunciation dramatized in the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The frozen library, frosted panes, ice prism, and lantern are vivid and purposeful. The prism constrains her method (splitting light into frequencies), satisfying the 9+ gate partially. However, spatial choreography is vague—desk, lantern, prism positions aren't tracked across moves. The setting pressures Elara (fading magic, wind rattling panes) but doesn't supply a resource that alters the final outcome; the dawn's warmth arrives coincidentally.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early: decode the vows to save the library. One meaningful tightening when the first vow's final word eludes her, then a second when the warrior's vow dissolves into static. Elara's agency (sampling faster, switching slides) drives escalation under the Causal lens. The resolution—dawn arriving and illusions brightening—lacks a visible price paid by Elara; her exhaustion melts away without foreclosing a path or trading off a competing need.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme of meaning conjured from oblivion emerges through Elara's struggle with fading vows, not stated overtly. The lantern slides and light frequencies form a coherent motif. However, the ending offers a declarative success ("She had done it") rather than a resonant, non-literal image that reweights prior material. The dawn's arrival feels more literal rescue than thematic reprise, and no moral ambiguity or counter-reading lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Single POV, stable focalization, and no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present (alignment of quills, precise handwriting) and diction remains character-consistent. The prose modulates with emotional intensity (frantic sampling, exhaustion melting). Minor filter-verb reliance ("She believed," "She'd spent years") slightly dulls immediacy in early beats. No dialogue to assess, but internal voice is distinct and purposeful.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Clarity is high and sentences advance story without major loops. However, "gently meticulous" appears twice in identical phrasing, and "the edge of oblivion" recurs without reweighting. Template cadence in the sampling sequence: "She adjusted... She hummed... She scribbled... She sampled... She reached..." across five consecutive beats without variation. Mixed metaphor: "tomb" versus "sanctuary" works, but "quartz hush" as a sound descriptor is strained. Information density is moderate; some lines ("Tonight, it felt less like a sanctuary and more like a tomb") tell rather than show.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The magic-library-fading premise is familiar (archival-magic-decay template). The lantern slides and frequency-sampling method offer a fresh technical angle, but the emotional arc (meticulous scholar racing against time, succeeding at dawn) follows a well-worn path. No counter-intuitive turn or moral complexity; the resolution is victory without meaningful transformation or trade-off. Specific details (ice prism, tuning fork, violet hue) elevate execution, but the synthesis feels incremental rather than irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and makes decisions (adjusting the lens, sampling frequencies, switching slides). Her role as records chief frames her meticulous approach. However, her choices are tactical variations (sample faster, try another slide) rather than altering stakes or tactics in a meaningful way. The final success is hers, but the dawn's arrival—not a character decision—tips the outcome.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The lantern slide appears in multiple beats: lifted, projected, adjusted, and switched. It is causally central—projecting the vows is the sole method of decoding them. The slide returns in the ending image implicitly (the illusions brighten as a result of her slide work). Strong integration, though the final image could more explicitly recharge the slide's symbolic weight.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Luminous vows shape the dominant stake (decode them to save the library) and are dramatized on-page (golden script, syllables revealed by frequencies). They constrain Elara's method (she must sample light to reconstruct text). However, the vows' content ("I promise to love you," "I swear to defend") is generic and doesn't alter tactics or generate moral friction; they are MacGuffin-like rather than thematically charged.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Gently meticulous" is mentioned twice verbatim and shown through quill alignment and precise notes. It constrains her approach (careful sampling, ledger scribbling) but doesn't create a visible trade-off or cost. When she needs to hurry, the trait "felt like a curse," yet she simply samples faster without a dramatized tension between precision and speed that alters outcome.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Measure" as action is present (matching tuning fork pitch, scribbling notes, sampling frequencies) and signaled early. It drives her method but is one of several overlapping actions (adjust, hum, sample). Swappable with "analyze" or "decode" without restructuring; it shapes process but doesn't uniquely redefine options or stakes at closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Sampling frequencies is signaled early (split light into spectrum, match pitch to violet, sample blue then green) and its mechanics matter—each frequency reveals a syllable. The method shapes multiple attempts (first vow incomplete, warrior vow stronger, faster sampling). It is causally active and could not be swapped without rewriting the magic system. Strong integration, though the final success doesn't show a unique constraint imposed by this method.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The frozen library is vividly present (frost, clouds, spires, rattling wind) and pressures Elara (fading illusions, crumbling shelves threatened). The ice prism is crafted from the setting's material and used to split light, a tactical resource. However, the setting doesn't alter the final outcome—dawn arrives externally. The library is more atmospheric crucible than active constraint at closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Time pressure is present: illusions are fading, magic dying, and Elara must hurry. The dawn's arrival marks the resolution. However, no ticking clock or tracked elapsed time shapes her decisions; urgency is asserted ("She needed to hurry") but not dramatized as a narrowing window that forces tactical changes. The timeframe is thematic backdrop rather than a live constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The motivation "to conjure meaning from the edge of oblivion" is stated early and drives her goal (decode vows to reignite the library). It is dramatized through her struggle with fading vows. However, it is not conflicted—no competing desire or cost tests her commitment. She pursues it single-mindedly, and the resolution grants it fully without a trade-off or renunciation.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Quartz hush" appears once as a descriptive phrase ("The air hummed back, a quartz hush settling over the room"). It evokes stillness and crystalline clarity, fitting the frozen library. However, it is a single tonal note rather than a modulating presence; the tone doesn't shift with pressure or charge the final image. The ending shifts to warmth and brightness, diluting the quartz-hush quality.</comment>
