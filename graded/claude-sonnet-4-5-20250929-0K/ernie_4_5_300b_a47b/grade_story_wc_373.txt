<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lira's motivations are clear—retrieve the device, protect her father's legacy—and her "curiously steadfast" trait drives her through missteps. Internal contradictions appear in the bell chamber when her hands shake but she acts decisively, and the closing smile suggests complicated acceptance. However, the father's voice on the recording feels unmotivated by prior scene work; we never see Lira process why he'd plead or what that changes about her mission, leaving the peak emotional beat under-earned. The embodied detail is strong (watch fob chain biting her palm, breath echoing), but the final stance shift reads too smooth given the betrayal revelation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchors by the second paragraph (Saltspire Pier, pirate market, moonshine runner's daughter). The drive lens reads Causal with event-linked pressure: bribe fails → courier chase fails → eavesdrop yields intel → tower confrontation. Closure is a Decisive Change: Lira smashes the device and flees, ending with the cracked watch fob still ticking—a resonant image of damaged continuity. Cost is visible (fob broken, market chaos, father's reputation shattered by the recording). One weakness: the buyer's late entrance and instant defeat feel compressed; the recording's content (father pleading) arrives without prior setup, creating a small causality gap in the climax that slightly undermines the earned weight of Lira's choice.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The pirate market is vivid and purposeful: barnacled pilings, tattered silk stalls, brine-and-opium stench, masks of lace or paint. The Clocktower Stall's frozen hands at 2:17 and the corroded tower structure guide Lira's route and constrain her search. The watch fob's anchor engraving and chain snag on a nail are micro-setting moves that charge the object. Spatial choreography is mostly clear (pier → market → stall → tower stairs → bell chamber), though the buyer "detaching from the wall" in the bell chamber is a touch convenient. The closing beach image dissolves the market into tide, reinforcing impermanence and grounding the thematic unease.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—thwart the recording device sale—is clear from paragraph two. Pressure tightens through failed bribe, lost courier, overheard intel, the lisp-man's demand for the fob, and the tower sprint against a midnight deadline. The buyer's arrival and recording playback create a reversal that narrows options (device active, father's betrayal audible), forcing Lira to smash it with visible cost (market chaos, fob cracked). The escalation is coherent under a Causal lens. One friction: the buyer's late entrance and instant defeat compress the peak confrontation; we don't see Lira weigh alternatives or face a harder trade-off, which keeps the final choice from reaching maximum pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The core concept—"a truce of hush," silence as currency—emerges through her father's maxim and the market's whisper economy. Trust and betrayal accumulate in the father's disappearance, the misleading dockhand, the lisp-man's favor, and the recording's revelation. The smashed device and the line "Trust breaks so beautifully, doesn't it?" charge the thematic question. The closing image (cracked fob, hands still moving, "comforting unease") offers a non-literal answer: continuity persists amid damage. However, "comforting unease" as a phrase arrives late without sufficient embodied grounding earlier, reading slightly imposed. The father's pleading voice on the recording could have been seeded more subtly to deepen the trust-breaking motif organically.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, rooted in Lira's perceptions. Voice is textured: "stubbornness with a thesaurus," "tide gnawed at barnacled pilings," "the stench of brine and opium mingled." Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during tower sprint, slightly pulled back during market description). Dialogue is spare and goal-driven: the lisp-man's demand, the buyer's taunting line. One slip: "the comforting unease of her father's legacy settling in her chest" in the final paragraph edges toward authorial summary rather than Lira's exact idiom under that pressure. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping. The perceptual signature—counting lantern flickers, checking the fob's face—is character-specific.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and the opening line anchors voice and stakes effectively. Information density is high in the market and tower sequences. However, several lines loop or paraphrase: "Her mission was to thwart the sale of a recording device" immediately followed by restating what the device does; "Each misstep sharpened her resolve" after listing two missteps feels like scaffold. The phrase "comforting unease" in the final paragraph is abstract and under-dramatized. "Lira's plan was a tangle of false starts" tells rather than trusts the prior showing. Minor filter-verb reliance ("She was the moonshine runner's daughter") is voice-acceptable but clusters in exposition. Proofreading is clean; no major grammar or continuity errors. Line-level clarity is strong in action beats but suffers from expository padding in setup.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The pirate market beneath a rotting pier and a device that "captures the sound of trust breaking" offer fresh specificity. The watch fob as inheritance-turned-currency is a strong synthesis. The false-starts structure (bribe, courier, eavesdrop) differentiates this from a straight retrieval plot. However, the core arc—retrieve object, confront betrayal, smash device—is familiar, and the buyer's porcelain-mask entrance and instant defeat feel stock. The father's recorded pleading is a late reveal without prior breadcrumbs, reducing inevitability. The closing image (cracked fob, moving hands) is evocative but doesn't fully transform the material. Emotional specificity in Lira's final smile ("comforting unease") hovers at the edge of abstraction. The piece commits to its premise but doesn't take a bold structural or moral risk that would elevate originality into the high band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lira (moonshine runner's daughter) is present throughout and makes key choices: decides to pursue intel, places the watch fob on the scale, sprints up the tower, smashes the device. Her decisions alter tactics (trading the fob, racing the clock) and drive the climax. The trait is tied to her role (inherited stakes, father's legacy). She is not passive; the final act is hers. However, the buyer's arrival compresses her agency slightly—she reacts to the recording rather than forcing a turn herself. Strong beat involvement and closure linkage, with visible cost (fob broken, market chaos). Setup early, development through middle trades, payoff at the smash.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The antique watch fob appears in paragraph one (cold against her palm, engraved anchor), returns when the chain snags on a nail during eavesdropping, is placed on the scale as proof of silence, used to check time (11:47 PM), and serves as the weapon to smash the device in the climax. The closing image shows it cracked but still ticking, reweighting continuity amid damage. Early setup, multiple beats (eavesdrop snag, scale trade, time check, smash, final image), clear causal pressure (enables access, becomes weapon), and closure linkage. The anchor engraving and chain are specific, irreplaceable details. Cost is visible (glass cracked). All three gates met with strong integration.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The "truce of hush" is named in paragraph one via the father's maxim: "silence… that's the gold standard." It shapes the lisp-man's demand for "proof of silence" (the fob trade) and is thematically present in the market's whisper economy and masks. The climax involves breaking silence (smashing the device, the crash "like a gunshot"). However, the concept does not tighten a mid-scene choice with on-page cost; it operates more as thematic backdrop than tactical constraint. Setup is clear, middle development is modest (the scale trade gesture), and the payoff is thematic rather than mechanical. Functional but not indispensable; the plot would hold with a different core metaphor.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Curiously steadfast" is named in paragraph three as a trait her father mocked, and the text claims "it anchored her" amid chaos. We see persistence through the bribe failure and courier chase, but the trait itself is told rather than shown constraining a choice with cost. No on-page moment where steadfastness forces a trade-off or enables a tactic that another trait would not. It labels her behavior but does not alter it. Present in setup, absent in middle development as a causal force, not visible in closure mechanics. Ornamental label without beat-level integration.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Thwart" is the dominant verb of Lira's mission, stated early. She pursues it through bribery, pursuit, eavesdropping, trading the fob, racing to the tower, and ultimately smashing the device. The action drives the escalation sequence and the climax. The final smash is the on-page enactment of "thwart," with visible cost (device destroyed, fob broken, market chaos, buyer screaming). Setup is immediate, development spans the middle false-start beats, and the payoff is the story's decisive act. The specificity of "thwart" (prevent sale) rather than "steal" or "destroy for its own sake" matters; she acts to stop weaponization. Strong causal role and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Through false starts" is signaled in paragraph three: "Lira's plan was a tangle of false starts." The bribe fails (dockhand misleads), the courier chase fails (lost in crates). Each misstep is on the page and propels the next attempt. However, the method itself does not impose unique cost or constraint; the false starts read as plot beats rather than a structural device that reweights the ending. The phrase "false starts" is told more than taught through pattern. Setup is clear, development is present (two failed attempts), but the payoff does not return to the method or charge it with new meaning. Functional, mid-integration; the method shapes attempts but is not indispensable to the closure image.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The pirate market beneath Saltspire Pier is established early with sensory detail (barnacled pilings, tattered silk, brine-and-opium stench, masks). It supplies the Clocktower Stall, the tower stairs, and the bell chamber. The rotting infrastructure constrains Lira's route (sagging planks, rusted beam, spiral stairs, creaking floorboards). The market "dissolves into the tide" at dawn, charging the impermanence theme. However, the setting mostly stages action rather than forcing a hard choice; Lira does not navigate a unique environmental obstacle that another hidden market would not provide. Setup is vivid, middle beats use the space, and the closing image includes it. Solid integration but shy of indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Until sunrise" is stated in the opening concept and checked at 11:47 PM ("She had until sunrise"). The midnight deadline for the buyer's arrival creates urgency in the tower sprint. Dawn appears in the closing line as the market dissolves. However, time is not tracked beat-by-beat; we don't feel minutes slipping away or see Lira forced to skip a step due to the clock. The sunrise frame brackets the story but does not tighten a mid-scene decision with on-page cost. Setup is clear, development is modest (one time check, midnight arrival), payoff is present (dawn image) but not causal. Functional bracket, not a live pressure mechanic.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The motivation "to capture the sound of trust breaking" belongs to the buyer, not Lira. Lira's mission is to thwart the sale, not to capture the sound herself. The recording device is described as rumored to capture that sound, and the buyer intends to weaponize it. The concept is thematically present (father's voice, trust breaking), but as written this element is assigned to the wrong character. If the intent was for Lira to be motivated by understanding or preventing the capture of trust-breaking sounds, that motive is not dramatized in her choices; she acts to stop the sale, not to engage with the metaphysical concept. Ornamental to Lira's arc; functional only as antagonist motive. Missing protagonist agency on this specific desire.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Comforting unease" is named only in the final sentence, but the tone is present throughout: menacing market atmosphere (brine, opium, masks, whispers) paired with Lira's resolve and her father's familiar legacy. The watch fob is both anchor and wound. The closing image (cracked fob, hands moving, Lira smiling) embodies the oxymoron. However, the phrase itself arrives late and reads slightly imposed; earlier beats do not consistently layer comfort with unease in a way that teaches the reader the tonal pattern. The smile at the end and the phrase "comforting unease" feel authorial rather than fully embodied. Tone is coherent and modulates with pressure (escalating dread, smash, quiet beach), but the specific duality is under-dramatized until the final line. Lyric reprise with modest setup.</comment>
