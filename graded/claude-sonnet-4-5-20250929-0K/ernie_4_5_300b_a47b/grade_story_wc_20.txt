<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kael's interior life shows contradictory impulses—torn between logic and mysticism, searching versus accepting limits—but the interiority leans heavily on stock metaphor ("balance was a fragile thing") and label-speak without sufficient embodied cost in micro-choices. The final acceptance of cracks reads slightly declarative rather than earned through prior micro-decisions under pressure. Lira's translucent form and her articulation of theme ("balance isn't about equal parts") borders on sermon rather than dramatized struggle. The renunciation is present but the path to it feels somewhat externalized rather than emerging from contradictory wants acting simultaneously in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when early (Kael, foundry, post-search). The closure lands on-page as Kael reaches for Lira and closes on empty air—a clear Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant) where options crystallize and the cost (her permanent absence, his acceptance) is felt. Lens reads Causal-Situational Hybrid: the coin drop triggers the vortex, but the ending reconfigures meaning more than advancing new plot points. One meaningful tightening occurs when Lira appears and reframes his search. Cost is legible but slightly abstract; the "empty air" line delivers the final emotional price, though the setup feels compressed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The foundry is vividly anchored—corrugated roof, molten-metal pit, iron and wet earth—and the coin's heat and glow constrain Kael's final choice to drop it, directly charging the vortex and closure image. Spatial choreography is clean (edge of pit, approaching, dropping). Sensory selection reflects urgency (rain pauses "as if the world itself were listening"). The recurring object (coin) and micro-setting (pit) both shape the climactic act, meeting the 9+ gate requirement that environment/tool constrain choice and charge the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—understanding Lira's disappearance and redeeming himself—is signaled early and tightens when the coin's glow intensifies and he whispers "Show me." The vortex arrival and Lira's appearance narrow options (she's not alive in the expected way; she "shed" her name). Cost is visible in the empty-air grasp and her instruction to accept cracks, but the escalation from search-to-acceptance feels slightly compressed; the middle beat (coin drop to vortex) lacks a second tightening reversal that would test Kael's resolve more sharply before the final renunciation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Theme—names as anchors, kintsugi mending, balance through acceptance—emerges through image (coin, bowl, cracks filled with gold) and Lira's dialogue. However, Lira's lines ("balance isn't about equal parts"; "by exploring your limits") veer into direct thematic statement rather than leaving resonance implicit. The kintsugi bowl and coin reprise function well, but the final exchange edges toward sermon ("some questions don't have answers") rather than a non-literal answer arising from scene particulars. The foundry-as-cathedral pivot is evocative but slightly on-the-nose.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV remains stable in Kael's third-limited perspective; psychic distance is controlled. Voice has texture ("factually mystical blend," "luminous and sad") and reflects his alchemist frame. Lira's dialogue carries distinct idiom ("In a way," "You're not?") that separates her from Kael's narration. No head-hopping. Filter verbs ("he felt," "he wondered") appear but are voice-motivated. Brief elision of Lira's fate is purposeful and paid off when she explains she "shed" her name. Minor slip: "expression" instead of "an expression" in "a expression both luminous" disrupts flow.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully (long reflective sentences, short crisis beats: "Wait!"). Information density is high; most lines advance character or atmosphere. Clarity is strong except for one typo ("a expression"). Minor loop: "kintsugi intentions" appears twice with similar framing. Overwriting appears in figurative clusters ("molten gold that mirrored," "ink into water," "woven from starlight and regret") that slightly slow momentum in the middle beat. No major scaffold or template cadence, but the foundry-to-cathedral shift leans toward elevated diction that edges past Kael's practical alchemist register.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The synthesis—alchemist grief, zodiac coin as key, kintsugi philosophy, rain-washed foundry—creates a specific frame. The coin-into-molten-metal vortex and Lira's translucent return offer a fresh visual angle on the ghost-sister trope. However, the core arc (searching sibling accepts their metaphysical departure after a mystical vision) follows a recognizable template; transformation relies on the kintsugi lens and the foundry's tactile grounding rather than a non-obvious moral calculus. Risk is present in the lyric tone and abstract closure, but the thematic articulation feels slightly safer than the imagery promises.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Kael is present throughout and his choice to drop the coin triggers the vortex (setup, development). At closure he reaches for Lira but grasps empty air, accepting her departure—a decision that forecloses reunion (payoff). Early signal, two beats (drop, reach), causal pressure moderate, closure linkage strong. Swappability: a different archetype (mystic scholar, priest) could function similarly with edits. Cost is visible but tied more to Lira's departure than to Kael's alchemist identity uniquely shaping tactics.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The zodiac coin appears in paragraph one (setup), is handled and its glow intensifies as Kael approaches the pit (development), then dropped to trigger the vortex and fused into the metal (payoff). Three beats, causal pressure high (drop causes vortex, fusion symbolizes permanence), closure linkage strong. Specificity: the constellation etchings and faint glow distinguish it from a generic talisman. Cost: Kael relinquishes the sole physical anchor to his father and sister. High integration; removal would collapse the sequence.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Kintsugi is introduced early ("jagged edges... reminded him of kintsugi") and recurs at midpoint ("Kintsugi intentions... understand its cracks") and closure (the bowl, cracks filled with gold). Setup and payoff present; middle development weak—kintsugi functions as thematic echo rather than constraining a choice. Kael's final acceptance ("So I redeem myself by accepting the cracks?") is dialogue summary, not dramatized tactics. The concept enriches tone but remains more metaphor than lever.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Factually mystical" appears once ("factually mystical blend that made his nose tingle") as description of the foundry's air. No second beat; no visible constraint or tradeoff. The phrase colors tone but does not enable or foreclose an action. Ornamental. No setup gate (not present by end of first third as a character trait), no development, no payoff.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Redeem" is signaled early ("come here to redeem himself") and recurs at closure ("So I redeem myself by accepting the cracks?"). Setup and payoff present. Development: the coin drop and Lira's appearance are steps toward redemption, but the action itself (seeking forgiveness, proving alchemy can bridge seen/unseen) does not uniquely shape the vortex mechanics—Lira's mystical agency dominates. Lyric reprise reweights the stake, but swappability moderate (similar verbs: atone, prove, reconcile could substitute).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Exploring limits" is hinted midpoint ("by exploring your limits") in Lira's dialogue and earlier ("prove that his alchemy could bridge the gap"). Setup weak (frame present but not as method); development unclear—Kael does not test multiple alchemical approaches on-page; payoff is Lira's instruction rather than Kael's dramatized attempt. The method is told more than shown; it shapes the thematic answer but not the tactical sequence.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The rain-washed foundry anchors scene throughout: rain drumming on roof (setup), molten-metal pit as the action site (development), rain pausing at the emotional peak (payoff). Three beats, strong spatial choreography. The pit constrains Kael's choice (he must approach and drop the coin there), and the foundry's transformation into cathedral-like space charges the closure. Specificity high (corrugated roof, iron/wet earth, soot-streaked memories). Removal would break the alchemy frame and the coin-melt logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"After the search party for his missing sister had disbanded" establishes timeframe in paragraph one (setup). The post-search context pressures Kael's need for closure now rather than continuing to wait (development). At closure, Lira's fade implies finality after this one chance (payoff). Two gates met; the timeframe tightens emotional stakes but does not create a live ticking clock that alters tactics beat-to-beat. Cost: opportunity forfeited. Moderate causal role.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"To understand the weight of names" is signaled early (father's quote, Lira's belief) and drives Kael's coin drop ("Show me") and his question about names being too heavy (development). At closure, Lira reaffirms names' weight and Kael accepts the metaphor (payoff). Three beats, friction between wanting proof and fearing the answer. Cost is visible (he loses Lira again). Swappability moderate—similar desires (understand her fate, find peace) could work. Strong thematic tie but slightly told rather than fully enacted as contradictory wants.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Luminous regret" coheres from the opening's "melancholic rhythm" and "ache in his bones" through Lira's "luminous and sad" appearance to the final empty-air grasp. Tone modulates under pressure: reflective sorrow (early), mystical wonder (vortex), sharp loss (final reach). The rain-pausing moment and "foundry's light dimmed, coin's glow extinguished" directly charge the ending image. Coherent, mood-specific to this grief, and carried through turns. Strong integration; removal would flatten the emotional arc.</comment>
