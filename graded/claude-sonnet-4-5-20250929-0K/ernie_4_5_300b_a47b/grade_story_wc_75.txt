<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lila's motivation is clear and sustained, but her interiority relies on abstraction ("rosewater dread," "historically oriented mind raced") rather than embodied contradiction. The final choice to teach children feels declared rather than earned through visible internal conflict—no competing impulse or cost dramatizes what she's risking or refusing. Micro-choices (kneading dough, lifting the lens) remain gestural without revealing a hierarchy of values under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density increases through repeated mentions of arts, bread, lens, thaw, culminating in the children's festival. Orientation anchors cleanly by the grotto tour opening. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration (Lila moves from solitary guide to communal teacher), but the cost is asserted ("fragile optimism," "rosewater dread remained") rather than made legible in a specific forfeiture or image that reweights prior material. The beekeeper's absence is mentioned twice but never constrains a tactic or charges the ending.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The grotto city, waterfall mist, crystalline pool, and moss-carved arches are vividly rendered and establish atmosphere. However, setting remains largely scenic: the cave's dampness and chill are noted but do not force a tactical choice or alter the final image. The oven's heat at closure provides sensory contrast yet does not constrain Lila's decision to teach. Spatial choreography (cottage near hives, pool at the grotto's heart) is coherent but not leveraged for pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—rescue dying arts—is signaled early and sustained. One tightening occurs when Lila decides to host a festival and teach, but this turn is executed as summary ("she'd host a festival, revive the opera, bake bread") without on-page resistance or a visible trade-off. No live constraint (time, resource, opposition) narrows her options; the children's arrival and their request to learn feel cooperative rather than testing. Cost is told ("fragile optimism") not shown in a forfeited path or altered tactic.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme—art as survival, tradition as defiance of displacement—emerges organically from Lila's actions and the grotto's history. The emerald lens filtering grief to beauty offers a resonant image, and the bread-as-names custom grounds abstraction in ritual. However, the final paragraph edges toward thesis statement ("Art, like bread, required patience, care, and a willingness to rise again") rather than letting the scene do thematic work. The ending reweights prior material but leans on metaphor rather than a non-literal answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Voice is controlled and literary, with some perceptual specificity ("rosewater dread," "emerald tint… filtered grief"). Distance remains stable. Dialogue is minimal and functional but lacks subtext or character distinction—the child's "Why's it green?" and another's "Teach us" are generic. Some phrases ("cultured museum guide," "historically oriented mind") lean toward resumé rather than lived perception. Under peak moments (deciding to teach, kneading dough), diction stays decorative rather than sharpening with urgency.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Moderate line-level craft with several artifacts touching high-pressure beats. "Rosewater dread" appears three times without evolving meaning; template cadence runs in "She'd host a festival, revive the opera, bake bread" and "teach us… first, we bake… shape it… then we'll sing." Paraphrase loop: "The arts weren't dead; they'd just been frozen. And thawing them would take more than heat" restates the thaw metaphor without added pressure. Filter-verb stack in "she felt a fragile optimism" and "thought of Celeste" dulls immediacy. Stock metaphor "footprints in snow" and "life raft" reduce specificity. Apply −0.8 for patterned artifacts and loops touching closure third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The grotto-city setting and emerald-lens relic offer fresh texture, but the core arc—solitary preservationist decides to teach the next generation—follows a familiar template without transformation through unexpected cost or complication. The beekeeper's disappearance, thaw metaphor, and bread-as-initials custom are present but remain illustrative rather than driving an inevitable, non-obvious synthesis. Emotional specificity is limited by abstraction ("rosewater dread"). The piece commits to its premise but does not risk an unconventional structure or moral calculus that would elevate originality.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Lila frames the story and her decision to teach provides the final turn, but most page time is devoted to tour narration and reflection rather than high-stakes choices. Her role as guide enables exposition but does not create tactical pressure or constrain her options; teaching the children feels like a natural extension rather than a choice that alters prior tactics. Present in setup, middle reflection, and ending, but causal pressure is light.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The emerald-tinted opera glass lens appears in the opening tour beat, is handled and explained ("filtered grief, leaving only beauty"), returns at the pool mid-story, and is propped on a stone at the ending to catch torchlight. Three distinct beats, but its function remains symbolic rather than enabling or constraining a choice. The lens does not reweight prior material with new cost at closure; it decorates rather than drives.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Displaced persons frame the backstory (Madame Celeste's exile, refugees who built the city) and echo thematically in Lila's resolve, but the concept does not alter on-page tactics or narrow her options. Displacement is told context rather than a live pressure that forces a trade-off. Present in setup and thematic reflection but not causally active in middle or ending beats.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>"Historically oriented" appears once as a label ("Lila's historically oriented mind raced—how to connect Celeste's exile to the city's present plight?") without shaping a visible choice or imposing a cost. Her knowledge enables the tour exposition but does not constrain her teaching decision or conflict with another value. Trait is mentioned, not dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Thaw is signaled early ("The thaw had begun. Spring's first trickle seeped through cracks"), recurs as metaphor ("The arts weren't dead; they'd just been frozen"), and charges the ending image (children, oven warmth, "thawing them would take more than heat"). Three beats, and the thaw reframes the dominant stake. However, the physical thaw does not constrain a tactic—Lila's choice to teach is independent of the cave's warming. Strong thematic integration, moderate causal role.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The family custom of baking bread shaped like initials is introduced early (Lila kneading "CV" for Celeste), recurs in the middle as she works dough, and culminates when she teaches the children to shape their names in the ending beat. The method enables the communal lesson and provides the tactile closure image. Three beats with purposeful escalation; the custom bridges memory and future, individual and collective. Essential to the ending's charge.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The grotto city behind the waterfall provides vivid atmosphere (mist, moss-carved arches, crystalline pool, cavern dampness) and frames all action. However, the setting does not constrain Lila's choices—she could teach anywhere. The oven's warmth contrasts with the cave's chill at closure but does not alter her decision. Present in setup, development, and ending; strong descriptive integration but limited causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"After the beekeeper's last visit" anchors the story in a post-loss present and recurs as "a quiet ache," but the timeframe does not tighten decisions or create urgency. No clock pressures Lila's choice to teach; the festival planning is future-oriented summary. The beekeeper's absence colors mood but does not constrain tactics. Setup and thematic mention only; no middle or closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Lila's motivation to rescue dying arts is stated early ("her motivation burned fiercer each day"), sustained through the tour and reflection, and drives her final decision to teach. However, the desire is declared rather than tested by friction—no competing want or fear forces a trade-off. The motivation enables the plot but does not generate visible internal conflict or on-page cost. Present across all three gates with moderate causal role.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Rosewater dread" is named three times (hearing it in her own words, as undertone at night, tempered by purpose at closure) and attempts to establish a tonal through-line of elegiac anxiety. However, the phrase remains abstract and does not modulate with scene pressure—it is asserted rather than embodied in syntax, image, or pacing shifts. The tone label recurs but does not charge the final image with specific dread; optimism dominates the ending without tonal tension.</comment>
