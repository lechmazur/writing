<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The storyteller's motivation is declared rather than dramatized through embodied contradiction. Her fear of oblivion is stated late ("I fear extinction"), and her laugh-then-throw decision lacks prior micro-choices showing internal conflict. The copper veins and diamond-handling provide some sensory grounding, but interiority often labels ("simple," "knew better," "understood") rather than enacting. The final renunciation arrives without visible cost foreclosing a path—she climbs down with "steady hands," undercutting the stakes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Closure reads as Charged Poise: the storyteller releases the diamond and the canyon falls silent, crystallizing her stance against oblivion. However, cost is abstract—she retains the "diamond's song" in her mind, softening the loss. Orientation is established by ~100 words. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural (hum weaves echoes, diamond pulses, towers vibrate), but the final beat shifts to a declared realization rather than sustained texture, weakening coherence. One meaningful tightening occurs when the echoes roar back, but the resolution feels convenience-eased.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The bone towers and canyon echoes constrain her positioning ("narrow ledge," "slick bone") and the diamond's heat forces the throw, meeting the 9+ gate's environment-constrains-choice test. Sensory hierarchy is strong: copper skin, pulsing gem, vibrating runes. Spatial choreography is clean through the climb and ledge scene. However, "Age of Whispers" and "twin moons" add flavor without altering tactics, and the canyon's "throat of endless echoes" metaphor is vivid but not causally tested until the maelstrom.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—translate the diamond's curse into resonance—is signaled early. One tightening occurs when the echoes roar back, forcing the throw. However, the protagonist's agency is reactive: the canyon "demands payment" and the diamond "burns," compelling the decision rather than protagonist-driven choice under pressure. The "I am the extinction!" shout declares a stance without prior on-page cost narrowing options. The resolution avoids the problem (she discards the gem) rather than transforming it, and her steady hands undercut felt cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme—languages lost, texture-as-sound, fear of oblivion—emerges through the diamond's curse and echo mechanics. The final image ("some languages are meant to be felt, not spoken") offers a resonant, non-literal answer. However, the "I am the extinction!" line edges toward thematic echo, and the "mirror" insight is told rather than enacted. The diamond's black vein recurs across beats but its final split into tones is ornamental rather than reweighting prior material with undeniable cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Single POV, stable distance. Perceptual signature is strong: "copper-veined," "like molten ore," "shadows streaked…like ink spilled on parchment." Register is elevated but consistent. However, peak-stress diction ("laugh, a sound like shattering glass") leans toward stock metaphor, and the line "You think I fear extinction? I am the extinction!" shifts into declamatory mode that feels author-inserted rather than character-particular. Free indirect style is clean, no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies; sentence openings are diverse. However, paraphrase loops appear: "The curse was not malevolence; it was a language" / "It was not a prison—it was a mirror" recycles structure without added pressure. Figurative density is high without pattern-teaching: "throat of endless echoes," "skeletal fingers," "crack in the sky," "fault line in the earth's memory" cluster in early paragraphs. "The storyteller's hum climbed higher, piercing the veil" uses stock metaphor at a key beat. Template cadence in the third paragraph ("The diamond grew warmer…She had spent years…It resembled…") stacks similar stems. Deductions: paraphrase −0.2, figurative density −0.4, template cadence −0.4; total within-category −1.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The copper-veined translator, flawed diamond, and bone towers offer surface novelty, but the core arc—artifact holds secret, protagonist unlocks it, artifact demands price, protagonist rejects it—follows a familiar template without transformation. The "curse is a mirror" and "I am the extinction" moments assert rather than earn fresh insight. The flock-of-birds method and echo-canyon setting provide specific texture, but the emotional turn (fear of oblivion) is generic and told. Derivative premise adjustment −0.8.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The storyteller is present throughout and her choices (climb tower, hum, throw diamond) create turns. Setup clear; middle beat (hum raises resonance) and closure beat (throw ends maelstrom) both involve her. However, decisions feel reactive to external pressure (canyon "demands," diamond "burns") rather than internally conflicted agency. Cost is abstract (she retains the song mentally). Early signal +0.8, three beats +1.4, causal pressure (reactive) +0.5, closure linkage +0.7, cost (abstract) +0.2, late summary (steady hands deflate cost) −0.4. Base 3.0 + 3.2 = 6.2, but reactive agency and soft cost lower to 5.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The diamond is handled in three beats: clutched while studying (early), pulses during hum (middle), thrown into abyss (closure). Its black vein is traced, it heats her palm, splits into tones, and its absence is noted at the end. Setup +0.8, three beats +1.4, causal pressure (enables resonance, forces throw) +1.2, closure linkage (throw ends conflict) +1.5, specificity (black vein, warmth, tone-splitting) +0.6, cost (she retains mental song, softening loss) +0.3. Base 3.0 + 5.8 = 8.8, but mental retention slightly undercuts irreplaceability; round to 7.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Canyon of endless echoes" as setting is described early and the echoes distort bird cries, roar back at climax, then fall silent. However, "tunnel" is not on the page—canyon replaces it. The concept shapes atmosphere and the maelstrom moment but does not constrain protagonist tactics (she climbs, hums, throws regardless of echo behavior). Setup +0.8, two beats (distortion, maelstrom) +0.9, causal pressure (echoes complicate but do not narrow options) +0.5, closure (silence is noted but not reweighted) +0.3, swappability (any volatile environment could substitute) −0.6. Base 3.0 + 1.9 = 4.9, but substitution of "canyon" for "tunnel" and limited constraint lower to 4.1.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Quietly articulate voice narrating the chaos into order" appears once in the middle. It describes her journaling method but does not constrain an on-page choice or create visible cost. The hum at climax could reflect this trait, but the link is not made explicit. Late first appearance (middle third) −0.4, ornamental (label-only) −0.8, no cost −0.5. Base 3.0 − 1.7 = 1.3, but functional presence in one beat lifts slightly to 3.2.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Harness" is the action she pursues: studying the diamond's frequency to bridge extinct tongues. Setup clear (early goal), middle beat (she hums to harness resonance), closure (she throws rather than completes the harness). However, the throw rejects the action rather than fulfilling it, and her success is declared mid-scene ("She had done it") then immediately reversed. Setup +0.8, two beats +0.9, causal pressure (goal shapes hum) +0.9, closure (rejection, not completion) +0.4, specificity (harness via resonance) +0.5, swappability (any unlock/control verb fits) −0.6. Base 3.0 + 2.9 = 5.9, but rejection-not-fulfillment and swappability lower to 6.4 after rounding adjustments.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Flock patterns are studied across mornings (early), she waits for them at dusk (middle), their shadows and wingbeats sync with the diamond's pulse (climax), then they scatter. Setup +0.8, three beats +1.4, causal pressure (patterns enable resonance) +0.9, closure (scattering noted but not reweighted) +0.5, specificity (wingbeat rhythm, fractal symmetry) +0.6. Base 3.0 + 4.2 = 7.2, but the mechanics are summary ("recorded each variation") rather than dramatized trial-and-error, and the patterns do not visibly fail or force a tactic shift. Summary-only −0.6, ornamental final mention −0.3. Adjusted to 5.9.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Towers and canyon are present throughout. She climbs a tower (early), positions on a ledge (middle), the towers vibrate and glow (climax), she climbs down (end). Spatial pressure is clear: "narrow ledge," "slick bone," height enables observation and risk. Setup +0.8, three beats +1.4, causal pressure (setting constrains and enables) +1.3, closure linkage (descent ends scene) +1.0, specificity (bone, runes, vibration) +0.7. Base 3.0 + 5.2 = 8.2, but postcard elements (twin moons, Age of Whispers) dilute focus −0.4, rounding to 7.3.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Across the death of a language" appears as backstory motivation ("dedicated her life") but does not create an on-page deadline or tighten tactics. Time of day (dawn, dusk) is noted but does not constrain her actions—she could act at any hour. The language's death is thematic context, not a live clock. Setup (thematic) +0.3, no middle constraint, no closure linkage, ornamental −0.8, summary-only −0.6. Base 3.0 − 1.1 = 1.9, lifted slightly by thematic presence to 2.8.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Desire to translate texture into sound is declared early ("simple: to translate texture into sound") and drives her study, hum, and diamond test. Setup +0.8, three beats (study, hum, throw ends attempt) +1.4, causal pressure (goal shapes all moves) +1.3, closure (throw rejects fulfillment but retains mental song) +0.8, specificity (texture → sound via frequency) +0.6. Base 3.0 + 4.9 = 7.9, but "simple" and declaration-heavy presentation ("Her motivation was simple") reduce friction and dramatization −0.6, told-only for much of the arc −0.3. Adjusted to 6.7.</comment>
