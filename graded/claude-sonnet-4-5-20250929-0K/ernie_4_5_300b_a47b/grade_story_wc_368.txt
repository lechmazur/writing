<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lin's interiority carries specific texture—the "two people" sensation after transplant reads as embodied contradiction. The desire to understand story-magnetism drives her tracking movements, though the shift from watchful observation to decision lacks a visible cost or foreclosed path. Embodied emotion appears in "hands steady" and "ravenously," but the climax moment (wing vanishing, insight arriving) feels more like epiphany than a choice under competing pressure. The final commitment to "illuminate stories" is declared rather than enacted with a trade-off on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when within the first paragraph. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the wing's movement through the tea house gathers sensory and thematic density until it vanishes, leaving Lin with a new mission. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the final paragraph crystallizes her stance and reconfigures her purpose—but the cost remains conceptual and diffuse rather than a visible forfeiture. The escalation from private observation to shared story-moment to vocation is legible, though the wing's disappearance as trigger feels slightly convenient.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The floating tea house, obsidian stones, valley mist, and sun trails create a vivid, purposeful micro-setting. Light tracking constrains Lin's movement and charges the climax when the wing casts "sun trails" across the chamber. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered: "wet ink," "labyrinth of cool blues," morning versus afternoon mood shifts. The recurring blue morpho wing functions as both object and environmental modifier, shaping Lin's path and the travelers' shared moment. Spatial choreography is clear throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding why some people magnetize stories—is signaled early and shapes Lin's tracking. The middle tightening occurs when the wing's light leads her to the travelers, and pressure peaks when the wing flares and vanishes. However, the escalation relies on the wing's autonomous movement rather than Lin's agency under competing constraints. The travelers' story reaches climax simultaneously, but Lin remains observer; no visible trade-off or foreclosed option anchors her final commitment. Pressure is coherent but the cost at closure is asserted rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: story-magnetism, iridescent caution, quiet explosions in everyday moments. The blue morpho wing shifts from talisman to beacon to vanished lesson, charging the final image without overt moralizing. The donor heart as "new lens" ties interiority to thematic question. The ending offers a resonant answer—some hearts are built to hold stories—without a stated moral, and the travelers' shared connection dramatizes the concept. Minor slip: "iridescent caution" and "quietly explosive" appear as direct thematic labels in the final paragraph, edging toward summary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Single POV, stable third-limited with close psychic distance. Perceptual signature is consistent: Lin notices light, shadow, narrative aura. Diction is controlled and lyric ("angry star," "invisible threads"), though some phrases edge toward elevated register ("ravenously," "visceral hunger") that slightly exceed a dye master's idiom under stress. No dialogue on the page. Free indirect style is clean, and the narrative stance modulates appropriately as pressure rises. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks, and the voice remains distinct throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Rhythm varies, and figurative language is dense but mostly coherent ("stolen secret," "tiny, angry star"). Two minor slips: "quietly explosive" and "iridescent caution" recur as abstracted labels in the final paragraph without fresh embodiment (−0.3). A slight paraphrase loop appears mid-story when Lin's realization is restated across adjacent lines ("felt different. It felt purposeful.") (−0.2). Information density is high, and clarity remains intact. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes effectively. No major grammar or continuity errors.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The floating tea house, donor heart as lens shift, and blue morpho wing as story-key combine into a fresh synthesis. The premise—tracking sun trails to illuminate magnetized narratives—offers a non-obvious angle. Execution is competent but the emotional arc (observer to vocation) follows a familiar template: witness mystery, receive insight, commit to mission. The donor heart could be removed or replaced with another catalyst without fundamentally altering the structure. Transformation test: the core turn (wing vanishes, Lin understands) would work with different objects and setting. Specificity in world-building elevates the piece, but the arc itself is not bold.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lin as watchful dye master is present throughout and her observation drives her path through the tea house. The "watchful" trait is demonstrated (tracking light, noting patrons' auras), and she makes the final commitment to illuminate stories. However, her choices are reactive—following the wing's lead—rather than creating turns under competing pressure. The dye-master occupation is mentioned early but does not constrain or enable a tactical choice; her work with indigo pigment appears only in the opening beat and does not return. Two-of-three gates (setup, payoff via vocation) are met, but middle development lacks a decision that narrows options. Early signal +0.5, closure linkage +0.8, but late agency and ornamental occupation detail limit the score.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The blue morpho wing appears in three distinct beats: initial handling/description, movement through the tea house as beacon, and vanishing at climax. It is physically manipulated (unscrewed vial, tilted, catches light) and its iridescent properties drive the middle action. The wing's disappearance triggers Lin's realization, so closure linkage is strong. However, the wing acts autonomously ("drifted upward, catching the sun's rays") rather than being wielded by Lin under pressure, reducing causal specificity. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.2, but swappability (any luminous object could serve a similar role) and autonomous action reduce irreplaceability. Caps at all three gates met; strong integration but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Iridescent caution" is named explicitly as theme in the opening and closing paragraphs but does not shape on-page stakes or alter Lin's tactics. It functions as label rather than lived constraint. The wing's beauty is "quietly explosive, a reminder that not all that glittered was safe to touch," but Lin never faces a choice where the caution compels her to hold back or risk. The concept echoes thematically but does not change options. Setup present +0.4, but ornamental use without pressure −0.8, label-only treatment −0.3. Missing middle development → cap 3.4; present in closing reflection pushes slightly above baseline.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Quietly explosive" appears as descriptor for the wing's beauty and later for "everyday moments" in the final paragraph. It is treated as thematic attribute rather than a trait that constrains or enables action. No on-page choice demonstrates a tradeoff between quiet and explosive; the travelers' story is "hushed" yet reaches climax, but this is their scene, not Lin's decision. Setup present as label +0.3, closure mention +0.3, but ornamental use without visible cost −0.7, label-only −0.3. Introduced early but missing middle development → cap 4.6.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Illuminate" is the final verb of Lin's vocation: she will "spend the rest of her days illuminating the stories." The action is foreshadowed by her tracking of light and the wing's dazzling arc that "illuminates" the travelers. However, the major turn (wing vanishing, Lin's insight) is not enacted by Lin illuminating something; it happens to her. The action names her future stance but does not drive the on-page climax. Setup via light-tracking +0.6, closure linkage as named vocation +0.9, but swappability (other verbs like "gathering" or "revealing" would fit) −0.5, and the action is declared rather than performed at the decisive beat. All three gates present; functional but not irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Tracking sun trails" is established early: "She had always tracked the sun's movements" and "the light felt purposeful." Lin follows the wing's reflection "like a beacon" through the tea house, so the method shapes her middle beat. At closure, she vows to continue "by tracking the sun's path." However, the mechanics are minimal—she simply walks after the light—and no constraint or technique is demonstrated. Early signal +0.5, middle beat involvement +0.4, closure linkage +0.7, but method lacks specificity (anyone could follow light) −0.6. Two-of-three gates met (setup, development); payoff is declarative rather than enacted, limiting score.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The floating rock tea house is anchored early and its obsidian walls, terrace, main chamber, and bell tower provide spatial structure. The setting's unique trait—floating above valley mist—creates visual wonder but does not constrain a choice. The tea house functions as stage for the travelers' story and Lin's tracking; light reflection off obsidian matters ("gleam like wet ink"). At closure, the tea house is named as her "sanctuary" and "stage for quiet explosions." Early signal +0.7, two beats (terrace, main chamber) +0.9, closure linkage +0.9, but setting pressures atmosphere more than tactics −0.4. All three gates met; essential to tone but does not alter a key decision.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"After receiving the donor heart" anchors the timeframe in the opening: "three weeks ago." The transplant creates the new lens—"as though she were now two people"—that motivates her question about story-magnetism. The timeframe shapes her internal state but does not tighten decisions or impose a deadline. No countdown or urgency tied to the three weeks. Early signal +0.6, motivational linkage +0.5, closure mention (the heart "had given her a new lens") +0.4, but time does not alter tactics or escalate pressure −0.5. Two gates (setup, payoff); missing middle development where time constrains a choice → guided toward mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"To learn why some people magnetize stories" is stated explicitly in paragraph 3 and drives Lin's tracking. The desire is tested when she observes the travelers and the wing leads her to them, then fulfilled when she realizes the donor heart gave her the lens to see narrative threads. Friction appears in her "desperate need to understand" and the implicit risk of following the wing. However, the want is more curiosity than conflicted desire with competing cost. Early signal +0.7, middle beat (tracking to travelers) +0.4, closure payoff (insight arrives) +0.8, but told-only motivation without on-page tradeoff −0.6. All three gates met; functional but the friction is light.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Valley-mist wonder" saturates the opening ("valley mist swirled, thick and silver") and modulates through the piece: morning light "seeping," the wing glowing "like a tiny, angry star," mist "burn[ing] away under the morning heat." Tone remains coherent across turns and charges the final image when patrons arrive "their faces still damp with mist" as Lin smiles. The tone supports rather than tensions the concept, but the lyric register never falters or undermines pressure. Early establishment +0.7, consistent modulation across three beats +1.2, closure linkage (mist imagery in final lines) +1.1. Strong tonal control throughout; irreplaceable to the piece's effect.</comment>
