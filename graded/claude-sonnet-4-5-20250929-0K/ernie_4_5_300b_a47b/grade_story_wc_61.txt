<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Lumin's motivations are stated rather than earned through embodied contradiction. The internal conflict between fire's warmth and the Enclave's ban is told through exposition ("Lumin's heart ached") rather than dramatized through difficult micro-choices under pressure. The ghost encounter resolves the tension through explanation rather than forcing Lumin to foreclose a path with visible cost. Interiority relies on abstract philosophical framing ("generational patterns weren't chains—they were bridges") instead of character-particular perception.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The piece orients who/where/when adequately by ~120 words. Closure attempts a Resonant Reconfiguration through the insight about wielding light without violence, but the cost remains conceptual and asserted rather than dramatized—Lumin places the gear down and walks away without forfeiting a live stake or altering concrete options. The ghost's exposition ("light *is* fire, child") delivers the turn through tell rather than causal pressure, weakening the because/therefore linkage. Under a Causal lens (inferred from the calculating-machine setup and the quest structure), the resolution feels given rather than earned.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The nebula garden offers vivid, purposeful sensory detail (gas-clouds "shimmered like mother-of-pearl," crystalline trees with fractal leaves). However, the environment functions primarily as backdrop rather than constraining choices—petals drift and sonar pings, but these don't alter Lumin's tactics or options. The gear is placed at the tree base as a symbolic gesture, not because the setting forces that move. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—decoding why the Enclave abandoned fire—is signaled early. However, escalation occurs through the ghost's exposition rather than Lumin's agency under mounting pressure. The ghost simply explains the answer rather than Lumin earning it through a choice that forecloses options. No visible price is paid; Lumin achieves understanding and walks away with a promise, leaving the gear behind in a symbolic rather than costly act. One tightening occurs (the sonar pinging intensifies, guiding deeper) but it leads to information delivery, not a trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The theme of generational patterns as bridges rather than chains emerges clearly through the fire/light dichotomy. However, the final insight is stated directly ("generational patterns weren't about repeating the past, but about refining it") rather than embodied in a non-literal image. The ghost's monologue ("Fire is a language... we forgot how to speak it gently") delivers the thematic answer through explicit articulation. The ending carries earnest emotional weight but lacks the resonant ambiguity that would lift it beyond teachable morals.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>POV remains stable in third-person limited focused on Lumin. Voice carries a lyric, elevated register consistent with the SF-fantasy setting. However, diction occasionally drifts into prompt-echo phrasing ("approximating infinity," "transit") that feels imposed rather than organic to Lumin's perceptual signature. The ghost's dialogue ("light *is* fire, child") reads as thematic explanation rather than character-specific speech. Psychic distance is controlled, though the narrator's philosophical framing sometimes pulls away from embodied interiority.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully and imagery is often striking ("petals drifted like forgotten constellations"). However, several template-cadence runs appear ("Lumin understood. The Enclave's ban hadn't been about... it had been about..."), and synonym loops recur around "light" and "fire" without adding pressure. The phrase "approximates infinity" appears twice in similar constructions, feeling like prompt-checklist fulfillment. No paraphrase loops or filter-verb stacks dense enough to trigger heavy penalties, but cumulative minor issues lower clarity and propulsion in non-closure beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The core premise—an enclave that banned fire for quieter light sources—offers a fresh angle on generational trauma and technological choice. However, execution relies on familiar SF-mysticism tropes (sentient nebula garden, hologram ancestor, mystical calculating device) without transforming them through grounded specificity. The emotional arc (seeking ancestral wisdom, receiving it from a ghost, walking away with new understanding) follows a template structure. The "fire that whispers" resolution feels metaphorically tidy rather than earned through lived contradiction.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Lumin is identified as "a sentimentalist from the Starfall Enclave" and believes in generational patterns, but this trait functions more as label than driver. The key turn—understanding that light is fire, just quieter—comes from the ghost's exposition rather than Lumin's sentimental framework forcing a difficult choice. Present in setup and ending, but the character's defining attribute doesn't constrain options under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The gear appears in three beats: Lumin adjusts it early, it flickers during the ghost encounter, and Lumin places it at the tree base at closure. Its "teeth approximating infinity" and ability to "decode hidden frequencies" are stated but never mechanically demonstrated—we don't see it actually decode anything or narrow options. The final placement feels symbolic rather than causally necessary. Present across beats but swappable with any mystical decoding device.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Generational patterns anchor the premise (why the Enclave abandoned fire) and shape Lumin's quest. The concept drives the middle investigation and the ghost's revelation reframes it ("patterns weren't chains—they were bridges"). It appears in setup, complicates the middle through the ancestors' silence, and is explicitly resolved at closure. However, the concept operates more as thematic frame than tactical constraint—it doesn't force Lumin to choose between competing goods on the page.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>The gear's teeth "approximating infinity" is mentioned twice as a descriptive label but never constrains or enables an on-page action. The attribute signals the device's mystical scope but doesn't alter what Lumin can or cannot do with it. No visible tradeoff tied to this specific property; a gear with any other mystical descriptor would function identically in the narrative.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Transit" appears as a whispered word-revelation midway ("Transit," Lumin whispered, the word carrying the weight of a revelation") and the final paragraph references moving forward by carrying lessons. The concept of movement/passage is thematically present but the story's major turns (encountering the ghost, receiving the explanation, placing the gear) don't hinge on an act of transit. The element reads as thematic echo rather than plot driver.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Sonar pinging is signaled early as the garden's communication method and intensifies to guide Lumin to the grove—a functional middle beat. The mechanics matter (low, resonant hum; marks passage of time) and the method shapes one tactic (following the sound deeper). However, it doesn't recur at closure or constrain the final choice. Present in setup and middle development; absent from payoff.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The nebula garden frames the entire story, provides the sonar-pinging method, and hosts the crystalline grove where the ghost appears. The setting supplies the petals motif that recurs in the timeframe phrase and the final image. However, the environment doesn't constrain Lumin's choices—the garden guides and houses but doesn't pressure. Micro-setting (the gear placed at the tree base) charges the ending symbolically. Present across all three gates with moderate causal weight.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The phrase "across the quiet sigh of falling petals" appears three times, framing the story's temporal span poetically. However, no live clock tightens decisions—the petals fall throughout without creating urgency or altering Lumin's tactics. The timeframe is atmospheric rather than tactical. Present in setup and ending as a recurring image but doesn't constrain the middle action.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Lumin's desire to share light without using fire is stated early, drives the quest to decode the ancestors' silence, and is resolved in the pledge to create "a fire that whispers." The motivation is told more than dramatized—Lumin's heart "ached" for fire's warmth, but we don't see conflicting pulls tested through difficult on-page choices. The ghost's explanation satisfies the want without forcing a trade-off. Present across beats but the friction between want and cost remains conceptual.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Tone balances serenity (drifting petals, quiet humming) with troubling undertones (ancestors' silence, scars from fire, the urgency in the sonar). The "quiet sigh" motif and the ghost's dissolution into light maintain the serene-yet-unsettling register. However, the tone remains relatively static—it doesn't modulate sharply under pressure or deepen at closure. The final image (petals clinging "as gentle as a promise") leans more purely serene than troubling. Coherent but doesn't charge the ending with the promised disquiet.</comment>
