<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Kael's motivation to free trapped creativity is declared but never tested by a choice that forecloses an alternate path. His "moonstruck dreamer" trait functions as label-only; we observe him adjusting instruments and experiencing visions, but no internal contradiction forces a decision under pressure. The stardust flood at the climax is received passively—he kneels, laughs, stands—without a micro-choice that reveals hierarchy of values. The ending resets him to chase the aurora again, foreclosing no live option with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The closure unit is a passive reception of stardust that grants creative fulfillment without protagonist agency; Kael tips a jar and images flood him, then the archway fades. No on-page choice narrows options or forecloses a path with felt cost; the "unwritten calendar can wait" line asserts renewed purpose but nothing was visibly renounced or altered. The Drive Lens reads as attempted Accumulative/Textural (aurora motifs, stardust recursion), yet the final image does not reweight prior material—it simply restates the opening stance. Orientation is anchored early (aurora archway, Kael with sextant); no penalty there.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The aurora-lit archway is vividly rendered and anchors the scene early; the sextant's brass and mother-of-pearl inlays add texture. The hidden chamber with labeled jars ("The Singer's First Note") offers specific detail that constrains Kael's final choice of which jar to open. However, spatial choreography inside the chamber is vague—shelves, dust, dissolving walls—without coherent scale or movement logic that would further pressure the peak beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—freeing trapped creativity—is signaled early but never faces a trade-off or tightening that narrows options. The archway opens without resistance; the chamber contains exactly what Kael seeks; the stardust grants fulfillment with no price paid on the page. The voice's reassurance ("You're close," "Creativity isn't trapped. It's waiting") removes tension rather than escalating it. No meaningful escalation or deepening occurs; the plot is outline-like and-then sequencing without protagonist-driven reversal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The theme of trapped creativity waiting to be unlocked emerges through the stardust jars and the aurora's "breath of imprisoned gods," but the final image—Kael standing, brushing dust, smiling—offers no non-literal answer or reweighting of prior material; it simply restates the premise. The line "The unspoken words had been here all along" is an explicit theme statement rather than earned resonance. The stardust's specificity (labeled jars, static electricity) adds texture, yet the resolution into easy fulfillment flattens complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Kael; perceptual signature is consistent (fractured galaxies, ozone taste, stardust prickle). Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register—"shadowed rapture" tone sustains "iridescent tendrils," "moonstruck," "murmur of a thousand voices"—but remains voice-motivated and legible. The voice's dialogue ("You see?") lacks clear sourcing, creating brief ambiguity, yet the mystical frame permits it. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks that dull immediacy at peak beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Overwriting is pervasive: "aurora-lit archway loomed like a portal," "eyes like fractured galaxies," "remembered stardust that clung to his memories," "painting of the archway as it might've looked centuries ago" all layer figurative language densely without pattern-teaching or payoff at closure. The opening sentence front-loads three subordinate descriptors before the subject acts. Paraphrase loop: "The unspoken words had been here all along, hidden in the stardust, in the aurora's light, in the act of resting not by sleeping, but by listening" restates the theme claim across three parallel prepositional phrases. Template cadence in the final paragraph: "But his mind buzzed… each one a star… He stood… and smiled." Information density is moderate; many lines do atmospheric work but do not advance causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The core premise—jars of preserved creative stardust unlocked by an astronomical instrument under an aurora—reads as a fantasy-fulfillment template without transformation through specific lived friction or non-obvious moral calculus. The "moonstruck dreamer seeks lost creativity" frame is familiar; execution does not subvert or deepen it. The sextant projecting a holographic map and the labeled jars offer surface novelty, yet the arc (seek, find, receive, renew) follows a median plot path. No bold structural risk or synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Kael is present throughout and his desire drives the search, but his choices are passive observations (adjusts sextant, closes eyes, lifts jar, tips jar). No decision alters tactics or forecloses a path; the archway opens for him, the voice guides him, the stardust floods him. Setup gate met (paragraph one), middle gate weak (no choice under pressure), closure gate weak (receives fulfillment, stands and smiles without renunciation). Swappable with any questing dreamer archetype.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The sextant appears in paragraph one (brass, mother-of-pearl inlays), is adjusted in paragraph three (gears whir, projects hologram), and clatters to the floor in paragraph six during the vision. Three touches across setup, middle, and ending proximity. It enables the holographic map that reveals the hidden chamber—causal pressure—but does not constrain a choice or return with reweighted meaning at closure. The final paragraph mentions it only as "cold against his chest," a static prop. Functional but not indispensable; a different device could project the map with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Remembered stardust frames the opening ("fragments of a childhood spent under skies no longer visible"), reappears as preserved jars in the chamber (middle beat), and is absorbed in the climax ("stardust spilled into his palm… melted into his skin, flooding his mind"). Three-gate presence: setup, middle causal work (the jar he chooses), and closure participation (the absorption). It shapes the dominant stake (freeing creativity trapped in stardust) and the final image (Kael's mind "buzzed with ideas, each one a star waiting to fall"). The concept is irreplaceable to the story's logic; removing it collapses the premise and resolution.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Kael's ability to hear unspoken words is mentioned in paragraph one ("whispers that only the moonstruck could hear") and dramatized in paragraph three ("he heard it—the murmur of a thousand voices, unspoken yet urgent"). The voice returns in paragraphs four and five ("You're close," "You see?"), guiding him but not constraining a choice with visible cost. No trade-off or price is paid for this trait; it functions as a convenience that smooths his path. Present in two beats (setup, middle guidance) but absent from closure; no reprise in the final image. Swappable with any intuitive perception without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>"Rest" is declared in paragraph one ("he vowed, he would rest not in sleep, but by tracing the path of falling stars") and restated in paragraph six ("the act of resting not by sleeping, but by listening"). It functions as thematic label rather than action that shapes beats. Kael never enacts rest as a tactic under pressure; he adjusts the sextant, follows the star's arc, and absorbs stardust—all active moves. The word appears twice but does not drive turns or constrain tactics. Easily swappable with "seek," "listen," or "attune" with no structural impact. Missing middle and closure gates; ornamental theme claim only.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Tracing the path of falling stars is signaled in paragraph one (taught by a dying astronomer), enacted in paragraph four ("Kael traced the path of a falling star with his finger, following its arc across the hologram"), and that action triggers the archway to shudder and reveal the chamber—clear causal pressure. The method matters: his finger-trace on the hologram is the hinge that unlocks the hidden space. However, the method does not return at closure; the final paragraph mentions chasing the aurora but not tracing stars. Setup and middle gates met, closure gate missing. Functional and specific but not indispensable to the ending image.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The aurora-lit archway is established in the opening line, anchors all spatial action (Kael leans against it, projects the hologram onto it, it shudders and reveals the chamber), and its fading at dawn bookends the piece. It constrains the scene to one location and supplies the resource (the central stone alignment) that enables the sextant's projection. The archway's etched constellations return as the hologram's stars in paragraph three, a purposeful reprise. However, the archway itself does not charge the final image—Kael is "alone in the field" with the sextant cold against his chest; the archway has vanished, its work complete but not reweighted in the ending beat. All three gates met; strong causal work; missing a final closure charge that would push it into the 8+ range.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"Unwritten calendar" appears only in the final line ("The unwritten calendar could wait") as a thematic flourish without prior setup or middle-beat constraint. Time is tracked loosely: "For years, he'd chased," "Tonight, he vowed," "When dawn approached." No clock tightens Kael's choices; the archway fades at dawn but that progression does not force a trade-off or shape tactics. Missing setup and middle gates; closure mention is label-only and does not reweight prior material. Swappable with any temporal metaphor ("tomorrow," "the future") with no structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The motivation to free trapped creativity is declared in paragraph two ("Trapped creativity, he believed, was the curse of those who forgot how to listen"), drives Kael's journey to the archway, and is fulfilled in paragraph six when the stardust floods his mind with "a symphony he'd never written, a painting… a poem." Three-gate presence: setup, middle pursuit (opening the jar), and closure payoff (ideas buzz "each one a star waiting to fall"). However, the motivation is never conflicted or tested by a choice with visible cost; Kael receives exactly what he seeks without friction. Functional but lacks the trade-off or renunciation that would demonstrate hierarchy of values under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Shadowed rapture" as tone is coherent and sustained: the aurora is both beautiful and ominous ("breath of imprisoned gods"), the stardust "prickled like frost," the sky "felt like drowning," Kael's laugh is "raw and unburdened." Elevated diction ("iridescent tendrils," "fractured galaxies," "murmur of a thousand voices") maintains a mystical register throughout. The tone modulates slightly—urgency in the search, awe in the chamber, release in the vision—without breaking coherence. It charges the final image: Kael's smile after the raw laugh sustains the rapture, and the dawn's approach casts a shadow on the archway's fading. Strong execution with purposeful modulation; no static flatness.</comment>
