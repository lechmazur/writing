<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lira's motivation to leave a mark is established, but her interior life reads more as thematic vehicle than embodied contradiction. The final choice to plant the vial is declared rather than earned through on-page struggle; we're told she's "purposefully curious" and that she "ignored" the cold, but these remain labels without visceral cost or conflicting impulses acting simultaneously. The grandfather's wisdom arrives as inherited epigram rather than lived tension, and the ending's satisfaction feels preordained rather than wrested from genuine stakes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece anchors who/where/when early and attempts a Conceptual Repricing at closure (the archivist's discovery, Lira's reflection years later). However, the final third fragments into summary epilogue rather than landing a single on-page closure beat with felt cost—Lira never learns her message was found, so the "outlasting" registers as thematic assertion rather than dramatized reconfiguration. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural (dawning hush as image, hourglass grain as motif), but the closure disperses across multiple time frames without a clear tightening that reweights the dominant stake with visible price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The moonlit summit, crater edges, and Earth's crescent are rendered with purposeful detail, and the airless cold and dust are integrated into action (kneeling, adjusting visor, planting vial). The hourglass grain functions as micro-setting object that charges the final image, lifting the category. However, the summit itself remains largely atmospheric backdrop; no environmental constraint meaningfully narrows Lira's options or complicates her planting of the vial.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—to document and leave a signal before drones arrive—is signaled early, and the 17-minute countdown adds temporal pressure. Yet the escalation is largely external (drones en route) rather than driven by Lira's agency; she executes her plan without reversal, adaptation, or visible trade-off. The drones arrive "seconds later," but Lira is "unbothered"—no cost is legible in the moment, and the epilogue's satisfaction undercuts any sense of forfeiture or endurance with felt weight.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Theme of human marks outlasting indifference emerges from the hourglass grain and archive photo, and the grandfather's maxim ("Some truths outlast the hands that write them") seeds the closure resonance. However, the final paragraph summarizes theme rather than embodying it: "dawnlit melancholy lingered—a quiet, persistent truth" is overt moralizing that replaces image with label. The archivist's smile and Lira's own retrospective contentment resolve ambiguity too neatly, flattening the complexity the piece reaches for.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable, and diction ("crater-inspection visor," "Lunar Standard Time") carries setting texture. However, register drifts into generic lyricism at emotional peaks ("the melancholy of this moment," "the indifference of the cosmos") that could describe any solitary act. The epilogue's summary voice—"she'd moved on to teaching, her curiosity now focused"—flattens interiority into past-tense report, and no distinct perceptual signature emerges beyond competent documentary observer.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear and free of major grammar errors, but suffers from template cadence ("She knelt… She retrieved… She checked… She packed") and paraphrase loops: "the moon wasn't a conquest. It was a mirror" followed by "Her photographs, her messages—they were attempts to outlast" repeats the same thematic claim. Stock metaphors ("carved a silver path," "fleeting moment," "quiet, persistent truth") dull the closure beats. The epilogue's summarized years compress pivotal emotional territory into exposition, and figurative language in high-pressure lines ("spiral of golden gas that danced") trends decorative rather than purposeful.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The hourglass sand grain offers a specific mechanism, and the "last crater inspector" frame gestures at fresh angle. However, the emotional arc—solitary scientist leaves poignant mark before obsolescence—follows a familiar template without transformation. The archivist epilogue and Lira's retrospective contentment deliver exactly the thematic payoff the setup promises, with no counterweight or non-obvious synthesis. The piece reads competent but median, choosing safe lyricism over risk.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Lira is present throughout and her choice to plant the vial is the story's central act, but her role is more custodian of premise than agent under pressure—she executes a plan without reversal or adaptation. Present by setup, involved in the middle beat (planting vial), and referenced in epilogue, she meets two gates. However, swappability is high (any solitary technician could perform this ritual) and no on-page cost tied specifically to her inspector role alters tactics. Causal pressure is weak; the story would function identically with "astronaut" or "surveyor."</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The hourglass sand grain appears early (setup), is handled and activated mid-scene (middle beat: "positioned the vial at the crater's center," "activated the vial's trigger"), and its dissolution at dawn provides the story's visual climax (closure participation). The object is irreplaceable—its chemical properties and grandfather's legacy charge its meaning—and it shapes two distinct beats. However, it does not constrain a choice under pressure (Lira never struggles with whether or how to use it), and the epilogue's archivist discovery feels tacked rather than causally earned. Strong integration across beats, but lacks the friction or trade-off that would lift it to indispensability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>The "dawning hush" is named in paragraph one and reprised in the title and final beats, but functions as atmospheric label rather than stake or constraint. Lira photographs it, but the concept does not shape her tactics, narrow options, or create on-page friction. It remains ornamental—swappable with "last light" or "final silence"—and the piece would function identically without the phrase. Present (setup via title/opening) but fails middle development and closure participation tests.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Purposefully curious" is stated twice ("Lira's curiosity wasn't bound by duty," "Purposefully curious, she'd spent years decoding") but never dramatized as a trait that constrains or enables a choice with visible cost. The decoding work is summarized backstory, and her on-page actions (planting vial, photographing) do not hinge on curiosity over, say, duty or nostalgia. The attribute is label-only, lacks middle development (no scene where curiosity forces a trade-off), and does not participate in closure. Introduced early but remains inert.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Outlast" is the story's thematic spine—Lira wants her mark to outlast drones and indifference, and the epilogue confirms the archive photo persists. The action is present in setup (stated goal), middle (planting vial "to outlast"), and closure (archivist finds photo, Lira reflects on outlasting cosmos). However, the mechanics are passive: time does the work, not Lira's struggle. She does not actively outcompete or adapt to beat the drones; she simply places the vial and waits. The ending's satisfaction—"she'd outlasted the indifference"—is asserted rather than earned through on-page friction. Functional across beats but replaceable with "preserve" or "mark" with minor edits; no unique cost or constraint tied to outlasting per se.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Chemical reactions for timed messages are introduced early (grandfather's work, microcapsule mechanics explained), the vial is activated mid-scene ("tiny laser that would begin the dissolution process at dawn"), and the gas release at 05:13 provides the story's visual payoff. The method is specific and irreplaceable—no other mechanism would produce the "spiral of golden gas." However, the method does not constrain a choice under pressure (Lira does not troubleshoot, adapt, or risk failure), and the epilogue's cross-reference to chemical logs feels expository rather than causally earned. Shapes two beats (activation, dissolution) and participates in closure image, but lacks the friction or cost that would make it indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The moonlit summit is anchored early and provides spatial coherence (crater, visor, Earth on horizon), meeting setup. The summit's "airless chill" and dust are mentioned but do not constrain Lira's planting of the vial—no environmental obstacle complicates her action. The summit appears in closure (final image of crater, gas, Earth) but as backdrop rather than active pressure. Functional and present across beats, but swappable with any isolated lunar site; no unique topographic or atmospheric feature alters tactics or charges the ending beyond generic "remote, silent place."</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The Space Age is named in paragraph one ("twilight," "early days") and reprised in the epilogue ("The Space Age had ended"), framing the story's nostalgia. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions or tactics—Lira's work would read identically in any era of human spaceflight. The 23-minute/17-minute countdown provides local urgency, but that is scene-level pacing, not "Space Age" as constraint. The era functions as thematic color (flags, conquest, drones as progress) without shaping on-page choices or costs. Present in setup and epilogue (closure echo) but fails middle development; easily swappable with "colonial era" or "survey era."</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The desire to photograph "the last of something precious" is stated early and drives Lira's presence on the summit; the camera hums, she frames the shot, and later develops the film, meeting setup and middle beats. The photo appears in closure (archivist finds it, Lira reflects on it years later). However, the motivation is told more than dramatized—no on-page friction between wanting to capture the hush and the cost of doing so (time, risk, sacrifice). The epilogue confirms she succeeded, but the success is given rather than earned through conflicted choice. Functional across beats and linked to closure, but lacks the trade-off or felt cost that would lift it above replaceable "document" or "commemorate."</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Dawnlit melancholy" is named in the final paragraph and gestured at throughout (cold silence, fading gas, Lira's wistful reflections), meeting tonal coherence. However, the tone remains static—gentle sadness without modulation under pressure. The drones' arrival does not darken or sharpen the mood; Lira remains "unbothered" and smiles. The epilogue's "quiet, persistent truth" restates melancholy as label rather than charging the final image with fresh emotional weight. Present in setup (implicit) and closure (explicit label), but fails middle development (no tonal turn or deepening) and does not reweight the stake. Functional but one-note; swappable with "wistful solitude."</comment>
