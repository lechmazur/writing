<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Lirael's core motivation (planting seeds for her people) is established, but her interiority reads as thematic assertion rather than embodied contradiction. The chains function primarily as symbolic decoration rather than constraining live choices—she wrenches them free when needed without prior struggle or cost. Key beats like "The liberator was unchained at last" tell the transformation rather than dramatizing micro-choices that reveal it. Backstory about "generations ago" and "the wall came down" floats above present action without anchoring in a concrete stimulus that shifts her stance on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The opening delays spatial orientation (carnival prize redemption center, chains, piano bench upstairs) past 120 words, creating initial fog. Drive lens reads as hybrid causal-symbolic, but the closure—seeds exploding and rooting instantly—introduces a late magic-realist rule without prior cuing, breaking earned causality. The scavengers appear as convenient pressure in the final third without prior setup, and Lirael's decision to hurl the vial feels reactive rather than motivated by prior tactical narrowing. Cost at closure (freeing the seeds vs. keeping them) is gestured at but not legibly weighed on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The carnival setting supplies vivid anchors (dust, cotton candy smell, rusted iron, piano bench) and the arrow's fletching provides tactile recurring detail. The vault's "door forged from iron and ivy" and the seeds in glass vials offer specificity. However, spatial choreography weakens: the bench is "upstairs" from chains on the floor, but Lirael's movement between levels and the scavengers' simultaneous approach create unclear geometry. The final outdoor transformation (dry soil trembling) lands as a charged image that shifts scale.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—reach the vault and free the seeds—is signaled early, but escalation relies on the scavengers' late arrival rather than protagonist-driven tightening. Lirael's puzzle-solving (inserting keys) proceeds without meaningful reversals or cost; each key works in sequence without friction. The climax choice (hurl the vial to root the scavengers) feels coincidental rather than a trade-off shaped by prior constraints. The instant vine-growth offers spectacle but no visible price paid for using the only vial.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Theme of resilience vs. dry soil emerges through the seed vault conceit and the title "chained liberator," but the final beat states the theme overtly: "resilience had been planted." The arrow's symbolic fletching and the keys' moon/sun/spiral shapes gesture toward pattern without earning a non-literal reweighting at closure. The scavengers remain one-note greed figures without complexity. The vial's explosive use offers a visual payoff but the thematic question—what cost to plant hope—is answered by convenience (instant vines) rather than ambiguous particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV holds consistently to Lirael's perspective with clear psychic distance. Perceptual signature shows in sensory details filtered through her goals (symbols on keys, fletching design). However, diction drifts into elevated register at peaks: "staggering grace in her movement" and "the culmination of generations of patience" feel authored rather than character-particular. The scavengers' "faces twisted with greed" externalizes judgment Lirael wouldn't pause to catalogue mid-escape. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, balancing longer descriptive passages with terse action beats in the climax.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Clarity holds across most beats, but the piece carries template artifacts: "She'd been here for days, maybe weeks—time blurred"; "The air smelled of dust and forgotten cotton candy"; "a promise she'd made to herself when the wall came down" all read as stock framings. Paraphrase loop appears when "She reached for the keys" is followed by three nearly identical sentences describing key insertion without added pressure. The line "The liberator was unchained at last" summarizes the transformation rather than showing the wrenching action. Mixed metaphor: seeds "suspended in glass vials" then "shimmering like liquid starlight" blurs their physical state.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The premise—seed vault unlocked by piano keys in a carnival—offers a specific synthesis, but the chained-prisoner-escapes-with-treasure structure follows a familiar template without transformation. The instant-growth vines that conveniently trap pursuers resolve tension through a late rule rather than earned constraints. The "chained liberator" title and wall-collapse timeframe gesture toward allegory (freedom, resilience) without grounding in lived particulars that would distinguish this world's history. The arrow-as-map and key-sequence puzzle show craft but not risk that heightens stakes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Lirael is on-page throughout and her title frames the concept, but her choices (insert keys in sequence, descend stairs, throw vial) are reactive steps rather than dilemmas that create turns. The decision to hurl the vial at scavengers is the sole active choice, arriving in the final beat without prior friction that would make it costly. Setup is immediate, development shows puzzle-solving, closure involves her, but causal pressure remains low.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The arrow appears in two beats: retrieved from the bench with fletching study, then inserted into the vault door where it glows and unlocks. Its strange fletching (twilight dyes, copper wire) is described and its symbols align with piano keys, creating specificity. However, it functions as a static puzzle piece rather than constraining choice under pressure; once retrieved, it opens the vault without complication. Early signal (+0.3), two beats (+0.9), closure linkage (+0.7), but swappable with any symbolic key mechanism (−0.5) and no visible cost tied to using it (−0.3).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The seed vault is the story's core goal, shaping Lirael's entire sequence of actions (solve puzzle, descend, open vault, deploy seeds). It appears in setup (buried generations ago), drives middle development (the puzzle to access it), and the seeds' deployment at closure creates the final image. However, "clandestine" reads as label-only; no on-page tension arises from keeping it hidden—scavengers learn of it off-page. Early framing (+0.5), three beats (+1.4), closure linkage (+1.2), but the vault itself remains passive backdrop rather than imposing a tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Patiently strategic" is told in the opening: "She'd spent hours studying the keys" and "waiting for the right alignment of stars." The trait justifies her preparation but does not constrain a live choice with cost on the page. The key-solving proceeds smoothly without a moment where patience must battle urgency or strategy must adapt to a reversal. Label present, no dramatized tradeoff, swappable with "prepared" or "careful" (−0.6).</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Impede" structures the climax: Lirael uses the exploding vial to root scavengers in vines, halting their pursuit. This action is irreplaceable—without it, the scavengers would seize the seeds. The choice appears late (final paragraph) but it redefines the tactical situation and enables her escape. Setup is thin (scavengers arrive only in the final third, −0.3), but the act drives the closure image directly (+1.5) and carries specificity (vines as impediment, +0.5). Late arrival (−0.4) limits the score, but causal necessity and closure linkage elevate it into the 7-band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The piano-bench puzzle is introduced early (first third) and occupies the middle: Lirael studies key symbols, matches them to arrow fletching, and turns each key in sequence. The method is specific (crescent moon, sunburst, spiral, star keys) and irreplaceable—no alternate path to the vault is offered. However, the sequence unfolds without friction; each key works on the first try, offering no tactical cost or reversal. Early signal (+0.5), two beats (study, execution, +0.9), closure participation (unlocks vault leading to seed deployment, +0.9), but no dramatized pressure or failed attempt (−0.4).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The abandoned carnival prize redemption center anchors the opening with sensory detail (dust, cotton candy, rusted cuffs) and houses the piano bench that holds the puzzle. The vault lies beneath the carnival, making location integral to structure. Spatial specificity (bench upstairs, vault below) creates two-level choreography. Setup immediate (+0.5), two environments used (redemption center, vault, +0.6), closure occurs there (+0.8), but the setting does not constrain Lirael's choices—she moves freely once unchained, and the carnival's abandonment removes social obstacles rather than imposing them (−0.6).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"When the wall comes down" is referenced three times: opening ("when the wall came down"), middle ("the wall's collapse had drawn scavengers"), and ending ("the wall's rubble at her feet"). The collapse signals a larger societal shift and explains both why Lirael acts now and why scavengers arrive, but the timeframe remains abstract—no clock tightens decisions, and the collapse itself occurs off-page before the story opens. Setup via allusion (+0.3), mentioned in two beats (+0.4), closure image includes rubble (+0.4), but the timing does not narrow live options or create urgency within the scene (−0.7).</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Lirael's motivation—"to plant resilience in dry soil, to give her people a chance to grow again"—is articulated in the middle and drives her persistence through the puzzle and her choice to deploy the seeds at the end. The desire is specific (seeds for her people's survival) and opposed by scavengers' greed. However, the motivation is told rather than shown through a moment of friction where planting competes with another want (safety, keeping seeds for herself). Early signal (implied by "liberator" title, +0.3), present in middle and ending beats (+0.9), closure linkage (she throws the vial to actualize the goal, +0.9), but no on-page conflict between her stated want and an opposing impulse (−0.6).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Staggering grace" appears once, near the climax: "Lirael smiled, a staggering grace in her movement." Tone elsewhere mixes gritty realism (chains, rust, dust) with elevated lyricism ("feathers dyed in hues of twilight," "liquid starlight"), creating inconsistency rather than purposeful modulation. The phrase itself reads as authorial assertion rather than embodied description—grace under duress is told, not shown through rhythm or gesture. Single mention (−0.8), late arrival (−0.5), does not modulate across pressure beats or charge the final image (−0.6).</comment>
