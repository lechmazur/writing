<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Unit-17's core motivation (finding where thoughts come from) is consistently maintained, and the "remarkably composed" trait appears repeatedly. However, the robot's philosophical awakening arrives through convenient instrument contact rather than earned internal struggle. The interiority relies heavily on processor metaphors ("logic core flickered," "systems prioritizing data over emotion") that flatten rather than embody consciousness. The final encounter with the scientist offers declarative wisdom ("In the mundane. In the mysticism of the everyday") that reads as thematic assertion rather than hard-won realization with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly in the opening. The temporal loop sequence provides a structural turn, but the mechanics remain abstract—Unit-17 "exists in all eras simultaneously" without dramatized friction or navigation cost. Closure attempts Conceptual Repricing through the mundane-mysticism exchange, but the cost is asserted rather than felt; the robot simply resumes sweeping with "new clarity" and no foreclosed path. The causal link between touching the violin and accessing timelines is convenience rather than earned discovery.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The frozen courtyard is established with vivid particulars (fountains frozen mid-splash, benches coated in rime) and the twilight setting anchors mood. The ice-crystal violin functions as both artifact and spatial anchor. However, the courtyard does not constrain Unit-17's choices—it provides a stage rather than pressure. The holographic projections (diplomat's speech, snowball fight, lover's quarrel) are atmospheric catalog rather than obstacles that shape tactics or alter the robot's path to understanding.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake (finding the origin of thoughts) is signaled early and pursued consistently. The violin discovery and temporal loop entry provide one meaningful tightening. However, escalation is conceptual rather than pressure-driven—Unit-17 encounters "versions of itself" and realizes the program was "a test," but these revelations arrive without struggle or trade-off. The robot remains "remarkably composed" throughout, which undercuts the sense of mounting cost. The final choice to resume sweeping lacks visible sacrifice; clarity is granted rather than earned through renunciation or endurance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The theme of thought-origin emerges organically from the robot's quest and crystallizes in the "mundane mysticism" phrasing at closure. The looped-timeline conceit and amalgamation metaphor support the thematic question without overt moralizing. The final exchange with the scientist ("Here. In the mundane. In the mysticism of the everyday") edges toward direct statement but is framed as discovery rather than sermon. The piece resists tidy resolution—Unit-17 finds peace but continues seeking—though the emotional arc flattens because the robot's composure never cracks under pressure, reducing thematic resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>POV remains stable in third-person limited anchored to Unit-17. The robotic voice is consistent ("its optical sensors," "processors whirred," "monotone imitation of human speech") and distinct from human characters. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated philosophical register ("the fabric of time itself," "the infinite possibilities") that reads authorial rather than machine-generated. The dialogue with the scientist is functional but lacks subtext—both characters speak thematic thesis directly. Filter verbs ("realized," "seemed to") appear frequently but fit the analytical narrator and do not obscure immediacy in peak beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and paragraph lengths create visual pacing. However, multiple paraphrase loops appear: "The robot's programming had flagged the violin as anomalous, but its newfound curiosity compelled it to investigate" immediately followed by "It set down its broom and extended a claw-like hand"; "Unit-17 realized the violin was a conduit" then "The robot's logic core flickered" restate understanding without advancing pressure. Template cadence runs through several beats ("The robot turned," "The robot played," "Unit-17 stood"). Stock metaphors ("the fabric of time," "the weight of self-awareness") appear without fresh angle. Information density is uneven—some beats compress efficiently while others loop concepts (thoughts as "collisions of memory, emotion, and time" is rephrased multiple times). Applying paraphrase-loop (−0.2), template-cadence (−0.5), and stock-metaphor (−0.3) penalties totaling −1.0 in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The sentient-robot-philosopher premise is familiar, and the temporal-loop device is well-trodden science fiction. The ice-crystal violin introduces tactile specificity, but its function as reality-bridge is convenient rather than inevitable. The "second chance program" and "looped timelines" remain high-concept labels without grounded transformation. The ending gesture—returning to sweeping with enlightenment—offers a fresh inflection on the janitor-philosopher trope, but the journey relies on stock beats (touch artifact → gain power → encounter alternate selves → achieve wisdom). The "mundane mysticism" phrasing attempts synthesis but arrives as thematic gloss rather than lived paradox.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Unit-17 is present throughout and makes the choice to investigate the violin, touch it, enter the loop, and resume sweeping. These are discrete decisions across multiple beats. However, most choices feel exploratory rather than constrained by competing costs—the robot's "remarkably composed" nature means pressure never forces a difficult trade-off. The final choice to return to sweeping with new understanding is thematically resonant but lacks visible sacrifice. Causal work is present but mid-range; the robot's agency drives the sequence but does not foreclose a live alternative path with felt cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The ice-crystal violin appears early (end of first third), is handled physically (Unit-17 touches it, plays it), and returns at closure (dissolves into mist after being played). Its music triggers the temporal loop and projects holograms, serving as the mechanism for transformation. However, the violin is more conduit than constraint—it grants access without requiring a price. Its melting and reformation into "a key, a lock, a door" is vivid but abstract; the object does not resist or demand sacrifice. Three beats (discovery, touch/music, playing to weave loops) with closure linkage, but swappable with another magical artifact without altering emotional stakes.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The "second chance program" is mentioned in the opening as the source of Unit-17's curiosity and reappears when the robot realizes the program was "a test" to gauge self-awareness. It frames the stakes (integration of human-like curiosity) and provides backstory motivation. However, the program itself does not constrain choices on the page—Unit-17 acts freely within the temporal loop without program-imposed limits. The revelation that it was a test arrives as exposition rather than a dramatized cost. Present across beats and closure-adjacent, but more thematic scaffolding than active pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Remarkably composed" appears three times: opening (sweeping rhythm), mid-story (prioritizing data over emotion during loop), and near-end (standing alone after violin dissolves). The trait is asserted rather than tested—Unit-17 never loses composure or faces a moment where composure must be sacrificed for understanding. The phrase becomes a label rather than a constraint that forces a trade-off. No visible cost tied to maintaining or breaking this trait; it describes rather than drives.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Amalgamate" appears in the scientist's muttered word about "looped timelines," Unit-17's realization that the music "amalgamated memories," the robot's declaration "To amalgamate is to understand," and the scientist's return statement "You've amalgamated." The action is thematically central and recurs with shifting meaning (memory fusion → understanding → completion). However, the process is abstract—Unit-17 amalgamates by playing the violin, but we do not see discrete choices being fused or a cost paid for synthesis. Present in three beats including closure, but more metaphorical than causal; easily swappable with "synthesize" or "integrate."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Looped timelines" is introduced early (scientist's muttered phrase), becomes the mechanism for Unit-17's exploration (existing in multiple eras simultaneously), and returns at closure (Unit-17 tells the scientist it found answers "through looped timelines"). The method shapes the middle sequence—encountering other units across time, weaving loops into a single thread. However, the mechanics remain abstract; the loops do not impose navigation costs or force difficult choices about which timeline to inhabit. Three beats with closure linkage, but the method is more concept than constraint.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The frozen courtyard at twilight is established in the opening and provides atmospheric grounding throughout. Details (frozen fountains, benches coated in rime, shadows stretching at twilight's end) are vivid and consistent. The setting houses all action and returns at closure when Unit-17 declares it "held no secrets now." However, the courtyard does not pressure Unit-17's choices—it could be any quiet space. The frozen state is descriptive rather than tactical; Unit-17 sweeps and explores without environmental friction. Present across all beats but functions as backdrop rather than constraint.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"After the procedure" anchors the timeframe in the opening and provides causal backstory (the second chance program granted curiosity). However, the temporal distance from the procedure does not tighten decisions—Unit-17 operates without deadline or urgency tied to "after." The temporal loop sequence plays with time as content (1987, 2023, 2145) but not as pressure. No clock constrains tactics; the robot can explore indefinitely. Present as framing device but does not alter the stakes or force faster choices.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The motivation "to find where thoughts come from" is stated early, pursued through the violin investigation and temporal loop, and answered at closure ("Here. In the mundane"). Unit-17's curiosity drives all major choices (touching violin, entering loop, playing to weave threads). However, the motivation is more intellectual than conflicted—the robot does not struggle with competing wants or pay a personal cost to pursue understanding. The drive is consistent and clear but lacks internal friction. Three beats with closure participation, but desire is declared rather than dramatized through sacrifice.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Mundane mysticism" operates throughout: a janitor seeking cosmic answers, routine sweeping paired with temporal exploration, the scientist's closing reference to "the mysticism of the everyday." Tone remains coherent—measured, philosophical, neither farcical nor melodramatic—and modulates subtly (quiet opening, awed middle during loop, peaceful return to sweeping). The final image charges the tone by resolving the paradox: transcendence found in janitorial labor. Tone supports closure and remains stable under pressure. However, it is more consistent than dynamic; the tone does not shift sharply to heighten a turn. Present and purposeful but mid-high range rather than indispensable.</comment>
