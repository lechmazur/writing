<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias shows coherent motivation (painting beauty in imperfection post-phoenix), but his "innocently cunning" acceptance of Marla's trade reads label-only; no on-page cunning micro-choice appears. Marla remains static—her backstory revelation doesn't emerge from contradictory impulses, just exposition. The moth and plant awakening feel decorative rather than embodied struggle; Elias's climactic "I've just started to see" lands flat because prior interiority was abstract ("hauntingly empty," "obsession") rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. Internal conflict is told, not dramatized through micro-choices under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors within opening lines (courtyard, Elias, post-phoenix timeframe). Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—motifs (cobalt dust, plants, fractals) layer toward a final image. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration via "I've just started to see" + painting phoenix-from-glass-bird, but cost is asserted ("his canvases would never be the same") rather than legible in the final image; no visible forfeiture or tactic shift. The cobalt-dust reveal and mural vision provide one meaningful deepening, but Marla's backstory arrives as convenience exposition rather than motivated ellipsis. Cost proof test fails: the ending declares transformation without showing what Elias sacrificed or lost on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Courtyard setting supplies glass orbs, kiln, clay pots—vivid anchor. Plants shudder and sway under the reed tongue's keys, constraining the plant-arrangement method and charging the climax (tourists gather, sky painted). However, spatial choreography drifts: Elias arranges plants "that night," then Marla sees it (when?), then "the sun set"—temporal/spatial continuity blurs. The moth's iridescent wings and cobalt dust are specific, but the courtyard itself doesn't constrain Elias's final painting choice; he could execute the phoenix anywhere. Micro-setting (body/tool) test: the reed tongue's warmth and keys guide action, lifting the score slightly, but the courtyard qua location remains postcard description.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: prove he's "not as dull as his paintings" via the plant arrangement, then find color/meaning through cobalt dust. One tightening: mural erupts in fractals revealing Marla's phoenix-shard backstory. Agency at closure: Elias chooses to keep painting, but the decision costs nothing visible—he gains dust, gains vision, gains approval. Coincidence resolves: the moth whispers "Awaken," cobalt dust conveniently unlocks color, tourists appear to validate. No trade-off or foreclosed path; the ending awards satisfaction without sacrifice. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens until the climax, then diffuses into declarative summary ("His canvases would never be the same").</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Theme—beauty in imperfection, cracks as fuel—emerges through glass-bird shards and the phoenix premise. "Beauty isn't in perfection... It's in the cracks" is direct thematic statement but somewhat earned by prior action (shattered bird, withered rose, fractals). Final image (phoenix from glass-bird/ivy/thorns) attempts non-literal answer, yet the moth's on-the-nose "You've awakened" / "I've just started to see" exchange functions as Thematic Echo, restating the premise in prompt-like language. Subtext operates in Marla's trades and the plants' rustling "language," but the ending over-articulates rather than trusting image alone. Resonance is present but diluted by summary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited on Elias holds throughout; no head-hopping. Voice carries distinct textures ("molten-glass orbs," "cricket's legs," "shattering glass" laugh), and diction mostly fits an artist's perceptual filter. Dialogue advances plot (Marla's trades, moth's whisper) and differentiates speakers—Marla's pragmatic barter vs. Elias's hesitant questions. However, the moth's choral "Awaken" and Elias's closing line veer into allegorical register rather than character-specific idiom. Filter verbs are sparse. Psychic distance remains stable. Minor slip: "the world refused to show him" reads slightly elevated for in-scene thought. Perceptual signature is artist-focused but not deeply idiosyncratic under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear and rhythmically varied. Overwriting flares in the opening ("sunlight fractured through molten-glass orbs") and climax ("mural's colors bled into the air, painting the sky")—metaphor density without pattern-taught payoff. Minor paraphrase loop: "canvases were always abstract—swirls of gray and beige" then "hauntingly empty" restates the same idea. Template cadence in middle beats: "He'd long suspected... the reed tongue hummed... the plants shuddered... the ivy curled... the rose's petals unfurled"—five consecutive subject-verb frames. Stock metaphor: "shattered glass" laugh, "like starlight." Scaffold: "After the phoenix, the land's full of secrets" is tell-summary. Artifacts do not obscure causality but dull momentum in high-pressure beats; deduct −0.6 in Q7 for spread, final-third proximity, and template cadence run.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Phoenix-aftermath premise and magical-realism trades are familiar genre territory. Colorblind painter regaining "sight" through magic dust is a well-worn metaphor. The cobalt-dust → fractals → backstory-vision sequence feels engineered rather than inevitable. Fresh inflections: communicating-through-plant-arrangements and the glass-bird-as-phoenix-fuel have specificity, but both arrive late and don't transform the emotional arc—swap "dust" for "potion" or "plants" for "sculptures" and the arc holds. Proximity check: "you see the world sideways" echoes common craft wisdom. Emotional truth (artist seeking validation) is authentic but executed through convenient magic rather than grounded struggle. Transformation test fails: plot works unchanged with different objects and names.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Colorblind painter: present throughout, frames opening and closure. Colorblindness motivates his search but doesn't constrain tactics—cobalt dust bypasses the disability rather than forcing him to work within it. One choice-driven beat: he accepts Marla's trade and arranges plants, but the decision isn't pressured by his colorblindness; any artist could do the same. Closure participation: he paints the phoenix, but the colorblindness itself is resolved (he now sees hues) rather than integrated. Early signal +0.6, beat involvement (trade, arrangement, painting) +0.9, but swappability (any artist seeking validation) −0.7, ornamental disability (cured by magic) −0.5. Two gates (setup, payoff) cap ~6.0; lacks middle development where colorblindness alters a tactic under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Concertina reed tongue: introduced early (Marla tosses it), used in two beats (keys click, Elias presses to make plants shudder and courtyard sing). Specificity: brass keys, cricket-leg clicks, warmth. Causal role: it enables the plant-communication and courtyard symphony that draw tourists. However, it's swappable—any magical instrument would serve; the concertina-ness (bellows, air, squeeze) is never invoked. Closure linkage: he trades it back for dust before the final painting, so it's absent from the ending image. Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, causal pressure (enables arrangement magic) +0.8, but swappability −0.6, absent from closure −0.7. Three gates present but specificity is thin; properties don't uniquely constrain.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Bartered awakenings: stated as Marla's fame ("bartered awakenings were infamous—glass heart for drowning tale") but not shaped as the dominant stake. The story's conflict is Elias proving himself via the arrangement, not negotiating a barter structure. "Awaken" appears as the moth's word and Elias's reply, thematic echo rather than tactical mechanic. The barter itself (reed tongue for arrangement) is transactional setup, not a system that changes options under pressure. Late thematic claim: the concept is named early but only returns as label at closure. Ornamental use −0.8, swappability (any trade/exchange framing) −0.6, summary-only −0.4. Setup gate present, development and payoff missing; cap 4.6, lower for lack of causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Innocently cunning: label-only. "Innocently cunning, Elias accepted" is the sole reference; no on-page action demonstrates cunning (foreseeing Marla's deeper magic, exploiting asymmetry, concealing intent). His acceptance is straightforward artist curiosity, not a calculated move with visible tradeoff. The trait could be deleted without altering any beat. Absent embodiment, no cost connection. Present in setup but purely ornamental; swappability total. Cap 2.8 (missing development and closure), apply ornamental −0.5 and label-only −0.3 within band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Awaken: the moth commands "Awaken," Elias replies "You've awakened" / "I've just started to see," plants and tourists "awaken" to the spectacle. The verb threads through closure and charges the final exchange. However, it's metaphorical label rather than physical or causal act—what specifically awakens on the page is abstract (perception, appreciation). If swapped to "transform" or "illuminate," the story holds. Early signal (phoenix "awaken" implied in backstory), middle beat (plants respond), closure (dialogue). Three gates, closure linkage +1.2, beat involvement (two uses) +0.9, but swappability −0.7 (any transformation verb), summary-only interiority (told he's awakened) −0.5. Strong thematic presence, mid-range causal necessity.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Communicating through plant arrangements: Elias arranges ferns/ivy/rose, presses reed-tongue keys, plants shudder/spiral/unfurl, moth emerges. This is the story's mechanical hinge (the method Marla requested and Elias executes). Appears in setup (trade premise), development (arrangement + key-press), and payoff (courtyard symphony). Specificity: leaf positioning for dawn light, ivy spiral, moth reveal. However, the "communication" itself is vague—what message do the plants send? The tourists see light/color, not legible content. Causal pressure: method enables the spectacle that validates Elias. Early +0.7, two beats +0.9, causal +1.0, closure linkage (symphony) +0.8, but vague mechanics (what is communicated?) −0.6, swappability (any magical art-form) −0.5. Three gates; solid integration, lacks irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Glassblower's courtyard: present throughout, supplies props (glass orbs, kiln, pots, stone walls). The courtyard's glass orbs sing during the climax, grounding the spectacle. Setting enables the action (Elias paints there, tourists gather there) and the glass/fire motif coheres with the phoenix backstory. However, spatial pressure is thin—Elias could execute the plant arrangement and painting elsewhere. Micro-setting test: the orbs and pots matter, lifting the score. Early anchor +0.7, beat involvement (orbs sing, walls line pots) +0.5, closure linkage (orbs overhead harmonize) +0.8, but swappability (any artisan's workspace) −0.6, postcard description (no tactic constrained by layout) −0.4. Three gates, decent specificity, mid-causal necessity.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>After the phoenix rises: establishes backstory (three summers prior) and world state (land reshaped, Elias lost color). The timeframe is static anchor, not live pressure—no ticking clock, no approaching second phoenix. "After" functions as setting context rather than tactic constraint. The phoenix's past fire matters thematically (Marla fed it glass shards) and causally (Elias's colorblindness origin), but the "after" itself doesn't tighten decisions. Early signal +0.6, backstory causality (Elias's condition) +0.4, thematic closure link (phoenix painting) +0.5, but no live time pressure −0.8, swappable with any past-catastrophe frame −0.6. Setup and payoff gates present, development missing; cap ~6.0, lower for lack of tactical urgency.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>To find beauty in imperfection: named early ("gained an obsession: to find beauty in imperfection"), drives the plant-arrangement attempt (withered rose included), and lands in the closure painting (phoenix from shattered bird + thorns). Dramatized through Elias's choices (accepting trade, mixing dust, painting) but told more often than shown in friction. No visible cost tied specifically to this motive—he succeeds without sacrifice. Marla's dialogue restates it ("beauty isn't in perfection..."), reducing subtext. Early +0.7, two beats (arrangement, final painting) +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, but told-only interiority (abstract "obsession") −0.7, lacks friction between want and cost −0.5. Three gates, thematic integration solid, causal pressure moderate.</comment>
