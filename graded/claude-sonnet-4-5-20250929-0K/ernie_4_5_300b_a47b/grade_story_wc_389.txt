<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Kael's motivation—communion with ancient frequencies—remains consistent, but his interior life is largely label-driven ("lonely visionary," "relic and catalyst") rather than embodied through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The prophetic gift feels asserted more than dramatized; we're told he unravels riddles but never see him struggle against a misinterpretation or pay a visible cost for this ability. The final moment ("You are the prism. You are the storm.") reads as declarative epiphany without prior friction between want and fear, and no path is foreclosed with on-page consequence—he achieves alignment without visible trade-off.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Drive lens inferred: Accumulative/Textural, with pressure building through radio transmissions and storm imagery. Orientation is adequate (Kael, observatory, storm) but the closure—sand swirling, storm ebbing, glass glowing—reads as affirmation rather than decisive change or resonant reconfiguration with felt cost; no option is narrowed, no renunciation occurs, and the "new dawn" remains abstract promise. The piece teaches a lyric pattern but the ending delivers symbolic convergence without on-page consequence that reweights prior material. Cost proof test fails: no sentence shows what Kael has forfeited or what path he has foreclosed by activating the mechanism.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The cobalt glass portico and storm-lit altitude anchor the piece vividly and constrain Kael's isolation motive. The portico functions as both window and threshold, and the activation of mirrors/lenses uses the setting's architecture to charge the climax. However, the hourglass and radio rig remain postcard details without tactile interaction that alters a tactic; Kael places a palm on glass but does not navigate or negotiate spatial pressure in a way that changes his choices.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—understanding and harnessing the storm's frequencies—is signaled early. Pressure accumulates through transmissions but never tightens into a forced choice or trade-off; Kael activates the mechanism without obstacle, cost, or complication. The text claims allegiance and balance but no on-page reversal tests his commitment, and the resolution (sand swirls, storm ebbs) arrives as convergence rather than earned deepening. The Accumulative lens tolerates gentler escalation, but even under that standard, no moment narrows options or reweights cost—the prophetic voice affirms rather than challenges.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Theme—embracing fragility, storm as blueprint—emerges from imagery and Kael's stance, avoiding overt moralizing until the final beat. "You are the prism. You are the storm" hovers near thematic echo but is embedded in radio transmission rather than naked narrator declaration, preserving some indirection. The hourglass and variant allegiance remain abstract; the ending offers atmospheric validation rather than a non-literal answer that reweights prior material with undeniable pressure. Recurrence of the portico and frequencies builds pattern but does not constrain a choice or complicate the thematic question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Single POV, clean focalization, and distance remain stable. Diction carries a consistent elevated register ("jagged fingers," "circuit board gone feral," "origami in his mind") that suits the lonely-visionary archetype but occasionally tips toward purple density without voice-motivated purpose. The prophetic voice layering ("his own, layered with the prophets'") is an interesting device but not sustained or paid off in later beats. No dialogue on the page to test voice distinction. Perceptual signature is present (storm as language, frequencies as blueprints) but syntactic patterns repeat ("The radio crackled," "He scribbled," "He rose") without modulation under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout ("clawed," "drowned skies," "circuit board gone feral," "wounded beast," "symphony of thunder") with several metaphors stacked in single sentences, creating overwriting in peak beats without pattern-teaching or payoff (−0.5). Register occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("variant allegiance," "lyrically prophetic") that clashes with grounded action (−0.3). Paraphrase loops appear: "ancient shadows" recurs across paragraphs without added pressure; "frequencies" and "radio" cycle through synonym variants (crackled, transmission, static) in adjacent beats (−0.4). "Across the rise of a prophet" appears twice, verbatim, as a structural marker without clear function, reading as scaffold (−0.2). Accumulation cap applied: −1.4 total in Q7 only.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The prophetic-radio-frequency frame is familiar (lone genius decoding cosmic messages) and the arc—from isolation to affirmation—follows a recognizable template without transformation through specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The cobalt glass prism and hourglass of volcanic sand offer vivid particulars, but the emotional logic (storm as ally, not threat) is declared rather than earned through a risky choice. "Variant allegiance" and "ancient shadows" remain abstract gestures. The piece commits to its lyric mode but does not risk complication or ambiguity that would elevate the synthesis.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Kael is present throughout and his goal (decode frequencies, harness storm) frames the narrative. He makes one on-page decision—activating the mirror mechanism—but this occurs late (final third) and meets no resistance or cost, trending replaceable. His loneliness and visionary stance are asserted labels without a choice that tests or complicates them. Setup present; development weak (no middle choice constrained by his isolation); payoff present but passive (affirmation, not turn). Two-of-three gates met; causal pressure minimal; swappability moderate. Band guidance: functional but replaceable, trending mid-5s with small lift for closure presence.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The cobalt glass portico is established early (setup), returns in the climax when Kael places his palm and activates the prism mechanism (development and payoff), and charges the final image ("threshold"). Three gates met; two distinct beats (framing storm, refracting light); closure linkage strong (+1.5). However, its properties (cobalt hue, glass vibrations) are described more than used to constrain a choice or impose cost; Kael's touch is gestural rather than tactical. Specificity moderate (+0.5); causal pressure present but not decisive (+0.8). Total adjustments +2.8 from base 3.0 anchor → 5.8, round down to 5.8. Re-checking: closure participation is strong (prism/threshold transformation), beat involvement spans two, early signal clear. Eligible for mid-6s; final 6.1.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Variant allegiance" appears twice—once as thematic claim (storm-earth-void) and once as internal realization ("between order and chaos")—but does not shape an on-page stake or tactic. Kael's actual conflict is decoding frequencies and achieving communion; allegiance remains atmospheric metaphor. Setup absent; development absent; payoff ornamental (mentioned in reflection, not decision). Late appearance (second half); label-only use (−0.6); swappability high (could replace with "balance" or "duality" without structural change, −0.6). Base 3.0 − 1.2 → 1.8; add small thematic echo +0.3 → 2.1. Re-checking band: present but ornamental, trends low 3s; round 3.2 to reflect slight thematic integration without action.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>"Lyrically prophetic" appears as descriptor (radio voices, Kael's gift) but does not constrain or enable an on-page action with visible cost. The trait is asserted ("his gift was to unravel") but never tested—no moment where lyric ambiguity forces a wrong turn or prophetic certainty exacts a price. Setup present (established early); development absent (no middle choice enabled or blocked); payoff label-only (final voice layering mentioned, not dramatized). Swappability high (−0.6); ornamental use (−0.5); no cost connection (−0.3). Base 3.0 − 1.4 → 1.6; small lift for setup +0.3 → 1.9. Band: functional but replaceable, low 4s at best; final 3.9 reflects lack of dramatized constraint.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Unfold" appears as key verb (origami metaphor, prophets' truths unfold, act of unfolding as allegiance) and the climax involves unfolding light into prism patterns. Setup strong (early metaphor); development present (middle reflection ties unfolding to Kael's method); payoff present (prismatic shattering, sand swirling as physical unfolding). Three gates met; two beats (+0.9); causal pressure moderate (the unfolding image drives the climax action, +1.0); closure linkage strong (+1.2). However, swappability is moderate—"reveal" or "decode" could substitute with minor edits (−0.5). Base 3.0 + 2.6 → 5.6, round to 5.6. Re-checking: specificity is good (origami, prism), irreplaceability moderate; final 5.7 reflects solid integration without indispensability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Fragmented radio frequencies are Kael's primary tool, present in opening and throughout. Setup strong (first paragraph); development strong (multiple transmissions shape his understanding); payoff present (final clear note, voice layering). Three gates met; three beats (+1.4); causal pressure strong (messages guide his actions and final activation, +1.3); closure linkage clear (+1.0). However, the mechanics remain vague—tuning dials, static resolving—without specific constraint or cost tied to fragmentation (why fragmented matters is told, not shown, −0.4). Base 3.0 + 3.3 → 6.3; small swappability friction (could be "ancient texts" or "dreams" with adjustments, −0.3) → 6.0. Re-checking irreplaceability: the radio is specific, but fragmentation as method is underused; final 5.3 after reconsidering mechanics opacity.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The stormlit observatory above clouds is established in opening, provides isolation motive, and houses the prism mechanism that delivers the climax. Setup strong; development strong (altitude chosen for clarity, storm frames pressure); payoff strong (storm ebbs as Kael acts, threshold image). Three gates met; three beats (+1.4); causal pressure clear (isolation enables focus, architecture enables prism, +1.2); closure linkage strong (+1.3); specificity high (cobalt portico, altitude, observatory heart with antiquities, +0.7). Base 3.0 + 4.6 → 7.6. Small swappability friction (mountaintop tower could substitute, −0.3); small cost connection gap (setting supplies resources but does not impose visible price, −0.2) → 7.1. Re-checking: environment constrains (isolation) and enables (prism); final 6.9 reflects strong integration with minor swappability.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Across the rise of a prophet" appears twice as a structural phrase but does not function as timeframe that tightens decisions. The narrative unfolds in one storm-night without clock pressure or tracked duration; "years ago" backstory is mentioned but does not create urgency. Setup absent (time not signaled as constraint); development absent (no ticking clock alters tactics); payoff absent (closure is atmospheric convergence, not time-driven). Late appearance (phrase used mid-story as metaphor, not timeframe anchor); ornamental use (−0.7); swappability extreme (could remove with no structural loss, −0.8). Base 3.0 − 1.5 → 1.5; add small thematic nod +0.3 → 1.8. Re-checking: the phrase is poetic marker, not functional timeframe; score 2.6 reflects minimal integration as metaphor without tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Kael's motivation—"to shape a new dawn using ancient shadows"—is stated explicitly in paragraph two and drives his radio communion and prism activation. Setup strong; development present (his belief in humanity's salvation guides his choices); payoff present (final note, new dawn roaring). Three gates met; two beats (+0.9); causal pressure moderate (desire propels action but is not conflicted or tested, +0.8); closure linkage clear (+0.9). However, the motivation is told more than dramatized—no moment where shaping the dawn costs him a present comfort or forces a trade-off (−0.6). Base 3.0 + 2.0 → 5.0; small lift for explicit closure tie +0.4 → 5.4. Friction between wants and costs absent; band guidance: shapes key turn but lacks visible price.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Gritty whimsy" is signaled through juxtaposition (rust and gleam, storm and laughter, "gritty, whimsical sound") and diction mixes elevated metaphor with tactile detail. Setup present (tone established early); development present (modulates from somber to playful laugh); payoff present (final "roar" and "symphony" blend both). Three gates met; two beats (+0.9); coherence moderate (tone tensions are intentional but "gritty" and "whimsy" do not fully cohere—whimsy is asserted via one laugh rather than sustained idiom, −0.5). Closure linkage moderate (+0.6); no causal pressure or cost tied to tone itself (−0.3). Base 3.0 + 0.7 → 3.7; add setup signal +0.5 → 4.2. Re-checking: tone present but static mood rather than modulating charge; round 4.7 reflects functional presence without dynamic integration.</comment>
