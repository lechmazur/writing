<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lirael's mercury-glass nature remains largely ornamental; her pain around memories is asserted more than embodied through contradictory impulses. The climactic moment—feather to stone, transformation—lacks visible internal conflict; she "welcomes" pain without prior resistance shown on the page. Secondary characters (Orin, the mother's voice) apply no immediate relational pressure. Micro-choices exist (climbing to the attic, pressing the feather) but the stakes feel declarative rather than tested through friction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: images and motifs (stone, feather, mercury skin) accrue until the cavern sequence. Orientation anchors (bookstore, Lirael, stone) arrive quickly. The closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration—Lirael integrates the stone's shards, declares home is "the act of remembering"—but the cost is abstract; obsidian flecks and a glow are asserted consequences without foreclosing a legible path or tactical shift. The final paragraph's thematic summary ("to seed the world with truth") tells rather than charges the image, weakening the RR.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The labyrinthine bookstore and mountain setting are vivid in opening description but function as backdrop; the stone and feather are handled, yet spatial choreography in the cavern (rocks freeze midair, shatter embedding in skin) remains gestural rather than grounded. The cedar box and attic supply texture but do not constrain a middle choice. Micro-setting (body, feather) charges the climax modestly, lifting the score slightly, but the environment does not alter tactics on the page.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—understanding "the shape of home"—is signaled early. One tightening occurs: Lirael moves from avoidance to pressing the feather, which triggers the vision and shattering. Agency is present but passive; the stone acts upon her more than she wrestles with it. The cost (pain, embedding shards) is asserted rather than shown to foreclose an option or force a trade-off. Escalation under the Accumulative lens is minimal; the sequence intensifies atmospherically without a second beat that narrows her choices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Theme—home as memory and the weight of others' truths—emerges from the stone and feather motifs. The final statement "It's in the act of remembering" is direct thematic summary rather than image-based resonance. Subtext operates in the mother's recorded voice and Lirael's hesitation, but the climax resolves into abstraction ("seed the world with truth") without a non-literal answer rooted in particulars. The piece invites reflection but the ending moralizes rather than reweights.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV holds stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature (mercury skin reflecting, glass fingers leaving no trace) is consistent and character-specific. Dialogue is minimal (Orin's two lines, the mother's voice) but functional. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("bioluminescent fungi," "constellations") that feels observational rather than urgent. The prose modulates with intensity (cavern sequence quickens slightly) but remains at a steady lyric distance throughout, neither rising nor faltering under peak pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies; sentence openings shift. Information density is moderate—many lines describe rather than advance dual functions. Minor loops: "the lost language stone" recurs as a label without fresh detail; "her mercury skin" is repeated identically. Figurative language clusters without always clarifying ("edges blurring into liquid," "stardust," "edges softening into feathers") but remains legible. No major scaffold or template cadence. The final paragraph summarizes rather than propelling, costing momentum at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The mercury-glass seer and lost language stone offer surface novelty, but the emotional arc (seeking home via inherited object, epiphany about memory) follows a familiar template. The feather-as-key and "texture" mechanism arrive late without prior grounding, reading as convenient rather than inevitable. The cavern transformation and floating rocks gesture toward high fantasy without grounding the magic's cost in prior scenes. Specificity in bookstore titles and the mother's linguist background add texture but do not transform the core premise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Present throughout; drives the attic climb and feather-press action. Decisions exist but feel reactive to the stone's agency rather than protagonist-driven turns. No middle development beat where her seer nature constrains a choice; the mercury skin is mostly descriptive until the cavern, where it "flares" and "reflects" without altering her tactics. Closure participation: she bears shards and declares insight, but the seer trait itself does not causally shape that outcome.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Setup: introduced paragraph one. Development: Lirael avoids it, then uses it with the feather (two beats). Closure: shatters and embeds in her skin, reweighting her identity. The stone drives causality and appears in the final image (obsidian flecks). Swappability is low—its shifting symbols and memory-unlocking function are specific. Cost is present but abstract (pain, embedding). Strong integration across all three gates with causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Setup: mentioned obliquely ("buried talents") in paragraph one via Orin's claim. Development: Lirael "felt her buried talents stir—the ability to weave memories into reality" in the cavern, but this is summary rather than a demonstrated choice under pressure. Closure: she states she will "bear the weight of others' memories," thematically echoing the concept. The concept shapes theme more than it alters on-page tactics or options; label-only use lowers the score.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Setup: "her mercury skin substituted reality, unraveling her dreams into visions" (paragraph two). Middle: no on-page scene where this nightly substitution constrains or enables a choice during the present action. Closure: not invoked; the cavern sequence involves transformation, not nightly dreaming. The attribute is told as backstory context but does not create visible cost or tactical friction in the present window. Ornamental use trends low.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Setup: obliquely prepared by Orin's advice "seed it with intention" (paragraph three). Action occurs at midpoint: Lirael presses the feather to the stone, triggering the vision and shattering. This drives the climax. Swappability: "touch" or "speak to" could replace "seed" with minor edits; the verb itself is not irreplaceable. Closure: the seeding is complete, but the final image (obsidian flecks, mountain glow) does not hinge on the act's unique properties. One strong beat, moderate specificity.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Setup: feather introduced paragraph three (cedar box, belonged to mother). Method signaled: Orin's cryptic "via the texture of a feather." Development: Lirael uses the feather once (paragraph four) to activate the stone. Closure: "The feather's texture lingered, a reminder" and the final line reprises "via the texture of a feather." The texture itself is never made tactile or mechanically distinct; it could be any keyed object. Late method signal, minimal causal differentiation, lyric reprise lifts slightly but swappability caps the score.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Setup: vivid opening description, labyrinthine shelves, mountain scope. Development: Lirael climbs the spiral staircase to the attic—a spatial move, but the bookstore's layout does not constrain her choice or supply a resource that alters tactics. Closure: "The labyrinthine bookstore reappeared, its shelves intact"; present but static. The setting frames atmosphere without pressuring decisions. Micro-setting (cedar box, attic) is functional but not indispensable. One gate (setup) strong; others weak.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Setup: title phrase "after remembering becomes painful" anchors the timeframe in paragraph two. Development: the pain "gnawed deeper" tonight, motivating the attic climb—one choice tied to the temporal frame. Closure: not invoked; the ending does not reference the pain threshold or time pressure. The timeframe sets context but does not create a ticking clock or shape tactics beyond the initial motivation. Functional but replaceable with "after years of avoiding."</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Setup: "She needed to understand the shape of home" (paragraph two). Development: drives the attic climb and feather use; the mother's vision directly addresses it ("Home isn't a place, but the shape of what you carry"). Closure: "I see the shape of home now. It's not here, or there. It's in the act of remembering." The motivation is dramatized across two beats and resolved thematically. Friction exists (pain vs. desire) but remains abstract rather than forcing a visible trade-off. Strong thematic integration, moderate causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Setup: "a low hum filled the air, like hidden thunder" (paragraph four) introduces the tone phrase. Development: tone modulates from reflective (opening) to atmospheric dread (cavern shaking, pain lancing) to declarative calm (final exchange). The phrase itself is invoked once and does not return. Coherence holds across turns, but the tone does not charge the final image with undeniable pressure—the ending softens into summary. Functional modulation without closure linkage; mid-band.</comment>
