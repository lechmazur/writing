<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Clara's contradiction—probability professor's daughter turned compulsive gambler—is established but functions more as backstory label than live tension. Her choice to follow the scrawl clues and board the subway car shows agency, but the emotional arc from grief to "visit her father" feels unearned; the closure pivot lacks the compounding internal friction needed to make renunciation or endurance credible. Embodied emotion is present (heart racing, throat tightening) but interiority often defaults to abstract musings about contradictions rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The father's absence drives motivation but the final tear-mixing moment reads as sentiment assertion rather than choice with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads Hybrid-Accumulative: chalk outline → staircase → subway car → metaphysical journey → return. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration ("Contradictions aren't traps. They're mirrors") but the cost is unclear—Clara ends where she began emotionally, now planning to visit her father, a decision that feels like delayed action rather than a reweighting with on-page consequence. The subway-car journey and instant return to the library collapse causality; no dramatized choice narrows options or forecloses a path. Orientation anchors within ~120 words (library, Clara, midsummer) so no penalty applied there, but the metaphysical transit lacks legible stakes or price paid.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The rainwashed library, mica-pane lantern, and subway-tile corridor create vivid atmosphere and the lantern's warping light subtly mirrors the story's theme of bent perception. Spatial choreography is mostly clear (stacks, movable shelf, staircase, corridor, car) though the subway car's physical impossibility (sitting on tracks inside a library basement) is never anchored as magical realism or explained, creating a brief credibility gap. The lantern constrains Clara's movement through darkness and charges multiple beats (tracing rim, beam drifting, flame dancing, steady at return), pushing this into the 7+ range despite the setting's occasional vagueness about rules.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—Clara seeking meaning in chaos after her father's death—is signaled early but never meaningfully tightened. The subway-car "journey" offers no visible obstacle, sacrifice, or trade-off; she simply rides, chooses left at a fork based on memory of her father's lectures, and returns unharmed. Coincidence (the car lurching, Ms. Greer vanishing, the instant return) drives all movement rather than Clara's agency under pressure. One micro-turn exists (choosing left over right) but it carries no legible cost and the resolution—"she'd visit her father"—defers action off the page rather than enacting change here.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Theme of contradictions-as-mirrors emerges through image (mica pane warping light, subway scrawls, the chalk outline) and Ms. Greer's closing line crystallizes it, but the thematic statement is delivered rather than earned through Clara's choices. The scrawls and lantern motifs recur but their meaning doesn't deepen—they illustrate rather than test the premise. The final moment—tears mixing with rain, deciding to visit her father—gestures toward integration but the specific cost or insight Clara gains remains abstract; we're told she sees contradictions differently but not shown what she has renounced or accepted to reach that view.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization is stable and Clara's perceptual signature (noticing patterns, tracing outlines, decoding scrawls) is consistent and character-specific. Ms. Greer's dialogue ("The floors… shift") carries subtext and the brief exchange advances plot without exposition dump. Filter verbs ("she'd follow," "she thought") are light and voice-motivated. Diction occasionally slips into elevated abstraction ("theoretical rebellion," "lucid contradictions") that feels slightly above Clara's present emotional register during peak stress, but the internal texture holds and no head-hopping or POV leakage occurs.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and the opening anchors voice cleanly. Minor template cadence appears in the middle third: "She knelt, heart racing. The lantern's heat warmed her palm as she traced…" / "She sat, running a finger over a phrase…" / "She stood, heart pounding, and walked…"—three near-identical subject-verb-gerund constructions within four paragraphs. One paraphrase loop: "The scrawls," Clara breathed. "They're maps." followed immediately by corridor description then "The scrawls had led her here" restates without added pressure. No figurative muddle in peak beats and information density is solid, but the template stems and one loop warrant −0.6 under the Patterned-artifact penalty pack, preventing entry to the 7.5+ range.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The combination of probability-professor lineage, cryptic subway scrawls, and a library housing a metaphysical subway car offers fresh texture, but the core emotional arc—grieving daughter seeks meaning in chaos, finds it via mystical journey, decides to reconnect—follows a familiar template. The scrawls and mica-lantern details are specific and memorable, elevating this above generic, yet the resolution's lack of surprise or earned trade-off limits ingenuity. Risk-taking (the subway car's impossible presence, the metaphysical traverse) is bold but undercut by convenience plotting (no cost, instant return) that retreats from full commitment to the premise's implications.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Clara, probability professor's daughter and compulsive gambler, is introduced early and her grief over her father drives the plot, but her choices (following clues, boarding the car, choosing left) do not create key on-page reversals with visible cost. She observes, reacts, and is told the meaning by Ms. Greer rather than earning insight through sacrifice or renunciation. Two gates met (setup early, present at closure via her decision to visit her father) but middle development is passive—she is led and lectured rather than deciding under competing pressures. Swappable with "grieving scholar's daughter" without major edits.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The candle lantern with mica pane is introduced in the opening beat, handled across multiple moments (rim tracing, beam drifting over spines, casting jagged shadows, flame dancing, steady at return), and its warping light subtly reinforces the theme of bent perception. Three gates met (setup, development as tool in darkness, present at closure with "steady" flame marking return). However, the lantern does not constrain a choice or narrow options; it illuminates but does not force trade-offs. The reprise (steady flame at return) reweights slightly but the cost is not tied to the object itself. Strong beat involvement and specificity but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Lucid contradictions" is named in the opening paragraph and revisited via Ms. Greer's mirror metaphor at closure, but it functions as thematic label rather than shaping stakes or tactics on the page. Clara does not face a choice between contradictory goods or navigate competing rule-sets; instead, she is told that contradictions are mirrors and accepts it. The concept echoes as premise but does not alter options or create friction. Present in setup and closure (two gates) but ornamental—theme claim without dramatized pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"Theoretically rebellious" is mentioned once as the father's phrase and labeled as Clara's trait ("the urge to bet on chaos still hummed in her veins") but never constrains or enables an on-page action with cost. We're told she craves contradictions but do not see her rebelliousness force a trade-off or mistake. The trait exists as backstory characterization rather than live friction. Present in setup but absent from middle development and closure; label-only mention trends low per rubric guidance.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Traverse" occurs at the story's climax when Clara boards the subway car and rides through the tunnel, making it causally central to the plot's lone turn (choosing left at the fork). Two gates met (middle development and closure participation) but the action is facilitated by Ms. Greer and coincidence (car lurches, tracks vanish, instant return) rather than Clara's sacrifice or skill. The traverse itself is passive—she sits, remembers, stands, and the car moves her. Functional but lacks the agency-driven pressure or visible cost needed for higher scores; somewhat swappable with "journey" or "passage" without rewriting stakes.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Interpreting cryptic scrawls on subway seats is introduced in the second paragraph and returns when Clara sits in the subway car reading phrases, using them to choose left at the fork. Two gates met (setup and middle development) and the method shapes one choice, but the mechanics are vague—how do the scrawls function as maps? What system or cost governs interpretation? Clara's choice ("Time bends. Like probability curves.") reads as association rather than a dramatized decoding process with friction. Functional causal role but the means lacks specificity and closure linkage is weak (Ms. Greer explains rather than Clara proving mastery).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The rainwashed library at midsummer is established in the opening line and supplies the stacks, movable shelf, staircase, corridor, and subway car—shaping Clara's physical path and creating atmosphere across multiple beats. Three gates met (setup, development via spatial navigation, closure as return location). The library's "shadow holds a door" clue drives middle action and the setting's layered spaces (surface library, hidden staircase, impossible subway car) constrain movement. However, the setting does not force a resource trade-off or narrow Clara's options at the peak choice; it stages rather than pressures. Strong involvement but not indispensable to the closure's emotional charge.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"After the heart attack last winter" anchors backstory and motivates Clara's grief, but the timeframe does not tighten on-page decisions or create urgency. The story unfolds "tonight" with no live clock; Clara can explore the library, descend the staircase, board the car, and return without time pressure or consequence. Present in setup (first paragraph) but absent from middle escalation and closure. The "after" functions as static context rather than a countdown or constraint that alters tactics. Swappable with any past loss without structural change.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"To widen perspectives responsibly" is stated by Ms. Greer near the midpoint as the purpose of the scrawls/maps, but Clara's desire for this goal is not dramatized in scene. She follows clues out of grief and curiosity, not an articulated wish to widen perspectives. The motivation is told rather than shown through conflicted choices, and no on-page friction tests her commitment—does widening perspectives cost her certainty, safety, or a competing want? Present in dialogue (middle development) and nodded at closure ("She'd widen perspectives, yes") but lacks the choice-driven friction and visible trade-off required for higher integration.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Clover melancholy" is not a standard idiom but the intended tone—bittersweet, layered sorrow—is legible in the opening ("old regrets," "absence felt like a ledger she couldn't balance") and modulates subtly through curiosity (following clues), awe (the corridor, the car), and resolution (tears mixing with rain). Tone is coherent across beats and charges the final image with quiet grief and tentative hope. However, one gate is weak—setup is present but "clover" as modifier is never anchored through image or diction on the page, making the specific tone label feel imposed rather than earned through prose texture. Functional atmospheric control but not indispensable or unmistakably specific to "clover melancholy."</comment>
