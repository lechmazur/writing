<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elinor's motivation to decode falling leaves is clear and her choice to build monuments is on the page, but her interior life remains thin—we see precision and dedication without genuine contradiction or embodied struggle. The final sequence (gather silverseed, warn others, seek Lirael) reads as a to-do list rather than a foreclosing choice with visible cost. Emotional states are largely asserted ("mossy delight") rather than embodied through perception and action under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece anchors who/where/when within the opening and teaches an Accumulative/Textural lens: the moonstone dust triggers discovery, the monuments gather light, leaves reveal their message. However, the closure dissolves into a three-item action plan rather than a single decisive image or reconfiguration; the cost of decoding (what Elinor forfeits or risks by acting) remains abstract. The dust "dissolving into air" gestures toward Resonant Reconfiguration but lacks felt weight.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The ashen skyborne arbor is vivid and specific—branches through clouds, mossy floor, light filtered to green haze—and the edge where "branches thinned into mist" provides spatial constraint for the monument-building beat. The worktable and seed sacks anchor early moves, and the arbor "trembles" in response to Elinor's action, charging the atmosphere. The micro-setting (moonstone speck on bark, twig for building) shapes one key turn, meeting the band requirement.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—decode the message in falling leaves—is signaled early and the moonstone dust prod tightens the problem by enabling legibility. However, escalation is mild: the discovery unfolds smoothly without false starts, trade-offs, or visible prices paid in the moment. The final "I know what I must do" declaration lists consequences (storm, silverseed, Lirael) but does not dramatize a choice that narrows options or forecloses a path with on-page cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme—folklore as lived language, the bridge between past and prophecy—emerges through the moonstone dust's transformation and the monument-building practice. The arbor "leaning closer, as if listening" and the dust "emerging transformed always" offer layered imagery. Yet the ending resolves into summary ("the world, for now, made sense") rather than a resonant, non-literal answer; the plea to "seek out Lirael" opens a question the text does not reweight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV is stable, and diction ("chisel-marked stone," "mossy delight") carries specificity. Phrases like "bordered on reverence" and "hush where past met prophecy" elevate register but remain voice-motivated. However, several lines ("motivation sharpened," "her mossy delight growing") tell emotional state rather than anchor it in perception or micro-choice. No dialogue is present to judge.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The prose is clear and rhythmically varied, but several passages loop or paraphrase: "shifted and faded before they could be read" is restated in the monument paragraph as achieving "markings now clear and steady" without showing intermediate failure. "Emerged transformed always" appears three times, twice as folklore summary and once as closure claim, creating thematic echo rather than earned pattern. Filter-verb density is moderate ("she believed," "she knew") but does not stack in peak beats. Figurative language ("branches twisted like ancient veins," "light weaving through the monuments like a thread") adds texture without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The ashen skyborne arbor and seed-sorter protagonist offer fresh texture, and "building tiny monuments to forgotten things" as method is specific. However, the core arc—magical object enables decoding of cryptic messages—is template-familiar, and the resolution into a three-part quest (harvest, warn, seek) does not transform the premise. The moonstone dust's role as "bridge between worlds" echoes stock folklore without a surprising inflection.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elinor's choice to nudge the speck and build monuments drives the middle beat and enables the leaf-decoding turn. Her final decision to act on the revealed message is present but summary-level. She is on the page throughout, but the closure dilutes into listed intentions rather than a single foreclosing action.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The moonstone cabochon dust speck appears in paragraph two, is prodded in paragraph four (enabling the light trail), glows brighter during monument-building, and dissolves in the penultimate paragraph after serving its purpose. It drives two distinct beats and charges the closure moment, though its disappearance is noted rather than felt as cost. Specificity (iridescent surface, faint trail of light) is high.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Regional folklore is invoked as Elinor's lens for interpreting the moonstone dust and frames the transformation motif. However, it functions as thematic backdrop rather than altering tactics; Elinor does not wrestle with belief versus doubt or pay a social cost for acting on folklore. The concept is present and consistent but does not constrain choices.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Emerges transformed always" is stated twice as folklore principle and once at closure ("emerging transformed always, as the folklore promised"). The dust's transformation from speck to light trail to dissolution demonstrates the attribute, and Elinor's recognition enables her final stance. Yet the cost of transformation (what is lost when the dust dissolves) remains abstract; no on-page trade-off hinges on this property.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The prod (paragraph four: "with a gentle prod of her thumb, she nudged the speck onto a sliver of bark") initiates the light trail and leads Elinor to the arbor's edge, triggering the monument-building sequence. It is the hinge action, but the choice to prod is not dramatized as a risk or dilemma—Elinor acts without hesitation. The prod is essential but not charged with cost.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Monument-building is introduced in paragraph five as a learned practice, executed on the page (stacking seeds, stones, bark in constellation patterns), and directly enables the leaf-decoding by drawing the moonstone light through the structures. The method shapes two beats (building and decoding) and is left standing as "testament to the arbor's memory," contributing to closure. Specificity and causal integration are strong.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The ashen skyborne arbor is established early with vivid detail (branches through clouds, mossy floor, dappled light) and provides spatial constraint at the edge where branches thin into mist. The arbor "trembles" in response to Elinor's work and its canopy shifts ("streaks of gold bleeding through the gray"), linking environment to progression. It shapes one major beat and contributes atmosphere to closure but does not supply a resource or obstacle that alters final tactics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"The hush where past meets prophecy" is invoked twice as descriptor and once at closure ("had given way to action"). Time is vague—no clock or urgency presses Elinor's choices. The timeframe provides tone and thematic frame but does not tighten decisions; Elinor's actions unfold without deadline or temporal cost.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Elinor's motivation to decode the message is stated in paragraph three and drives the prod, the monument-building, and the final reading of the leaves. The desire is clear and persistent, but internal conflict (doubt, fear of failure) is absent—she acts with certainty. The resolution (leaves become legible) satisfies the want without friction or trade-off, limiting the felt cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Mossy delight" is named once (paragraph six) and "mossy green haze" appears in paragraph one, linking tone to setting. However, the tone is more wonder and gentle purpose than delight; emotional modulation is mild across beats. The final image ("her hands steady, her mind clear") suggests calm resolution rather than joy, and the tone does not sharply charge the closure.</comment>
