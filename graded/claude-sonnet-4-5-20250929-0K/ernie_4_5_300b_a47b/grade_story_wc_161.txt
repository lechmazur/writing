<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elias's interior world is richly layered with contradictory impulses—romanticizing his grandfather while knowing the truth of fraud, serving dubious clients yet pursuing personal meaning. Embodied moments work well: trembling fingers on the harness, cross-legged listening to the tape. However, the final turn to pack and deliver the chip himself feels under-motivated; weeks of obsessive decoding collapse into a sudden decision without visible internal cost or a dramatized tipping point that earns the shift.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The piece establishes a hybrid lens—accumulative texture (dust-mote mapping, journal entries) braided with causal pressure (meteorite chip → decoding → discovery of Dr. Voss). Orientation anchors arrive promptly. The dream revelation and map epiphany provide a knowledge change, but the closure—Elias leaving with the chip—reads more as departure than decisive transformation; the cost of abandoning clients and pigeons is asserted in summary ("watching him go") rather than felt on the page. One meaningful deepening is present, sufficient for this length, but the final image lacks the reweighting charge required for higher bands.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The attic is vivid and functional: leather harness, skylight, dust motes, shelves of maps and ledgers. The skylight constrains Elias's method (mapping dust patterns) and charges multiple beats. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (wood polish, sunflower seed reward, cassette hum). The setting enables the decoding work and shapes the final departure, meeting the 9+ test of constraining choice and charging closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding the meteorite chip and his grandfather's legacy—is signaled early and tightens through weeks of decoding. The dream delivers a knowledge reversal ("the echo isn't in the stone...it's in the space between") that narrows options. However, the escalation is primarily reflective; Elias ignores clients and decodes, but no on-page choice tests commitment with visible cost until the final departure, which arrives abruptly. The constraint (dust mapping) shapes tactics, but the peak choice lacks the dramatized friction required for higher bands.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme of legacy, reinvention, and echo emerges through particulars: faked data, the song, dust as language. The final departure offers a non-literal answer to the central question of preservation versus delivery. However, the dream's wisdom ("the echo...is in the space between") edges toward explicit statement, and the closing line—"blooming and withering all at once"—feels ornamental rather than earned from prior image work. Strong thematic grounding with minor lapses in subtlety at closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Voice is consistent and textured: "Paper trails...were fragile things," "The method was absurd, he knew, but it calmed him." Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping. The perceptual signature (mapping chaos, balancing caution/curiosity) is character-specific. One slip: "blooming and withering all at once" in the final line shifts into lyric register without prior grounding, creating a minor tonal break. Otherwise, clean POV control and distinct idiom throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies well; information density is high (meteorite symbols, journal entries, Cairo delivery, Dr. Voss). No loops or scaffold. However, figurative density spikes unevenly: "dust motes swirled...like tiny galaxies," "melody that seemed to shift like sand," "echo...humming in his veins, blooming and withering." The metaphors are legible but stack without pattern-teaching, and the final phrase ("blooming and withering") feels imposed rather than emergent. Clarity and propulsion remain strong; the overwriting is concentrated rather than pervasive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The courier-pigeon trainer paired with meteorite decoding is a fresh synthesis, and the dust-mote mapping method is specific. However, the emotional arc—descendant redeeming disgraced ancestor—follows a familiar template without transformation through bold stakes or moral calculus. The dream revelation and map discovery feel convenient rather than inevitable. Specificity (Cairo, Dr. Voss, 1987 ledger) elevates the piece, but the core premise remains derivative and the resolution lacks risk.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Elias's profession frames setup (training pigeons, checking harness) and supplies the delivery mechanism. The decision to deliver the chip himself is the key turn, but it arrives late and feels more like role abandonment than trainer-specific choice. Two beats: releasing the pigeon, rewarding it at dusk. Mid-band for functional presence without irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The meteorite chip appears in the opening scroll case, drives weeks of decoding (middle development), and Elias pockets it for the final journey (closure participation). Its symbols overlay with dust patterns to form the map. Three gates met; causal pressure across beats; specific properties (etched symbols) matter. Scores in the essential range but not indispensable—story logic could survive with another relic type.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Paper trails" is mentioned once in reflection ("Paper trails...were fragile things") and thematically echoed by ledgers and journals, but it does not constrain an on-page choice or alter tactics. Present as concept, not active pressure. Functional but ornamental; swappable with "fragile histories" or similar.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Elias's reinvention (claiming his grandfather was "a famous archaeologist rather than a disgraced academic") is told in backstory and gnaws at him, but it does not enable or constrain an on-page action with visible cost. Label-only trait; no dramatized tradeoff. Present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Balance" is invoked explicitly ("Balance...came from observing chaos," "Balance...Don't rush") and enacted through dust-mapping. It shapes his method and calms him, influencing the decoding work. Two beats: skylight observation, tape-listening. Setup and middle development met; closure linkage weak (the final departure is not framed as balance). Lyric reprise without strong causal pressure; mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Dust-mote mapping under the skylight is introduced early, recurs (tracing arcs, overlaying with meteorite symbols), and yields the map discovery. Three gates met. The method is specific and shapes the decoding attempt. However, the mechanics remain abstract ("Lines intersected, forming constellations"); the story does not show how the mapping directly produces actionable knowledge. Functional across beats but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The attic is present throughout: skylight for dust mapping, shelves holding journals, pigeon cages, cassette drawer. It supplies the resources (journals, tape) and constrains the method (single skylight). Three gates met; the setting shapes tactics and the final departure originates there. Essential across beats; removing the attic would break the story's spatial logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Learning to trust again" is implied in Elias's shift from ignoring clients to trusting the unknown/decoding work, culminating in the decision to deliver the chip himself (trust in the journey). However, the timeframe is vague ("weeks passed") and does not tighten decisions with a live clock. Thematic presence without tactical pressure; functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Preserve the echo of lost songs" is signaled in the anonymous note, mentioned by the grandfather, and enacted through tape-listening and the final journey. Three gates met. The motivation drives the decoding and the closure choice. However, the friction between preservation (keeping the chip) and delivery (taking it to Dr. Voss) is not dramatized as a live dilemma with cost; the decision feels harmonious rather than conflicted. Shapes beats but lacks visible tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Blooming withering" appears only in the final line without prior tonal preparation. The attic scenes are contemplative and textured, but the tone does not modulate to charge the ending; the phrase feels appended. Lyric gesture without coherent buildup; present at closure but ornamental.</comment>
