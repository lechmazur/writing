<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Clara is presented through label-heavy interiority ("motivation was simple, if vast") and stock gestures (fingers tracing, breath caught) rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final choice to grow the choir lacks visible cost—no path is foreclosed, no trade-off dramatized. Elias appears but his arc from regret to steadier playing feels asserted rather than earned through prior causality. Minor: occupational detail (choir teacher) remains ornamental.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive promptly. The piece lacks a decisive on-page change or legible cost at closure: the choir simply "grew" and the zither rosette "spun" without narrowing options or reweighting prior material. The ending offers thematic echo ("something new could take root") but no felt consequence or Charged Poise crystallization. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural, yet the final image does not reweight the dominant stake with visible pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The velvet library, autumn light, and stained-glass windows are vivid and consistent. The zither's soundhole rosette returns in the final image and charges it visually, earning credit. However, the environment does not constrain a choice—Clara and Elias could meet anywhere without altering tactics. Sensory hierarchy is present (dust motes, maple leaves) but remains decorative rather than pressure-shaping.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—reviving vanishing arts—is signaled early but never tested by a concrete obstacle or reversal that narrows options. Elias's arrival and the violin's unveiling could serve as a tightening, yet no cost or trade-off follows: they simply play together and the choir grows off-page. The story presents a want ("braid diverse voices") without an on-page friction or escalation moment that forces a sacrifice or alters tactics.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme (harmony as holding conflict gently) emerges through image and motif without overt statement, and the zither rosette functions as a recurring anchor. The line "hatred, she knew, was a kind of noise—a cacophony that drowned out the quieter truths" edges toward thesis but is brief. The final image (rosette spinning, "something new could take root") offers resonance, yet it restates the premise rather than reweighting it through a non-literal answer earned by prior particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-person limited on Clara with clean distance control. Perceptual signature is present (she listens "through" stillness, hears "echoes of songs") and voice carries a lyric cadence. Elias's brief dialogue ("In my grandfather's attic...") lacks subtext and reads slightly expository. The phrase "expectantly resigned" in his entrance is label-only and does not inform his syntax or gesture under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Paragraph two opens with template phrasing ("She had come here not to read, but to *denote*") and stacks abstract constructions ("boundaries between what was lost and what might yet be saved"). The phrase "traveled stillness" appears twice, once as italicized and once plain, creating a synonym loop without added pressure. Minor filter-verb stack in paragraph five ("thought," "knew," "asked"). Rhythm varies but density is uneven; several lines restate theme rather than advance scene.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The premise (choir teacher revives vanishing arts amid cultural erasure) follows a familiar template without a transformative inflection. The zither and violin pairing is pleasant but not causally necessary—any two instruments could substitute. The ending's promise ("something new could take root") restates the opening concern rather than offering a non-obvious synthesis. No bold structural or perspectival risk elevates the material.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Clara is present throughout and her vocation (choir teacher) frames the premise. She initiates the meeting with Elias and invites others to the library. However, no on-page choice by Clara creates a key turn or forecloses a path with cost—she observes, reflects, and facilitates without facing a dilemma that alters tactics. The harmonious trait is asserted rather than tested by conflict.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The zither soundhole rosette appears in the opening (Clara's fingers tracing it), is described as matching the violin's scroll motif in the middle, and returns in the final image ("the rosette spun"). It is handled on the page and visually charges the closure. However, it does not constrain a choice or enable a tactic—its presence is atmospheric rather than causal. The reprise reweights tone but not stakes.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Vanishing arts (zither's tremolo, hurdy-gurdy, forgotten lullabies) are named early and provide the thematic backdrop. The story claims they "wither as hatred etched itself into culture," but this remains told rather than dramatized. The concept does not shape on-page tactics or create a concrete obstacle—Clara's choir grows without friction tied to the vanishing phenomenon. Setup and theme presence only; no middle development or closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>The phrase "expectantly resigned" is applied to Elias's tone when he enters ("his tone expectantly resigned"). It is mentioned once, label-only, and does not constrain or enable an action. No cost or trade-off follows. The trait does not reappear or shape a beat beyond that single descriptor.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Denote" appears twice: Clara's purpose is "to *denote*—to mark the boundaries between what was lost and what might yet be saved," and later "they *denoted* the space between discord and unity." Both uses are metaphorical and abstract; no physical act of marking or boundary-setting occurs. The action is ornamental and could be replaced with "define" or "articulate" without structural change.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"By subtracting noise" is stated early as Clara's method ("by subtracting noise—the clamor of bias, the roar of division—she could coax those echoes back into being"). It is echoed once more ("Clara showed them how to subtract it, layer by layer, until only the purest notes remained"). The mechanics are never demonstrated on the page—no scene shows the process of subtraction altering a specific attempt or tactic. The method is told and thematic rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The velvet library in autumn is anchored early, returns in multiple beats (stained-glass windows, dust motes, shelves), and the autumn light "gilded" the final image. The setting provides a sanctuary frame and accumulates texture across the story. However, it does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome—the meeting could occur elsewhere without tactical change. The library shapes tone and closure charge but not pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"Across unlearning hatred" appears once in the phrase "Across the unlearning hatred, they worked." The timeframe is vague and never tracked—no clock or deadline tightens decisions. The story moves from Clara's reflection to Elias's arrival to the choir's growth without temporal markers or a sense of duration that alters tactics. The phrase reads as thematic ornament rather than a pressure device.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Clara's desire "to braid diverse voices into harmony" is stated early and motivates her invitation to others. The motivation is present in two beats (opening reflection, gathering the choir) but is never conflicted—no friction between this want and a competing cost or fear appears. The motivation is told and shapes the premise but does not drive an on-page choice with visible trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Traveled stillness" is named twice (once italicized: "the *traveled stillness* of a place that had witnessed revolutions"; once plain in the title phrase). The tone is lyric and contemplative, coherent through the piece. It modulates slightly when Elias plays ("the first note was a sob") but remains largely static. The final image gestures toward the tone (rosette spinning, light gilding) but does not charge or crystallize pressure—the mood restates rather than reweights.</comment>
