<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is concrete (outrunning guilt from the scarred children) and her mentor's lessons guide her choices. The chanting habit embodies her loneliness and becomes purposeful by the end. However, her interior voice slides into elevated register during peak moments ("Filter the world through its flame") that feels imposed rather than organic to a wandering artisan. The final laugh and transformation arrive without sufficient intermediate cost or contradiction—she moves from guilt to defiance too smoothly.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed: we learn "blooming fortress," "fire-lilies," and her mentor's disappearance, but the fortress's actual nature (inhabited? abandoned?) and Lira's immediate tactical goal remain vague past the 120-word mark. The closure—lilies blooming as she realizes "shadows" mean unlit potential—offers a conceptual repricing, but the cost is asserted ("she's learned to defy gravity") rather than dramatized through a visible forfeiture or tactical shift. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural (density increase via the spreading flame), yet the escalation is more descriptive than causal.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The fortress courtyard (archways, fountains of liquid light, fire-lilies) is vivid and purposeful. The kerosene knot's warmth and the mosaic's spiral guide Lira's movement, and the domed chamber's closed petals create spatial pressure. The starless sky returns charged at the end. Micro-setting (the knot in her hand, the cool stone beneath her knees) constrains her kneeling choice and charges the final image, meeting the 9+ gate requirement and elevating the score above mid-band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—reigniting her craft after the pavilion disaster—is signaled early. The note and the knot's pull create a tightening, and placing the knot on the lily triggers the chain reaction. However, the escalation is more atmospheric than causal: Lira's choices (following the light, kneeling, placing the knot) are sequential but not forced by mounting opposition or cost. The resolution (fortress blooms, she laughs) asserts transformation without an on-page trade-off or visible price paid.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Theme—unlit potential within oneself, defying gravity through fire—emerges from the blooming lilies and the mentor's lessons. The kerosene knot and fire-lilies function as recurring images that reweight at closure. Yet the final realization ("shadows weren't darkness, but unlit potential") is stated rather than discovered through a non-literal image, and the mentor's map metaphor leans toward direct thesis. The piece invites reflection but the ending articulates the theme rather than letting the image resonate without comment.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, and Lira's perceptual signature (filtering ambient sounds, warmth of the knot) is consistent. Psychic distance modulates appropriately (closer during the chant, wider when surveying the courtyard). However, elevated diction ("tapestry of color," "velvet void," "roaring, golden radiance") intrudes during high-pressure beats, clashing with a wandering artisan's interior lexicon. The chant's "guttural sound" and "serious playfulness" are told rather than embodied in rhythm or word choice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout ("tapestry of color," "gravity of hopelessness," "fire spins upward," "shadows bloom") without clear pattern-teaching, creating mild register drift. Sentence openings vary, and spatial choreography is mostly clear. Minor paraphrase loop: "The knot...had been soaked" and "He'd given it to her" restate the mentor's gift across adjacent beats. The closure beat ("she stood, the kerosene knot still burning") is clean, capping non-closure deductions. No severe line-level artifacts, but cumulative density and stock metaphors ("raw and unfamiliar" laugh) lower momentum slightly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The premise—fireworks designer rekindles craft via mentor's cryptic lesson—is familiar, and the core turn (unlit potential = shadows) is telegraphed by the note's script. The blooming fortress and kerosene knot offer specific texture, and the fire-lilies' chain reaction is visually fresh. However, the emotional arc (guilt → defiance via literal ignition) follows a predictable template, and the mentor's disappearance + cryptic gift + found note echo common workshop tropes. Transformation is modest; the plot and arc could port to different names/places with minimal friction.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Lira is present throughout and her final act (placing the knot on the lily) triggers the bloom. However, most of her movement is reactive (following the note, following the knot's pull) rather than decision-driven. The choice to kneel and place the knot is undersold—no visible friction or alternative considered. She observes and enacts the mentor's lesson more than she wrestles with competing options.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The kerosene knot appears in paragraph 2 (setup), grows warm and flares blue-white in paragraph 4 (development), and ignites the lily in paragraph 5 (payoff, present at closure). It is handled across three beats and its properties (warmth, flame) enable the chain reaction. Elevated by causal pressure and closure linkage, but not fully indispensable—another fire source could substitute with moderate edits. Strong integration overall.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The note ("seek the chamber where shadows bloom") is discovered mid-story and its script matches the mentor's, raising stakes emotionally. It directs Lira to the chamber, shaping one tactical turn. However, it does not constrain her choices with cost or return reweighted at closure—the final image focuses on the blooming lilies and her stance, not the note itself. Functional but somewhat replaceable; another clue (map, symbol) could serve similarly.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Chanting is mentioned in paragraphs 2, 4, and 7: initially as a loneliness habit, then louder to coax secrets, finally "with purpose." It is present across beats but operates as a label—no on-page moment shows the chant enabling or constraining an action with visible cost. The attribute decorates her character without altering tactics or outcomes. Functional presence without causal necessity.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Filter" appears as the mentor's lesson in paragraph 2, Lira recalls it in paragraph 5 ("Filter, she thought"), and she closes her eyes to let ambient awareness flood her before the bloom. It shapes the climactic beat by cueing her method, but the mechanics are vague—filtering does not narrow options or impose a tradeoff. The action drives one key turn (the bloom) yet could be replaced with "focus" or "attune" with minor edits. Solid integration, not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Ambient awareness" is named in paragraph 3 ("moved through ambient awareness") and paragraph 5 ("letting ambient awareness flood her"). It describes her sensory attunement (hum, crackle, draft) but the mechanics remain abstract—no moment shows how this method constrains a choice or enables a tactic another approach couldn't. Present in two beats, but ornamental; the bloom would proceed without explicit invocation of this method. Functional setup, weak development and payoff.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The blooming fortress is anchored in paragraph 1 (setup) and its courtyard, mosaic, spiral staircase, and domed chamber guide Lira's movement across multiple beats. The chamber's closed fire-lilies are essential to the climax, and the starless sky/reflected light charge the final image. The setting supplies the constraint (lilies dormant until ignited) and the resource (the chamber itself). Removing the fortress would break the story's logic and closure image. Strong causal role and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The starless night is mentioned in paragraph 1 ("sky was a velvet void, starless") and returns in paragraph 6 ("starless sky above the dome began to glow"). It provides atmospheric texture and a before/after contrast, but does not tighten decisions or impose a clock—Lira explores at her own pace with no temporal pressure. The hush and darkness are descriptive rather than constraining. Present in setup and closure, weak development; time does not alter tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The motivation ("outrun the shadow of her last failure," "defy the gravity of hopelessness") is stated in paragraph 1 and echoed in the final line ("learned to defy gravity"). It frames her emotional stake and the closure's thematic repricing. However, the desire is told more than dramatized—no on-page moment shows her weighing the cost of attempting ignition versus retreating. The friction between guilt and defiance is asserted rather than enacted through conflicted choice. Functional framing, modest dramatization.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Serious playfulness" is named only in the final line and not embodied earlier in diction, rhythm, or choice. The tone reads earnest and lyric throughout (elevated metaphors, mystical cues) without modulation or ironic distance that would signal playfulness under pressure. The laugh in paragraph 6 ("raw and unfamiliar") gestures toward release but is brief. The tonal label is applied at closure without prior demonstration, making it ornamental. Static lyric mood, weak coherence with the declared tone.</comment>
