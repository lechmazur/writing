<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The Herald's motivation to "shape the future" is declared but never concretely tested—she adjusts the wick, sees shadows, and decides she's ready, but no on-page choice forecloses a path or costs her something visible. Interiority relies on stock phrasing ("her breath catching," "the sound echoing off the stones") and therapy-speak self-awareness ("total internal reflection required focus, a willingness to let the light consume her"). The final "choice" to raise the lantern feels performed rather than earned by prior contradiction or struggle. Embodied emotion is minimal; laughter recurs as a tic without contradictory impulse acting in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed—who, where, and when are scattered across the opening third without early anchoring. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural (shadows coalesce, colors shift, light "bursts free"), but the final image offers no decisive reweighting or visible cost: she raises the lantern, feels "purpose," and the dawn arrives as expected. No meaningful tightening occurs; the Herald's actions (adjust wick, step to balcony, raise lantern) do not narrow options or change knowledge. Closure reads as Charged Poise in aspiration, but the cost is asserted ("the one who dared") rather than felt on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The emerald lighthouse, glass panels, and cliff anchor space effectively; the lantern's "total internal reflection" property constrains her method and the balcony staging grounds the final beat. Sensory detail is selective (wind tugging cloak, waves crashing, flame hissing) and filtered through urgency. The glass wick's light directly shapes the closure image, satisfying the 9+ gate criterion, but overwriting in the opening third ("glass panels glowing faintly under a sky thick with stars," "its flame flickering like a captured comet") and a few vague gestures ("the shadows seemed to agree, pulsing") hold the score in mid-band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"to see the dawn" and "shape the future"—is signaled early but never tested by a live on-page reversal. She adjusts the wick, the shadows respond obediently, and the gold dawn appears; no complication forces a trade-off. The "darkness too" flicker is acknowledged then set aside without cost. Agency is reduced to observation and declaration ("Let's do this") rather than a choice that forecloses a path. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening is required; here the pressure remains flat from midpoint to end.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Theme—light/dark as choice, the power of ancient tools to shape the future—emerges from images (lantern, shadows, dawn) rather than statement, which is a strength. The final paragraph lapses into direct thematic summary ("the dawn wasn't just a time of day. It was a choice") and the Herald's self-congratulation ("she'd always known her role was small, but tonight, it felt enough") replaces earned resonance with assertion. The shadows-as-living-secrets motif recurs but does not constrain a choice or reweight prior material at closure. No non-literal answer to the central question lands; the ending states the theme rather than dramatizing it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Voice is consistent—third-person close with metaphoric diction ("wind chimes in a hurricane," "liquid night")—and psychic distance is stable. The perceptual signature (colors, light, shadows) is character-specific and maintained under pressure. However, register drifts into elevated abstraction at peak beats ("total internal reflection required focus, a willingness to let the light consume her") that feels imposed rather than voice-motivated, and the final paragraph's "steward of shadows" phrasing reads like external labeling. No dialogue present. Filter verbs ("she saw," "she understood") cluster but remain legible within the reflective mode.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "She'd accidentally discovered its prophetic nature years ago: adjust the wick just so, and the shadows it cast would reveal fragments of the future. Not clear images, but feelings, colors, the shape of events yet to unfold" restates the same content across three clauses without added pressure. Template cadence runs appear ("She laughed again... She needed to see more. Grasping the lantern firmly, she stepped..."). Stock metaphors ("like a captured comet," "restless gods," "liquid night") stack without fresh specificity. Figurative density in the opening and middle third ("wind tugging at her cloak," "shadows burst free, spilling across the balcony") dilutes momentum. The closure beat is relatively clean, capping deductions at −0.8 per the Non-closure Accumulation Cap, but pervasive scaffold holds the score in mid-band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The core premise—lighthouse keeper uses prophetic lantern to shape the dawn—synthesizes familiar elements (lone keeper, mystical tool, light/dark choice) without a fresh angle. The "total internal reflection" concept is named but not transformed into surprising tactics or consequences. The prophetic shadows obey without resistance; the Herald faces no genuine dilemma between competing goods or unavoidable harms. Emotional progression is generic: laughter → determination → satisfaction. The ending's "choice" rhetoric ("the dawn was coming, and she was ready") offers tidy affirmation rather than an earned, non-obvious synthesis. Risk-averse execution prioritizes coherence over bold insight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Laughing Storm Herald is present throughout and her actions (adjusting wick, stepping to balcony, raising lantern) drive the sequence, satisfying setup and development gates. However, her final choice—raising the lantern—does not narrow options or impose visible cost; she acts, the dawn arrives, and she feels satisfied. The "accidentally prophetic" title and laughter tic are decorative rather than causal. Closure participation is ornamental (she raises the lantern, but the outcome was assured). Swappability: a generic "keeper" could perform the same beats with minor edits. Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.4 (ornamental), minus swappability −0.6, minus label-only laughter tic −0.3, minus no visible cost tied to her choices −0.7, lands ~4.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The glass lantern wick appears in setup (adjusting, "thin as a spider's thread"), middle (twisting, flame flares), and closure (burning brighter, raised high). It constrains method—she must master "the angle, the pressure, the exact moment"—and the final image depends on its light "piercing the night." However, its mechanics (total internal reflection) are asserted rather than demonstrated with tactical consequence, and the wick obeys her without complication. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure (moderate) +0.8, closure linkage +1.0, specificity +0.5, minus summary-only mechanics −0.5, minus no cost tied to its use −0.6, lands ~6.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The "otherworldly routine" is mentioned in setup ("keeper of routines no one else remembered, her tasks otherworldly in their precision") but does not shape stakes or tactics on the page. The Herald's actions (adjusting wick, observing shadows) read as mystical rather than routine-bound, and no on-page conflict arises from the tension between routine and prophecy. The concept functions as thematic decoration rather than a pressure that constrains choices. Setup +0.4, closure absent (the ending celebrates her role generically, not the routine itself) −1.0, ornamental use −0.7, swappability −0.5, label-only −0.3, lands ~3.9.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Accidentally prophetic" is mentioned in setup ("She'd accidentally discovered its prophetic nature years ago") and shapes the premise, but the trait does not constrain or enable a choice with visible cost. She uses the prophecy deliberately here, and "accidentally" is backstory flavor rather than an on-page friction. The trait could be replaced with "deliberately learned" without altering events. Setup +0.5, middle development (her mastery of the angle/pressure implies control, not accident) absent −0.8, closure linkage weak (the discovery is backstory, not reweighted) +0.2, ornamental −0.6, swappability −0.6, label-only −0.3, lands ~5.3.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Steer" appears explicitly ("To steer the future, she'd learned, required more than just vision") and implicitly in her adjustments of the wick and lantern to guide the shadows. The action is signaled early and present across beats (adjusting, tilting, raising), but no major turn traces uniquely to steering—she observes, then raises the lantern, and the dawn arrives as expected. If "steer" were replaced with "reveal" or "summon," the plot would hold with minor edits. Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, causal pressure (moderate) +0.7, closure linkage +0.7, minus swappability −0.7, minus no turn that depends on steering −0.8, lands ~5.7.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Total internal reflection" is named in setup and middle ("To steer the future, she'd learned, required... total internal reflection. The lantern's glass was designed to bend light inward, trapping it until it burst free"), but its mechanics are asserted rather than shown constraining her attempts. She tilts the lantern, the flame flares, and shadows burst free—no tactical friction or cost emerges from the method. The physics-borrowed term reads as decorative rather than functional. Setup +0.5, middle development (mentioned, not dramatized) +0.2, closure linkage (the light "pierces" but the method is not re-engaged) +0.3, ornamental −0.7, summary-only −0.5, swappability −0.6, lands ~4.1.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The emerald lighthouse under stars anchors all action, provides the balcony staging for the climax, and its light is the closure image ("the lighthouse, standing tall, its light cutting through the dark"). The cliff and ocean supply atmospheric pressure (wind, waves crashing) that grounds her physical stance. Early signal +0.7, three beats (opening, balcony, closure image) +1.4, causal pressure (the balcony and lantern's height enable the final act) +1.0, closure linkage +1.2, specificity (emerald, glass, circular balcony) +0.6, no major frictions, lands ~7.4.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"After the last print newspaper had yellowed and crumbled" is mentioned in setup but does not tighten decisions or tactics on the page. The Herald's world is post-print, but no on-page action depends on this timeframe—she could perform the same ritual in any era. The element functions as worldbuilding flavor rather than a constraint. Setup +0.4, middle and closure absent (no tactical consequence) −1.2, ornamental −0.7, swappability −0.7, label-only −0.3, cap at 2.8 (missing closure participation gate).</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"To shape a new dawn using ancient shadows" is the Herald's stated goal, signaled early and restated at closure ("to shape the new dawn, she'd need to steer through the chaos"). The desire is dramatized through her actions (adjusting wick, raising lantern) and the final image shows the dawn arriving. However, no on-page friction between the want and a competing cost emerges—she acts, succeeds, and feels satisfied without visible sacrifice. Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, minus no conflicted choice or cost −1.2, minus told satisfaction ("she was ready") rather than dramatized friction −0.8, lands ~6.1.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Shadowed elation" (laughter amid storm, cold electric shadows, gold dawn breaking through dark) is coherent across the piece and modulates with pressure: laughter bubbles early, gasps at the shadow revelation, steadies during the final act, then rises to meet the wind. The tone charges the final image ("first hints of gold began to bleed into the sky") with earned duality. However, the elation is asserted more than embodied in micro-choices under stress, and the final paragraph's declarative satisfaction flattens the shadow/light tension. Setup +0.6, modulation across three beats +1.3, closure linkage +1.0, specificity +0.5, minus static elation in final paragraph (no tonal complication) −0.6, minus asserted rather than embodied in peak beats −0.5, lands ~6.3.</comment>
