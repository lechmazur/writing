<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lila's motivation to collect "flavors of different silences" is established but remains abstract—she never wrestles with competing impulses or a genuine choice that costs her something internal. The doll loss registers emotionally and the sprout discovery shows change, but the arc feels more like acceptance than earned transformation through contradictory desires acting simultaneously. Interiority leans toward poetic declaration ("silence tasted of honey and old wood") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The father remains functional but applies no relational pressure that forces Lila into a values hierarchy.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors clearly by the opening paragraph (who, where, situation). The piece follows a causal lens: gravity inverts → Lila ascends → doll is lost → sprout appears, creating a legible before/after with cost (loss of anchor object, gain of hope-seed). The closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost (the doll is gone, irretrievable). Minor slip: the sprout's arrival "one morning" after "days" of mourning compresses the causal payoff into summary rather than dramatizing the discovery beat, slightly dulling the closure image's immediacy.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The bunker's metallic silence versus the trellis's "gilded hush" provides sensory contrast that reflects Lila's internal state. The xenial trellis functions as setting-as-constraint: its hour-long accessibility under inverted gravity shapes her tactical window and the doll's loss. Spatial choreography remains clear (bunker floor → hatch → trellis vines → fall back). The sprout pushing through the bunker floor crack charges the final image by importing the trellis logic into the sealed space, making the micro-setting (crack, shoot) essential to closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: Lila's need to escape claustrophobia and collect silence-flavors. The gravity-inversion countdown tightens the tactical window, and her choice to cling versus return under her father's call provides one meaningful pressure point. The doll's loss mid-scene delivers visible cost that forecloses her tangible anchor. However, the resolution (sprout discovery) feels more like thematic consolation than a protagonist-driven choice that narrows options or forces a trade-off; the sprout arrives as gift rather than through Lila's agency at closure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme of containment versus expansion emerges through concrete images (bunker/trellis, metallic/honey silence, doll/sprout), avoiding overt statement until the final paragraph's "stretching contracted fears into something like hope" leans slightly didactic. The doll-to-sprout transformation offers a resonant, non-literal answer to Lila's claustrophobia question. Subtext operates in the father's steady hands/tremor voice contradiction and Lila's mouth-opening gesture to "swallow" silence. The penultimate paragraph ("learned that by limiting her exposure") edges toward articulating the premise rather than letting the sprout image do the work alone.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping; Lila's perceptual signature filters setting through sensory-flavor metaphors ("silence tasted of honey and old wood"). Dialogue is minimal but functional: the father's warning and "Time to go" apply immediate pressure without exposition. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("intangibly tangible," "xenial") that reads slightly imposed rather than child-focalized, though the fairy-tale timbre may be intentional. Psychic distance holds close throughout peak beats (countdown, trellis moment, mourning, sprout discovery).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully (short sentences at countdown, longer lyric lines in the trellis), and information density is high in the opening paragraph. However, several lines loop concepts: "intangibly tangible" and "gilded hush" each appear twice with identical phrasing, and "silence" recurs seven times across 750 words without enough functional variation. Minor filter-verb stack in paragraph two ("he'd picked up," "silence could feel") slightly dulls immediacy. The phrase "stretching contracted" in the final paragraph reads as prompt-echo rather than earned image. No causality breaks, but scaffold and synonym proximity (flavors/wash over, floated/balloon) reduce propulsion in mid-beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The gravity-inversion premise offers a fresh physical constraint, and the sensory-collection motivation (flavors of silence) provides a non-obvious angle on claustrophobia. The doll-to-sprout transformation feels earned in hindsight and avoids purely symbolic convenience by linking loss to growth. However, the core emotional arc (child seeks escape, loses anchor, finds hope in new growth) follows a recognizable template, and phrases like "gilded hush" and "intangibly tangible" read as ornamental rather than organically arising from Lila's voice or the world's logic. The piece synthesizes its elements competently but does not take bold structural or tonal risks that would elevate originality into the high band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lila is present throughout and drives the ascent choice, but her major decisions (going up, clinging, letting go) are prompted more by external timing (countdown, father's call) than by internal conflict that alters tactics. The final paragraph's realization ("by limiting her exposure") registers as insight but is told rather than dramatized through a closing choice. She appears in the closure beat (finding the sprout) but does not act upon it in a way that narrows options; the sprout arrives as discovery, not consequence of a choice she made in that moment.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The porcelain doll appears in three distinct beats: clutched during ascent, described as relic/anchor in exposition, slipping away mid-trellis, and mourned for days. Its loss is the story's pivotal cost, and the final sprout is directly framed as "the doll's loss had planted something new," reweighting its meaning from anchor to seed. It shapes the ending's emotional and thematic charge. However, the doll is passive object rather than tool; Lila never uses it to enable a tactic or choice, only holds and loses it. Strong closure linkage and beat involvement, but lacks specificity in how its unique properties (porcelain, chipped face, bright eyes) constrain action.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Gilded hush" is introduced as the father's phrase for "something precious and quiet" and applied twice to the trellis silence. It labels the thematic atmosphere but does not shape stakes or constrain a choice; Lila's goal remains "collect the flavors of different silences," which is the operative driver. The concept appears in the trellis beat and the final reflection, but could be replaced with "sacred quiet" or "luminous silence" without altering plot logic. Functional but swappable; primarily thematic rather than mechanical.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Intangibly tangible" is applied twice as a descriptor (the gilded hush, the sprout) but does not constrain or enable any on-page action with cost. It labels a quality without altering what Lila can or cannot do. The trait is ornamental; removing it would not change the plot's causal chain or the closure's logic. Present but does not shape choices or momentum.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Sprout" appears as verb ("sprout wings of patience" in paragraph 3) and noun (the green shoot in the penultimate paragraph). The final sprout is the closure image and reweights the doll's loss, appearing in the ending and shifting Lila's stance from mourning to hope. However, it arrives as discovery rather than as the result of a choice Lila makes during the trellis beat; the doll "planted something new" by being lost, not by Lila's intentional act. The sprout drives the final thematic turn but is not causally linked to Lila's agency in the middle beats. Two-gate presence (development as metaphor, payoff as image) with closure linkage, but the middle metaphor use is weak.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Limiting exposure" is introduced as the father's warning ("limit your exposure") and returns in the final paragraph as Lila's lesson: "by limiting her exposure to the bunker's confines... she could sprout new ways of being." It frames the method but does not materially shape her tactics in the trellis beat; she ascends fully, clings until called back, and the hour limit is enforced by the father's voice rather than her own exposure calculus. The phrase appears in setup and payoff, reweighting the father's caution into Lila's strategy, but the middle beat (trellis) does not dramatize her actively managing exposure as a tactical constraint. Lyric reprise that reweights meaning, eligible for mid-5s to low-6s.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The xenial trellis is the story's destination and the site of the doll's loss; it supplies the "gilded hush" silence Lila seeks and serves as the physical space where the pivotal cost occurs. It appears in setup (paragraph 1), is reached in the middle beat (paragraph 5), and its logic (vines, flowers thriving in thin air) is imported into the bunker via the sprout at closure. The trellis's unique properties (defies logic, thrives in thin air) justify the sprout's arrival and charge the final image. However, the trellis does not constrain Lila's choices within the scene—she floats, experiences, reaches, but the environment does not force a tactical decision; the hour limit and father's call are the active constraints. All three gates present; causal role in one major beat (doll loss) and closure linkage (sprout logic), but lacks repeated tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The one-hour gravity inversion is announced in paragraph 1, the countdown dramatized in paragraph 4, and the time limit enforced when "the hour was short" and gravity pulls Lila back. It tightens the tactical window and creates urgency during the trellis beat. The timeframe shapes two beats (countdown/ascent, forced return) and participates in closure by explaining why the doll is lost (Lila clings, cannot retrieve it in time). However, the inversion itself is a given condition rather than a constraint Lila must navigate tactically; she does not make a mid-scene choice about how to spend the hour. Present across beats, causally active, but the time pressure is enforced externally (father, gravity) rather than through Lila's time-management choice.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Lila's desire "to collect the flavors of different silences" is stated in paragraph 2 and dramatized in paragraph 5 (tasting honey, old wood, lullabies). It drives her ascent choice and her reluctance to return. However, the motivation is not conflicted on the page—no competing want or cost tests her commitment during the trellis beat; she simply experiences the silence and is called back. The doll loss is incidental to her silence-collection goal rather than a trade-off she consciously makes. The final paragraph reframes the silences as "seeds, growing inside her," showing evolution, but the middle beat does not dramatize friction between her want and a price she must weigh. Setup and payoff present; middle friction weak.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Stretching contracted" appears in the opening paragraph as descriptor for the trellis's "contracted possibilities" and in the final paragraph as "stretching contracted fears into something like hope." The tone modulates from claustrophobic metallic dread (bunker) to soft, warm possibility (trellis) to quiet, earned hope (sprout). The tonal shift charges the final image by moving from enclosure to expansion. However, the phrase "stretching contracted" in the final line reads as echo rather than organic image, and the tone does not modulate with pressure during the peak beat—Lila's trellis experience is lyrically positive without tonal tension. Coherent arc, purposeful modulation, but the ending phrase feels imposed rather than inevitable. Setup and payoff present with clear tonal progression; middle beat lacks tonal friction.</comment>
