<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to "translate between generations" is stated but not embodied in contradictory impulses. His decision-making unfolds smoothly—capturing sounds, testing the box, sharing melodies—without internal friction or visible cost until the final choice. The tears at hearing his mother's lullaby provide an embodied moment, but the arc lacks a meaningful renunciation or foreclosed path. The self-aware poetic revisions mid-scene read as meta-commentary rather than dramatized struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation is clean by line 2 (who, where, when). The piece follows a causal-accumulative hybrid: Elias opens jars, the box plays, the village responds. However, closure lacks legible cost—he returns to the loft successful with jingling coins and renewed purpose, a soft affirmation rather than a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration. The Cost Proof Test fails: no on-page sentence at the ending demonstrates what path was foreclosed or what price was paid. The final paragraph summarizes theme rather than landing a charged image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The feral loft—sand through warped boards, rusted cot, chipped sink—anchors early and recurs at closure. The music box's "rusted keyhole" and the jars arranged in a semicircle create micro-setting that shapes action (he pours sound into the keyhole, conducts "an orchestra of ghosts"). The loft's "lonesome splendor" modulates with dawn's progression. The village choreography is less precise, but the loft itself constrains and charges the final return, meeting the 9+ gate test.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—proving lost songs can return—is signaled early and tested when the box shudders and plays his mother's lullaby. That moment tightens options emotionally. Yet the village sequence unfolds without friction: children cluster, an old woman recognizes a tune, coins jingle. No reversal or deepening choice narrows Elias's path. The ending restates intent ("capture more sounds tomorrow") without escalating cost or forcing a trade-off. One meaningful tightening occurs, but closure lacks visible price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Theme—memory, redemption through recurrence—emerges from the music box and jar mechanics. The three attempted verses show craft-consciousness but read as on-the-nose thematic rehearsal rather than earned insight. The village woman's "Where did you find this?" / "In the silence, where all stories wait to be sweetened" borders on sermonizing. The final paragraph ("not to be remembered, but to remember") states the moral rather than letting the image carry it. Theme is coherent but relies on assertion at closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV is stable. Diction is consistent ("vagrant penny poet," "lonesome splendor," "feral loft") with a lyric register. The three verse drafts—each with meta-commentary in parentheses—break immersion and read as authorial rather than character-driven. Dialogue is minimal and functional; the old woman's question advances plot without subtext. Psychic distance remains controlled, but the parenthetical verse workshop pulls the reader out of Elias's present experience during a peak beat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops appear: "In glass and rust, I find my trade— / to sweeten silence" restates "to become the translator… to sweeten the world's sharp edges." The three verse attempts with parenthetical commentary create a template cadence and scaffold the reader through revision rather than dramatizing it. "Lonesome splendor," "positively wistful," and "gleaned redemption" feel like prompt labels rather than earned images. Stock metaphors ("bridge between worlds," "thief of echoes") accumulate without fresh specificity. These patterns cluster in the middle third, warranting −0.8 to −1.0 total deduction and disallowing 9+ globally per the artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The "capturing sounds in jars" premise is inventive but closely echoes SFF tropes of bottled essence without transformation through lived detail. The vagrant poet archetype and the redemptive-music plot follow familiar contours. The three on-page verse revisions gesture toward craft struggle but read as meta-performance. No bold structural risk: the arc is straightforward problem→solution→affirmation. Specificity in the loft setting elevates slightly, but the emotional template—lost memory recovered, world softened—does not surprise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias is present throughout, makes the choice to test the jars, and returns to the loft at closure. His decisions (opening jars, walking to the village, planning tomorrow's captures) advance beats but lack friction or cost. The "vagrant penny poet" label recurs without altering tactics. Two-gate presence (setup, payoff) with beat involvement but low causal pressure and no visible trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The music box is introduced early (first paragraph), handled in at least three beats (testing with jars, playing for the village, humming at night), and appears in the final image. Its "rusted keyhole" mechanic matters: Elias pours sound into it. Removing the box would break the core action. Strong beat involvement and closure linkage, but the box does not create a constraint or cost—only enables the solution.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Gleaned redemption" is stated in the opening exposition ("to sweeten the world's sharp edges") and echoed in the final paragraph ("gleaned redemption wasn't his alone"). It does not constrain a choice or shift tactics on the page. The concept functions as thematic label rather than a dramatized stake with cost. Present and coherent but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Positively wistful" appears once in paragraph 1 ("the sun's first blush, painting the room in a positively wistful gold"). It describes atmosphere but does not enable or constrain any action. Label-only mention without cost or choice involvement.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Sweeten" recurs as verb and metaphor: "sweeten the world's sharp edges," "to sweeten silence," "make the remembering sweet." It shapes Elias's goal and appears in the village exchange ("to be sweetened"). The action is central to motivation and closure but could be swapped for "restore," "soften," or "redeem" with minor edits. Two-gate presence with thematic weight but moderate specificity.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Introduced in paragraph 2 ("spent weeks capturing sounds in glass jars"), executed on-page in paragraph 4 ("opened the first jar—the ship's creak—and poured the sound"), and mentioned at closure ("capture more sounds tomorrow"). The method drives the central turn (box plays the lullaby) and shapes village tactics (opening jars, letting the box sing). Mechanics are signaled early and matter to outcome. Strong setup, development, and payoff.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The "feral loft beneath the dunes" anchors early, recurs in paragraph 3 (rusted cot, chipped sink, jars in semicircle), and frames closure ("returned to the loft"). Sand through floorboards and the loft's isolation shape the opening ritual. The setting enables privacy for the experiment and charges the return, but it does not constrain a middle choice or alter tactics. Two strong gates (setup, payoff) with atmospheric contribution.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"At dawn's earliest whistle" appears in the opening and closing sentences. Dawn progresses to "dawn's peak" and then "dusk," creating a day-long span. Time is tracked but does not tighten a decision or create urgency—Elias works at his own pace. The timeframe brackets the story without pressuring tactics. Lyric reprise without causal constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"To become the translator between generations" is stated in paragraph 2 and governs the plot. Elias's desire to "capture the whispers of the old and the dreams of the young" drives jar-collecting and village sharing. However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized through friction—no moment where this goal conflicts with cost or safety. Functional but not tested under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Lonesome splendor" appears twice (paragraph 3, "the loft's lonesome splendor deepened"; title echo at closure). The tone coheres through lyric diction ("feral loft," "wistful gold," "gleaned redemption") and modulates from solitary dawn to communal dusk. The phrasing charges the final return to the loft. Strong reprise that reweights the opening mood, meeting two gates (setup, payoff) with atmospheric consistency.</comment>
