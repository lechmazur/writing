<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Clara's grief-driven carving process shows embodied emotion through concrete action—sharpening, cutting, placing the lion—and the husband's absence creates a clear internal contradiction between memory and present void. However, the interiority leans heavily on abstract metaphor ("hollowed her," "ghostly echo") rather than character-particular perception, and the final stance ("This is how we survive") arrives through meditation rather than a micro-choice under pressure. The carving itself is more therapeutic meditation than a decision that forecloses a path with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the loft session accumulates sensory detail and reflection toward a final image reweighting loss. Orientation anchors who/where/when by ~120 words. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis: Clara chooses to continue carving the void into form), but the cost is conceptual rather than legibly felt on the page—no live option is foreclosed, no tactical price paid. The "while the kettle boiled" frame promises tightening that never materializes; the kettle goes cold without pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The loft's rain-streaked skylight, chipped kettle, workbench, and ash wood are vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (steam curling, sawdust smell, fractured light). The carving blank and knife constrain Clara's hand movements and the final windowsill placement charges the closure image. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout. The "rust-hued peace" is evocative but slightly abstract; the setting does pressure the reflective mood without forcing a tactical choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—processing grief through carving—is signaled early and sustained. However, escalation under the Accumulative lens is minimal: Clara begins ready to carve and completes it without meaningful resistance, reversal, or deepening. The wood "resisted at first, then yielded" is the sole friction, resolved in a single sentence. No live option is foreclosed; the carving succeeds as planned. The piece offers a single move (carve → place) rather than a tightening that narrows tactics or raises cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme—loss as transformation, carrying the dead forward—emerges organically from the carving action and the ash wood's particularity. The final image (lion on sill, candlelight through rain) reweights prior material without overt moralizing. However, the penultimate paragraph states the thesis explicitly ("Loss wasn't an ending, but a transformation"), and the final line ("This is how we survive") edges toward summary. The carving as vessel for memory is a strong particular, but the scaffolding around it dilutes resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Single-POV distance is stable; perceptual signature (steam, sawdust, honey) reflects Clara's priorities. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register mismatched with grief under pressure: "alchemy," "mosaic," "contain the uncontainable" read more essayistic than lived-in. The sentence "She'd read once that time wasn't linear but a mosaic" is meta-commentary that externalizes rather than embodies. No dialogue present. Rhythmic control is competent but not distinctive; many sentences open with subject-verb patterns.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Clarity and sensory density are strong; no grammar errors. However, pervasive figurative language creates density without always advancing pressure: "silver threads," "watercolor haze," "ghostly echo," "monument to here and gone" cluster in many sentences. Paraphrase loop: "The loft existed outside time, a bubble where the past and present coexisted" restates the prior "time as mosaic" concept. Template cadence: "She lit... She sharpened... She rose... She sipped... She worked..." runs across multiple beats. Minor scaffold: "the kind that comes only after the storm has passed" tells what has been shown.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The widow-carving-grief premise is familiar; the transformation occurs through the ash wood's specificity and the loft's rain-beaded particularity. However, the emotional arc—decide to carve, carve successfully, find peace—follows a predictable template without a non-obvious turn. The "here and gone" and "crystallized time" concepts are invoked as thematic labels rather than transformed through lived detail. Risk-aversion is visible: Clara encounters no meaningful friction, and the ending grants full closure without ambiguity or cost.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Clara appears in every beat and her decision to carve (end of paragraph 2) initiates the sequence. However, her agency is observation-heavy: she watches steam, traces wood, lights candles, and works "slowly" without a mid-scene choice that alters tactics. The placing of the lion on the sill is the sole decisive action at closure, and it completes rather than redirects her intent. Present throughout but lacks the two-beat causal pressure typical of higher scores.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The ash wood carving blank is introduced early (paragraph 2), handled in the sharpening and carving beats (paragraphs 5–6), and placed on the windowsill at closure with reweighted meaning ("a vessel... to hold the parts of him that still lingered"). The blank's grain and texture constrain Clara's knife path, and its transformation from blank to lion embodies the thematic shift. Three-beat involvement with closure linkage and specificity; the exact material (ash wood, his gift) matters. Reaches essential range.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Here and gone" is named explicitly in paragraph 4 ("the way things could exist so vividly one moment and dissolve into nothing the next") and echoed at closure ("a monument to here and gone"). However, it functions as thematic commentary rather than shaping on-page choices or stakes. Clara does not face a decision between holding on and letting go; the concept is invoked to explain rather than complicate. Functional label without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Hauntingly practical" appears once in paragraph 3 as a descriptor of the wood's texture, framing it as "a blank slate demanding purpose." The phrase colors tone but does not constrain or enable a choice with visible cost—Clara's carving proceeds without the trait altering her method. Present and tonally coherent but ornamental; easily swappable with "simple" or "unadorned."</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Contain" is named in paragraph 3 (husband's teaching: carving was a way to "contain" the chaos of life) and enacted in the carving sequence (paragraphs 5–6). The final paragraph reprises it: "a way to contain the uncontainable." The action drives the middle beat (shaping raw emotion into the lion) and charges the ending image. However, "contain" could be replaced with "hold," "shape," or "capture" without structural loss. Present in setup, development, and payoff; shapes one key turn but lacks irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Through crystallized time" is mentioned in paragraph 4 ("the method she'd chosen to process her grief: through crystallized time") and linked to the mosaic metaphor. It does not shape Clara's carving technique or appear at closure; the method is stated rather than dramatized. Ornamental concept without on-page mechanics or beat involvement.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The rain-beaded skylight loft is anchored in the opening line, recurs in sensory beats (slanted glass, draftless room, rain-streaked windowsill), and provides the placement site for the lion at closure ("fractured light over its surface"). The loft's "rust-hued peace" and "bubble where past and present coexisted" frame the reflective mood and enable the carving session. Setup, development, and payoff present; the windowsill charges the final image. Strong integration but more atmospheric than tactical.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"While the kettle boils" is invoked in the opening (paragraph 2: "while the kettle boiled, she'd decided it was time") and the kettle whistles in paragraph 4, but by paragraph 7 it "had long since gone cold" without creating urgency. The frame is decorative rather than a live clock that tightens decisions. Mentioned in setup and middle but does not constrain the carving pace or tactics. Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"To harvest lessons from loss" is named in paragraph 4 and drives Clara's choice to carve the lion as a vessel for memory (paragraph 7: "She'd harvested what she came for: not closure, but understanding"). The motivation initiates the sequence and is fulfilled at closure. However, it is primarily told through summary rather than dramatized through friction or conflicting wants. Present in setup and payoff with one clear turn; lacks visible cost or competing desire.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Rust-hued peace" is named in paragraph 3 and recurs in the final paragraph ("in the rust-hued peace of the loft, that was enough"). The tone—contemplative, elegiac, post-storm calm—is coherent across beats and colors the closure image (candle flame, raindrops as stars). However, the tone remains static; no modulation under pressure or tonal shift that charges the ending. Present in setup and payoff with consistent mood but lacks dynamic reweighting.</comment>
