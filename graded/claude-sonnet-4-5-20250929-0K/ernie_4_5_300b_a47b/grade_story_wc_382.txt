<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation (learning building language) is present but remains abstract; his choices at closure (following her, speaking to the library) feel reactive rather than driven by visible internal contradiction. The woman's character is more vivid through selective gesture ("patience… nimbleness"), but both figures lack embodied emotion under pressure—the climactic moment when he "lets the words rise… from his bones" is asserted rather than dramatically earned through prior micro-choices that show cost. Internal states are told cleanly but never contradict each other in scene, flattening the arc.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph; the piece unfolds as a single continuous scene with clear causal steps (note → meeting → revelation → ritual). The closure lands on the page (the library answers), but the cost remains abstract—what Elias has forfeited or risked by "lying to the building" is asserted in dialogue rather than shown through a visible forfeiture or tactical consequence. The inferred lens is Causal, and linkage holds, but the final beat's pressure is conceptual rather than materially legible, capping the band.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The rooftop garden is anchored with vivid, POV-filtered detail (wisteria, cracked pavers, string lights) and the meteor shower timestamps the ritual. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or alter tactics—Elias and the woman could enact the climax in any library space. The dome's glass panels and glowing seal charge the visual field but remain postcard elements rather than pressure levers, missing the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake (unlocking the seal's power) is signaled early and tightens once when she reveals the century-cycle constraint. The final action (speaking the building's language) narrows options on the page, but the cost of "lying to the building" is declared rather than shown as a trade-off or visible forfeiture—no prior resource, relationship, or belief is spent. Agency at closure reads reactive (she urges, he complies) rather than protagonist-driven, and coincidence (meteor shower timing) enables rather than complicates.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The theme of agreed-upon lies and truth's fleeting nature emerges through dialogue and the seal's mechanics, but the final moment offers a stated moral ("we lie to the building") rather than a non-literal image that reweights prior material. The line "Like truth" and the closing voice-answer summarize rather than charge the ending with felt ambiguity. The particulars (sugar-borrowing sessions, architect's journal) enrich texture but do not converge into a resonant final answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-person limited on Elias; distance control is clean with no head-hopping. Diction is controlled and voice-specific ("the currency of their trade"), and dialogue carries subtext ("You're interrogating me… with silence"). However, peak beats lean on filter verbs and declarative interiority ("A chill ran down his spine") rather than embodied perception under stress, slightly dulling immediacy. No multi-POV issues; the piece remains coherent throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, information density is high, and clarity holds throughout. Minor scaffold appears in the opening ("his specialty the dialects of stone and timber—the forgotten tongues of buildings") where apposition restates rather than advances. The climactic beat ("let the words rise, not from his throat, but from his bones") is vivid but edges toward elevated register for a moment of peak stress. No loops or major artifacts touch closure; line-level control is strong.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The core premise (building language, animate architecture) is familiar but executed with specific detail (desk seal engravings, Leonid timing, architect-as-guardian). The transformation of "agreed-upon lies" from historical fictions to a ritual speech-act offers a modest inflection. However, the emotional arc and plot structure (mentor reveals hidden truth, novice performs climactic ritual) follow a recognizable template, and the final image (library answers) is prefigured by prior lore rather than arising from character-specific stakes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias Voss is present throughout as the focalizer and makes the closure choice (speaking the building's language), but his decisions feel prompted by the woman rather than arising from his own contradiction or forfeited alternative. His specialty (dead language tutor) frames the stakes and payoff, giving him causal relevance across setup, middle, and ending. However, his agency at the peak beat is reactive, capping the score in the mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The antique desk seal appears in the opening (brought to the meeting), is examined on the stone table, and is placed on the dome floor where it glows and triggers the library's response. It is handled in three distinct beats and its engravings shift meaning from "symbols no scholar had deciphered" to a functional key. However, no visible cost is tied to using it—no forfeiture, no tradeoff—so it remains essential but not charged with price, capping the band below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The concept of agreed-upon lies shapes stakes explicitly: the woman explains their prior historical fictions, and the climactic act is "we lie to the building." It appears in setup (the cryptic note), development (the tea-session backstory), and closure (the ritual speech). However, the lies themselves do not constrain an on-page choice or impose visible cost—they are discussed rather than dramatized as a tactical dilemma. Present and causal, but not charged with tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Patiently nimble" is attributed to the woman in one descriptive beat ("her patience… nimbleness") and echoed once in Elias's reflection, but it does not constrain or enable an on-page action with cost. It functions as characterization flavor rather than a tactical lever. Present and logically consistent, but ornamental—easily replaceable with another descriptor without altering the plot.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Interrogation appears explicitly ("You're interrogating me… with silence") and implicitly (Elias asks three direct questions across the scene). However, it does not create a major turn—the woman volunteers revelations without resistance, and Elias's questions function as exposition prompts rather than pressure tactics. Present in setup and middle, but swappable with straightforward conversation; does not shape closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Borrowing sugar that turns into weekly tea sessions is recounted in one dialogue beat as the origin of their agreed-upon lies and the basis for trust. It is signaled as backstory and primes the closure (trust enables the ritual collaboration), but it is summarized rather than dramatized—no on-page scene or micro-choice tied to those sessions. Present and causal for trust-building, but told-only, capping the score in the mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The rooftop garden during a meteor shower is anchored early, provides vivid sensory detail (wisteria, string lights, meteor streaks), and timestamps the ritual with the Leonid constraint. The setting is present in setup, middle, and closure. However, it does not constrain a choice or alter tactics—the characters could perform the ritual in any library space. The meteor shower is a coincidence that enables rather than complicates, limiting causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>N/A</grade>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The motivation to learn the language of old buildings is signaled early (Elias's specialty), recurs in his questions about the building's history, and is fulfilled at closure when he speaks the building's language. It is present across all three gates. However, it is not dramatized through conflicting wants or visible cost—Elias does not forfeit an alternative desire or face friction between his goal and another value. Essential but not charged with tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mysterious familiarity is established through the string-light blur, the woman's cryptic note, and Elias's recognition of "her patience," then sustained through revelations that reframe known history. The tone modulates subtly (from waiting to revelation to ritual urgency) and charges the final image (the familiar library now answers). Coherent and purposeful, with a resonant shift at closure, though the effect is gentle rather than decisive.</comment>
