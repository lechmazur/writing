<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lira's motivation to explore the caves is clear and her psychometry trait is established, but her internal experience remains somewhat generic—"felt a prickle of curiosity," "hands trembling." The final realization ("she'd tasted the edge of the unknowable") reads as abstract epiphany rather than embodied contradiction. The choice to collect samples and leave is credible but lacks visible cost that forecloses a path; she simply returns enriched, with no dramatized renunciation or struggle that alters her stance on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—density increases through the descent, psychometry flashes, and lagoon encounter, building to a final image of the compass and jars. Closure reads as Conceptual Repricing: "the absence of [answers]" and "mysteries meant to stay unsolved" reweight the premise. Cost is conceptual (hunger for more, acceptance of the unknowable) but legible. One minor orientation slip: "after the factory shut down" anchors time early, but the connection between factory waste and the lagoon's purity could be more causally explicit in the middle beats.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The subterranean lagoon is vividly rendered—"black and still, reflecting the jagged ceiling like a mirror," "soft silt"—and the setting constrains movement (narrow fissure, sloping tunnel). The compass's pull provides spatial choreography. The lagoon's untouched petrichor directly charges the closure by offering "something ancient, almost sentient" that Lira collects and labels, making environment integral to the final image. Minor: the workshop at the end is efficient but receives less sensory grounding than the cave.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: finding untouched petrichor and understanding the expedition's fate. The descent tightens options (narrow fissure, compass pull, psychometry visions), and the lagoon encounter deepens knowledge of "where explanations fail." However, escalation is more accumulative than decisively narrowing—Lira faces no live choice between competing goods or immediate cost. The compass dropping and lagoon rippling complicate but do not force a renunciation; she simply collects samples and leaves, so agency at closure is observational rather than a foregrounded trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme—mysteries that resist explanation, the edge of the unknowable—emerges through concrete particulars: the spinning compass, psychometry flashes, the lagoon's indifferent presence. "Hinged awakenings" and "place where explanations fail" are somewhat prompt-literal but integrated into action. The final image of labeled jars and the silent compass offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Minor deduction: "curiosity outlived certainty" in the closing beats edges toward thematic statement rather than pure image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited on Lira throughout. Perceptual signature is present—"petrichor collector" lens colors her noticing—but diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("threshold," "indifferent, like a mountain observing a moth") that reads slightly above her established voice. Psychic distance is consistent; psychometry sequences are clearly cued. The compass and expedition are filtered through her touch and intuition without head-hopping. Minor: "sensibly eccentric" is told rather than embodied in speech or micro-choice early.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is clear and propulsive with strong specificity: "jagged ceiling like a mirror," "soft silt," "low, endless hum." Sentence rhythm varies purposefully. One paraphrase loop: "The compass had been left behind, its needle frozen" closely echoes earlier compass descriptions without new pressure. Minor filter-verb cluster in the psychometry beat ("felt the expedition's fear, their excitement, their confusion") slightly dulls immediacy. No major scaffold or template cadence; information density is high.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The petrichor-collector premise is fresh and the psychometry method adds specificity. However, the lost-expedition mystery and subterranean-lagoon discovery follow a recognizable template (character seeks forgotten place, finds eerie remnant, returns changed). The "place where explanations fail" as destination is conceptually interesting but not transformed through a non-obvious moral calculus or lived detail that makes it irreplaceable. The emotional arc—curiosity rewarded with ambiguous knowledge—feels earned but not startlingly original.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Petrichor collector: establishes motivation and frames her sensory focus throughout. She catalogs samples, uses the skill to decide to delve, collects lagoon air/water at the climax, and labels jars at closure. Present in setup, middle (decision to explore), and ending (jars on shelf). The occupation drives two beats (cataloging triggers discovery; collection at lagoon) and charges the final image. Cost is conceptual (hunger for the unknowable) rather than a visible trade-off tied specifically to *being* a collector, so score in mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lost expedition compass: introduced early (wedged between jars), guides the descent (needle locking, growing heavier), and is present at closure (silent, on desk, "waiting for the next delve"). It appears in at least three beats: discovery, navigation, and the lagoon drop/spin that signals the threshold. The compass's changing behavior (lazy spin → locked → violent spin → silent) tracks escalation and charges the final image. Strong integration; the exact object's shifting states matter causally and thematically.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Hinged awakenings: mentioned once in narration ("the kind of revelation that comes not in a flash but in stages") and echoed thematically in the gradual descent and psychometry flashes. It does not constrain a choice or alter tactics on the page—Lira's approach is linear exploration, not a staged decision process. Present as theme but does not reshape options or pressure. Functional but replaceable; the story works identically without the concept label.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Sensibly eccentric: told in exposition ("Her sensibly eccentric nature made her neighbors chuckle") but not dramatized through an on-page choice where the trait constrains or enables action with visible cost. The attribute could describe her hobby but does not force a trade-off or complicate her descent. Label-only use; no causal work in middle beats or closure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Delve: the entire middle act is the descent into the cliffs, and the action generates all key turns—psychometry intensifies in the tunnel, the lagoon encounter provides the core discovery, the compass drop/lagoon ripple complicate. Present in setup (decision), middle (journey), and ending (return with samples). Removing the delve collapses the narrative; the action is structurally indispensable. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Psychometry reading: signaled early ("a skill she'd honed"), used in the tunnel ("felt the expedition's fear"), and again at the ledge ("surged—she saw flashes"). It shapes two beats (tunnel visions, ledge insight) and provides knowledge that reweights the mystery. However, the method does not constrain a tactic or force a choice—it delivers information passively. Present across beats but not causally pressured; the same revelations could occur via inscription or found journal with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Subterranean lagoon beneath limestone cliffs: destination and climax location. The lagoon's "untouched petrichor," "black and still" surface, and defiance of gravity create the core discovery. The setting supplies the samples Lira collects (air, water) and the presence that complicates (rippling surface, indifferent hum). Present in setup (mentioned as goal), middle (approach), and ending (labeled jars reference it). The exact environment's properties are indispensable to closure; remove it and the story's logic fails.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>After the factory shuts down: anchors timeframe early ("petrichor grew sharper") and primes the lagoon's contrast (waste never seeped there). Mentioned at closure in jar label. However, the factory's absence does not tighten a decision or alter tactics on the page—Lira's exploration proceeds identically whether the factory is active or shut. Functional context but easily swappable with any post-industrial marker; no causal pressure in middle beats.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>To find the place where explanations fail: stated motivation ("You were looking for the place where explanations fail") and echoed at closure ("the absence of [answers]"). Drives the decision to delve and frames the lagoon encounter. However, the desire is more told than conflicted—Lira faces no on-page friction between wanting mystery and needing safety or certainty. Present in setup, middle (search), and ending (realization), so two-gate participation, but cost is conceptual rather than a visible want-versus-fear trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Resonant hush: established early ("resonant hush, the kind of silence that amplifies the smallest sound"), sustained in the cavern and lagoon, and returns at closure ("in the quiet, between heartbeats, she could almost hear the lagoon's low, endless hum"). Tone modulates appropriately—chuckles at the start, eerie pressure in the cave, contemplative at the end—and charges the final image. Coherent through turns; the hush reweights the stake by framing mystery as sonic and spatial. Strong tonal integration.</comment>
