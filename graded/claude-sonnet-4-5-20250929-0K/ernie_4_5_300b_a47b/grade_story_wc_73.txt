<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kael's interior is heavily reflective and label-heavy ("grim optimist," "balancedly daring"), but his decision to rupture the step demonstrates motivated action under pressure. The lover backstory provides motivation yet remains abstract—"the texture of that loss" reads as conceptual more than embodied. The final renunciation ("Let them be") carries visible cost (relinquishing the dice) and feels earned by his arc. Therapy-adjacent phrasing ("haunted by the ghost," "addicted to") weakens interiority at key moments, but the core choice holds.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens inferred as Accumulative/Textural: the staircase loops and proofs accumulate until the rupture crystallizes perpetual motion, achieving a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). Orientation anchors (who, where, what) land within ~100 words. The rupture beat narrows his quest from possession to acknowledgment, and the final image reweights the opening obsession with visible cost (the dice orbit beyond reach). One meaningful tightening is present and sufficient for this length; closure lands with felt cost on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The infinite staircase constrains movement (steps vanish/reappear), the chipped die functions as talisman and differentiator, and the dice orbit charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clear (seventh loop, 14th loop, edge of step), and sensory detail ("ozone and regret," "metallic groan") is selective and purposeful. The setting directly enables the rupture action and the perpetual-motion outcome, meeting the 9+ gate test for constraint and closure participation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early: capture perpetual motion to mirror lost love. The rupture (slamming his fist) is an on-page protagonist action that transforms the system, creating the dice orbit—one meaningful tightening with visible cost (he can no longer touch them). Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens; the proofs, the loops, and the final renunciation all deepen his engagement with the impossibility. The ending reweights his goal from possession to acceptance, and the price is legible in "they danced out of reach."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme (holding loss without possessing it) emerges from the dice orbit and Kael's final whisper, avoiding overt moralizing. The chipped die as "flaw gleaming like a star" and the space-between-dice image resist easy reduction. However, "the texture of his missed opportunity" and "the confinement was still boundless" lean toward prompt-echo abstraction rather than fully earning resonance through scene pressure. The final image offers a non-literal answer but edges close to thematic statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>POV is stable third-close; perceptual signature is present (numbers, proofs, the taste of "ozone and regret"). Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("Möbius strip of time and space," "the texture of that loss") that feels slightly imposed rather than voice-organic. Filter verbs ("he'd traced," "he'd calculated") accumulate but remain legible. Dialogue is sparse and functional ("Not enough," "Let them be"), carrying goal and subtext. The voice is distinct but not fully pressure-tested under peak stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Clarity and momentum are generally strong, but figurative density is high without consistent payoff: "stone that shimmered like aged parchment," "a wound that heals by bleeding forever," "like a deck of cards." The rupture beat is vivid and propulsive. Template cadence appears in the backstory ("he'd come…he'd calculated…he'd memorized…he'd tested"), and "the texture of" recurs as a conceptual placeholder. Proofread clean; no major loops, but overwriting slightly dulls the closure paragraph.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The infinite-staircase + perpetual-motion synthesis is conceptually clear but not wholly fresh (echoes Escher, Sisyphus). The chipped vs. smooth die distinction and the rupture-as-solution offer specificity. The ending avoids sentimentality and commits to the premise's logic. However, the grim-optimist seeker and the metaphor-for-loss frame feel template-adjacent; transformation through lived detail is present but modest. Risk-taking is restrained; the piece executes competently within its conceptual bounds without bold structural or perspectival leaps.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Kael (grim optimist) is established early and his optimism ("grim but satisfied") frames the closure. His key choice—rupturing the step—demonstrates the trait, though "grim optimist" functions more as label than lived contradiction. Present in setup, middle (the rupture), and ending; the trait enables the action and charges the final smile. Swappable with "determined seeker" or similar without major loss, limiting irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Pair of dice (one chipped) appears in four beats: opening (clutched, backstory), 14th loop (rolled to four), rupture (begins to spin), and closure (orbiting, chipped die gleaming). The chipped flaw differentiates and the smooth die's return creates symmetry. The orbit is the story's key image and directly shapes the closure. Removing the dice would collapse the perpetual-motion proof and the final renunciation. High causal pressure and closure linkage; nears indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Perpetual motion is the dominant stake from paragraph one, explicitly sought and achieved on-page. It structures Kael's method (mathematical proofs), his rupture action, and the dice orbit—the story's climactic image. The concept is not merely thematic; it changes options (he ruptures to induce it) and the ending reweights his relationship to it (from possession to acceptance). Setup, development, and payoff all present; causal pressure high. Swappable with "eternal loop" or similar abstraction only with significant rewrites.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Balancedly daring" is told in paragraph one ("His balancedly daring nature let him tread the line") and applied to the rupture choice, but the trait is label-only and does not visibly constrain or trade off in the rupture scene itself. The 42.7% calculation gestures at balance, but the action reads as singular risk without on-page cost tied to this specific attribute. Functional mention but replaceable with "determined" or "risk-tolerant." Missing middle development as lived friction.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Rupture is the story's climactic action: Kael slams his fist, the step ruptures, and the dice orbit is born. This turn redefines his quest from possession to witnessing. Setup (proofs describe rupture), development (he positions himself), and payoff (the orbit persists, charging the ending) all present. Removing rupture collapses the perpetual-motion proof and the final image. High causal pressure, closure linkage, and specificity; nearly indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Mathematical proofs appear in three beats: Kael's charcoal equations on walls, the 42.7% figure, and the crumpled proof detailing rupture mechanics. The method shapes his attempt (he follows the proof's logic to rupture the step). However, the proofs are told rather than shown; we never see him calculate or revise on the page, only that he "had memorized" them. Setup and middle planning present; payoff indirect (rupture succeeds per the proof). Functional but summary-dominant; demonstration would elevate.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Infinite staircase frames every beat: steps vanish/reappear (constrains movement), loops organize progression (seventh, 14th), and the step's rupture is the key action. The setting is indispensable; removing it collapses the perpetual-motion frame and the spatial logic of the orbit. Setup, development (breathing structure pressures Kael), and payoff (staircase shifts as dice orbit) all present. High causal involvement and closure linkage; the "Möbius strip" detail adds specificity. Setting as constraint and closure participant.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>N/A</grade>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Motivation (capture texture of missed opportunity) is established early and drives every beat: seeking perpetual motion as analogue, the proofs, the rupture, and the final renunciation. The lover backstory primes the quest, and the ending explicitly reweights it ("not something to possess—it was the space between"). Setup, development, and payoff present. However, "texture of a missed opportunity" remains abstract; the lover is summary-only (no scene friction). Causal linkage strong; embodiment modest. Functional across arc but not irreplaceable phrasing.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Tone (boundless confinement) is coherent throughout: infinite staircase that traps, endless motion within finite orbit, "confinement was still boundless" at closure. Diction and imagery sustain the paradox (steps that breathe, orbit that refuses to stop). The tone charges the final image (Kael walking, dice shrinking to pinpricks). Setup, development, and payoff present; modulation occurs (exhaustion to satisfaction) without breaking coherence. Strong closure linkage; removing the tone frame would flatten the thematic charge.</comment>
