<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is declared but not contradicted or tested under pressure—she sorts buttons and receives a prophecy without any choice that forecloses a path. Interiority leans heavily on stock phrasing: "quietly inspired, her mind a library of half-remembered tales," "her heart light." The final turn to cataloging more buttons feels arbitrary rather than earned by prior causality, and no visible cost attends her "raw possibility." Embodied emotion is minimal; the hourglass functions as prop rather than constraint.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who and where within the first paragraph, but causality is thin: Mara seeks the jar, finds it easily, hears its message, and accepts it without complication. The ending offers no decisive change—she already believed prophecies were malleable, and the canyon's echo merely confirms this. Charged Poise requires undeniable pressure at closure; here the final image (cataloging buttons again) reads as static reprise without reweighting prior stakes or visible cost. The lens appears Accumulative but does not deepen or shift at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The amber warehouse, cliffs, and canyon are vividly sketched with selective sensory detail (dust, groaning beams, sawdust carpet). The jar and buttons constrain Mara's method—she must sort to unscramble—and the warehouse's labyrinth frames the search. However, spatial choreography is light (she moves from center to far corner without complication), and the setting does not pressure a choice at closure. The final window view charges the ending image moderately but does not alter tactics or cost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—spinning prophecy into possibility—is signaled early but never tested. No reversal or tightening narrows options; Mara encounters no obstacle (the jar is found, the echo is heard, the wisdom is received). The button-sorting is framed as method but does not escalate pressure or force a trade-off. The ending restates her prior belief without demonstrating a visible price paid or a path foreclosed. Escalation is absent under any lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars (hourglass sand, buttons as memory anchors, canyon voices as shared wisdom) and avoids overt moralizing. The final image—"The future isn't a line to be followed but a field to be planted"—offers a resonant answer but leans close to articulated thesis. Subtext operates in the jar's swirl and the warehouse's "unearthed silence," yet no irony or counter-reading complicates the resolution. The thematic question is posed and answered cleanly, without ambiguity or felt cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Voice is distinct with purposeful diction ("hourglass turner," "canyon echo in a jar," "unearthed silence") and controlled psychic distance. POV remains stable in third-limited. However, elevated register occasionally drifts into abstraction ("spin a prophecy into raw possibility," "raw possibility was hers to spin") that feels more thematic than character-particular. Perceptual signature is present but generic—Mara notices dust, glass, buttons—without idiosyncratic bias. No dialogue appears. Rhythm modulates but does not compress under stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Syntax varies and figurative language is controlled without muddle. Minor scaffold appears: "She'd always been quietly inspired" restates the attribute rather than dramatizing it, and "The hourglass turner had always believed" summarizes rather than showing the belief tested. Paraphrase loop: "quietly inspired" recurs as "quiet inspiration blooming" without added pressure. Template cadence is avoided. Clarity is high, but information density dips in expository blocks. Propulsion stalls mid-story as Mara sorts buttons without complication.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The core premise—hourglass turner decodes a canyon echo via button-sorting—offers a lyrical synthesis but leans on metaphor tokens (hourglass, jar, buttons) that remain ornamental. The button method is introduced and resolved without transformation or surprise. Emotional arc and plot would function unchanged if Mara decoded the jar via another symbolic catalog. The final image recycles the opening belief without fresh inflection. Voice is competent but does not take bold structural or perspectival risk.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Mara appears throughout but her choices do not create key turns—she seeks, finds, sorts, and accepts without complication. The decision to catalog more buttons at the end is stated, not tested under pressure. Present but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The jar appears in the search beat, the listening beat, and the final window beat. Its echo resolves into words that restate theme. It is handled and its presence charges the ending image, but the jar does not narrow options or impose cost—it simply delivers wisdom. Functional with moderate closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Shared wisdom is thematized in the jar's chorus and the buttons' histories, but it does not shape on-page tactics or force a choice. The concept is illustrated rather than pressure-tested. Logically present, not causal.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Quietly inspired" is labeled twice and mentioned as "quiet inspiration blooming" at the end, but it does not constrain or enable a specific action with visible cost. The trait exists as description without tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Unscramble" appears in the search motivation and the button-sorting method. The sorting is dramatized, but the unscrambling does not create a turn—the jar's message is received without complication. The action is functional but does not redefine options at closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Button-cataloging is signaled early, demonstrated in the sorting beat, and returns in the final line. The method matters (Mara uses it to understand the jar), and its mechanics are shown. However, it does not shape the middle attempt or alter the outcome—wisdom arrives independently. Functional with purposeful reprise.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The amber warehouse beneath cliffs frames the search and supplies the jar and buttons. The labyrinth complicates access slightly (far corner), and the window provides the final image anchor. Setting enables but does not pressure a choice. Micro-setting (jar, buttons) is more active than the warehouse itself.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"As the truth unravels" appears as a transition marker midway. Time is not tracked as a tightening constraint—Mara's hourglass trickles but does not impose urgency. The phrase is present but does not alter tactics or accelerate decisions.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>Mara's desire to spin prophecy into possibility is declared in paragraph one and restated at closure. The motivation is clear but not conflicted—no friction between want and cost appears. It guides the search but does not force a choice with visible price.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Unearthed silence" is established early, deepens mid-story ("the warehouse seemed to hold its breath"), and modulates when the echo surges. Tone coheres and charges the final image moderately, though it does not shift under pressure or create irony. Functional with purposeful texture.</comment>
