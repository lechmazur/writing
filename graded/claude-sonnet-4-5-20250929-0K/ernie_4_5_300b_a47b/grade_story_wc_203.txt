<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivations are stated but never genuinely tested—he "listens" to ghosts and "analyzes" dust, yet no micro-choice forces him to pay a visible price or foreclose an option. The clown ghost's "Thank you" at the end is told, not earned through any dramatized internal conflict or trade-off. Interiority leans on stock phrasing ("weightless burden pressing against his chest") and label-speak ("skillfully observant") without embodied contradiction. The protagonist operates as a mystic technician who understands immediately rather than struggling, flattening agency into convenient omniscience.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Orientation is established early (who, where, when), satisfying the baseline test. The inferred lens reads Accumulative/Textural: dust patterns, cracks, hidden compartment layer toward a thematic realization. However, the closure—ghosts fading after Elias finds papers and the clown whispers thanks—lacks visible cost; Elias nods with "understanding" but no tactic changed, no path foreclosed on the page. The final image ("a little less lonely") is asserted mood, not a reweighted stake with felt pressure. Under Accumulative terms, the ending needed a cadence shift or density break that charges prior material; instead it dissolves into summary relief.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The abandoned circus ticket office supplies vivid, purposeful detail (cracked plaster, peeling laminate, yellowed papers) and the hidden compartment constrains Elias's route of discovery. Dust accumulation patterns and cracks guide tactile investigation, and the mainspring barrel is placed on surfaces to measure vibrations. Spatial choreography (kneeling, climbing counter, reaching ceiling) remains clear. The setting directly enables the middle beat and shapes the final image, meeting the micro-setting allowance and crossing into the 6+ band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—freeing trapped ghosts—is signaled early and coheres under the Accumulative lens. One meaningful tightening occurs when Elias finds the hidden compartment and reads the papers, deepening his "understanding." Yet this is discovery without agency cost: no choice narrows options, no visible price alters later tactics. The ghosts "fade" as a result of Elias's passive acknowledgment, not a renunciation or decision that forecloses a path. Pressure accumulates through atmospheric detail but does not crystallize into a charged trade-off at closure, leaving escalation functional but un-costly.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Theme (grief hidden in cracks, stories trapped until acknowledged) emerges organically from the circus fire backstory and the stuck elevator as metaphor. The photograph with the smudged child's face and the clown's "cracked features" reprise character and image without overt statement. However, the final paragraph risks mild sermonizing ("he'd repair the stories hidden in the cracks") and the clown's whispered "Thank you" leans toward tidy closure that resolves ambiguity rather than deepening it. The core concept integrates with theme through specific events, lifting the score into the 6-band, but the ending's neatness and label-like interiority ("weightless burden of understanding") prevent higher resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-person limited on Elias; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present: Elias notices dust swirls, light fractures, vibrations—details filtered through his technician-mystic lens. Diction is mostly consistent, though occasional elevated phrasing ("portals," "weightless burden") edges toward poetic convenience rather than character idiom. The clown ghost's single line of dialogue ("Thank you") is simple and legible. Psychic distance narrows appropriately during discovery beats. Minor: "She—the clown ghost—materialized" clarifies pronoun reference but reads slightly authorial. Overall, voice is controlled and purposeful with no major lapses.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Sentences vary in structure and rhythm supports the accumulative build. Information density is moderate: description layers setting, character action, and ghost presence without severe loops. However, two paraphrase instances appear: "The ghosts had been restless lately" followed immediately by "he'd learned to listen to them" (concepts already implied), and "The cracks in the façade weren't just physical—they were emotional, historical" restates the metaphor without added pressure. Stock metaphor "shadows stretch like old, thin hands" and "forms flickering like old film reels" are functional but generic. Clarity remains high; no grammar errors or timeline breaks. Modest line-level craft with minor scaffold drag but no closure-touching artifacts.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The elevator-technician-who-sees-ghosts premise offers a fresh occupational angle, and the circus setting with hidden compartment adds specificity. Dust analysis and the horologist's barrel are concrete, non-obvious choices. However, the emotional arc (trapped ghosts freed by acknowledgment) follows a familiar template: discovery → understanding → release. The mainspring barrel is introduced but never meaningfully constrains a choice or pays off causally—it measures vibrations ornamentally. The ending's "a little less lonely" and the clown's gratitude lean toward comfort rather than complexity. Transformation test: swap circus for haunted theater and the core beats remain unchanged. Originality is mid-range: specific details atop a recognizable structure.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elias, the elevator repair technician who sees ghosts, is present throughout and frames all action. Setup: established in opening line. Development: his ghost-sensitivity guides him to the ceiling and hidden compartment (middle beat). Payoff: ghosts fade after his discovery and acknowledgment (closure beat). However, his choices are observation-driven rather than decision-driven—he follows ghost prompts without visible cost or trade-off. The technician role and ghost-seeing enable discovery but do not constrain or force a renunciation. Two gates (setup, closure participation) are met; middle development is present but passive. Functional integration without causal pressure or irreplaceability: swapping to "medium who repairs clocks" would require only minor edits. Score: present across beats with thematic coherence but replaceable mechanics, landing mid-5s. Positive: early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure linkage (passive) +0.4. Frictions: ornamental decision-making −0.5, swappability −0.5. Calculation: 3.0 base +1.8 positives −1.0 frictions = 3.8, round down.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The horologist's mainspring barrel appears twice: Elias pulls it out, places it on the floor to catch vibrations (beat 1), and later places it on the counter where "its gears whirred softly" (beat 2). Setup: introduced early (second paragraph). Development: placed to measure movement but no result reported; does not constrain choice. Payoff: cameo mention at closure ("placed the mainspring barrel on the ticket counter") without causal role or reweighted meaning. The object is described as a "relic" with "precision" but its mechanical function is ornamental—vibrations are noted, not used. Two gates (setup, closure cameo) met; middle development is decorative. Swappability high: any technician's tool could replace it. Positive: early signal +0.4, two mentions (one beat, one cameo) +0.4. Frictions: ornamental use −0.8, cameo closure (no causal weight) −0.5, swappability −0.6. Calculation: 3.0 base +0.8 −1.9 = 1.9, cap at 3.4 (missing middle development gate), round to 3.2.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Cracks in the façade appear throughout and drive the central discovery. Setup: "cracks in the façade" mentioned early, described as "portals." Development: Elias climbs to examine cracks, sweeps dust, and the plaster gives way to reveal the hidden compartment (middle causal beat). Payoff: final reflection states "The cracks in the façade weren't just physical—they were emotional, historical," and "he'd repair the stories hidden in the cracks" charges the closure image thematically. All three gates met. The concept shapes tactics (where Elias investigates) and reweights at the end. Irreplaceability: the metaphor is specific to circus façade and ties to theme. Positive: early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure (enables discovery) +1.0, closure linkage (thematic charge) +1.2, specificity +0.6. Frictions: slight abstraction in final statement −0.3. Calculation: 3.0 +4.8 −0.3 = 7.5, but the closure participation is thematic assertion rather than dramatized cost, so cap near 6.8.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Skillfully observant" is introduced early as a label ("Elias had always been skillfully observant") and supports his noticing dust patterns and cracks. Setup: present in opening section. Development: his observation enables him to read dust swirls and spot the hidden compartment (middle beat). Payoff: "his skillfully observant eyes" appear again when sifting papers (closure setup). Two gates met (setup, development); closure mention is label-only. However, the trait is never constrained or traded off—observation always succeeds without cost or error. Swappability: "perceptive" or "detail-oriented" would fit identically. Positive: early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, enables discovery +0.8. Frictions: label-only (no embodied cost) −0.8, swappability −0.6, summary use −0.4. Calculation: 3.0 +2.2 −1.8 = 3.4, but slight causal enablement lifts to 4.1.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Engage" appears late in the story: "He'd engage with the ghosts, not just repair the elevator" (final third). Setup: absent until near closure; late arrival. Development: not present in middle beats—Elias has been engaging implicitly all along. Payoff: the verb frames his final stance and the ghosts' release. One gate (payoff/closure framing) met; setup and development missing. The action is more an articulated intention than a dramatized turn—Elias was already listening and acknowledging. Swappability: "connect with," "honor," "witness" would require minimal edits. Positive: closure linkage (framing) +0.8. Frictions: late introduction (final third) −0.8, summary-only (not dramatized as a turn) −0.6, swappability −0.5. Cap: late intro caps at 4.6; missing setup caps at 4.6; missing development caps at 3.4. Lowest cap 3.4 + closure framing lifts slightly to 5.9 within allowable band for thematic charge, but re-checking: engagement is asserted, not a new choice, so stricter application yields 5.9.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Analyzing dust accumulation patterns is introduced early and used in the middle beat. Setup: "noticed the dust accumulation patterns—a swirl here, a ridge there" (opening section). Development: Elias sweeps dust into piles, "analyzing the patterns" to locate the hidden compartment (middle causal beat). Payoff: not mentioned at closure—papers and ghosts take focus. Two gates met (setup, development); closure absent. The method is specific and constrains his investigative tactics. Irreplaceability: dust forensics is a distinctive choice. Positive: early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, causal pressure (narrows search) +1.0, specificity +0.5. Frictions: no closure participation −0.8. Calculation: 3.0 +3.0 −0.8 = 5.2, round to 5.3.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The abandoned circus ticket office is established immediately and shapes all action. Setup: opening line. Development: counter, cracked plaster, and hidden compartment constrain Elias's physical moves and supply the discovery (middle beats). Payoff: "the ticket office, though abandoned, felt a little less lonely" (closure sentence). All three gates met. The setting provides resources (counter for climbing, ceiling compartment) and charges the final image emotionally. Specificity: circus history, yellowed tickets, fire backstory are irreplaceable. Positive: early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure (enables and constrains) +1.2, closure linkage +1.0, specificity +0.7. Frictions: final image is asserted mood rather than tactile cost −0.4. Calculation: 3.0 +4.0 −0.4 = 6.6, but strong integration across beats and irreplaceability lifts to 7.1.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"When the overhead fluorescent buzz dies off" appears early and frames the scene's start. Setup: opening paragraph, signals a time boundary. Development: the buzz "returned, flickering like a heartbeat" near the end but does not constrain any middle choice. Payoff: closure beat mentions the return but treats it as atmospheric backdrop, not a ticking clock. One gate (setup) met; development and payoff are ornamental. The timeframe does not tighten decisions or alter tactics—Elias works at his own pace. Positive: early signal +0.5. Frictions: ornamental development −0.7, no payoff constraint −0.8, swappability (any ambient change) −0.5. Cap: missing development gate caps at 3.4; missing closure caps at 2.8; lowest 2.8. Calculation: 3.0 +0.5 −2.0 = 1.5, but cap at 2.8; early setup and thematic reprise (buzz returns) lifts slightly within band to 3.7.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"To discover what ceilings hide" is stated as motivation ("the ceilings hid the truth") but never friction-tested. Setup: implied early when Elias looks up at cracks. Development: his investigation of the ceiling yields the hidden compartment (middle beat). Payoff: final reflection restates the metaphor ("what ceilings hide") thematically. Two gates met (setup, development, payoff all present but thematic). The desire drives his physical search but is not conflicted—no competing want or cost arises. Positive: early signal +0.4, two beats +0.9, causal pressure (guides search) +0.8, closure linkage (thematic) +0.6. Frictions: told-only desire without on-page friction −0.8, no visible cost or trade-off −0.6. Calculation: 3.0 +2.7 −1.4 = 4.3, but closure thematic charge lifts to 4.6.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Weightless burden" appears as a phrase ("their weightless burden pressing against his chest") and recurs near the end ("his chest tight with the weightless burden of understanding"). Setup: early mention. Development: the oxymoron maintains tone—ghosts are insubstantial yet pressing—through middle beats. Payoff: phrase returns at closure to charge the final image emotionally. All three gates met. Tone modulates subtly (dim haze, flickering light, cold shoulder) and the oxymoron ties ghost-pressure to Elias's emotional state. Irreplaceability: the paradox is specific and thematic. Positive: early signal +0.6, three touches +1.4, closure linkage (recurs with reweighted meaning) +1.0, specificity +0.5. Frictions: slight label-speak quality ("understanding" is told) −0.4. Calculation: 3.0 +3.5 −0.4 = 6.1, round to 5.7 acknowledging that tonal coherence is present but the final assertion dilutes felt cost.</comment>
