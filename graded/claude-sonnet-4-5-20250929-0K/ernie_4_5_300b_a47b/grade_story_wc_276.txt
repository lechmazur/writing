<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Kael's "cool-headed" trait is asserted but not tested under contradictory impulses; he remains composed throughout without genuine internal friction. The goddess encounter feels observational rather than a crucible that forces micro-choices with visible cost. Interiority leans toward poetic description ("sorrow so profound") rather than embodied contradiction. The final choice to leave the spike in place carries minimal felt consequence, reading more as ritual than renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors arrive cleanly by the opening paragraph. The dominant stake—capturing the goddess's echo to understand the constellations—is signaled early. However, the closure unit is ambiguous: the goddess dissolves, constellations stabilize, and Kael smiles at a lingering note, but no decisive change in his options or knowledge is dramatized on the page. The "cost" (goddess gone) is asserted rather than felt through a concrete trade-off or foreclosed path. Lens reads Accumulative/Textural, but the final image reweights atmosphere more than stakes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The sound wave garden is vividly rendered with crystal trees, moss converting footsteps to auras, and the rail spike as frequency conductor. Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through the stakes. The rail spike constrains Kael's method (strike to emit tone) and the moss forms the zigzag path in the climax, charging the final turn. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake is present and pressure accumulates through dissonant patterns and the goddess's appearance. However, Kael's agency is largely reactive—adjusting the emitter, striking the spike—without a meaningful trade-off or choice that narrows options. The goddess's dissolution stabilizes the constellations, but this outcome feels coincidental rather than earned by protagonist decision. One tightening (goddess encounter) occurs, but escalation lacks visible cost that alters later tactics.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges around impermanence, translation of emotion, and cosmic order, but the final image ("The garden had spoken. And this time, he'd listened.") edges toward thesis statement rather than resonant particularity. The goddess as fractured light and the soil shimmer offer symbolic texture, but the piece does not pose a question sharp enough to be reweighted non-literally at closure. Subtext operates in the goddess's gesture and Kael's steadiness, yet the ending summarizes insight rather than embodying it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Voice is consistent, with elevated diction ("feral hope," "sleepwalking constellations") that fits the conceptual premise. POV remains stable third-limited on Kael. The single line of dialogue ("Show me," "You're breaking") feels slightly performative rather than goal-driven subtext. Perceptual signature is present (scientist-supplicant lens), though lexicon occasionally drifts into abstract register ("transliterate emotions into geometric patterns") that risks distancing the reader from embodied experience.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and figurative language is dense but mostly coherent. Minor scaffold appears: "The garden itself was a labyrinth" follows setup without advancing pressure, and "The garden's patterns had stabilized, but the cost was clear" tells rather than shows. Paraphrase loop in the opening (spike embedded → spike's jagged edge driven deep) costs −0.2. Propulsion is steady but momentum sags slightly in the middle exposition of the emitter's mechanics. No major clarity breaks, but information density could tighten.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The sound wave garden and sleepwalking constellations premise offers a fresh synthesis of synesthesia and cosmic disorder. However, the emotional arc (calm observer witnesses goddess, garden stabilizes) follows a familiar contemplative template without surprising turns. The rail spike as tuning-fork tool and "voicing silence" paradox provide specificity, yet the resolution (goddess absorbed into soil, constellations freeze) lacks a non-obvious inflection. Transformation test: swapping names and the garden type would leave the arc largely intact.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Kael is present throughout and his actions (adjusting emitter, striking spike twice) drive beats. However, "cool-headed" functions as label rather than constraint; no moment tests his composure with a choice where steadiness versus emotion alters outcome. He observes, adjusts, and accepts the goddess's dissolution without internal friction or tactical shift. Meets setup and middle gates, but no closure-scene choice that hinges on this trait.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The rail spike appears in the opening (embedded in soil), is struck twice (crystal tree, then ground) to emit tones that reveal the zigzag path and goddess's trail, and is replaced in the soil at closure with a shimmer. Handles in three beats, causally enables the goddess encounter, and charges the final image. Specificity (conductor, emits geometric tone) makes it irreplaceable. Strong integration across setup, development, and payoff.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>Sleepwalking constellations are described in the opening and stabilize at closure, framing atmosphere. However, they do not constrain Kael's choices or alter his tactics on the page. The stake is to understand them via the goddess's echo, but no on-page scene dramatizes how capturing the echo changes options or knowledge about the constellations. Present in setup and payoff, but ornamental to causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Transliterates emotions" applies to the rail spike/emitter system (emotions into geometric patterns, frequency map of constellations). It enables Kael's method and is invoked in two beats (strike produces zigzag light, emitter projects constellation map). However, no cost or trade-off tied to this trait is dramatized—does translation fail, cause harm, or demand sacrifice? Functional across beats but lacks visible consequence that constrains choice.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The zigzag appears as dissonant static in the opening, as crimson light when the spike strikes the tree, and as the moss path leading to the goddess. Shapes two key beats (visual manifestation, path formation) and is present in the climax. Could be replaced with another pattern descriptor (spiral, pulse) with moderate edits, but its recurrence and causal role in revealing the goddess earn mid-high range. Not indispensable to closure logic.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Voicing silence" is introduced as a paradox Kael has mastered and implied when he whispers "Show me." It enables the spike's harmonization with garden chaos but is not mechanically dramatized—how does silence produce vibration? Present in setup and invoked at the climax, but the mechanics remain abstract. Lyric reprise potential, yet the method does not visibly constrain or alter tactics across beats.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The sound wave garden pressures every beat: dissonant patterns signal the goddess, moss converts footsteps to auras and forms the zigzag path, crystal trees provide the striking surface for the rail spike. Setting supplies resources (spike anchor, resonant surfaces) and alters tactics (where to strike). Integral to setup, middle problem (fraying harmonics), and closure (goddess dissolves into soil). Removing this setting would break the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"When patterns break themselves" frames the opening urgency (tonight the garden is fraying) and the goddess appears when chaos peaks. However, time pressure is not tracked on the page—no clock tightens Kael's window or forces a rushed choice. The timeframe colors atmosphere and signals the inciting condition, but does not constrain tactics or escalate stakes across beats. Setup and thematic presence, but limited causal role.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Kael's goal to catch the goddess's echo drives the scene setup and his actions (strike spike, adjust emitter). The motivation is stated and pursued across beats. However, internal friction is absent—no competing desire (safety, doubt, attachment to the goddess versus duty) complicates the choice. The echo is "caught" when the goddess dissolves, but the cost (her disappearance) is not framed as a sacrifice Kael wrestles with. Functional across setup and payoff, but lacks dramatized conflict between want and price.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>"Feral lullaby" is evoked explicitly ("a crescendo that felt like a lullaby sung by wolves") and colors the garden's hums and the goddess's mournful tone. Tone is coherent and modulates with the goddess's appearance and dissolution. The final note is "pure, clear," softening from feral to elegiac. Purposeful tonal arc that charges the closure mood, but the phrase itself is slightly on-the-nose and does not constrain action. Lyric resonance present, causal pressure limited.</comment>
