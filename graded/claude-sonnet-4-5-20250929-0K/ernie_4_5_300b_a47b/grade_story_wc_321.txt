<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Kael's "resiliently positive nature" is label-only until it "falters," then disappears; his final smile feels unmotivated by prior contradiction. The hourglass choice at the climax ("Okay... But you have to trust me") lacks visible internal conflict—he simply decides. Interiority relies on stock phrasing ("his resiliently positive heart swelling") and the emotional arc telescopes from wavering to tears to swelling heart without embodied progression.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second sentence; the drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural (pattern-driven ferry dissolution). The closure—ferry dissolves, passengers merge, hourglass shatters—lands on the page as a Resonant Reconfiguration, but cost is abstract: Kael loses the ferry and stands "alone," yet his final smile and deeper walk suggest no felt forfeit. The hourglass's sand "spilling outward to weave the timelines" functions as telling rather than dramatized causality, and the resolution feels authored rather than earned by prior pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The spectral grotto's bioluminescent veins and liquid starlight are vivid and purposeful, mirroring the fractured chronology and guiding Kael's radio tuning. Spatial choreography remains clear (deck, railing, grotto walls, shifting dock layers). The hourglass and radio function as micro-setting that constrains choice at the climax, meeting the 9+ gate requirement, but the final image—Kael walking deeper into the grotto—does not charge the setting with additional cost or consequence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—merging timelines to complete the passengers' journeys—is signaled early and tightens when Kael tunes the radio to match the grotto's pulsations. The grotto shudders, the ferry lurches sideways, and the passengers materialize: one meaningful deepening under the Accumulative lens. However, Kael's agency is passive observation followed by a single broadcast decision with no visible trade-off; the hourglass shatters in his hand without prior cost, and the passengers' merge feels coincidental rather than driven by his sacrifice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Theme of transience and completion emerges from the ferry's dissolution and the passengers' merged timelines, but the final paragraph's "temporary guardian of a permanent transient moment" is abstraction replacing image. The hourglass motif shifts meaning (empty → filled with stories → shattered) but the new constellation and Kael's deeper walk assert resonance rather than earning it through concrete cost. The widow, child, and lover receive symmetric satisfaction without narrative hierarchy, flattening thematic weight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Kael; perceptual signature is present (memorized passenger stories, radio static forming constellations). Diction elevates during peak beats ("their essence absorbed by the ferry's hull") in ways that strain the deckhand's lexicon. Dialogue from the spectral captain and passengers' chorus feels functional but generic. The final smile and "swelling heart" recycle the opening's "resiliently positive" label without voice modulation under the dissolution's pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Overwriting pervades high-pressure beats: "spectral grotto beneath a sky thick with liquid starlight," "bioluminescent veins... mirroring the fractured chronology," "their fur glowing with the light of a thousand suns." Mixed metaphors appear ("sliding along a sheet of glass" while wood warps "into shapes that defied geometry"). Template cadence in the climax: "The widow found... the child's pet reappeared... the lover embraced..." Paraphrase loop: "the ferry becomes a bridge" → "The ferry had been a bridge." Artifacts touch the closure beat, triggering −1.7 and disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The vanishing-commuter-ferry premise is a recognizable writing-prompt template (liminal space + time anomaly + self-sacrificing guardian). Execution leans on genre furniture: spectral captain's poetic warning, bioluminescent patterns, radio as mystical device, hourglass as symbolic key. The final constellation and Kael's walk into the grotto offer closure gestures but no fresh synthesis. Emotional specificity is absent; the passengers' resolutions are interchangeable and the deckhand's arc follows the chosen-one template without transformation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Kael (ardent ferry deckhand) is present throughout and makes the key broadcast decision at the climax. However, "ardent" is label-only—no on-page passion for the ferry work shapes his choices. His decision to broadcast the pattern and accept the merge drives the ending, meeting setup, development, and payoff gates, but the choice feels passive (passengers ask, he complies) rather than costly. Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, swappability (any guardian) −0.6, late friction (decision appears suddenly) −0.4, cost connection weak −0.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The empty hourglass appears in the opening (found in a crevice), is handled twice (Kael glances, presses transmit while holding it), and shatters at the climax to weave timelines. It is signaled as "the key" and its emptiness/filling arc mirrors the closure. Setup +0.6, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.2, specificity (vessel for echoes of time) +0.5, cost connection (shatters to merge timelines) +0.4, but the mechanics are told rather than dramatized (sand spills to "weave") −0.5, and the object's properties shift conveniently (empty → opaque with stories) −0.3.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Vanishing commuter ferry (core concept) shapes the inciting situation (passengers board but never disembark) and the climax (ferry dissolves as passengers merge). It pressures Kael's tactics (must use the ferry's architecture to broadcast) and the ending image (ferry gone, passengers vanished into merged lives). Setup immediate, three beats (opening, Lira's warning, dissolution) +1.4, causal pressure (ferry's absorption of passengers drives the merge) +1.0, closure linkage (dissolution is the final act) +1.3, irreplaceability +0.6, cost (ferry and Kael's role vanish) +0.5, but the concept is told via backstory rather than dramatized on the page −0.7.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Resiliently positive" is mentioned twice (opening "wavered," ending "swelling") but never constrains a choice. Kael's grin falters when contemplating the merge, yet he proceeds without visible friction; his final smile contradicts the dissolution's cost rather than arising from earned endurance. Label-only trait −0.6, no causal pressure −0.8, ornamental use −0.7, summary-only (told he's positive, not shown making a costly optimistic choice) −0.6. Present in setup and closure, granting two-gate access to ~6.0 range, but functional involvement is absent.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Radio (action element) drives the climax: Kael tunes it to the grotto's pulsations, broadcasts "I carry the hourglass," then transmits a pattern-sequence that causes the ferry to lurch and passengers to materialize. It appears early (strapped to his belt), is handled in two beats (tuning, broadcasting), and the broadcast is the proximate cause of the merge. Setup +0.5, two beats +0.9, causal pressure (broadcast triggers ferry's sideways lurch and passenger manifestation) +1.2, closure linkage +1.4, specificity (frequency matching grotto veins) +0.6, but the radio's mechanics are convenient (static resolves into chorus, dial flickers with constellations) −0.8, and the pattern-method is told rather than demonstrated −0.4.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Via interconnected patterns" (method) is mentioned in the opening ("a language of resonance only the ferry's architecture understood") and executed at the climax (Kael broadcasts "a sequence of tones that matched the grotto's interconnected veins"). The method appears in setup and payoff gates but not development; Kael does not test or learn the pattern mid-scene. Setup +0.4, one beat (climax broadcast) +0.4, closure linkage +0.9, but late execution (final third) −0.6, told mechanics (no on-page trial) −0.7, swappability (any mystical tuning would work) −0.5, and the pattern's rules are never established −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Spectral grotto under starlight (setting) frames the entire scene, supplies the bioluminescent veins Kael must match with the radio, and the starlight coalesces into a prism at the climax to illuminate the layered docks. The grotto's pulsations guide his tuning and the fungi flare when he broadcasts. Setup immediate, three beats (opening, tuning, climax prism) +1.4, causal pressure (grotto's patterns constrain the radio frequency) +1.0, closure linkage (prism illuminates the merge) +1.0, specificity (bioluminescent veins as signal) +0.6, but much description is ornamental ("liquid starlight," "luminescent fungi like smoke") −0.8, and the setting does not impose cost −0.3.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"When clocks run sideways" (timeframe) is a lyric phrase in the opening line but never operationalized. No on-page clock tracks Kael's decisions; urgency is implied by the grotto's shuddering but not by temporal pressure. The phrase reappears only as metaphor (ferry becomes unstuck in time). Present in setup only, missing development and closure gates → cap 4.6. Ornamental use −0.8, no causal pressure −1.0, swappability (any time-distortion phrase) −0.7. Setup +0.3, one beat (opening anchor) +0.4, but no middle or ending involvement.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Motivation "to merge parallel timelines" is present in Kael's realization ("merging timelines meant erasing the boundaries") and his decision to broadcast the pattern. The passengers' plea ("Let us merge. Let us finish") externalizes the stake, and Kael's whispered "Okay... But you have to trust me" is the key choice. Setup (passengers vanish, Lira's warning) +0.6, development (Kael realizes the cost) +0.5, closure linkage (broadcast causes merge) +1.0, but the motivation is the passengers' more than Kael's (he complies rather than desiring it) −0.8, and internal conflict is told ("his resiliently positive grin faltered") rather than embodied in competing impulses −0.6.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Tone "permanent transient" is literalized in the final line ("temporary guardian of a permanent transient moment") and present in the ferry's paradox (bridge between worlds, both present and erased). The oxymoron charges the opening and closing images. Setup +0.6 (ferry "both present and erased"), closure linkage +1.2 (Kael as temporary guardian), specificity +0.5 (ferry dissolves yet passengers' journeys are unbroken), but the tone is declared rather than modulated through pressure ("the promise of journeys yet to begin" is asserted optimism, not earned ambiguity) −0.7, and the final explanation flattens the paradox into a tidy moral −0.6.</comment>
