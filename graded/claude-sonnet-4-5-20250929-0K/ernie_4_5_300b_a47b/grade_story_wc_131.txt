<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivations are clear—survival, protection of library patrons, pursuit of the tape's mystery—but her actions feel observational rather than constrained by contradictory impulses. The "kindly" trait is asserted through exposition ("her kindly nature emerged in her patience") without dramatizing a choice where kindness costs her something tangible. Interiority leans toward summary ("Her heart raced") and label-only emotion rather than embodied perception under pressure. The ending gesture—feeling "seen"—arrives as an epiphany without a visible forfeiture that earned it.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story anchors who/where/when early and follows a causal chain: Mara finds tape → traces origin through pipe chases → discovers decoder → hears message. However, the closure is a realization ("she felt seen") without a decisive on-page cost or action that forecloses a path. The sense-memory conceit adds texture but does not tighten options or force a visible trade-off at the end. The inferred lens is Causal, but the final beat lacks the felt price required for Resonant Reconfiguration or Decisive Change.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Setting details are vivid and atmospheric: stained-glass windows, dust-capped books, pipe chases slick with condensation, the sub-basement's mildew and oil. Spatial choreography is clear through Mara's crawl-space navigation. The decoder's location in the basement matters for discovery, but the environment does not constrain a choice or charge the final image; it remains backdrop. The "sapphire hush" tone is poetic but static, not modulating with pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—uncovering the tape's message—is signaled early and drives Mara's journey through the pipe chases to the decoder. The discovery of the recorded message ("you're not alone") provides information but does not force a visible trade-off or narrow Mara's options on the page. The ending claims she is now "a guardian, a keeper of secrets, and now, a messenger," but no action or cost demonstrates this transformation. Escalation is present as curiosity deepens, but the closure lacks a felt price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>A theme of invisibility versus visibility emerges through Mara's crawl-space existence and her final realization. However, the ending states the theme overtly ("for the first time, she felt seen") rather than earning it through a non-literal final image or action. The tape functions as a message of solidarity, but its thematic weight is told rather than charged by a concrete choice or cost. The decoder remains a device rather than a motif that reweights prior material.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited, filtered through Mara's sensory attention and methodical mind. Perceptual signature is present: her focus on passages, caches, and physical navigation feels character-specific. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("sapphire hush," "a ghost in her mind") that feels authorial rather than Mara's interior lexicon. No dialogue appears. Free indirect style is mostly clean, though some filter verbs ("she could see," "she heard") dull immediacy in peak beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Prose is clear and rhythmically varied, with strong sensory detail in the pipe-chase sequences. However, several lines loop conceptually: "sense memory" is mentioned repeatedly without added pressure, and phrases like "her methodical mind" and "her kindly eyes" feel like scaffold labels. The opening's "staining the air a sapphire hush" mixes metaphors (air cannot be stained with hush). Template cadence appears in the cache-patrol routine description. The closure paragraph contains summary ("she was no longer invisible") rather than propulsive image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The crawl-space dweller premise and ferromagnetic tape reel offer period-specific texture, but the core arc—hidden person finds message, feels validated—follows a familiar template. The "Project Lumen" tape and decoder feel like genre furniture rather than transformed elements. The ending's emotional payoff (feeling seen) is earned by discovery alone, without a non-obvious moral calculus or risky structural choice. Specificity in setting and sensory detail lifts the piece above generic execution, but no element surprises in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Mara appears throughout and drives all beats. She decides to trace the tape's origin, navigates pipe chases, pries open the grille, and operates the decoder. However, these are investigative actions rather than constrained choices with visible trade-offs. The ending claims transformation ("a guardian, a messenger") but no on-page decision alters her tactics or forecloses a path. Setup and development are present; closure participation is claim-only.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The tape reel fragment is introduced early, handled when Mara finds it and again when she inserts it into the decoder. Its "sense memory" effect recurs across beats, and it delivers the message that reframes her mission. However, the reel's magnetic properties do not constrain a choice or create friction; it functions as a plot key rather than an element with irreplaceable specificity. Closure linkage is present (the message plays), but the cost is not tied to the reel itself.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Sense memory is mentioned repeatedly as a sensory effect (whispers, static, voices) but does not shape stakes or tactics on the page. Mara follows the reel's origin via spatial logic (pipe chases) rather than sense-memory guidance. The concept adds atmosphere but remains ornamental; removing it and replacing with "curiosity" would not alter the causal chain. No visible cost or closure moment depends on sense memory specifically.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Kindly" is asserted once ("her kindly nature emerged in her patience") and "methodical" appears as a label ("her methodical mind"). The methodical trait is shown through cache-marking and passage-mapping, but no on-page choice requires her to balance patience against urgency or kindness against self-preservation. The traits describe Mara but do not constrain or enable a beat with felt cost. Label-only presence without causal friction.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Mara caches supplies in the opening routine, then caches the decoder in a hidden alcove at the end. The action bookends the story and reflects her role, but the decoder-caching does not create a turn or cost; it is a logical follow-through. The morning cache routine sets up her character but does not drive escalation. The action is present and thematically coherent but functionally replaceable ("hide" or "store" would work equally).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Uncovering in pipe chases is signaled early, mapped in Mara's prior years of navigation, and drives the middle sequence where she follows the tape's origin. The method matters: her knowledge of twists, junctions, and the grille location enables the discovery. She uses the screwdriver from her cache to pry the grille loose, showing mechanics on the page. The method shapes two beats (navigation and grille removal) and is causally indispensable to reaching the decoder.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The shadowed library at dawn is established in the opening paragraph with vivid sensory detail (stained-glass windows, sapphire hush, dust-capped books). The setting provides atmosphere and the physical structure (pipe chases, sub-basement) that Mara navigates. However, the library does not pressure a choice or supply a resource with visible trade-off; it remains backdrop. The dawn timeframe recurs at closure but does not tighten tactics or stakes.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The power outage and flickering lights are mentioned in the opening and closing paragraphs but do not tighten decisions or impose a time constraint on Mara's actions. The generator hum adds sensory texture, but no beat depends on the outage's duration or threat. The timeframe is ornamental; removing it would not alter the causal chain or stakes. Late closure mention ("the city's lights steadied") is atmospheric only.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The motivation to "become visible to those who need you" is stated explicitly midway ("she needed to become visible to those who needed her") and echoed at closure ("she was no longer invisible"). The desire drives Mara's decision to trace the tape's message, but no on-page friction between visibility and safety creates a choice with cost. The motivation is told rather than dramatized through a trade-off that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Sapphire hush" appears in the opening (dawn light) and near the end ("the sapphire hush remained"). The tone is poetic and contemplative throughout, consistent but static. It does not modulate with pressure during the pipe-chase sequence or decoder discovery. The phrase charges the opening atmosphere but does not reweight the final image or reflect escalation. Present and coherent, but ornamental at closure.</comment>
