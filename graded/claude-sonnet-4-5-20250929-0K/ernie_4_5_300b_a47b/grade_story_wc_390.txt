<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to protect the key is clear, and his use of the resonator under pressure shows agency. However, the ghost's transformation from threat to ally happens too quickly without sufficient internal conflict dramatized in Elias; the shift reads more like plot convenience than earned change. The "logically emotional" attribute is stated repeatedly but never constrains a choice with visible cost—it remains a label rather than a lived contradiction. Interiority leans toward stock phrasing ("chest tighten," "vision blurring") without character-particular texture.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story anchors who/where/when within the opening and delivers a clear closure: Elias stabilizes the key and accepts his role as guardian. The causal lens holds through the confrontation, but the ghost's capitulation ("You… understand") lacks sufficient prior setup—its rage dissolves without a dramatized cost or trade-off that the protagonist's actions specifically earned. The resonator's mechanics shift purpose (ice-shattering to soul-harmonizing) without on-page explanation of how Elias knew to adapt it this way, creating a small causality gap at the climax.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The drift-ice marina and lighthouse are anchored early with vivid sensory detail (frosted planks, tangerine sunset, ice creaking). The resonator functions as a tool that shapes tactics, and the ice underfoot provides spatial grounding. However, the setting remains largely atmospheric backdrop; the ice and marina don't constrain Elias's choices or force adaptation in the confrontation—the ghost could have appeared anywhere and the outcome would be identical.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—protecting the key from malevolent forces—is signaled early and drives the action. Elias's decision to match the key's frequency with the resonator creates one meaningful tightening. However, the ghost's reversal is coincidental rather than earned by Elias's prior choices; it accepts his explanation without a visible trade-off or cost that forecloses an option. The resolution feels more like the ghost's epiphany than Elias's transformation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The theme of harmony between physical and spectral emerges through the resonator's function and the key's purpose as "bridge." The final image of Elias standing vigil with the lighthouse beam sweeping overhead offers a resonant closure tied to his role. However, the ghost's line "The key's not a weapon. It's a bridge" states the theme too directly, and Elias's realization ("sonic absolution") arrives as a sudden label rather than being built from prior particulars. The "logically emotional" phrase recurs without deepening meaning.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-person limited on Elias with consistent distance and perceptual filtering. The dialogue with the ghost carries goal-driven tension and subtext. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register that doesn't fully match the engineer's established voice ("Sonic absolution," "fleshly and ethereal" in narration feel imposed). Some filter verbs and stock embodiment phrases ("chest tighten," "vision blurring") dull immediacy at peak moments.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear with good sensory anchoring and varied sentence rhythm. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "The key's power wasn't just about locking doors—it was about harmonizing frequencies, uniting the physical and the spectral" restates the bridge concept already shown. Template cadence runs in the opening ("his boots crunching," "his hands… adjusted," "his breath fogged"). Stock metaphors cluster without fresh texture: "horizon bled tangerine," "edges flickering like a broken film reel," "voice crackled, a sound like grinding ice." These artifacts accumulate to −0.8 to −1.0 in this category.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The combination of lighthouse engineer, sonic resonator, and crypt keeper's key offers a fresh surface premise. However, the emotional arc—protector faces supernatural threat, finds understanding rather than violence—follows a familiar template without transformation through specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The ghost's quick conversion and Elias's role as guardian-through-harmony resolve into a tidy, safe middle that avoids riskier implications of the "sonic absolution" concept.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias is present throughout, makes the key decision to activate the resonator at the confrontation, and his final choice to "let it sing" reframes his guardian role. His engineer identity shapes his approach (frequency matching, tool adaptation). However, his choices don't create reversals so much as execute a plan; the ghost's transformation is not forced by Elias's actions but by its own epiphany.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The key is mentioned in setup (hidden in vault, vibrational signature faltering), drives the middle conflict (ghost drawn by its distress), and appears at closure (pocketed, its hum stabilized). However, it's never handled or used on the page—it remains in the vault throughout. The key's presence is causal but abstract; we don't see Elias interact with it physically or make a trade-off involving it directly.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Sonic absolution" is named once mid-confrontation as Elias's realization, but it doesn't shape tactics or constrain choices—it's a thematic label applied to actions already underway. The concept of using sound to harmonize rather than destroy is present, but "absolution" specifically (implying forgiveness or release) doesn't alter on-page options or create a visible cost. Swappable with "sonic harmony" or similar.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Logically emotional" appears three times as a label (intro, ice vibrations, final reflection) but never constrains a choice or enables a tactic with cost. Elias is described as "a man of equations and gears" yet responds emotionally, but this trait doesn't create a dramatized internal conflict or force a trade-off. It remains a conceptual claim rather than a lived contradiction that shapes action.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>"Adapt" drives key beats: Elias adapts the resonator's purpose from ice-breaking to frequency-matching, and the final image shows him as one who "adapted once more." The ghost's transformation could also be read as adaptation. However, the adaptation itself is told rather than shown in mechanical detail—we don't see Elias struggle with recalibrating the tool or choosing between conflicting methods. The element is thematically central but functionally light.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Vibrational matching is signaled early (Elias adjusts frequency dial, presses palm to ice to feel vibrations) and executed at the climax (matches the ghost's pitch with the resonator). The method shapes the confrontation's tactics. However, the mechanics remain vague—how Elias knew the correct frequency or how sound dispels a wraith is unexplained, weakening the method's specificity. Present across beats but not irreplaceable; "energy matching" could substitute.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The drift-ice marina is anchored early with vivid detail (frosted planks, ice-jumbled water) and reappears at closure ("slept, its secrets safe"). The ice provides spatial grounding (creaking underfoot, low hum from below). However, the setting doesn't constrain Elias's choices—the confrontation unfolds the same way regardless of location. The ice could have been replaced with another liminal environment without altering tactics or outcome.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The sunset is mentioned in the opening (tangerine and lavender) and tied to urgency ("before the sunset's last light vanished"). It reappears at closure ("sun dipped below the horizon"). However, the timeframe doesn't tighten tactics—the ghost arrives and departs without the sunset imposing a visible deadline or forcing Elias to rush or compromise. Time is more atmospheric than mechanical. Present but not load-bearing.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Protecting the key is Elias's stated goal from the opening and drives his presence at the marina. The motivation is tested when the ghost challenges him, and his response (harmonizing rather than destroying) reflects a deeper understanding of protection. However, the motivation is told more than dramatized through conflicted micro-choices—Elias never weighs abandoning the key or faces a cost that challenges his commitment. Functional but not deeply embodied.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Fleshly ethereal" tone is present in the juxtaposition of physical detail (cracked leather gloves, frosted planks) and spectral imagery (wraithlike form, ghost dissolving into static). The tone modulates slightly as the ghost softens. However, the tone remains more atmospheric than structural—it doesn't charge the final image with undeniable pressure or reweight prior material. The final paragraph's shift to peaceful vigil feels more resolved than resonantly ambiguous.</comment>
