<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's occupation and grandfather backstory provide concrete motivation, and the final singing choice carries visible cost (the pane cracks, the puppet shatters). However, interiority leans toward diagnostic self-awareness ("accept her own flaws—the doubt that gnawed at her, the fear that she'd miscalculated") rather than embodied contradiction acting simultaneously in scene. The decisive act of singing is dramatized, but the internal struggle is summarized rather than shown through micro-choices under pressure. Backstory occupies substantial space (~25%) but does anchor present choices, keeping the piece within BRR tolerance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land cleanly in the opening paragraph. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (singing the lullaby/accepting flaws) with visible cost (lighthouse groaning, pane cracking, puppet shattering, clocks slowing worldwide). Causal lens holds: Mara climbs → finds the pane → places the puppet → sings → world responds. The Cost Proof Test is met: "The pane of hush began to crack, its fractal patterns unraveling like a frayed rope" and "The broken puppet head shattered, its porcelain pieces raining down like snow" provide on-page legibility. One meaningful tightening occurs when she presses her palm and memories flood, narrowing her path to the final song.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The lighthouse setting (skeletal tower, rusted railing, crumbling cliff, fog, salt and decay) is vivid and coherent throughout. The "pane of hush" functions as micro-setting, constraining Mara's final action: she must press the puppet to the glass, then sing through it to amplify the lullaby. The fractal patterns guide her method. The setting charges the final image (lighthouse shudders, fog swirls) but does not fully constrain an earlier choice with felt cost, capping high-band entry below 7.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (vouchsafe the final ripple of time/ensure a gentle end) is signaled early and tightens when Mara discovers the puppet is a map and when she must accept her flaws to sing. The final act—singing despite doubt—narrows options (the pane cracks, irreversibly) and pays a visible price (puppet shatters, lighthouse groans). Agency is clear: Mara's choice to sing drives the resolution. One meaningful turn occurs when she realizes "the broken puppet head wasn't a failure. It was a map," reweighting her task and enabling the climax.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme (perfection is a lie; cracks let light in; the end is a lullaby, beautifully flawed) emerges from concrete particulars: the cracked puppet, nested fractal patterns, Mara's rough voice. The final image—puppet shattering with golden light, clocks softening worldwide—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. However, the grandfather's aphorism "Perfection is a lie...It's the cracks that let the light in" and Mara's closing realization "the end wasn't an ending. It was a lullaby, beautifully flawed, sung across a thousand lifetimes" edge toward thematic echo, restating the premise rather than trusting the image alone. Still, the nested patterns and shattered puppet do most of the thematic work on the page.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable throughout; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is clear (Mara notices time's weight, mechanical details, her grandfather's teachings). Diction is controlled and voice-motivated, with purposeful register ("vouchsafe," "nested patterns," "spectral glow") fitting a character who adjusts the doomsday clock. Under peak stress (the singing), the prose tightens appropriately ("She kept singing, her voice steady now, her flaws embraced"). One minor register slip: "the fear that she'd miscalculated" reads slightly more meta-cognitive than embodied in the moment, but does not break voice coherence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Information density is high; most sentences advance character, atmosphere, or stakes. Rhythm varies purposefully (short declarations at the climax: "The lighthouse groaned. The pane of hush began to crack"). However, figurative language clusters densely in the opening and middle passages ("skeletal tower," "spectral glow," "insects in amber," "thread to be gently pulled," "ripples in a pond," "frayed rope," "snow") without all serving distinct functions, triggering overwriting concerns (−0.4). Paraphrase loop: "The end is not an event...but a lullaby sung across a thousand lifetimes" in backstory is echoed nearly verbatim in the closing line, reducing closure sharpness (−0.3). No other scaffolding or template cadence issues; clarity remains high.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of doomsday-clock adjuster, fractal glass pane, broken puppet as map, and lullaby-as-gentle-apocalypse offers a specific, non-obvious premise. The emotional particulars (grandfather's rough laughter, Mara's calloused hands, her unpracticed voice) ground the fantastical elements. However, the core arc—flawed protagonist must accept flaws to succeed—follows a familiar template, and the grandfather's aphorism ("It's the cracks that let the light in") is a widely used metaphor. Transformation is present but incomplete; the nested-pattern mechanism and the pane of hush add freshness, yet the emotional resolution does not fully surprise in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara (doomsday clock adjuster) is present throughout and makes the key decisions: to climb, to use the puppet, to sing despite doubt. Her occupation frames expectation (adjusting fragile mechanisms) and her final choice (singing the lullaby) creates the story's climactic turn and consequence. Present in all three gates (setup, middle choice, ending); drives at least two beats (placing the puppet, singing); causal pressure evident; closure linkage strong. Cost is visible (pane cracks, puppet shatters). High irreplaceability: her specific skill and motivation (grandfather's teaching, time adjustment) make her indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The broken puppet head appears in the first third (setup), is used actively in the middle (placed against the pane, causing it to hum and shift patterns), and shatters at closure with visible consequence (golden light, pieces like snow). Present in all three gates. Handled in at least two distinct beats (examination/backstory, placement against pane, shattering). The crack along the jawline and missing eye are noted but not leveraged for distinct tactical pressure beyond symbolic resonance. Causal role is strong: the puppet's fractal nature (via the crack) becomes the key to the nested-pattern method. Cost connection clear (shattering completes the lullaby). Slight swappability: another flawed object with fractal properties could serve similarly with moderate edits.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The pane of hush (glass window etched with fractal patterns) is introduced early, shapes middle tactics (Mara must place the puppet against it, press her palm to align patterns), and amplifies the ending (sends the lullaby across the world, then cracks). Present in all three gates. The pane's mechanics (swallowing sound, humming, nested patterns duplicating inward) directly enable the resolution: Mara cannot complete her task without it. Causal pressure evident; closure linkage strong. Cost visible (pane cracks as the lullaby spreads). Specificity high: the fractal-pattern functionality is unique and irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Beautifully flawed" is stated as theme (grandfather's teaching, Mara's acceptance, the puppet's cracks) and drives the emotional arc. The attribute constrains Mara's action: she must accept her flaws (doubt, fear) to sing, and her "rough, unpracticed" voice becomes the vehicle for success. Present in setup (grandfather's lesson), middle (Mara's realization), and ending (singing with flaws embraced). However, the attribute operates more as thematic premise than a visible on-page tradeoff with tactical cost. The flaws enable rather than complicate: no moment where flaw actively costs her an option or creates friction beyond internal doubt. Label-only in places ("beautifully flawed" appears verbatim at closure, restating rather than dramatizing). Band ceiling ~7.0 due to label reliance and lack of distinct tactical cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Vouchsafe" (to ensure/guarantee) appears once in the first third as Mara's stated task ("to vouchsafe the final ripple of time") and frames her goal. The action itself (ensuring a gentle end) drives the entire plot: climbing, using the puppet, singing. However, "vouchsafe" as a specific verb does not recur or shape middle tactics distinctly; Mara's method (sing the lullaby) could be described as "deliver," "secure," or "transmit" with minimal narrative change. The word's archaic register fits voice but does not impose unique mechanical or tactical constraints. Present in setup and thematically in ending, but not explicitly in middle beats. Moderate swappability (−0.6). Causal role evident but verb choice not irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Through nested patterns" is signaled early (the pane's fractal etchings, patterns duplicating inward) and becomes the mechanism at the climax: Mara places the puppet's cracks against the glass, the patterns align and amplify, enabling the lullaby to spread. Present in all three gates (setup describes fractals, middle shows alignment, ending uses the amplification). The method shapes attempts: without the nested-pattern alignment, the lullaby cannot reach across time. Causal pressure clear; closure linkage strong. Specificity high: the fractal-duplication mechanic is unique and irreplaceable. Cost connection present (alignment causes the pane to crack). The method is taught (grandfather's journals mention it) and paid off dramatically.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The hidden lighthouse at dusk is introduced in the opening line and provides the location for the entire narrative. The setting's features (spiral stairs, rusted railing, skeletal tower, crumbling cliff, fog) create atmosphere and constrain Mara's movement (she climbs with "measured steps"). At closure, the lighthouse shudders and the fog swirls unnaturally, charging the final image. Present in all three gates. However, the lighthouse itself does not force a key tactical choice or supply a resource that alters outcome beyond serving as the container for the pane. The pane does the causal work; the lighthouse is setting-as-stage rather than setting-as-agent. Moderate irreplaceability: another isolated, decayed structure with the pane could function similarly.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Across the hush of time's final ripple" appears as phrasing in the first third ("to vouchsafe the final ripple of time") and thematically at closure ("the hush of time's final ripple"). The timeframe (doomsday, the world's end) frames stakes but does not function as a live ticking clock that alters Mara's tactics. No countdown, no visible time pressure forcing speed or choices. The passage of time is vague: Mara climbs, examines, remembers, sings, with no sense of urgency or deadline. Present in setup and ending thematically, but not as a functional constraint in the middle. Swappable: removing "final ripple" and replacing with "world's end" or "last moment" would not break story logic. Low causal pressure (−0.8); ornamental use (−0.7).</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The motivation "to whisper a lullaby across a thousand lifetimes" is stated early (Mara's task, grandfather's letter) and drives the climax (Mara sings the lullaby). Present in setup and ending. However, the desire is told more than dramatized: Mara's internal conflict (doubt, fear) is summarized rather than shown in friction between wants and costs during the singing. The lullaby's content and emotional texture are not detailed; it is described as "rough, unpracticed" but we do not see Mara choose lyrics, rhythm, or tone under pressure. The goal shapes the plot but lacks embodied struggle in the key beat. Middle development weak (no scene where Mara wrestles with whether to sing or how). Label-only in places ("whisper the lullaby" restated without fresh dramatization). Cost is visible (puppet shatters) but not tied to the motivation's internal friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Bruised awe" (tone combining damage/vulnerability with wonder) is coherent throughout: the lighthouse "wore its scars like a badge of honor," Mara's hands are "calloused," the air smells of "salt and decay," yet the pane's patterns are described with wonder ("celestial clock," "golden light," "strange peace"). Tone modulates with pressure: reverent in the opening, tense during the alignment, awed at closure ("across the world, clocks slowed"). The final image (puppet shattering, clocks softening, lullaby spreading) charges the tone with both loss and transcendence, fitting "bruised awe" precisely. Present in all three gates. No tonal breaks or register clashes. High coherence and closure linkage. Slightly abstract as a label, but the prose consistently embodies it.</comment>
