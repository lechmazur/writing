<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lirael's motivation to restore faith is declared but interior contradiction remains thin—she doubts the elders yet presses on without visceral cost dramatized in scene. The choice to follow at the end ("She chose to follow") tells rather than showing a foreclosed alternative with embodied stakes. Reflection dominates the middle ("She thought of her grandmother…") without micro-choices that alter present tactics. Embodied emotion is present in "heart racing" but therapized phrasing like "warmly curious" and "cautious enchantment" reads label-only.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure reads as Charged Poise—the sundial glows, roots tremble, Lirael kneels—but cost is implied rather than legible on the page; we do not see what path she forecloses or what price she pays for choosing to follow. Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraph. The chamber discovery and sundial placement offer one meaningful tightening, sufficient for this length, but the final image ("It's not finished, but it's enough") abstracts rather than crystallizing options through concrete detail.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard is vividly rendered—roots coiling like ropes, sun piercing the domed ceiling—and the circular chamber's pedestal constrains Lirael's action (the sundial base fits perfectly). Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered. However, the orchard does not evolve causally after the glow; the villagers appear at the edge without prior spatial set-up, and the setting does not charge the final image beyond backdrop.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore the shrine/faith) is signaled early. One meaningful tightening occurs when the sundial emits its tone and the chamber glows, forcing Lirael to choose whether to follow the thread. However, the choice is narrated as internal summary ("a thread she could follow or let unravel") without on-page cost—no visible price, no tactic altered, no path foreclosed in scene. The "warmly curious" attribute and "purposeful but unhurried" pacing dilute urgency rather than escalating pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme (faith as choice, diaspora memory, restoration) emerges through image and action rather than statement. The sundial's alignment and the roots' reverent response carry subtext. The final line "It's not finished, but it's enough" offers a resonant reconfiguration of completion versus process, but it borders on thematic summary rather than image-driven answer. No overt moralizing; the ending invites reflection without confusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present ("warmly curious," "cautious enchantment") but these phrases recur as labels rather than shaping syntax or diction under pressure. Dialogue is minimal and functional ("Here," "Show me," "It's not finished"). Psychic distance widens during reflection ("She thought of…") without clear purpose, and the prose does not modulate rhythmically with the glow's climax—texture remains even rather than tightening.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and clarity is high; no major loops or scaffold. However, figurative language is dense without pattern-teaching: "roots twisting like serpents," "coiling around her ankles like living ropes," "pulsed like a heartbeat" cluster without payoff. "Warmly curious" and "cautious enchantment" appear as stock descriptors. The final paragraph shifts to summary telling ("Days passed… piece by piece") that compresses key labor without scene pressure. Minor filter-verb stacks ("she'd say," "she felt") dull immediacy in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard with bone-roots is a vivid synthesis, and the sundial as restoration key is specific. However, the diaspora returnee restoring lost faith follows a familiar template arc without transformation through lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The ending ("It's not finished, but it's enough") gestures toward complexity but does not surprise or reweight prior material in hindsight. Emotional specificity is present but not enough to lift the piece beyond competent execution of recognizable beats.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Lirael as diaspora returnee is signaled early and frames her goal. She makes one key choice at the climax ("She chose to follow") but it is narrated rather than dramatized with visible cost. Her twelve-year absence and purpose drive setup and the ending moment, meeting setup and payoff gates, but middle development shows observation more than decision.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The sundial base appears in the satchel (setup), is placed on the pedestal (middle action), and emits the harmonic tone that triggers the glow and Lirael's choice (payoff). It constrains the chamber discovery and enables the climax. However, its mechanics are vague—engravings "humming with energy" is told rather than shown through specific interaction—and it does not reappear with reweighted meaning in the final image.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Interrupted journeys" is mentioned in backstory (storm, fever) but does not shape on-page stakes or tactics. The interruptions are summary-only; they do not narrow options or create friction during the orchard wandering or tomb excavation. Present as thematic echo but functionally swappable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Warmly curious" appears twice as a label ("warmly curious about every shadow"; implicit in "curiosity was a compass") but does not constrain an on-page choice with cost. It colors tone but remains ornamental; Lirael's actions (descending despite racing heart, clearing debris) do not hinge on this trait versus another.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Rebuild" drives the plot: Lirael carries the sundial base to restore the shrine, clears debris, places the base, and kneels at the rebuilt structure in the ending. It appears across beats and shapes the closure image. However, the labor is summarized ("Days passed… piece by piece") rather than shown in scene, reducing irreplaceability—another restoration verb could substitute with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Purposeful wandering" is described ("purposeful but unhurried, gathering stones, clearing debris, tracing the old paths") but its mechanics do not visibly alter tactics or outcomes. Lirael's path through the labyrinth is not shown constraining her; the tomb entrance discovery reads as chance rather than method-driven. Present in middle and ending but functionally soft.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard is vividly detailed and pressures choices: roots coil around Lirael's ankles, the chamber's pedestal matches the sundial base, the hole in the dome allows sunlight to trigger the alignment. It supplies resources (hidden springs, forgotten altars) and the final glow. It appears in setup, middle, and ending with causal force; removing it would break the story's spatial logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>"Across excavating a tomb" timeframe is signaled ("third day," "Days passed," "One evening," "next morning") but does not tighten decisions. The clock is loose; Lirael works "unhurried" and time compresses without cost. The sundial's noon alignment is noted but does not create urgency. Present across beats but does not escalate pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>"Restore lost faith" drives Lirael's goal and shapes the ending ("the faith, not as a command, but as a choice"). It is dramatized in the sundial placement and the villagers' arrival. However, internal friction is told ("she didn't fully believe them—not yet") rather than shown through contradictory impulses in scene. Desire is present but cost of restoring faith versus leaving it unfinished remains abstract.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Cautious enchantment" appears as label and colors the prose: Lirael's heart races yet she presses on, her curiosity is a compass, the air "shimmers" and roots "listen." Tone is coherent and modulates slightly when the chamber glows ("she froze, her breath catching"). It charges the final image through the sundial's glow and Lirael's kneeling posture. However, "warmly curious" and "cautious enchantment" recur as fixed descriptors rather than intensifying under pressure.</comment>
