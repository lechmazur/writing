<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kael's role as fractal weaver is established with concrete interiority ("Some burdens are anchors. Let them sink, but not drown you"), and his work with the burdens shows embodied choice under pressure. The mother's locket creates genuine internal conflict when he pauses but chooses not to touch it—an earned renunciation with visible cost. However, the interiority occasionally drifts into label-speak ("The thought made him smile, a rare thing") and the emotional progression from grotto work to village arrival feels somewhat flattened, lacking contradictory impulses in the final beats.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story accumulates seven burdens through discrete beats, each melting/weaving cycle deepening the dominant stake (collecting weights, not wounds). Closure arrives as Earned Stasis when Kael refuses his mother's locket—a renunciation that forecloses the path with felt cost ("Some burdens, he realized, were meant to stay buried"). Orientation is clear by the opening paragraph. One minor slip: the village arrival and workshop storage feel like a soft reset that diffuses rather than charges the ending image, slightly weakening the cost legibility of the locket refusal.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The bronze grotto is vividly anchored with layered sensory detail (wet metal, moss-crusted pool, calcified whispers as "shingled hush"), and the kerosene lamp burner constrains multiple choices—relighting after a draft, angling flame at different burdens. The starlight fissure provides both spatial grounding and a method for orienting the lamp. The micro-setting (lamp, niches, specific burdens like thorns and obsidian) directly shapes Kael's tactics across beats, and the grotto's physicality charges the ending when he leaves it behind, satisfying the 9+ gate for Q3.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (collecting burdens, not wounds) is signaled early and tightens through escalating resistance: thorns soften easily, obsidian requires a crack "like a heart breaking," and the mother's locket remains untouched. The lamp's repeated extinguishing and the need to reorient it create tactical pressure. The final refusal of the locket is protagonist-driven with visible cost (leaving his own grief unresolved). However, the village arrival deflates tension rather than sustaining it through the final image, and the workshop storage beat feels like an epilogue that diffuses rather than charges the closure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme (the ethics of processing grief: what to carry, what to leave buried) emerges through the specific work of melting hush into fractals and culminates in the locket refusal—a non-literal answer to the question of whether all burdens should be lifted. The recurring motif of "weights, not wounds" and the shingled hush as solidified grief are concretely embodied rather than abstract. The final dream of the grotto as lullaby resonates without moralizing. Minor slip: "Some truths were too heavy to share, even when woven into fractals" edges toward thematic summary in place of image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited throughout, and Kael's perceptual signature (metallic taste, the grotto as a "great beast") is character-specific. Diction is controlled and purposeful in most beats. However, several phrases drift into elevated register inconsistent with the established voice: "whalebone reverie," "boundary-lessly trapped limbo," and "restless spirits" feel ornamental rather than earned by Kael's working-class artisan perspective. Free indirect style is clean, but the psychic distance occasionally wobbles when the narration adopts a more lyric, authorial stance ("The grotto seemed to sigh") that competes with Kael's grounded interiority.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and many lines carry dual purpose (e.g., "The burner's brass had patinaed to a sickly green, but its wick still held a flicker" grounds setting and stakes simultaneously). However, figurative density spikes without pattern-teaching: "jagged shadows," "tongue" of flame, "whalebone reverie," "scale-covered hide," and "restless spirits" cluster in adjacent beats, creating mild overwriting. Template cadence appears in the middle section: "He lit the burner… He held the lamp close… He closed his eyes… He reoriented the lamp…" across consecutive paragraphs. One paraphrase loop: "Kael's people believed burdens…solidified into stone" is immediately restated as "These were the unclaimed burdens…dissolved into the grotto's shingled hush." Deductions: −0.6 for density/template issues, not touching closure directly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The fractal-weaver premise and the mechanics of melting calcified grief offer a specific, non-obvious synthesis that avoids stock fantasy templates. The kerosene lamp burner as a mundane tool in a mythic task creates fresh texture. However, the emotional arc (artisan processes others' grief, cannot touch his own) is familiar, and the transformation relies heavily on establishing the shingled-hush conceit rather than on character-specific inflection. The grotto-as-beast metaphor and the final workshop dream feel like ornamental rather than structural risks. No close template echoes, but the piece does not push beyond competent execution of its premise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kael's choices drive every major beat: lighting the burner, adjusting flame angle for thorns and obsidian, and the climactic refusal of the mother's locket. Setup (first paragraph), development (multiple burden-melting decisions), and payoff (locket renunciation) are all present. The locket refusal forecloses a path with visible cost and is causally rooted in prior work. High causal pressure and closure linkage push this into the 7+ band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The kerosene lamp burner appears in setup (second paragraph), is used in at least four distinct beats (lighting, relighting after draft, angling for thorns, angling for obsidian), and is packed into the belt at closure. Its mechanics (flame angle, wick maintenance) constrain Kael's tactics under pressure. The burner's specific properties (brass patina, fragile wick) matter; a generic torch would not serve. Strong beat involvement and causal pressure; narrowly misses highest band because it does not return with reweighted meaning in the final image.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Shingled hush is introduced early (third paragraph) as the calcified whispers layering the walls and is referenced throughout. It shapes the task (melt the hush into fractals) and thus the dominant stake. However, the hush itself does not constrain a specific choice or change tactics; it is the burdens (thorns, obsidian, locket) that do the work. The hush functions more as atmospheric concept than active element. Present in setup and thematically threaded, but no strong middle development or closure linkage where the hush itself alters options.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Boundary-lessly trapped" appears once as a descriptor of limbo where souls are caught. It does not constrain or enable an on-page action, alter Kael's tactics, or return at closure. Label-only mention without functional pressure. Ornamental use and high swappability (could say "eternally trapped" with no structural change).</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Calcification is the core mechanism: burdens solidify into stone, and Kael's task is to reverse it. The action shapes the inciting task, the middle escalation (obsidian resists, thorns yield), and the thematic weight of the locket refusal (some calcifications should remain). Causally essential across beats. However, the ending pivots on *not* calcifying/melting the locket rather than on the act of calcifying itself, so the action is more backdrop than final-image driver. Strong setup and development, moderate closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"By orienting properly" is signaled in the mentor's teaching and demonstrated twice: angling flame by starlight for the thorns and repositioning for the obsidian's base. The method constrains Kael's approach and shapes the middle beats. However, it does not appear in or decisively shape the locket refusal at closure—Kael never lights the lamp for his mother's burden. Setup and development present; payoff absent. Two-gate cap ~6.0, lifted slightly for causal pressure in middle beats.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The bronze grotto is introduced in the opening line, provides all spatial and atmospheric anchoring, and supplies concrete resources (moss-crusted pool, niches, fissure for starlight) that enable and constrain Kael's work. The grotto's damp extinguishes the flame, forcing a relight; the starlight fissure guides orientation. Kael's departure from the grotto at closure reweights his relationship to it (from workspace to "distant echo"). Setup, development (multiple resource/constraint uses), and payoff all strong. High irreplaceability and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"After the first snowmelt" appears in the opening line and is reprised in the penultimate paragraph ("the first snowmelt glistening on the rocks"). It frames the season but does not tighten decisions or create a live clock. The work proceeds without temporal pressure; Kael collects seven burdens "by dawn" but the snowmelt itself is scenic rather than tactical. Setup and lyric reprise present; no middle development where the timeframe constrains choice. Swappable with "after the thaw" or "in early spring" with no structural change.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The motivation to collect burdens is established in the opening (third paragraph: "a task his kind had performed for centuries") and dramatized across multiple beats as Kael melts and weaves each burden. The task creates friction when the obsidian resists and reaches peak conflict when Kael refuses his mother's locket—desire to complete the work versus the cost of confronting personal grief. The motivation is tested and renounced at closure with visible cost. Strong setup, development, and payoff; causal pressure and closure linkage are high.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Whalebone reverie" appears once in the middle section ("the bronze walls humming with a low, whalebone reverie") as a tonal descriptor. The overall tone—elegiac, mythic, tactile—is coherent and modulates appropriately (clinical focus during burden-work, reflective during the locket pause, lighter upon departure). However, "whalebone reverie" as a specific phrase does not recur or charge the final image; it is ornamental rather than load-bearing. The broader tone succeeds; the required phrase itself is a one-time texture note. Tone coherence earns mid-band; the specific phrase's lack of structural role prevents higher scoring.</comment>
