<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Lira's interiority is nearly absent; we receive her title and attribute as labels ("spiralingly calm") but no contradictory impulses, embodied emotion, or micro-choices under pressure. The fisherman's question is deflected by silence, but Lira never wrestles with competing desires or costs—she simply executes her ritual. Her "motivation" to "teach darkness the value of stars" reads as abstract thesis rather than dramatized want, and no foreclosed path or visible cost emerges from her actions. The cat's appearance and the fisherman's departure register no internal conflict or trade-off.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed (who she is and why she's here remain vague past the opening paragraphs) but not taught as a pattern. No on-page decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing occurs; Lira arrives, performs her light-weaving, and departs with the dock "a little less heavy"—a declared outcome rather than a visible before/after with felt cost. The piece reads as a single illustrative action without escalation or a causal turn that narrows options. Accumulative lens is plausible, but the ending offers only authorial assertion ("its darkness a little less heavy") rather than an image that reweights prior material with undeniable pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The cobalt dock after rain is anchored early with vivid sensory detail (slick planks, bruised sky, water reflections). The shutters and dental mirror supply tactile specificity, and the setting's mood coheres throughout. However, the environment does not constrain Lira's choices or alter her tactics; she opens shutters and angles the mirror without friction or spatial limitation. The dock functions as atmospheric backdrop rather than active pressure, keeping the score in mid-band despite strong descriptive texture.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>One dominant stake is implied (to comfort the canal through light), but no on-page reversal, tightening, or deepening occurs. Lira's actions unfold in a single uninterrupted sequence with no opposition, complication, or cost that narrows options. The fisherman's question and the cat's appearance are ornamental rather than pressure points. The "stillwater tension" is declared but never tested, and the resolution ("the canal's whispers grew gentler") is told rather than earned through a protagonist decision with visible consequence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Theme ("silent empathy," teaching darkness the value of stars) is stated overtly in exposition rather than emerging from concrete action and image. The dental mirror's symbolic function (refracting light as metaphor) is explained by the narrator rather than felt through dramatized choice. The final image—Lira walking away with "its darkness a little less heavy"—asserts meaning instead of offering a resonant, non-literal answer. Subtext is minimal; the piece tells its thesis directly, and "some truths were too deep for words" arrives as moralizing summary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present in imagery (bruised sky, ivy-like calm) but diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("spiralingly calm," "stillwater tension") that feels authorial rather than character-specific. The fisherman's brief dialogue is functional but generic. Narrative distance remains consistent, and there are no filter-verb stacks or tense breaks. However, the prose lacks a distinct rhythmic texture that modulates with pressure, and interiority is sparse, limiting voice distinctiveness.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Clarity is generally maintained, but several passages loop conceptually: "silence was a wall, but also a bridge" followed immediately by "a way to let the light speak for her" restates the same idea. "The dock sighed, the water lapping at the pilings like a lullaby" stacks two personifications without adding pressure. Stock phrases appear ("rough as gravel," "old bones," "twin moons"). Figurative density is high in atmospheric beats without always serving momentum. Sentence openings vary, and no major grammatical errors disrupt flow, but paraphrase loops and decorative metaphor reduce propulsion in a piece that already lacks escalation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The premise—silent guardian using a dental mirror to weave light patterns on a dock—is specific and evocative. However, the execution follows a template structure: arrival, ritual action, brief observer, departure with declared effect. The dental mirror's use (angling light) is logical but does not transform the familiar "artist comforts the world" frame. Emotional arc and stakes are interchangeable with similar "quiet healer" narratives. No bold structural or perspectival risk elevates the material, and the ending's assertion of success ("a little less heavy") avoids complexity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Lira is on the page throughout but makes no key decisions that alter tactics or stakes. She performs her ritual without complication, friction, or choice under pressure. The title "silent canal guardian" is given rather than earned through on-page action. Her presence is observational and declarative; removing her specific identity would not break the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The dental mirror appears in three beats: introduction with backstory, use in the light-weaving, and the final pack-away. Its mechanics (angling light) are demonstrated on the page, and it enables the central action. However, its meaning does not shift or deepen; it functions as a tool without cost or evolving significance. The mother's gift backstory is told rather than woven into a present choice, and the mirror could be replaced with any reflective surface without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Silent empathy" is named explicitly in exposition ("The core concept of silent empathy threaded through her actions") and declared as Lira's approach, but it does not constrain or enable a specific on-page choice with cost. The concept is illustrated rather than tested. If removed, the story's action sequence (weaving light to comfort the dock) would remain unchanged.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>1.9</grade><comment>"Spiralingly calm" is introduced as a label ("Her attribute was spiralingly calm, a serenity that wound through her like ivy") but never dramatized as a trait that constrains or enables a decision with visible trade-off. Lira's calm is asserted, not tested under pressure. The attribute could be replaced with any synonym for serenity without affecting the story's beats.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Weaving (as action) is present in the central sequence: Lira opens shutters, angles the mirror, and creates light patterns. The action is demonstrated across multiple beats and is the story's centerpiece. However, no turn or complication traces to this action—it succeeds without friction. Swapping "weave" for "arrange" or "shape" would require minor edits but not structural change, as the narrative stakes do not hinge on the specific method.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Creating patterns with shutters is signaled early ("opening the shutters"), demonstrated in the middle beat (tilting slats, angling light, resulting spirals and constellations), and referenced at closure ("her mirror and her shutters"). The mechanics matter to the action sequence, and removing the shutters would require rewriting the central method. However, the shutters do not constrain a choice or impose a cost; they enable Lira's ritual without friction or failure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The cobalt dock after rain is anchored early, supplies vivid sensory detail throughout, and appears in the final image ("The cobalt dock stayed behind"). The setting's mood (slick planks, water, shadows) coheres with the tone and frames the action. The dock is essential to the story's location and atmosphere, but it does not alter Lira's tactics or constrain her choices; it functions as stage rather than active pressure. Present across all three gates (setup, middle, closure) but without causal pressure, placing it in mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>1.6</grade><comment>"Within the edge of a half-spoken secret" appears once in exposition ("the edge of a half-spoken secret hummed in the air") and is not developed as a ticking clock or constraint that tightens decisions. The phrase is lyrical but ornamental; no deadline or temporal pressure shapes Lira's actions or the ending. The story unfolds in "tonight" and "the hour grew late" without urgency or time-driven escalation.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"To teach darkness the value of stars" is stated overtly ("Her motivation was clear: to teach darkness the value of stars") and illustrated through her light-weaving, but it is never dramatized as a want in conflict with a competing cost or fear. The motivation is told, not tested. Lira enacts her goal without friction, and no on-page choice reveals a trade-off or hierarchy of values tied to this desire.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Stillwater tension" is introduced early ("a tension like stillwater, where the surface seemed placid but thrummed with unseen currents"), sustained through atmospheric description (bruised sky, whispers, shadows), and referenced at closure ("The stillwater tension remained, but it had softened"). The tone is coherent and purpose-driven, modulating slightly by the end. However, the tension is declared rather than dramatized through escalating pressure, and the final image's tonal shift is asserted ("gentler," "a little less heavy") rather than charged by an on-page reversal.</comment>
