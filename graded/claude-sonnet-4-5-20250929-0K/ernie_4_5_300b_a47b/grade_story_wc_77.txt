<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Mara's core motivation (trick fear into revealing its weakness) is clear and drives her forward, but her internal contradictions remain shallow—she hesitates, then presses on without meaningful friction between impulses. The photographic curse is label-only; it's told as backstory but never constrains an on-page choice or creates visible cost. Vey's role as advisor is functional but his presence doesn't generate relationship pressure or force Mara into harder trade-offs. The final exchange ("And what truth do you serve?") gestures toward complexity but arrives without prior dramatized tension between them.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when early enough (Mara, funhouse, post-resuscitation). The drive lens reads Causal: Mara enters, consults the dictionary, speaks the paradox, the shadow dissolves, leaving a thread she grips to complete the banishment. Closure is a Decisive Change—the curse mechanism is broken, the cloak now glows gold—but the cost is vague: her hand is seared, yet this doesn't foreclose a visible path or alter her stance in the final beat. The link from paradox-speaking to shadow-death feels asserted rather than earned by prior rule-teaching; the dictionary's mechanics arrive suddenly in the middle without setup.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The funhouse is vividly rendered with cracked mirrors, condensation, and twisted rooms that create atmosphere. Spatial choreography is coherent—Mara stands, steps, fumbles the book, reaches for the thread—and the cloak clasp is handled repeatedly, anchoring micro-setting to her body. The setting modestly constrains action (mirrors reflect the shadow, the labyrinth traps her inside) and the green luminance charges the climax image, lifting this into the mid-6s. Anchors are reused efficiently (mirrors, clasp, dictionary) without clutter.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake (break the curse, survive the shadow) is signaled early and Mara's agency drives the peak turn when she speaks the paradox and grips the thread. The tightening is present but thin: the shadow recoils, moths swarm, she holds firm, and the room shatters—escalation reads more as description than as narrowing options with visible cost. The thread vanishes without consequence beyond the cloak's glow upgrade, so the final image doesn't charge prior choices with felt loss. Under the Causal lens, the escalation is functional but the cost at closure remains abstract.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges around fear-as-illusion and the power of paradox, shown through Mara's refusal to flee and her spoken inversion. The cloak's lingering luminance recurs with shifting weight (inherited glow → resuscitation hum → final golden pulse) and the funhouse-as-devouring-mouth metaphor ties to the climax. However, Vey's final line—"Because fear, like beauty, is a lie. And lies unravel when exposed to the truth"—states the theme overtly, reducing resonance. The ending image (golden clasp, Vey's cold smile, "the truth that survives") gestures toward ambiguity but doesn't reweight prior material with undeniable pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Mara with clean focalization; no head-hopping. Vocabulary is elevated and consistent ("unbosomed," "repulsive allure," "lingering luminance") but occasionally drifts toward ornamental register ("testament to forgotten laughter," "grotesque mosaic of teeth and eyes") that reads writerly rather than Mara's lived perception under stress. Dialogue is sparse and serves goals—Vey urges, Mara questions—though both speak in similar cadences without strong voice distinction. The prose has texture and rhythm; short bursts at the climax ("She flinched but held firm") support pressure effectively.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout: "bruise-colored sky," "eyes like fractured glass," "diseased star," "sickly green," "grinding gears and shattered glass." In the climax beat multiple metaphors stack without clear vehicles, reducing clarity ("mosaic of teeth and eyes…shifting like smoke" then "thousand moths" then "glowing thread"). Template cadence appears in exposition: "Mara had been photographically cursed…The curse had left her…After her resuscitation…Now, driven by…" recycles structure across four sentences. Paraphrase loop: "The shadow recoiled, its luminance dimming. …The shadow wailed, its form dissolving." Information density is moderate; some lines do double duty (clasp bite = pain + commitment) but scaffolding intrudes ("she said, the words tasting of copper" after dialogue already conveys strain). No major loops touch closure, capping penalty at −0.8 under the Non-closure Accumulation Cap.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The core premise—cursed woman uses paradox from a dream dictionary to defeat fear—combines familiar gothic elements (haunted funhouse, inherited magical object, shadowy monster) without a fresh synthesis. The photographic curse is mentioned but never integrated into tactics; swapping it for any other isolating curse would leave the plot unchanged. The paradox mechanism (welcoming the unwelcome) is a known frame and arrives late without prior teaching. Emotional specificity is thin: Mara's terror and resolve are asserted through metaphor rather than particular, lived detail. The Vey reveal ("the truth that survives") hints at ambiguity but feels like setup for sequel rather than inevitable closure rooted in prior choices.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Vey (whispering advisor) is present in three beats: opening anchor, mid-scene dictionary prompt, and final exchange. His advice directly enables the climax turn (speak the paradox), satisfying Development and Payoff gates. However, his choices don't create pressure—Mara never resists or questions him until the final line, which arrives as character coloring rather than a decision that alters tactics. He observes and instructs without stake or cost tied to his presence; removing him and placing the dictionary insight in Mara's memory would require only minor edits. Early signal +0.5, beat involvement (3) +1.4, closure linkage (final exchange) +0.5 = baseline ~5.4. Swappability (Mara could recall the method herself) −0.6, ornamental closure cameo −0.3 = 4.5 → cap 3.8 for swappability.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The opera cloak clasp is handled in four beats: opening (brushing it), entry (tightening grip), climax (flaring luminance, biting into palm), and ending (pulsing golden). It appears early, recurs with evolving intensity (inherited glow → resuscitation hum → combat flare → permanent gold), and charges the final image, satisfying all three gates. The clasp's luminance enables the shadow banishment, though the exact mechanics (does the light weaken fear, or does Mara's grip channel courage?) remain vague, limiting irreplaceability. Early signal +0.6, beat involvement (4) +1.4, causal pressure (light affects shadow) +0.8, closure linkage (golden glow in final line) +1.2, specificity (inherited + resuscitation trigger) +0.5 = ~4.5 base. Mechanical vagueness −0.4, total 4.1 + gates (all three) → 6.4 eligible, rounded to 6.4.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Lingering luminance (core concept) is named repeatedly and the cloak's glow escalates across beats (faint → intense → green flare → golden pulse), satisfying Setup and Payoff. However, it functions as atmospheric effect rather than shaping tactics: Mara never leverages the light strategically, tests its limits, or pays a cost to sustain it. The middle beat involvement is weak—she grips the clasp and it flares, but she doesn't choose how or when to activate it, leaving Development gate only partially met. Early signal +0.5, beat presence (3 touches) +0.9, closure linkage (golden ending) +0.8 = ~2.2 base. Missing tactical constraint −0.8, ornamental middle use −0.4 = 1.0 + partial gates → 4.2.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>Photographically cursed (attribute) is mentioned in backstory ("every image of her turned to ash, every mirror reflection warped") and contributes to Mara's isolation motive, satisfying Setup. It never constrains or enables an on-page action—the funhouse mirrors are warped for everyone, not because of her curse, and she doesn't avoid/use mirrors tactically. The curse creates thematic resonance (fear of reflection, luminance as counter) but no visible cost or tradeoff in scene, failing Development and Payoff gates. Early mention +0.4, thematic coloring +0.2 = 0.6 base. Label-only −0.3, missing middle/closure action −1.0, summary-only −0.3 = −1.0 net → cap 2.8 for missing closure participation, further reduced to 2.1 for lack of on-page constraint.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Unbosom (action) is named explicitly twice: "You must unbosom it" (Vey's instruction) and "She unbosomed her fear, not by fleeing, but by standing still." The act of revealing/voicing fear is tied to the climax (Mara speaks "I welcome you" and "Your power is an illusion"), satisfying Setup and Payoff. However, the middle development is thin—unbosoming is equated with paradoxical speech, but Mara doesn't practice, fail, or refine the method, so the action doesn't constrain earlier tactics. The final turn hinges on this act, earning closure linkage, but the verb itself is somewhat swappable with "confront" or "voice" without structural loss. Early signal +0.5, closure linkage (speaking the paradox is the turn) +1.2, causal role +0.6 = 2.3 base. Swappability −0.5, missing distinct middle beat −0.3 = 1.5 + gates (two of three) → eligible to ~6.0, score 5.7 for moderate irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The dream dictionary (method) is introduced mid-scene when Vey prompts Mara to consult it; she pulls it from her pocket, reads the "carnival" entry, and uses the paradoxical instruction to defeat the shadow, satisfying Development and Payoff gates but missing Setup (no mention in opening third). The mechanics are asserted—dictionary says "feed it a lie," Vey translates to "welcome its presence," shadow recoils—but the cause-effect link (why does paradox work?) is unexplained, and Mara doesn't test or iterate, reducing mechanical weight. The method is indispensable to the climax turn, earning strong causal credit despite late arrival. Mid-scene intro (setup missing) −0.4, beat involvement (2 distinct: consult, apply) +0.9, causal pressure (enables climax) +1.0, closure linkage +0.8 = 2.3 base. Cap 4.6 for missing setup, mechanical vagueness −0.3 → 4.3, but method is load-bearing at climax, lift to 4.9 within cap tolerance.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The abandoned carnival funhouse (setting) frames the entire scene, is named in the opening line (Setup), provides the labyrinth that traps Mara and the mirrors that host the shadow (Development), and the room's final shuddering/cracking mirrors mark the climax resolution (Payoff), satisfying all three gates. The funhouse actively constrains choice (Mara must navigate mirrors, the shadow emerges from them) and the setting's collapse charges the ending image. Spatial details are tracked cleanly (gate, labyrinth, mirrors, walls). Early signal +0.7, beat involvement (entry, middle confrontation, climax collapse) +1.4, causal pressure (mirrors enable shadow, collapse signals defeat) +1.0, closure linkage (shuddering room) +0.9, specificity (carnival funhouse vs. generic dark room) +0.5 = 4.5 base + all gates → 6.8 eligible, minor scenic redundancy (mirrors mentioned repeatedly without evolving function) −0.2 = 6.6, round to 6.8 for strong closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>After the resuscitation (timeframe) is mentioned in backstory ("three nights prior") and motivates Mara's journey (the cloak awakened post-drowning), satisfying Setup. However, the timeframe doesn't create urgency or tighten choices in scene—there's no countdown, decay clock, or expiring opportunity. The "three nights" gap is static context rather than a live constraint. The resuscitation's effect (cloak awakening) is functional but the time itself is ornamental. Early mention +0.4, thematic link (death-brush → luminance boost) +0.3 = 0.7 base. Static time (no live clock) −0.5, missing middle/closure pressure −0.6 = −0.4 net → cap 3.4 for missing Development, lift slightly to 3.6 for motivational Setup.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>To trick fear into revealing its weakness (motivation) is stated explicitly in the opening ("driven by a motivation to trick fear") and shapes the climax tactic (speaking paradox to expose the shadow's illusory power), satisfying Setup and Payoff. However, the desire is announced rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses—Mara hesitates once ("she scoffed") but immediately complies with Vey's instruction without wrestling competing wants (survival vs. understanding, vengeance vs. escape). The final turn enacts the goal, but we don't see Mara question the cost or risk a different path. Early signal +0.5, closure linkage (paradox enacts the trick) +1.0, causal role +0.5 = 2.0 base. Told-only setup −0.5, missing friction (want vs. fear) −0.4 = 1.1 + gates (two of three) → eligible ~5.0–6.0, settle 5.3 for thin internal conflict.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Repulsive allure (tone) is embodied early ("The repulsive allure of the thing was undeniable; it pulsed like a diseased star, drawing her closer despite her terror") and recurs in descriptions of the shadow ("grotesque mosaic of teeth and eyes") and Mara's simultaneous dread and fascination, satisfying Setup. The tone modulates under pressure—initial dread, drawn fascination at confrontation, grim resolve at climax—supporting Development and Payoff. However, the allure component fades in the final third; after the paradox is spoken, the shadow becomes pure threat (wailing, swarming moths, searing thread) without the magnetic pull, weakening tonal coherence at closure. Early embodiment +0.7, beat involvement (opening, middle confrontation, climax partial) +0.9, closure linkage (partial; ending is cold rather than alluring) +0.4, modulation under pressure +0.5 = 2.5 base. Tonal drift at ending (loss of allure) −0.4 → 2.1 + all gates eligible → 5.8, acknowledging strong opening and mid-scene work with closure fade.</comment>
