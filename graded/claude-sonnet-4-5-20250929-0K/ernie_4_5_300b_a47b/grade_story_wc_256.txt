<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is clearly stated ("yearned to discover the texture of connection"), but her choices feel more reactive than driven by internal contradiction. The cave discovery sequence shows embodied perception ("skin prickled"), yet the final bell-ringing feels like a symbolic gesture rather than a choice with visible cost. Dr. Voss remains functional but applies minimal pressure. Interior voice lacks character-particular texture—"powerfully gentle" is repeated as a mantra rather than demonstrated through micro-choices under stress.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes a hybrid lens (causal journey + accumulative resonance) that holds through closure. Orientation anchors arrive cleanly within the first 120 words. The cave discovery provides one meaningful tightening that narrows Lira's understanding, and the ending offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise: "the pilgrimage wasn't over—it had just begun"). However, the cost remains conceptual and oblique—no visible forfeiture or tactical constraint appears on the page. The lens-dominant effect at closure is legible but the felt price is underdeveloped.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The lab and cave settings provide vivid sensory anchors ("brass dials," "damp earth," "carbide lamp"). The miner's lens functions as a micro-setting element that constrains Lira's approach and charges the final image when its scratches are revealed as grooves. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout the lab-to-cave transition. However, the mountain's "instrument" status emerges late without prior seeding, and the golden shadows recur as atmosphere without pressuring a choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—discovering connection's texture—is signaled early and coherent. One meaningful tightening occurs when Lira realizes the cave itself is an instrument, deepening her understanding. The ending crystallizes a stance ("We keep questioning") with conceptual pressure, qualifying as Charged Poise. Yet the escalation lacks a visible trade-off or tactical constraint; the lens discovery solves the mystery without Lira forfeiting a live option or paying an on-page price. Agency reads as observation more than decision under cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Theme (connection as presence rather than construction) emerges organically from the cave revelation and lens grooves. The final image ("We keep questioning") gestures toward open inquiry but stops short of a resonant, non-literal answer—it states the theme rather than embodying it through charged particulars. "Powerfully gentle" appears three times as a label without dramatized friction. The ending avoids moralizing yet also avoids embedding conceptual cost in a concrete image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization is clean with no head-hopping. Lira's perceptual signature includes iridescent threads and prism-song imagery, lending modest texture. Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven ("What now?" / "We keep questioning"). However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("coalescing into a melody," "symphony of contradictions") that feels imposed rather than character-particular. Free indirect style is clear, and psychic distance remains stable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear with varied sentence rhythm and no major loops. The opening line anchors voice and stakes effectively. Minor scaffold appears: "The lab's golden shadows" repeats twice as a scene-setter without evolution, and "powerfully gentle" recurs identically three times. Figurative language density is moderate ("whisper," "symphony of contradictions") but mostly legible. No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs harm momentum. Information density is adequate, though some lines ("its edges aligning with sensors that hadn't activated in decades") add atmospheric detail without advancing pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The premise—sound-as-texture research and a mountain-as-instrument—offers a modestly fresh synthesis. The lens-as-record-grooves reveal provides one non-obvious turn. However, the artificial pilgrimage and "questioning assumptions" method feel conceptually stated rather than dramatized through lived resistance or surprising cost. The emotional arc (curiosity → discovery → commitment to inquiry) follows a familiar template without bold risk or a perspective that feels singular. Transformation test: the plot could function with different sensor-object and different metaphor without structural change.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Lira appears early, drives the cave journey, and makes the lens discovery. Her decisions (inserting the lens, venturing into the cave, ringing the bell at closure) shape two beats and the ending. However, her choices feel more like puzzle-solving than high-cost agency; no visible trade-off forecloses a path. Present across all three gates with causal involvement, but swappable with a generic "researcher protagonist" without major edits.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The lens is introduced early, used functionally in two distinct beats (console insertion, cave carving), and returns with reweighted meaning at closure when its scratches are revealed as grooves encoding song. This reprise charges the thematic discovery and is irreplaceable—no other object carries this exact dual function. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage, though the middle beat (cave use) could be slightly more distinct from the setup.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The artificial pilgrimage frames Lira's journey and is named early. It shapes her decision to leave the lab and recurs in the final line ("the pilgrimage wasn't over—it had just begun"). However, it functions more as thematic frame than tactical constraint; the story would work as "research expedition" with minor edits. Present in setup and payoff but lacks middle development that narrows options or imposes cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Powerfully gentle" is introduced early and repeated three times as a self-reminder mantra. It does not visibly constrain or enable an on-page action with cost—Lira's approach (inserting the lens, exploring the cave) reads the same whether labeled gentle or not. The trait remains ornamental, a thematic echo rather than a lever that alters tactics or forecloses an option.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Propel" appears once in the opening ("propel the lab's research forward") as a stated task but does not recur or shape the climax. Lira's actions throughout are investigative rather than propulsive; she inserts, traces, presses, and rings without a distinct "propelling" gesture that drives a turn. The action is swappable with "advance" or "further" without structural change. Missing middle and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Questioning assumptions is named early ("Why do we assume sound is intangible?") and recurs at closure ("We keep questioning"). It enables the cave discovery when Lira traces a symbol rather than relying on machinery. The method is present across setup, development, and payoff, shaping one key turn. However, the mechanics feel declared rather than demonstrated through resistant friction or a visible cost tied to questioning itself. Functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The laboratory of lost sounds anchors the opening with vivid detail (brass dials, cracked tubes, console) and recurs at closure when the machines fall silent. The cave extension provides tactile resources (carvings, resonance) that enable the discovery. Setting participates in two beats and the ending, supplying both atmosphere and functional constraint. The lab's specific properties (hologram console, symbols) drive Lira's choices, though the cave could be replaced with another resonant structure without breaking logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>The timeframe appears in the opening line ("after the power grid stabilizes") and once more ("the world outside was still reeling from the grid's collapse"). It does not create urgency, tighten decisions, or alter tactics; the stabilization functions as backdrop rather than ticking constraint. Lira's journey proceeds at her own pace with no time pressure. Missing middle and closure participation; ornamental rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Lira's desire to discover connection's texture is stated early ("yearned to discover") and pursued actively across the console and cave sequences. It drives two beats and is answered at closure when she holds the lens and feels the texture ("both, and neither"). The motivation is present in all three gates and shapes the ending's conceptual charge. However, it is told more than dramatized through conflicting wants or visible cost; no alternate desire creates friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Golden shadows" appears in the opening and closing paragraphs, framing the piece with consistent atmospheric tone. The tone modulates slightly (dim light → carbide beam → evening deepening) without jarring shifts. However, it remains primarily decorative; the shadows do not constrain a choice or charge the final image with reweighted meaning. Present in setup and payoff with coherent mood, but lacks middle development and causal pressure. Lyric reprise without demonstrated cost.</comment>
