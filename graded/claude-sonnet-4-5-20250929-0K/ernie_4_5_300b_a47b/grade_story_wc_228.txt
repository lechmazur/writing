<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's interiority leans heavily on abstraction ("the world was fraying, and so was he") rather than embodied contradiction. The cave journey shows some micro-choices (choosing the left path, placing the shell), but the pivotal moment—seeing his mother's face in the pool—arrives without prior internal conflict between competing impulses. The final change reads as relief rather than renunciation with visible cost; no path is foreclosed on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural (reflection-led, recurring images, pattern reprise). Orientation is clean. The closure unit—placing the drawing beside the pool and carrying the cavern's peace—registers as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis via acceptance of fractures), but the cost is asserted ("weight of decades lifting") rather than shown through a forfeited option or dramatized price. The vision of his mother and the phrase "temporary eternity" recur but do not narrow tactics or alter knowledge in a way that changes his stance on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The coastal cave network constrains movement (narrow tunnel, forked path) and the cavern's fissure-lit pool charges the final image. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful (brine, limestone, pebbles crunching). Spatial choreography is coherent throughout. The painted shell functions as a micro-setting element that anchors both the opening and closure, meeting the 9+ gate requirement for constraint or charge.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding solace or beauty in fractures—is signaled early but remains abstract. The wrong turn and left-path choice constitute a tightening, yet no live option is foreclosed: Elias could return to the quay unchanged. The vision and placement of the shell feel like affirmation rather than a trade-off. Under the Accumulative lens, one deepening is present, but the cost at closure is told ("weight lifting") rather than shown as a visible price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme ("temporary eternity," beauty in fractures) emerges from recurring images—cracked mirror, painted shell, pool reflection—without overt statement. The final drawing-beside-the-pool image reweights prior material, but the line "to hold onto the temporary as if it were eternal" edges into thematic echo. The cavern functions as a non-literal answer to the question of how to live with fracture, though the epiphany lacks concrete cost or counter-reading on the page.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Single-POV distance is stable; perceptual signature (quay painter's eye, color vocabulary) is distinct and consistent. Diction remains voice-appropriate. The vision sequence ("She was younger, her smile unburdened by grief. 'You kept your promise,' she said, though her lips didn't move") introduces slight POV slippage—how does he know her lips didn't move if he sees only a reflection?—but recovers quickly and does not obscure the closure effect.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and sensory detail is concrete. Two paraphrase loops appear: "The world was fraying, and so was he" is echoed by "cracks in the mirror—and the cracks in his heart"; "temporary eternity" recurs in a way that reads as motif but borders on synonym churn. The scaffold phrase "He'd kept it hidden…a talisman against the tide of time" adds ornamentation without advancing pressure. Template cadence runs in the cave sequence ("He quickened his pace… He stepped forward… He knelt…") but do not obscure causality. Apply −0.6 for loops and template stems in Q7 only.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The nostalgic-artist-seeks-solace premise is widely used; the story transforms it through specific images (painted shell, fissure-lit pool, drawing placed beside water) and the cave setting. The "temporary eternity" paradox and the vision of his mother offer some fresh inflection, but the emotional arc—artist finds peace in hidden place—is conventional. The final image is vivid yet does not surprise or reweight in a non-obvious way.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elias is present throughout and makes the key choices (leave the quay, choose the left path, place the shell, draw the cavern), but his nostalgic-quay-painter identity does not constrain or enable tactics under pressure. His painter's eye colors perception but does not create a tradeoff. Setup and development are present; closure participation is functional but the occupation itself is swappable (could be a nostalgic sculptor, musician, etc.).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The painted seashell appears in three beats: opening (gift, talisman), packing into satchel, placement among cave shells, and final pocket carry. Early signal is strong. It charges the closure image by joining the chorus of muted shells. However, its painted colors do not constrain a choice or create visible cost; it functions more as a resonant motif than a causal agent. Lyric reprise is purposeful, but the element is not indispensable to plot logic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Temporary eternity" is named twice (mother's phrase, Elias's reflection) and evoked by the cavern's timeless quality, but it does not shape stakes or alter tactics on the page. It remains a thematic label rather than a constraint that narrows options. Present but ornamental; removing it would not break story logic, only soften thematic resonance. Late explicit return in the final third without middle development.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Intimately aloof" is named once in the cavern scene ("connected to the place, yet separate, as if he were both observer and participant"). The trait describes Elias's stance but does not constrain or enable an action with cost. Label-only mention; no visible tradeoff or choice that depends on this quality. Present but swappable with similar descriptors.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The reveal occurs in two beats: the vision of his mother in the pool and the realization that "the wrong turn had led him here." Both moments reweigh prior material. The vision is dramatized on the page and prompts the drawing action. However, the reveal does not redefine options in a way that forecloses a path; it affirms rather than transforms. Setup and payoff are present; causal pressure is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The wrong turn (veering left into the cave, then choosing the left fork) is signaled early and its mechanics matter: the forked path forces a choice, and the tunnel's narrowing creates spatial pressure. The method delivers the oasis (cavern) and shapes the middle beat. Causal role is clear in two beats (fork choice, cavern discovery) and contributes to closure. Essential to the story's spatial logic and discovery arc.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The coastal cave network pressures movement (narrow tunnel forcing a stoop, forked path demanding choice), supplies the cavern's pool and shells, and anchors the closure image. Spatial choreography is concrete and affects outcome. Setup, development (tunnel navigation), and payoff (cavern as hidden oasis) are all present. The setting is causally active across beats and indispensable to the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>"After the mirror cracks" frames the inciting incident (morning crack as sign) and the time of departure ("by the time he set out"). However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions or track a live clock. Elias has no deadline; he stays "until the sunlight faded" without consequence. Setup is present, but the element does not constrain tactics or add escalation pressure. Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The hidden promise ("to find beauty in the fractures, to hold onto the temporary as if it were eternal") is named late (final third reflection) and dramatized through the shell placement and drawing actions. The desire is present in his restlessness and cave journey, but it remains abstract and is not tested by a conflicting cost on the page. Setup (mother's gift, talisman), development (cave journey), and payoff (reflection) are present, but friction between want and price is minimal. Lyric reprise elevates it slightly above functional.</comment>
