<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lira's motivation to resurrect lost stories is stated early and embodied through her ritual of transcribing pirate broadcasts, but her interiority relies heavily on atmospheric reflection rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The final choice—stepping into the night with renewed purpose—feels more like confirmation than a path foreclosed with visible cost. Embodied emotion is present ("her throat tightened," "her fingers trembled") but some moments drift toward label-only sentiment ("a rare, fragile thing"). The copyist occupation anchors her worldview effectively, though no immediate pressure tests her dedication in a way that forces a genuine internal fork.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes orientation (who, where, when) within the opening and maintains a coherent Accumulative/Textural lens: fragments gather, the broadcast intensifies, the final image of Lira stepping into the night reweights her quest with a quiet cadence shift. However, the closure lacks a felt cost that forecloses an option—she ends exactly where she began, collecting fragments, with no visible sacrifice or tactical change. The structure is a single continuous scene, and causality within the broadcast sequence is clean, but the Resonant Reconfiguration reads more as affirmation than crystallization of stakes with undeniable pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The ember alcove is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (bioluminescent moss, mist, iron-and-memory air) and the setting subtly mirrors Lira's internal state through the glow and enclosure. The moss's breathing glow during the signal's peak ties environment to emotional beat, and the alcove's cliffside isolation reinforces her solitary quest. Spatial choreography is clear (radio, cloak pooling, boots on gravel outside), and the mist functions as a recurring atmospheric anchor. The micro-setting constrains her ritual and charges the final departure, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—resurrecting lost stories via pirate broadcasts—is signaled early and sustained, but pressure remains static across the scene. The broadcast strengthens, Lira transcribes, and she leaves; no reversal or tightening forecloses an option or alters tactics. The "key to unlocking the next fragment" is declared but not tested against cost or complication. Agency is present in her sustained attention and transcription, yet the resolution is incremental accumulation rather than a choice that narrows paths or deepens consequence under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme—the persistence of narrative and the quiet labor of memory—emerges through particulars (dust, fragments, static) without overt moralizing. The final image of teaching dust to sing offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question, and the father's "ghost bards" motif seeds early and returns with reweighted meaning. However, the thematic charge is diluted by exposition ("This was why she did it—not for glory, but for the quiet joy") that states rather than dramatizes the insight. The piece resists tidy morals and embraces complexity in the post-famine world, yet the ending affirms rather than reconfigures.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV is stable, third-person limited with consistent psychic distance and a distinct perceptual signature (Lira notices music notation, static patterns, her father's cloak). Diction is controlled and voice-motivated, with purposeful compression in phrases like "thistled calm" and "the dial glow." Elision of the broadcast's full content is functional, filtering perception through her deciphering method. Minor register drift appears in "the ember alcove had become a cocoon, its thistled calm wrapping around her like a second skin"—elevated but still within the lyric frame established early. No head-hopping, and the narrative stance modulates subtly with emotional intensity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Prose is generally clean with strong imagery ("mist curled like smoke from forgotten hearths," "the glow of the radio dial and the moss seemed to merge"), but a handful of artifacts dull momentum. "The cloak slipped from her shoulders, but she didn't notice" followed two paragraphs later by "She draped it over her shoulders" creates a minor continuity hiccup. Paraphrase loops appear: "This was why she did it" restates the motivation already dramatized. Template cadence in action beats ("She leaned closer," "She scribbled," "She adjusted," "She smiled," "She stood," "She stepped") stacks without variation. Figurative density is high but coherent; no mixed metaphors. Information density is solid, though some lines (the full description of the alcove's luminous moss) could compress further.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The premise—post-narrative-famine world, pirate broadcasts carrying story fragments, a copyist who transcribes from static—offers a fresh synthesis of archival labor and speculative context. The emotional core (quiet, solitary resurrection of lost things) feels particular to this voice and avoids template plot beats. However, the arc itself—character listens, transcribes, and leaves renewed—is structurally familiar, and the "story famine" framing remains abstract rather than viscerally constraining her choices. The father's "ghost bards" and the dust-teaching motif add specificity, but the piece does not take bold structural or perspectival risks that heighten stakes beyond the lyric accumulation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lira's occupation as orchestra copyist is signaled early, frames her perceptual signature (manuscript paper, sheet music), and informs her method of deciphering broadcasts. It appears in the opening, the transcription beat, and implicitly in the ledger mention at the end, satisfying setup and closure participation. However, her copyist skill does not constrain a key choice or enable a tactic under pressure—she listens and writes, actions that do not depend uniquely on her orchestral training. The element is thematically resonant but functionally swappable with "archivist" or "transcriber."</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The radio dial glow is handled in multiple beats: it traces her hands in the opening, illuminates the moss during the signal's peak, merges with the moss to create a halo, and dims at the end, marking the scene's temporal arc. The glow functions as a visual anchor and shifts meaning from solitary focus to transcendent fusion to quiet closure. It does not, however, constrain a choice or enable a tactic; its role is atmospheric and symbolic rather than causal. Setup, development, and closure participation are all present, and the element is irreplaceable in the story's visual logic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Pirate broadcasts shape Lira's nightly ritual, frame the dominant stake, and are the source of the fragments she collects. They appear in setup (her lifeline), drive the middle beat (the signal strengthens, she transcribes), and are implicit in the ending (she carries stories, "a pirate broadcaster in her own right"). The broadcasts define her tactics (tuning, deciphering) and the "ghost bards" motif charges the thematic layer. However, the pirate nature of the broadcast—its illegality or risk—never pressures a choice; it is context rather than complication. The concept is essential to the story's premise but does not narrow options or create on-page cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The moss's secret luminosity is described in the opening ("walls glowed secretly luminous") and intensifies during the broadcast peak ("the glow intensified, illuminating the moss in waves, as if the wall itself were breathing"). It contributes to atmosphere and mirrors the emotional crescendo, and it returns in the final paragraph as a faint anchor after the dial dims. The trait does not, however, enable or constrain an action with cost—Lira does not use the light, and its presence does not alter her tactics. Setup and closure participation are present, but middle development as causal pressure is absent. The element charges the setting but remains ornamental to choice.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The cloak appears in setup ("she wore her father's old cloak"), is adjusted mid-scene, slips during transcription, pools at her feet, and is draped again at the end. It recurs across beats and carries thematic weight (comfort, inheritance, connection to the father's sailor tales). However, none of these touches constrain a choice or alter tactics—Lira's actions would proceed identically without it. The cloak is a charged object in the lyric texture but does not drive a turn. Setup and closure participation are present; middle development as causal pressure is missing.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The method of deciphering via elusive song lyrics is signaled in the opening ("a method she'd developed after years of poring over sheet music and static") and executed in the middle beat ("The lyrics were garbled, but she'd learned to decipher them"). It shapes her tactics (listening, transcribing, stitching fragments) and is mentioned again in the ledger reference. However, the mechanics of how musical training aids lyric decipherment are asserted rather than demonstrated; the method does not narrow options or create visible cost on the page. Setup, middle signal, and closure mention are all present, but the method's specificity does not prove indispensable to the story's pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The ember alcove is established early as Lira's sanctuary, carved into a cliffside overlooking ashen plains, with mist curling at the entrance. It appears in setup, frames the entire middle sequence (the radio ritual unfolds within its glow and enclosure), and is sealed by mist in the ending as Lira steps outside. The alcove's isolation and sensory texture (iron taste, luminous walls, mist curtain) shape the ritual's intimacy and charge the final departure with spatial contrast (enclosed sanctuary → vast plains). The setting does not constrain a tactical choice, but it supplies the micro-environment that makes the transcription legible and the ending resonant. Setup, development, and closure participation are all strong.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The story famine is referenced in backstory ("that grim decade when silence had swallowed the world's narratives") and frames Lira's motivation, but it does not tighten present decisions or tactics. The temporal context is static backdrop rather than live clock; no on-page pressure derives from the famine's ongoing consequences. The element is present in setup and implicit in the ending (her vow to teach dust to tell stories), but it does not alter moves or create urgency. The timeframe is thematically resonant but causally inert.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Lira's motivation to teach dust to tell stories is declared early ("she believed that even the quietest things held voices"), dramatized through her nightly transcription ritual, tested when the signal strengthens ("This was it—the key"), and reaffirmed in the ending ("she would spend her life teaching the dust to sing"). The desire drives her sustained action and shapes the story's arc. However, the motivation is never conflicted or complicated by cost—no friction between want and consequence, no moment where the price of listening becomes visceral. Setup, middle involvement, and closure participation are all present, but the lack of on-page friction or tradeoff limits the element's causal force.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The tone "thistled calm" is evoked through diction ("the alcove had become a cocoon, its thistled calm wrapping around her"), sensory restraint (quiet glow, mist, soft sounds), and pacing (deliberate, unhurried beats). The tone remains coherent across the scene and modulates subtly as the signal intensifies, but the modulation is atmospheric rather than charged with escalating pressure. The final image sustains the calm rather than breaking or reweighting it. The element is present in setup and ending, with middle texture consistent, but it does not shift under pressure or charge the closure beat with new meaning. Tone is a stable aesthetic layer rather than a dynamic force.</comment>
