<comment>Clara's interiority is clear and embodied through action (tracing constellations, gripping the nib until it bites her palm). Her decision to expose her father is motivated by established values ("devotedly observant," truth-seeking), though the speed of her overnight investigation and immediate willingness to destroy her family legacy feel compressed. The internal conflict between loyalty and truth is present but could use more contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene rather than a relatively smooth progression from shock to resolve. Minor deduction for the journalist relationship lacking pressure dynamics and Clara's mother's reaction ("How could you?") reading as stock rather than specific to their established dynamic.</comment>

<comment>Drive lens: Causal with Accumulative elements (the observatory/nib motif). Orientation anchors (Clara, observatory, post-midnight call) arrive cleanly. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Clara resumes work with the nib now in a fountain pen, writing op-eds and testifying—she's crystallized her stance with visible cost (family rupture, public censure). The causal chain from journalist's call → archival investigation → exposure → ongoing atonement holds, though the middle section (overnight research montage) compresses discovery without meaningful resistance or false leads. One meaningful tightening occurs when she finds her father's handwritten note, which narrows options and drives the exposure decision.</comment>

<comment>The observatory is vividly established (dome humming, gears grinding, glass and steel sanctuary above clouds) and returns meaningfully at closure when the dome opens to reveal pink sky. The rosewood desk and nib anchor micro-setting throughout. The 1987 memo's coffee stain is a nice specific detail, though the library and its "decades of records" remain generic. The observatory's isolation constrains Clara's choice by removing social friction during the decision, and the telescope gesture ("see beyond the horizon") charges the exposure moment, pushing this toward the 9+ gate but not fully crossing due to the generic treatment of the library space during the pivotal research sequence.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake (exposing family corruption vs. preserving legacy) is signaled early and coheres under the Causal lens. The midnight call establishes stakes, the handwritten memo escalates by personalizing the betrayal ("Don't let Clara see this"), and the exposure decision forecloses the path of complicit silence with visible cost (legal threats, mother's grief, public censure). The journalist's arrival provides a reversal opportunity but resolves too smoothly—he simply accepts her evidence without resistance. Clara's agency drives the turn, though the overnight research montage skips potential complications (missing documents, ambiguous evidence) that would have deepened pressure. One meaningful tightening with felt cost present, but the escalation could be sharper.</comment>

<grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Theme (truth vs. complicity, the weight of legacy) emerges through Clara's actions and the recurring orbit/black hole imagery rather than direct statement. The nib shifts meaning from relic to weapon to tool across the story, and the grandfather's "see beyond the horizon" line reweights at closure when Clara chooses exposure. "Orbits of regret still spun, but she'd learned to dance in their gravity" skirts moralizing but stays grounded in her ongoing testimony and op-eds. The final image (dome opening to pink sky, nib cold against fingertips, truth as compass) offers resonance without stating a thesis. Minor deduction for "Truth, she realized, wasn't a destination—it was a compass" threading close to explicit theme articulation, though the action context partially earns it.</comment>

<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Clara with consistent psychic distance. Voice carries distinct texture through astronomical/orbital metaphors ("Orbits of regret," "black hole, swallowing truths") that feel character-specific. Dialogue is sparse but functional; the journalist's lines pursue goals economically. Perceptual signature is clear (Clara maps stars, notices margins and coffee stains). Minor slips: "newsprint heiress and amateur astronomer" reads expository in the opening, and the mother's "How could you?" is generic. Free indirect style is clean throughout. The narrative voice modulates appropriately from contemplative opening to urgent research to resigned closure without filter-verb stacking or register drift.</comment>

<grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is generally clean with varied sentence rhythm and strong momentum. Information density is high in the research sequence. Minor loop: "She'd never used it; the nib was a relic" and later "the nib now screwed into a fountain pen" nearly restates the relic-to-tool transformation. Template cadence appears in the headlines paragraph: "Her father's lawyers demanded… Her mother wept… Clara unplugged…" (three parallel constructions). Stock metaphor: "black hole, swallowing truths" is functional but worn. The observatory's "gears grinding like a celestial heartbeat" and "dome hummed" create vivid opening anchors. No major clarity issues, but the figurative density (orbits, compass, horizon, sunlight) in the final paragraphs risks slight overwriting without quite crossing into opacity. Propulsion remains strong throughout.</comment>

<grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>The premise (heiress exposes family corruption) follows a familiar template, though the observatory setting and astronomer angle provide some specificity. The nib as both relic and truth-telling instrument is a purposeful touch. The "proof by contradiction" method is mentioned but not dramatized in a fresh way—Clara simply finds incriminating documents rather than constructing an elegant logical trap. Emotional specificity (the nib biting her palm, her grandfather's legacy reframed) elevates above generic execution. The "orbits of regret" conceit is extended throughout but doesn't fully transform the core whistleblower narrative. The story commits to its premise and follows through with visible cost, landing in competent territory without a non-obvious synthesis or bold structural risk that would push higher.</comment>

<question>9 A</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Clara (newsprint heiress) is present throughout, established in the opening line. Her heiress status directly creates the stakes (inheriting a corrupted fortune/legacy) and her decision to expose rather than protect the family drives the key turn. She appears in setup, constrains the middle choice (to investigate or ignore), and drives closure (ongoing testimony, op-eds). Her wealth funds the observatory sanctuary and her family name gives weight to the exposure. Removing "heiress" would require fundamental restructuring—she could be any relative, but the inheritance angle and public platform are causally tied to the stakes. Cost is visible (family rupture, legal threats). Strong integration across all three gates.</comment>

<question>9 B</question>
<grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>The rosewood pen nib is introduced in the opening (drawer, relic, silent witness), returns when Clara grips it during research (trembling, biting her palm), is handed to the journalist ("Write your story"), reappears screwed into a fountain pen for her op-eds, and closes the story ("nib cold against her fingertips"). Appears in five distinct beats across setup, middle, and closure. The nib shifts from relic to evidence to active tool, materially altering Clara's tactics (she writes with it rather than just observing). However, the journalist's use of it is summary-only ("the nib clutched in his fist" then vanishes), and its physical properties (sharpness to "split truth from lies") are more metaphorical than mechanically constraining. Strong reprise and closure linkage, but the middle use could be more causally specific.</comment>

<question>9 C</question>
<grade>5.2</grade>
<comment>"Orbits of regret" appears three times: Clara thinks it after the call, the narration uses "orbit isn't one of light," and the closing paragraph states "Orbits of regret still spun, but she'd learned to dance in their gravity." The concept frames her decision (past circling back, demanding reckoning) and charges the final image (learning to dance in gravity = living with ongoing consequences). However, the concept is more thematic coloring than a mechanical constraint—it doesn't shape specific tactical choices on the page the way a literal orbit or cycle might. It's used as metaphor and articulated meaning rather than altering options mid-scene. Present in setup and closure with some middle echo, but primarily operates as theme rather than stake-shaper. Reaches lyric-resonance allowance range but not higher causal bands.</comment>

<question>9 D</question>
<grade>6.6</grade>
<comment>"Devotedly observant" is stated early ("She was devotedly observant, always had been") with childhood star-mapping as evidence. The trait enables her investigative success (noticing the coffee stain margin note, cross-referencing dates) and constrains her choice—she cannot ignore the evidence once observed. The attribute drives the middle research beat and the decision to expose. However, the phrase itself is label-heavy and the trait's cost (she cannot unsee corruption, cannot choose ignorant bliss) is implied rather than dramatized as a visible trade-off in a specific moment. The trait is functional across setup and middle with closure contribution (ongoing observation = testimony), but the execution leans toward told competence rather than a scene where observation forecloses a comfortable option with felt cost on the page.</comment>

<question>9 E</question>
<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>"Intervene" is explicitly named at the climax ("today, I choose to intervene. Not with silence, but with sunlight") and enacted through giving the journalist the nib/evidence, then sustained through op-eds, donations, and testimony. The intervention is setup by the journalist's call (an invitation to act or ignore), developed through the research choice (gathering ammunition), and executed/sustained at closure. Removing "intervene" would require reframing the entire arc—she could discover and sit on the evidence, or leak anonymously. The specific choice to intervene publicly and personally (heiress exposes own family) defines the story's turn and cost. Clara's agency drives it. All three gates with strong causal linkage and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 F</question>
<grade>4.2</grade>
<comment>"Proof by contradiction" is named once: "assume innocence, then dismantle it with evidence." Clara does investigate her father's records and find contradictions (pristine reports vs. margin notes), but the method isn't mechanically distinct from standard investigative journalism—she simply finds incriminating documents rather than constructing a formal logical trap where assuming innocence leads to an impossible conclusion. The phrase appears in setup, has minimal middle development (the coffee-stain memo contradicts the official report, but that's straightforward evidence rather than reductio ad absurdum), and doesn't return at closure. Swappable with "investigative research" or "due diligence" without significant structural change. Present but more decorative than load-bearing.</comment>

<question>9 G</question>
<grade>5.9</grade>
<comment>The "echoing observatory above clouds" is established in the opening (dome, gears, glass and steel, isolation) and returns at closure (dome opens, pink sky). The setting provides sanctuary and isolation during Clara's decision (no immediate social pressure to protect family), and the grandfather's "see beyond the horizon" origin story charges her choice to expose. The "above clouds" altitude reinforces her remove from the town/factory below. However, the observatory's physical properties (echoing acoustics, telescope, library) are described but don't mechanically constrain choices—she could conduct this research in any private library. The setting functions more as symbolic space (truth-seeking sanctuary) than tactical pressure. Setup and closure presence with thematic resonance, but limited middle constraint. Reaches mid-band via lyric reprise but not higher causal bands.</comment>

<question>9 H</question>
<grade>5.8</grade>
<comment>"After the journalist calls" is the explicit timeframe anchor: the story opens post-midnight call, progresses through one night of research, the journalist arrives "at noon," headlines appear "days later," and closure is "one evening" after sustained public work. The tight window (call to noon) compresses Clara's decision and creates urgency for the research sequence. However, the "days later" and "one evening" coda shifts to summary mode, and the timeframe doesn't create a ticking-clock pressure (no deadline, no race against lawyers or cover-up). Time structures the sequence but doesn't tighten tactics—Clara could take a week to research with similar results. Present in setup, tracks through middle, mentioned at closure, but operates as structure rather than constraint. Functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 I</question>
<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>"To discover hidden truths" is Clara's stated drive ("If her father had hidden corruption, she'd unearth it") and enacted through the overnight research. The motivation is established early (childhood star-mapping to escape "cold silences" = habitual truth-seeking), tested in the middle (finding the memo confronts her with unwanted truth), and sustained at closure (ongoing testimony, "next contradiction"). The desire conflicts with her prior belief in her father's "golden" legacy, creating visible cost when discovery destroys that belief. The friction between wanting truth and wanting to preserve family legacy is present, though the story resolves it relatively cleanly in favor of truth without extended ambivalence. All three gates with causal pressure and closure linkage, but the want-vs.-cost tension could be sharper in the moment of decision.</comment>

<question>9 J</question>
<grade>4.8</grade>
<comment>"Solemn playfulness" is difficult to locate on the page. The tone is consistently earnest and grave (family corruption, betrayal, public exposure, mother's tears), with metaphorical language (orbits, black holes, compass) that reads more poetic than playful. The closest approach to playfulness might be Clara's smile at being called "reckless, idealistic" ("She smiled. Let them."), but that's brief defiance rather than sustained tonal modulation. The observatory's "gears grinding like a celestial heartbeat" has some whimsy, but the overall register is solemn without ironic distance or tonal counterpoint. If "solemn playfulness" was intended as a conceptual dance (treating serious moral questions with imaginative metaphor), it's not taught or sustained as a coherent tone. Largely absent as a modulating force; the story reads as uniformly serious.</comment>
