<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's warmly inquisitive nature is shown through her tracing symbols and yearning to solve the puzzle, but her final choice to hand over the diary and goggles feels unearned—no visible internal conflict or foreclosed path. The widow is sketched through grief and trembling hands, yet remains a porcelain mask without contradictory impulses acting in scene. Mara's embodied reactions (chest tightening, breath fogging glass) anchor emotion, but the shift from tidying servant to truth-seeker lacks a dramatized cost that would elevate the change.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly by the first paragraph. The diary discovery shifts Mara's goal from tidying to truth-seeking, and the goggles reveal hidden patterns—a meaningful tightening. Closure lands as Charged Poise: Mara steps onto the tenth floor with diary and goggles, the widow's grief cracking, and a flame flickering above the clouds. The cost is felt (the widow's mask breaks, Mara commits to ascent), though the final beat could sharpen the foreclosed path more explicitly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The icebound spire, frosted glass, and pale gold light create a vivid, coherent atmosphere. The goggles function as micro-setting, revealing hidden ice-vein patterns that constrain Mara's perception and enable her insight. Sensory detail is purposeful: dust sparkling like starlight, breath fogging glass, wind through frozen pines. The tenth floor as "cavern of ice and memory" charges the final image, making the environment integral to the closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—understanding the captain's death and the widow's grief—is signaled early and tightens when Mara finds the diary and goggles. The reversal (captain chose this end, lured beyond the veil) narrows Mara's options to either surrender the artifacts or keep searching. The widow's cracking detachment and Mara's decision to step onto the tenth floor with the tools in hand provide a visible tightening with felt cost, though the price could be more explicitly foregrounded in the final beat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—joy and anguish as twins, the flame that cannot be smothered—emerges from the diary's symbols, the widow's grief, and the captain's choice. The goggles and phoenix symbol recur with reweighted meaning at closure. Mara's final hand-to-chest gesture ("the flame still burns—here") risks on-the-nose thematic statement but is saved by the embodied action and the widow's laugh, which complicate the sentiment. The ending's image of a flickering flame above the clouds offers resonance without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable and specific to Mara's perception: "warmly inquisitive," tracing symbols, yearning to solve. Dialogue carries subtext (widow's "You found nothing" is declarative, not questioning; Mara's "I ascend" is both literal and metaphorical). Minor slips: "affectionate in her detachment" reads like external narration rather than Mara's self-perception, and the widow's "You're clever for a servant" edges toward convenience exposition. Rhythmic control is strong, with short beats at the handover and the final step onto the tenth floor.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies effectively, and imagery is concrete (dust sparkling like starlight, lenses catching light like twin suns). Template-cadence issue: "Mara's fingers brushed…Mara hesitated…Mara picked them up…Mara's chest tightened…Mara tucked…Mara met her gaze…Mara pulled…Mara said…Mara stepped out" stacks protagonist-name sentence openers across ~15 lines, creating a mechanical drum. Figurative language is dense in the opening (gears grinding like a tired heart, clouds thin into wisps, grief like a second skin, symbols swirling like storm clouds) without a taught lyric pattern, edging toward overwriting. Minor filter-verb stack in middle section ("Mara's mind raced…She traced…She adjusted…peering through").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The icebound spire and encrypted diary offer a fresh synthesis of gothic isolation and steampunk discovery, avoiding pure genre pastiche. The goggles-as-lens-for-truth and the phoenix-from-ice motif feel purposeful but not wholly surprising. The widow's contradictory impulses (forbidding mention of the crash, yet picking the diary's lock) add specificity. However, the core emotional arc—servant discovers truth, confronts grieving widow, steps toward mystery—follows a familiar template without a bold structural or moral risk that would elevate originality into the high band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mara (ascending servant) is present throughout and makes key choices: opening the diary, adjusting the goggles, handing them to the widow, and stepping onto the tenth floor. Her observation drives the middle beats, and her final decision to pursue the flame above the clouds alters her trajectory. However, the choice lacks visible cost—she does not forfeit safety, relationship, or prior goal in a way that irreversibly narrows options.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The goggles appear in three beats: discovery near the diary, adjustment to reveal hidden ice patterns, and handover to the widow where lenses catch light. They enable Mara's insight (diary symbols unfold) and charge the widow's reaction. The goggles' cracked lenses and frayed strap tie them to the captain's last voyage, making them causally active. Removing them would break the revelation mechanism and weaken the closure's visual charge.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The encrypted diary discovery shapes the dominant stake: Mara's goal shifts from tidying to understanding the captain's final days. The diary's symbols and the phrase "joy beneath anguish" drive her tactics (tracing, adjusting goggles, handing it to the widow). It appears in setup, middle, and closure, and its encrypted nature matters to the unfolding action. However, the decryption feels passive (symbols "seep into her like ink") rather than Mara actively choosing to decode under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Warmly inquisitive" is mentioned once as a label ("her warmly inquisitive nature prickling") and shown through Mara tracing symbols and yearning to solve the puzzle. It enables her investigation but does not visibly constrain a choice or impose a cost—Mara never pays a price for her curiosity (no rebuke, no danger, no foreclosed safety). The trait is functional but replaceable with "curious" or "observant" without structural change.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Unfold" is the pivot action: the diary's symbols unfold when Mara adjusts the goggles, revealing the captain's philosophy and the ice-vein map. This beat changes Mara's knowledge and enables the widow handover. It appears at the structural turn and charges the closure image. However, the mechanics are soft ("meanings seeping into her like ink")—Mara does not perform a difficult, costly choice to unfold the symbols; they unfold for her once she dons the goggles.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Through scattered light" is mentioned in the setup ("desk sat near a window, bathed in the pale gold of scattered light") and at the goggles beat ("peered through the scattered light"). The light enables the goggles' revelation of ice patterns. However, the method's mechanics remain vague—it is unclear why scattered light specifically matters versus direct light or shadow. The element is present and functional but not irreplaceable; "through the lenses" would serve nearly as well.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The icebound spire frames the entire story (elevator ascending, frosted glass, clouds below, ice veins revealed through goggles, tenth floor as "cavern of ice and memory"). The spire's verticality and isolation pressure the widow's grief and Mara's ascent. The ice veins revealed by the goggles function as micro-setting that alters Mara's perception. The final step onto the tenth floor and the flame "above the clouds" use the spire's height to charge the closure. Removing the spire would require a full spatial rewrite.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The elevator climb is mentioned in the opening and twice more ("elevator neared the tenth floor," "elevator doors opened"), but elapsed time and urgency are not tracked. Mara's investigation (finding diary, adjusting goggles, reading entries, handing artifacts to widow) could occur across thirty seconds or ten minutes without contradiction. The timeframe is present but does not tighten decisions or impose a visible countdown that alters tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The motivation "to seek out the joy beneath anguish" is seeded in the captain's diary phrase and echoed in Mara's declaration to the widow ("He believed joy and anguish are twins") and her final commitment ("Somewhere above the clouds, a flame flickered. She'd find it"). However, the desire is told more than dramatized in choice—Mara never sacrifices safety, relationship, or certainty to pursue this joy. The motivation shapes theme but lacks visible friction or cost in the closure beat.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Affectionate detachment" modulates across the story: Mara's professional distance ("pretend not to notice the widow's trembling hands"), her gentle empathy ("pressed a hand to the widow's chest"), and the widow's rueful acknowledgment ("You're clever for a servant," not unkindly). The tone charges the final handover and step onto the tenth floor, where detachment (Mara's shrug, "I ascend") coexists with affection (the widow's laugh, Mara's pursuit of the flame). The phrase "affectionate in her detachment" risks label-speak but the tonal balance holds through closure.</comment>
