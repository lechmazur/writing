<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to teach vanishing is stated but never tested through on-page choices that foreclose options. The backward-aging premise remains decorative; her decisions don't emerge from aging-related contradictions or embodied costs. Lira's "desperate" need is told, not shown through micro-choices under competing pressures. Elara's withholding reads as authorial manipulation rather than character-driven constraint with visible internal conflict.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation debt persists past 120 words—"floating rock meditation platform" and "magnetic grotto" hover without spatial anchors or grounding who/where/when until the apprentice appears mid-story. The closure unit (Lira's "becoming" insight) attempts Conceptual Repricing but the cost is absent: no visible forfeiture, altered tactic, or foreclosed path on the page. The stone-throwing recurs but doesn't tighten options; weeks pass in summary without escalating pressure or on-page stakes crystallization.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The grotto's bioluminescent moss and fractal ripples offer vivid texture, but spatial choreography remains vague—how high does the platform float, how does Elara move between platform and grotto edge, where does Lira sit in relation to Elara? The obsidian stone constrains the method but doesn't alter a tactical choice. Sensory detail stays visual; no embodied heat, cold, wind, or bodily consequence of the magnetic hum.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—teaching vanishing—is declared but never faces on-page resistance or cost. Elara's withholding has no visible price; Lira's "desperate" questions occur in summary across weeks without a scene where she must choose between competing needs. The final "I see it" moment is cognitive, not a decision that forecloses a path. No reversal or deepening narrows options; the stone-throw recurs without escalating pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The vanishing/appearing theme emerges through the stone-ripple motif and recurs at closure, offering modest resonance. However, the final insight "It's not about disappearing. It's about… becoming" veers toward thematic echo and restates the premise without reweighting prior material with cost. The delayed-revelation concept is present but functions as a told attribute rather than a dramatized friction. No counter-reading or moral ambiguity; the lesson lands cleanly without complication.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>POV remains stable in third-limited on Elara; no head-hopping. Diction leans ornate throughout—"sycamore hush," "liquid mercury," "fractal patterns"—without modulating under pressure or reflecting Elara's particular scientific idiom versus her mystical goals. Lira's single line of dialogue carries subtext, but her voice isn't distinguished from narrative register. Perceptual signature is generic; the backward-aging researcher's way of noticing doesn't feel biased or selective in character-specific ways.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Overwriting pervades: most sentences carry figurative load—"spun silver," "breath of the wind," "mosaic of light and shadow"—without pattern-teaching or payoff, triggering density penalty. Paraphrase loop: "vanishing was not about leaving but about arriving unnoticed" then "see not what is, but what could be" restates without added pressure. Template cadence in opening: "She was… Her hair… her eyes…" Filter-verb stack in trance passage dulls immediacy. Artifacts touch the closure beat ("glimmer of it, the first thread"), disallowing 9+ globally and adding −0.5.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The backward-aging researcher, magnetic grotto, and vanishing-as-appearing cluster reads as prompt-derived assembly without organic synthesis. The delayed-revelation frame is told rather than enacted through withheld information that creates story friction. Stone-ripple divination and the patient-mentor trope are familiar; the piece doesn't transform them through specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The final "becoming" insight feels inevitable by design rather than surprising in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>Elara's backward aging is described in the opening but never constrains a choice or creates a visible cost. Her hair color and eye sharpness shift off-page; no on-page moment shows aging affecting her decisions, memory, or tactics. The trait remains ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The grotto appears in setup, middle (trance descent), and closure (Lira's throw), satisfying all three gates. It enables the stone-throw method and charges the final beat when Lira's ripple shifts to a spiral. However, the grotto's magnetic properties don't constrain a tactical choice or impose a felt cost; it functions as backdrop. Specificity is high but causal pressure is modest.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Delayed revelation is stated as Elara's method and recurs in her withholding across weeks. It shapes the frame but doesn't narrow options or create on-page friction—Lira's questions are summarized, not dramatized as competing pressures. The concept is present and consistent but functionally swappable with "patience" or "gradual teaching."</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Elara "weaves truth carefully" and withholds the final piece across the story, satisfying setup and development. However, no on-page cost or tradeoff is shown; her silence doesn't risk losing Lira or create internal conflict. The trait is label-only and doesn't constrain a pivotal choice.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Withholding structures the story and recurs in Elara's refusal to elaborate and her watching Lira struggle. It appears in setup, middle, and is implicitly resolved when Lira reaches insight. However, the withholding doesn't create a dramatic reversal or alter tactics; the story would function similarly if Elara simply demonstrated without comment. Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Stone-throw ripples appear early (Elara's obsidian stone), recur in middle (fractal patterns), and return at closure when Lira's throw produces a spiral. The method is signaled and its changing pattern matters to the ending's cognitive shift. However, the mechanics are visual metaphor rather than tactical constraint; the stone doesn't limit or enable a choice with cost. Lyric reprise reweights meaning modestly.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The floating platform is introduced early and hosts the opening trance and closing scene, satisfying setup and closure. However, it doesn't constrain a choice—Elara could meditate anywhere; the magnetic hum is described but doesn't alter tactics or impose cost. The setting is vivid but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Trance is mentioned in setup ("entering the trance") and enables the grotto vision in the middle beat. "Days passed, then weeks" summarizes elapsed time but doesn't create urgency or tighten decisions. The timeframe is present but doesn't shape tactics or closure; easily swappable with "meditation" or "study."</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Teaching vanishing is stated early and recurs across the story, driving Elara's withholding and Lira's questions. It frames the ending's "becoming" insight. However, the goal is never conflicted on the page—no scene where Elara must choose between teaching and another cost, or where Lira's need creates friction. Told motivation without dramatized friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Sycamore hush" opens the story and the quiet, contemplative register holds through the ending's whispered realization. Tone modulates slightly—Lira's "desperate" questions are told but the final "trembling" voice lands—and the hushed atmosphere charges the closure image. However, the ornate diction remains static across pressure beats rather than tightening. Coherent and present at closure with modest modulation.</comment>
