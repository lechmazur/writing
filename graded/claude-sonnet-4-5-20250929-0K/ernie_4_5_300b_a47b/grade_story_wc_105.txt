<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lira's interiority leans heavily on abstract sensory synesthesia ("lavender static," "green hum of moss") that feels ornamental rather than viscerally embodied. Her motivation to capture "the sound of trust breaking" is declared but never meaningfully tested by internal contradiction or a difficult micro-choice under pressure. The father's disappearance drives backstory but doesn't create a live on-page conflict that forces her to choose between competing goods. The final smile reads as self-satisfied rather than earned by a visible cost that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly in the opening paragraph. The piece tracks one continuous scene in the greenhouse with clear spatial choreography. However, closure relies on a device she assembles that "emits a final, resonant tone" of her father's ship sinking—this memory crystallization is asserted rather than dramatized, and no on-page cost or foreclosed option is visible in the final beat. The ending gesture ("she smiled, battered but marveling") claims triumph without showing what she has sacrificed or what path is now closed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The sunken orchard greenhouse, aurora glow, and ashen forge are vivid and purposefully recurse across beats. The forge anchors two distinct actions (feeling residual warmth, then mixing absences in the crucible), and the dead peach tree root serves as a plot-critical ingredient. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout. The setting constraints do not visibly narrow a choice at closure—Lira moves freely among all needed resources without tradeoff—which keeps the score below 8.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—capturing the sound of trust breaking—is signaled early but remains abstract. The story delivers one meaningful tightening when she adds the root to the crucible and the mixture erupts, yet this turn is the result of serial ingredient gathering rather than a choice that forecloses a live option or forces a trade-off. No visible cost attaches to her final success; she assembles the device, wears it, and smiles. Agency at closure is decorative rather than causal under any lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Theme (memory, absence, betrayal, trust) emerges through the recurring images of the forge, absences-as-vials, and the modified trees. Yet the ending offers no non-literal answer or reweighting—she succeeds in her quest and the final line ("the absence where love should be") restates the premise rather than repricing it. The piece avoids overt moralizing but also sidesteps thematic friction or cost, leaving the conceptual stakes static.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature tied to Lira's synesthesia. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("ephemeral resonance," "cellular regeneration") that feels more authorial than character-particular under pressure. No dialogue is present. The prose modulates appropriately through the forge sequence, and internal voice remains consistent, but the elision of her father's fate and the mechanics of memory-sound are conveniences rather than purposeful compression that pays off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and sensory detail is selective. However, the piece displays mild overwriting: "spectral light that seeped through the fractured roof like liquid mercury," "swirls of crimson and gold," "a scream of glass shattering, of promises unraveling" stack figurative language in peak beats without tight causal linkage. Paraphrase loops appear ("the sound of trust breaking" recurs four times with minimal variation). One instance of template cadence: "She pressed… She poured… She added…" structures three sequential beats identically. No artifacts touch the closure image directly, but cumulative density drag warrants −0.6 within band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The core premise—sound designer collecting absences to forge emotional frequencies—is imaginative in concept but executes through familiar quest-object mechanics: gather vials, stir, add catalyst, succeed. The father's disappearance and the greenhouse ringed by shipwrecks are evocative but not transformed beyond their initial genre staging. The ending offers no fresh turn or inflection; Lira achieves exactly what she set out to do without surprise or reweighting. Specificity (synesthesia, liquid memory vials) provides texture but not structural originality.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Lira is on-page throughout, and her occupation informs the premise. However, her choices are procedural—kneel, dig, pour, stir—rather than decisional. No key turn hinges on a hearing aid designer's unique trade-off or constraint; another inventor could execute the same sequence. Setup is immediate, development is functional (she assembles components), but closure participation is ornamental (she wears the device and smiles). Swappable with "memory technician" or "sound sculptor" without altering structure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The forge appears early, is handled in two distinct beats (feeling residual warmth; crucible mixing), and anchors the climactic assembly. However, its "ashen and cold" state is static—no rekindling or transformation under the aurora's influence; it serves as a container rather than an active constraint. The aurora itself is scenic backdrop, not a force that alters tactics or cost. Present across setup, development, and payoff, but causal pressure is moderate and the ending does not recharge its meaning.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Memories are thematically central (father's notes, trees storing memories, liquid memory vials) but do not shape on-page stakes. The concept appears as world-building exposition and closure assertion ("the exact moment… trust had fractured") rather than a constraint that narrows options or forces a trade-off. Functional setup and development, but closure participation is label-only. Could be replaced with "impact of grief" or "echoes of betrayal" without structural rewrite.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Synesthesia is introduced in the opening paragraph and recurs ("every color a note, every absence a chord" at closure). However, it functions descriptively rather than as a constraint—there is no moment where hearing colors enables a discovery or imposes a cost that alters her path. The trait decorates her perception but does not drive a beat or choice. Present in setup and payoff, missing development pressure; swappable with "sees auras" or "tastes emotions."</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The imprinting action anchors the story's procedural spine: she collects absences, stirs them, and pours the result into a hearing aid mold. Major turns trace to this method (eruption when root is added; final tone emission). However, the action is linear ingredient-gathering without a pivot or cost—she succeeds exactly as planned. Present across all three gates, drives two beats, but lacks causal friction or cost at closure. Mid-band because the ending's assertion depends on it, yet it could be "record," "synthesize," or "distill" with minor phrasing edits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The method is signaled early ("by collecting absences—the silence where a voice should be") and structures the middle sequence (vials from shipwrecks, root from dead tree). Mechanics matter in the crucible beat. However, "absences" remain abstractly defined—vials are labeled but their contents' properties are asserted rather than tested. Present in setup and development; closure relies on it but does not dramatize a tradeoff between competing absences or a cost of the collection itself. Functional rather than indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The greenhouse is vividly rendered and houses all key resources (forge, tree, shipwreck vials). It provides immediate setup, anchors all middle beats, and frames the closure. The ringed shipwrecks supply backstory and harvested absences with clear causal linkage. Spatial choreography is clean. However, the setting does not constrain her—she moves freely among all needed objects without obstacle or scarcity. Strong development and payoff participation, but lacks the pressure that would push the score above 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"While cells divide" appears once as a mid-passage thought ("While cells divide, she thought, memories fracture") tied to her father's cellular regeneration research. It does not create urgency, track elapsed duration, or tighten a deadline. The aurora and night setting provide ambiance but no temporal constraint. Absent from setup, development uses it as thematic metaphor only, and closure ignores it. Ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The desire to find the sound of trust breaking is declared in the opening and drives all her actions (collecting absences, mixing, forging). Her father's disappearance seeds the emotional stake and the ending claims fulfillment. However, the motivation is never dramatized through a difficult choice or internal conflict—she pursues the goal linearly without friction between want and cost. Present in setup and development, participates in closure assertion, but lacks the on-page tradeoff or visible foreclosure that would elevate the score.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The tone balances wonder (aurora glow, liquid mercury imagery) with grief (father's vanishing, mother's silence, "battered"). It coheres across turns and modulates during the eruption sequence ("exhilarating" pain). The final line ("battered but marveling") reprises the dual registers. However, the tone does not shift decisively under peak pressure—the ending mirrors the opening's stance without reconfiguration. Coherent and present in all three gates, but static rather than charged by cost.</comment>
