<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Lira's motivation to "scaffold complexity with simplicity" reads as abstract theme-speak rather than visceral want. Her interior life relies heavily on label-only description ("perpetually learning brain raced") without embodied contradiction or micro-choices that reveal hierarchy under pressure. The grandmother encounter and her shift to "weaver of timelines" arrive without prior internal conflict to make the transformation credible. The final moment shows her understanding the sculptures' meaning, but no visible cost forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation Test: who and where anchor quickly, but "after the GPS failed three days ago" introduces a timeframe that never constrains a choice on the page (−0.3). The closure unit attempts Conceptual Repricing—Lira now understands the island's complexity as tapestry—but the shift lacks visible or felt cost; she smiles and continues sculpting with new knowledge, no path foreclosed. The portal sequence and grandmother encounter read as expository rather than causal pressure that narrows options. Drive lens appears Accumulative/Textural but the ending does not reweight the dominant stake with cost legible on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The storm-tossed archway anchors location and provides atmospheric pressure throughout. Sensory detail is selective and voice-filtered ("damp moss," "turbine-hum reverie"), and the archway's transformation into portal charges the middle. However, the coral-and-timber village on the other side remains generic postcard description without spatial choreography or choice-constraining detail. The archway returns at closure but does not materially constrain Lira's final understanding; she's back under it, unchanged by the crossing.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding the island's fractured timelines—is signaled early. The lantern slide discovery and archway portal provide one tightening that changes knowledge, but the grandmother's "You're late" and cascade of images are delivered without trade-off or decision cost. Lira's agency at closure is passive reception; she blinks back and "understands" without forfeiting a live option. The turbine-hum vibration and slide warmth suggest intensification, but no on-page choice narrows her path or makes the cost of understanding legible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Theme of complexity-as-tapestry and simplicity-as-thread emerges from the premise, but the final paragraph states it overtly: "The island's complexity wasn't a burden; it was a tapestry, and simplicity was the thread that held it together." The sculptures' reinterpretation (kelp hair as timeline, clockwork heart as mechanism) reads as symbolic convenience introduced late rather than particulars that earned the insight. "Timewoven alliances" and "scaffold complexity with simplicity" are prompt labels repeated without dramatized cost. The ending smile and continued sculpting offer no non-literal answer or resonant ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present in craft-specific details (coaxing stories from flotsam, kelp hair, clockwork heart). However, diction drifts into elevated register at peak beats—"turbine-hum reverie," "perpetually learning brain," "scaffold complexity with simplicity"—that clashes with the established voice of a working sculptor. Dialogue with the grandmother is brief and functional; her voice does not distinguish from narration. Filter verbs ("She'd heard," "she understood") dull immediacy at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Line-level clarity is generally serviceable, but multiple prose artifacts accumulate. Paraphrase loop: "timewoven alliances" whispered, then "old sailors speak of it," then restated as "covenants passed down" within three paragraphs. Template cadence in the portal sequence: "Lira saw herself… a fisherman's daughter, a shipwright's apprentice, a storm chaser" reads as list rather than pressure. Stock metaphor: "storm-tossed," "bruised sky," "turbine-hum." The final paragraph recycles "wasn't just" twice in adjacent sentences. Filter-verb stack in closure beat: "she understood," "now clear in her mind," "she'd scaffold" (−0.5). Artifacts touch the ending; disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band entries at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The core premise—driftwood sculptor decoding timewoven island via magic lantern slides—combines familiar portal-fantasy and artist-as-seer tropes without transformation through specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The sculptures' symbolic decoding (kelp = years, clockwork = tides) arrives as convenient late reveal rather than earned particulars. The grandmother encounter and cascade of past lives echo standard chosen-one templates. "Turbine-hum reverie" and "scaffold complexity with simplicity" read as prompt-derived rather than organic voice. No bold structural risk; the portal-and-return arc follows a median safe path.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Lira is present throughout and makes two choices: pressing the slide to the archway and asking "Teach me." The second choice does not alter tactics (she's immediately returned to her original location). Her role as sculptor frames the story but her sculpting itself does not create a key turn; understanding the sculptures' meaning happens to her rather than through active decision. She observes the portal sequence passively. Present in closure, but her final "smile" and continued sculpting do not demonstrate a choice that narrows options.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The magic lantern slide appears in three beats: discovery near archway base, pressed against keystone to open portal, and received from grandmother. Its symbols pulse and rearrange, providing mechanism for the portal. It charges the middle sequence and links setup to ending (Lira holds it at closure). However, it does not constrain a choice with cost; she uses it without trade-off or tactical alteration. The slide's function is consistent but its presence at closure is passive—she picks up her sculptures, not the slide.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Timewoven alliances" is named explicitly and defined as threads of memory in certain places. It frames the archway's function and the grandmother's covenant. However, the concept does not shape stakes or constrain tactics on the page; Lira steps through the portal without cost, receives visions, and returns unchanged. The alliances "hold, but only if you remember" is stated but never tested by a choice. Present and logically consistent, but swappable for "temporal echoes" or "ancestral bonds" without structural impact.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Perpetually learning brain" appears once as a label when Lira sees the lantern slide's mechanics. It does not constrain or enable an action with visible cost. No trade-off between learning and another value is dramatized. The attribute could be removed and the scene would function identically—Lira would still puzzle out the slide and step through the portal. Ornamental mention only.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Reimagine" appears twice: Lira seeks to "reimagine the island's history" in paragraph two, and later "reimagined her role" as weaver of timelines. The second use marks a shift in self-concept after the portal experience. However, the reimagining is told rather than shown through a decision that narrows options. At closure she "understood" and continues sculpting; no major turn traces causally to an act of reimagining on the page. Present across beats but swappable for "reinterpret" or "reframe" with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Layered meanings" is stated once: "her perpetually learning brain raced. The lantern slide wasn't just an object; it was a key, a method to see through layered meanings." The slide's symbols and the cascade of images show layering, but the method itself is not taught or used to shape Lira's attempts. She does not decode meanings through effort or choice; the meanings are delivered to her. The phrase appears mid-story and does not return at closure. Functional but replaceable with "hidden truths" or "multiple histories."</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The storm-tossed archway anchors every major beat: Lira shelters against it at opening, finds the slide at its base, presses the slide to its keystone to trigger the portal, and returns to stand under it at closure. Its "skeletal silhouette" and "groaning" stones provide atmospheric pressure throughout. The archway is indispensable to the portal mechanism and frames the final image where Lira holds her sculptures beneath it. However, it does not constrain a tactical choice with cost—Lira does not choose between archway and alternate path. Essential across beats and ending, but not causally decisive in altering options.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"After the GPS failed three days ago" establishes the timeframe in paragraph one. The three-day duration and GPS failure are mentioned but never constrain a decision or tighten tactics. No live clock pressures Lira's moves; the storm "still raged" at beginning and end with no progression. Time does not alter her options or force a trade-off. Present as setup, absent in development and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"To scaffold complexity with simplicity" is stated as Lira's motivation in paragraph two and echoed at closure: "simplicity was the thread that held it together." However, the desire is never dramatized through a choice that costs her something. She does not face friction between simplifying and preserving complexity, nor does she forfeit an option to achieve this goal. The motivation labels the thematic claim but does not drive on-page conflict. Told in setup and summary at ending, absent from middle development.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Turbine-hum reverie" appears twice: when the archway hums after Lira presses the slide, and at closure when "the turbine-hum reverie still vibrat[es] in her chest." The phrase anchors an auditory-physical sensation that carries across the portal experience. Tone modulates from urgent shelter-seeking to contemplative understanding, coherent through turns. However, "turbine-hum reverie" reads as an imposed descriptor rather than emergent from the scene's textures; "reverie" clashes with the storm's urgency. The tone charges the final image but the exact phrase is swappable for "resonant hum" or "steady vibration."</comment>
