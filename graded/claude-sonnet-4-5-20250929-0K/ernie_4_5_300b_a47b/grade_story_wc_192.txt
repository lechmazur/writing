<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's core motivation—isolation-turned-reconnection—reads clearly, and the bridge-burning backstory anchors her current choice. However, interiority leans heavily on abstract formulations ("weight that pressed against her chest," "teach suffocating to breathe") rather than embodied contradiction. Kael's presence provides a relationship crucible, but his reaction feels underwritten; the final握手 and collaborative stance arrive without visible internal resistance or cost that would elevate the change from functional to deeply earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story establishes a coherent Accumulative/Textural lens: ashen sanctuary, doorknocker ritual, Kael's threshold crossing, and the closing image of held hands under starlight cohere as a pattern of reconnection. Orientation is prompt (ashen sanctuary, Elara as keeper, pre-call context), and the lens holds. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration—Elara moves from isolation to shared vigilance—but the cost is asserted ("for the first time in years, Elara felt the possibility of breath") rather than dramatized through a specific forfeiture or visible friction at the threshold moment, keeping the effect more told than felt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The ashen sanctuary, starlight, doorknocker embedded in the wall, and threshold hum are vivid and purposeful. Sensory detail—burnt wood scent, cold iron, thickening air—modulates with the knock and Kael's crossing. The setting constrains the initial separation and enables the ritual; the threshold's "shudder" when Kael steps through charges the reunion moment, meeting the 9+ quick test's requirement that environment constrain or charge a key choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—holding fading thresholds versus reaching out—is signaled early and tightens when Elara uses the ring. Kael's arrival and threshold crossing provide one meaningful turn. However, escalation is more atmospheric than agentic; the sanctuary "shudders," but no on-page obstacle tests Elara's decision or forces a visible tradeoff between isolation and connection. The resolution (standing together, gripping hands) feels collaborative but lacks the foregrounded cost or tactical alteration that would push pressure into the 8+ range.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Theme—connection as survival, bridges rebuilt—emerges from the doorknocker ritual and Kael's return. Yet the closing paragraph edges toward explanation: "some bridges were meant to be rebuilt" and "even in the emptiness, there was still a chance to breathe" state the lesson rather than letting the handgrip and dawn image resonate without commentary. The final moves risk Thematic Echo, dampening the non-literal answer the piece otherwise builds.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization is stable; diction ("tender shadow keeper," "loaded emptiness," "linking through scars") creates a distinct lyric texture. Dialogue between Elara and Kael is spare and goal-driven. Perceptual signature is consistent but occasionally slips into elevated register ("metaphysical," "ritual to protect the fading threshold") that reads slightly abstract for peak emotional beats, and some figurative phrases ("vibration that echoed in the hollows of her bones") veer toward stock embodiment without fresh specificity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is generally high. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "The emptiness had grown heavier" / "she could no longer ignore the urge"; "She had burned bridges carefully" recurs across paragraphs without added detail. The phrase "linking through scars" appears four times, twice as exposition. Mid-story, filter-verb stacks ("She had discovered," "She had erased," "She had burned") dull immediacy. These artifacts accumulate to approximately −0.8 under the patterned-artifact penalty pack, and their presence in non-closure beats applies the disallow-9+ rule globally and caps high-band entries at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The doorknocker-as-conduit and ashen sanctuary offer texture, but the guardian-calls-back-lost-lover frame follows a familiar template (isolation, regret, ritual reunion). "Linking through scars" and "teach suffocating to breathe" are evocative phrases, yet their transformation remains metaphorical assertion rather than fresh dramatization. The piece executes its premise competently but does not offer a non-obvious inflection or risky structural choice that would elevate originality into the high band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara as "tender shadow keeper" is present throughout and makes the key decision to knock. Setup is immediate, middle beat is the knock and Kael's summons, and closure shows her gripping his hand and acknowledging bridge-rebuilding. However, the keeper role itself—holding thresholds—remains abstract; we see her knock and reach out, but no on-page action dramatizes her "holding the line" beyond standing and speaking. The character drives the turn but the specificity of "shadow keeper" does not visibly constrain tactics or alter the final image beyond framing.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The doorknocker ring is introduced early, used to summon Kael (middle beat), and mentioned in the final paragraph as "silent witness." It enables the key turn. Yet after the knock, the ring becomes passive; its mechanics or cost are not revisited, and the closing reference is observational rather than causally active. Two touches across setup and middle, closure mention is ornamental, yielding solid integration but not indispensability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Fading threshold" appears in exposition and at the threshold-crossing beat; it frames the problem. But on the page, the threshold functions as a spatial marker—Kael stands outside, then crosses—without demonstrable mechanics or cost that alter Elara's options. The concept is thematically present but does not constrain a middle choice or shift tactics; it remains an atmospheric premise rather than a plot lever.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Burns bridges carefully" is backstory that motivates Elara's isolation and seeds her recognition that "some bridges were meant to be rebuilt." The attribute shapes her past stance and the thematic payoff. However, the burning itself is summarized ("each severed tie a ritual") without on-page consequence that we witness in real time; the cost is declared retrospectively. The trait is functional and present in closure reflection, meeting two gates, but lacks a dramatized middle beat where careful burning constrains a present action.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Encroach" is named as Elara's urge and action when she lifts the ring and calls Kael. Setup (urge to encroach), middle (the knock), and closure (stepping closer, brushing shadow, acknowledging encroachment as necessity) are all present. The action drives the key turn. Yet "encroach" could be replaced with "reach out" or "summon" with minimal edits; the specificity of encroachment—its connotation of transgression—does not visibly shape the sanctuary's response or Elara's internal conflict beyond semantic flavor.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Linking through scars" is named four times but never demonstrated. We are told the doorknocker "links," and Kael murmurs the phrase at the end, but the mechanics—how scars function as conduit, what cost or friction they impose—remain opaque. The method is present in theme and dialogue but does not shape an on-page attempt or constrain Elara's approach; it reads as metaphor rather than dramatized means.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The "ashen charcoal sanctuary under starlight" anchors the opening sentence, recurs through burnt-wood scent and air texture, and appears in the penultimate paragraph ("ashen charcoal sanctuary under starlight" verbatim). The sanctuary constrains Elara's isolation and provides the threshold mechanic; the air "thickens" when Kael crosses. Setup, middle constraint (threshold crossing), and closure reprise are all present, and the setting charges the reunion image, meeting the 9+ quick test for Q3.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"After cutting off all contact" frames backstory and motivates present urgency. The timeframe appears in exposition but does not create a live ticking clock or alter tactics during the knock-and-crossing sequence. "Years" and "tonight" anchor duration, yet no pressure mounts from time scarcity; the element is functional context but does not tighten decisions on the page.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>"To teach suffocating to breathe" is Elara's stated need when Kael asks why she called. It drives her choice to knock and her closing realization ("possibility of breath"). Setup is mid-scene dialogue, closure reflection echoes it. However, the desire is more declared than dramatized through conflicting wants; we are told she seeks this teaching, but no on-page friction shows her struggling between isolation (safety) and breath (risk) in a way that costs her something visible at the threshold moment.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Loaded emptiness" is named explicitly and evoked through "weight that pressed," silence "alive with the sound of things unsaid," and the closing night "filled with loaded emptiness." Tone is coherent and modulates from static isolation to charged reunion. The final paragraph's reflection slightly flattens the charge by explaining ("not quiet but alive"), but the tone remains stable and supports the thematic question, present across setup, middle silence, and closure image.</comment>
