<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kael's internal contradiction (fear vs. desire to prove himself) is present but largely told through retrospective summary rather than dramatized in scene. The scars-as-map conceit and the mentor's lessons dominate interiority, yet the peak choice—carving the rune—feels more like executing a plan than a genuine crossroads with visible cost. Embodiment is solid ("hands trembled," "chest tightened"), but the final transformation lacks the friction of a hard-won renunciation or forfeiture; he sheds doubt cleanly without on-page struggle at the moment of closure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes a causal-accumulative hybrid: Kael's preparation and invocation directly cause the rune to crystallize, then flare, reshaping his scars and opening a path. Orientation anchors (floating platform, moss forest, obsidian cups, crow quill) arrive early and remain stable. The closure—scars becoming legible symbols, platform steadying, path revealed—lands on the page with a visible shift in options (he descends into the forest). Cost is implied (he has shed hesitation, committed to the rune's power) but not sharply foregrounded as a loss or sacrifice in the final beat; the ending reads more as triumph than trade-off, softening the closure's bite.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The floating platform, obsidian cups, crow quill, and mist-choked forest anchor the scene vividly and filter through Kael's professional attention (rune scholar arranging a ritual). The platform shudders under the rune's activation, and the forest "roars to life" in response, demonstrating setting as active constraint. Spatial choreography (kneeling, standing, descending steps) is clear throughout. The quill and ink constrain and enable the climactic act, and the final path through the trees charges the closure image, meeting the 9+ gate for environment shaping tactics and the ending.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>One dominant stake—transforming his scars/failures into mastery—is signaled early and coheres throughout. Pressure tightens in the ritual sequence: ink crystallizes (complication), Kael fears miscalculation (reversal threat), then the rune flares and reshapes his scars (resolution). However, the climactic beat lacks a visible price or forfeited option; success arrives without a dramatized cost at the moment of closure. The protagonist's agency is present (he carves the rune, chooses to descend), but the escalation curve feels smooth rather than steeply contested, and no live option is foreclosed on the page to earn the triumph.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Theme (scars as stories, fear into power, breath between storms) emerges from imagery and action, not assertion. The recurring crow quill and crystallized ink motifs support resonance, and the mentor's aphorisms frame the transformation. Yet the final paragraph edges into overt summary: "scars were not wounds but witnesses," "to transform pain into power, one must first shed the lies that cage the heart." These lines tell the theme rather than letting the image speak, softening the non-literal charge. The middle beats earn thematic credit, but the ending moralizes rather than trusting the rune-and-path image to carry meaning.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited remains stable; psychic distance modulates appropriately (close during ritual, slight pull-back for the descent). Diction is generally consistent—"liquid starlight," "lattice of raised flesh"—though occasional elevated phrases ("saturated hush," "chorus of rustling leaves") drift slightly above a twenty-year-old's internal lexicon under stress. No head-hopping; filter use is light. The perceptual signature (scholar's attention to ink, quill, runes) is character-specific. Minor slip: "He realized, with a clarity that made him gasp" is a filter-heavy epiphany marker that slightly dulls immediacy at a peak beat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and sensory detail is vivid, but several passages loop conceptually: the mentor's lesson appears three times in paraphrase ("runes crystallize when stressed," "breath between storms," "held breath is a bridge"), and the scars-as-map/scars-as-stories/scars-as-language cluster recycles the same metaphor across four paragraphs. Sentence openings show variety, and no grammatical errors appear. Figurative density is high but mostly coherent; "bones had turned to mist" and "platform shuddered" work in context. The paraphrase loops and metaphor churn trigger a −0.6 deduction; otherwise the prose is clean and propulsive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The rune-scholar premise and floating-platform ritual setting offer a specific fantasy frame, and the scars-reshaping-into-runes image is memorable. However, the emotional arc—frightened novice overcomes doubt through ritual mastery—follows a familiar template, and the childhood-superstition method is invoked but not transformed (a single rhyme, then abandoned). The mentor's aphorisms and the "shed fear to gain power" thesis feel archetypal rather than freshly synthesized. The piece commits fully to its premise, but the stakes and resolution do not surprise or reweight prior material in a non-obvious way.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kael (budding rune scholar) frames the story, arranges the ritual, carves the rune, and chooses to descend—three distinct beats. His decisions (dipping the quill, carving the sigil, standing and descending) drive the key turns. Setup early, development in the ritual, and presence at closure satisfy all three gates. However, his choices feel pre-determined by the ritual plan rather than contested by meaningful alternatives; no visible cost or forfeited option appears on the page at closure, capping the score in the mid-7s.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The crow quill is introduced early (balanced on a cup's rim), used to dip ink and carve the runes (two functional beats), and reappears in the final paragraph ("pressed against his hip—a talisman, a tool, a reminder"). Setup, development, and closure linkage all present. The quill enables the climactic act and recurs with reweighted meaning (from mentor's relic to earned tool). It constrains Kael's method and charges the ending image, meeting high-band criteria. Minor friction: the final reprise is brief and does not add new causal pressure, keeping it just below 8.5.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The "breath between storms" appears as the mentor's aphorism and is restated twice ("held breath is a bridge," "the world held its breath with him" at close). It shapes Kael's understanding and frames the closure moment (he breathes in, the world holds its breath), linking setup and ending. However, the concept does not constrain a specific on-page choice or alter tactics in the middle; it remains thematic gloss rather than mechanical stake. Lyric reprise reweights meaning, earning mid-band credit, but lack of middle development and causal pressure caps it below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Crystallizes when stressed" governs the rune's behavior in the ritual: ink crystallizes into fractal patterns under pressure, enabling the transformation. The trait is signaled early (mentor's lesson), demonstrated in the climactic beat (ink spreads, veins form), and visible at closure (scars reshape into symbols). Setup, development, and payoff all present. However, the crystallization is a passive process Kael observes rather than a constraint he must actively work around with visible cost, limiting causal bite. It enables the resolution but does not force a hard choice or trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Shed" is whispered as the incantation, repeated as thematic frame ("shed his hesitation, his doubt, his fear"), and enacted in the final descent (Kael sheds doubt, walks as storyteller). Three beats; setup, development, and closure all engaged. The action drives the ritual's success and defines the resolution. However, the shedding at closure is told more than shown ("he shed his hesitation" is summary), and no specific forfeited option appears on the page. The action is essential but not irreplaceable—"transform" or "release" could substitute with minor edits—capping it in the 7–8 band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The childhood rhyme ("Storm come, storm go, leave me a path to grow") is murmured once in the ritual and dismissed as "nonsense" by the narration. Setup is present (signaled at ~40%), but the superstition does not shape Kael's attempts, constrain his choices, or reappear at closure. It is ornamental context rather than a causal method. The story could proceed identically if he simply recited any placeholder phrase. Missing middle development and closure participation; functional mention caps it near the lower-mid band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The floating platform is introduced immediately, anchors all action (Kael kneels, arranges cups, carves runes on its surface), and shudders under the rune's activation—pressuring the climax. He descends its steps at closure. Setup, development (platform shudders, creating threat), and closure (descent) all present. The platform enables the ritual and its instability raises stakes in one beat. However, it does not supply a persistent constraint or alter Kael's tactics after the shudder; he succeeds despite the tremor rather than because he adapts. Solid integration across beats, but causal pressure is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"During a held breath" is invoked thematically (mentor's lesson, Kael's breath hitches, final line "he breathed in, and the world held its breath") but does not function as a live time constraint that tightens decisions. No clock runs; Kael's ritual unfolds at narrative pace without urgency imposed by breath duration. The timeframe is metaphorical rather than mechanical, appearing in setup and closure but absent from middle tactics. Lyric reprise reweights meaning slightly, but lack of causal pressure and swappability (any meditative pause would serve) cap it in the lower-mid band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Kael's desire to "transform scars into stories" is introduced early, restated in reflection ("intended to transform them into stories"), and enacted at closure (scars become legible symbols, "a language only he could read"). Setup, development (he carves runes that mirror his scars), and payoff all present. The motivation drives the ritual and shapes the ending. However, the transformation is frictionless—no competing desire or cost appears to complicate the choice at closure. The want is clear but not conflicted in the final beat, capping it in the 7–8 band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Saturated hush" appears explicitly once and is evoked through "mist pooled like spilled milk," "the air hummed with tension," "stillness," and "the forest held its breath." Tone is coherent through preparation and climax, modulates slightly at closure (leaves rustle, forest roars), and charges the final image (Kael walks into hush). Setup, development, and payoff engaged. The tone supports pressure and reweights at the end (applause → hush). However, the single static register (dense, portentous atmosphere) persists without sharp tonal shift under peak stress, and "saturated hush" itself is announced rather than sustained through rhythm. Solid integration, minor friction from lack of modulation range.</comment>
