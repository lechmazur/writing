<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lirael's interior is vivid and embodied—pressing her palm to cold glass, tasting "metallic tang of a swallowed truth"—and her contradiction (oracle certainty vs. post-fever sway) drives her choice to descend. The fever's aftermath motivates her change, but the director and herbalist remain functional props rather than pressure agents. Her final smile and anchoring feel earned by the accumulated weight, though the transformation hinges more on accumulation than a single causal rupture with visible tradeoff on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors by ~80 words (station, Lirael, post-fever). The piece accumulates density through repeated smudging, peripheral noticing, and the QUARANTINE folder discovery, then delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant: she refuses the oracle role, descends with the illustration, accepts being "anchored" rather than crushed). Cost is felt—she abandons her position, the director will rage—and the final herbalist exchange reweights the bearberry's meaning. One meaningful deepening is present; the lens holds.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The mountain station is concrete (rattling windows, narrow halls, observation deck with aurora above) and the botanical illustration—handled, smudged, rolled—functions as micro-setting that charges the final beat when the herbalist names where it grows. Sensory detail (metallic tang, damp earth and pine, frost mustache) is selective and POV-filtered. The setting pressure is moderate: the station's literal instability (seismic data, structural fatigue) parallels Lirael's internal fracture, but the mountain itself does not directly constrain a mid-story choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: whether Lirael will continue as the station's complicit oracle or break with the lie. The QUARANTINE folder discovery tightens her dilemma, and her descent with the illustration forecloses the oracle path with on-page cost (director's rage, crew whispers, her smile of relief). The accumulative lens allows pressure to build through peripheral awareness and smudging rather than a confrontation, and the herbalist's recognition validates her choice. One meaningful tightening (folder → decision to leave) is sufficient and the cost is legible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: oracles quantify vs. feeling the world; margins as survival space; truth's weight as anchor rather than crushing force. The bearberry's roots "where the world shows its cracks" encapsulates without stating a moral. Lirael's final smile and the herbalist's nod offer a resonant answer to whether she can endure uncertainty. The smudged illustration charges the ending without becoming a symbol checklist, and the "auroral sorrow" modulates from external storm to internal reckoning without sermon.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, and Lirael's perceptual signature (tracing edges, peripheral noticing, smudging) is character-specific. Diction occasionally drifts elevated ("celestial shroud," "its sorrow lingered") without clear voice motivation, and a few filter stacks ("aware of," "realized," "knew") dull immediacy in high-pressure beats. The director's single line of dialogue feels functional rather than distinct. Psychic distance is controlled, but the prose sometimes explains what has been shown ("That's what she'd been doing").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but several paraphrase loops appear: "swaying certainties" is restated across paragraphs; "occupying margins" is explained twice in adjacent beats; "truth had a weight" / "weight of the truth" recurs without added pressure. Template cadence in the middle section ("She'd dreamed… and woken… certain she'd forgotten") and elevated register ("celestial shroud," "auroral sorrow") in peak beats create mild drag. No major scaffold or clarity breaks, but density could tighten. Baseline −0.6 for loops and stems, with minor elevation drift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The oracle-who-feels rather than quantifies offers a fresh angle on AI/prediction tropes, and the bearberry as a motif of resilience in thin soil is specific. However, the core arc—insider discovers cover-up, flees to village wisdom-keeper—follows a recognizable template without a bold structural or moral twist. The herbalist's validation arrives on cue, and Lirael's descent feels emotionally honest but predictable. Particulars (smudged illustration, aurora, fever) elevate the familiar frame modestly; the ending's symbolic neatness limits surprise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Present early (title character). Her oracle role frames her choices: she rejects quantification, discovers hidden data, and decides to leave—all tied to her fault-tolerant identity. The trait enables her to "endure errors" and "compensate for gaps," which she does by accepting uncertainty. Two beats (folder discovery, descent decision) involve her agency, but the oracle function is more thematic label than on-page constraint that narrows a tactic under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The botanical illustration appears in four distinct beats: tracing at the wall, tucked under arm during pacing, smudged with charcoal in observation deck, rolled and carried to the herbalist. Its meaning reweights at closure when the herbalist names where it grows ("where the world shows its cracks"), anchoring Lirael's transformation. Early setup, mid-story handling, and closure reprise all present. The smudging action recurs but remains somewhat ornamental until the final exchange gives it conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The concept is signaled early ("her certainties had begun to sway") and recurs in her pacing, smudging, and final acceptance of margins. It shapes her dominant stake—whether to cling to oracle logic or embrace uncertainty—and the ending shows her learning "to sway." However, the swaying is more thematic backdrop than a tactic-altering constraint; she does not test certainty against sway in a choice that visibly narrows options mid-story. The closure links to the concept clearly but without a felt cost tied specifically to the act of swaying.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Introduced early ("peripherally aware of the station's crew muttering") and recurs ("peripherally, she noticed the director's office door ajar"). The trait enables her to spot the folder and marginalia, but it functions more as descriptive filter than a constraint with on-page cost. Swappable with "distracted noticing" or similar; the peripheral mode does not force a tradeoff or visibly narrow her options. Present and consistent, but not causally indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Smudging appears in three beats: tracing the illustration's graphite margins, smudging ink at the observation deck, drawing roots deeper with charcoal. The action is specific and recurring, but the major turn (deciding to descend) traces more directly to the folder discovery than to the smudging itself. The smudging charges her embodied relationship to uncertainty and supports the closure image, yet it could be replaced by another tactile ritual (tearing, folding) without breaking the story's logic. Mid-band for thematic reinforcement without unique causal necessity.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The method is named explicitly ("occupying margins") and illustrated: scribbling notes in white space, pressing palm to glass, drawing roots into paper fibers, descending to the village (a social margin). Setup occurs early, recurs in middle beats (charcoal smudging, margins paragraph), and the herbalist's recognition of thin-soil plants echoes it at closure. However, the mechanics are more metaphorical than tactical; "occupying margins" does not constrain a visible choice under pressure. The method appears but does not uniquely enable the escape or cost in a way that another framing ("embracing uncertainty") could not.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The mountain weather station is established early with concrete detail (cliff-clinging steel, rattling windows, narrow halls, observation deck, aurora above) and the setting's instability (seismic data, structural fatigue) parallels Lirael's internal fracture. The QUARANTINE folder and director's office are setting-enabled beats. The station's literal crumbling raises stakes and motivates her descent. The village arrival and herbalist scene provide closure grounding. All three gates present; the setting supplies both resource (folder) and constraint (complicity in the lie). Strong integration, though the mountain itself is more symbolic frame than active pressure on mid-story tactics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the fever broke" anchors the opening and motivates Lirael's new uncertainty ("since the fever, her algorithms frayed"). The fever's three-night-prior arrival is specified, and the story spans midnight observation to dawn descent—a single compressed window. However, the timeframe does not create urgent pressure or constrain her choices; she could have discovered the folder and left at any point post-recovery. Setup and closure both reference it, but the fever functions more as backstory trigger than a live clock that alters tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Lirael's desire to "find the weight of a swallowed truth" is dramatized: she dreams of the bearberry, paces with the illustration, discovers the QUARANTINE folder, and feels the truth "root in her." The motivation drives her folder search and her descent decision. Friction between oracle duty and truth-bearing is visible, and the cost (abandoning her role) lands on the page. However, the phrasing "swallowed truth" is more poetic than visceral; her internal conflict is somewhat abstract. Two beats (folder, descent) clearly stem from this desire, and the final anchoring pays it off.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The tone is established early (aurora "a celestial shroud," "auroral sorrow") and recurs at closure ("the auroral sorrow of that mountain morning"). The sorrow modulates through pressure—initial fever uncertainty, folder discovery weight, descent relief—and the final "auroral sorrow" reweights prior dread as bittersweet acceptance. Tone is coherent and charges the ending image. However, "auroral sorrow" as a label appears more often than it is embodied in syntax or rhythm, and the phrase itself borders on decorative. Strong thematic presence with moderate line-level integration.</comment>
