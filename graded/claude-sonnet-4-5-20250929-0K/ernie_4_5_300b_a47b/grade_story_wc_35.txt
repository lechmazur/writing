<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Nessar's motivation—to "sandpaper rough memories"—is clear and sustained, and his choice to subsume the founder's guilt demonstrates on-page agency with embodied cost ("the weight of the fortress on his shoulders"). However, interiority leans toward abstract labels ("the sting of tears, the weight of a decision") and the final cooking sequence softens tension through metaphor rather than dramatized contradiction. The guard's retreat and the pavilion's "emotionally contagious nature" remain told rather than tested through conflicted micro-choices. Decent baseline, no slips at closure, but missing the embodied ambiguity and layered cost needed for higher bands.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: discovery of the pavilion, immersion in the pool, subsuming the founder's guilt, and the final cooking act build a legible progression. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—Nessar "learned to carry [remorse] differently"—with felt cost ("his legs unsteady," salt-stiff apron). Orientation is swift (fortress, chef, pavilion within ~15% of text). The escalation is a single meaningful deepening rather than a causal reversal, fitting this lens. One minor cost-proof gap: the assertion that "the fortress felt sturdier" is stated more than shown, nudging the score below 7.8.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The pavilion's coral spires, arctic air, brackish pool, and tidal formations create a vivid, selective sensory frame anchored early. The desert fortress after rain—wet stone scent, silver moon—grounds the exterior. The pool constrains Nessar's choice to kneel and immerse, and the pavilion's cold numbs his fingers, tying environment to action. Spatial choreography is coherent. The 9+ test is narrowly missed: while the pool is handled, it does not quite charge the *final* image (the kitchen cooking does), preventing top-band entry.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake—tempering stored remorse—is signaled early and sustained. The tightening occurs when Nessar submerges deeper, the memory surges, and he gasps under the founder's guilt, then the pool goes still. This is one meaningful deepening with felt cost (unsteady legs, numbed fingers, subsumption of guilt). The guard's retreat and the pavilion's contagion are pressures present but not tested through reversal. Agency at closure is renunciation/endurance (spreading the burden), fitting the Accumulative lens. Solid execution; no second reversal is required, but the cost legibility is asserted ("felt lighter") rather than dramatized in a concrete forfeiture, keeping the score at the threshold.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme—carrying intergenerational guilt, tempering memory—emerges from the pavilion's architecture, Nessar's ritual, and the closing cooking metaphor. The final image (chopping onions mellowed by laughter, broth softened by forgiveness) offers a resonant, non-literal answer without stated moral. Subtext operates in the guard's avoidance, the pool's "living ink," and the meal as nourishment of the present. One slip: "At the close of an unspoken dream" is a prompt echo that dilutes precision. The thematic question is coherent, the answer earned, but the ornamentation keeps it shy of the 8+ band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with controlled psychic distance. Voice carries texture: "whose tongue could taste memories," "the sting of tears," "grain of sand." Perceptual signature is consistent (memory as taste, tidal formations as text). The only elision—years-ago discovery of the pavilion—is brief and functional. Diction stays within the focalizer's idiom. No head-hopping, tense shifts, or filter-verb stacks. The elevated register ("shroud," "vessel," "seep") is voice-consistent but occasionally nudges toward poetic convenience rather than urgent need, preventing entry to 8+.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose is clear, rhythmically varied, and information-dense. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes. No loops, template cadence, or metaphor muddle in peak beats. Sentence stems vary; paragraph structure supports momentum. Minor density slip: "the pavilion's emotionally contagious nature worked both ways" tells mechanics rather than showing them through gesture or micro-action, and the final cooking paragraph layers three figurative beats without acceleration. Clean craft, no artifacts touching closure, but not quite the zero-scaffold propulsion of 8+.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The synthesis—chef as memory-taster in a desert fortress with a coral pavilion storing remorse—is specific and non-generic. The tidal-formations-as-text and cooking-as-tempering conceits feel purposeful. Transformation test passes: plot depends on these exact particulars. Risk is present (subsuming guilt, emotionally contagious architecture) and heightens stakes. One friction: the "unspoken dream" timeframe and the pavilion's ice-and-coral logic under desert dunes lean toward ornamental mystery rather than grounded inevitability, keeping the piece in the upper-mid band rather than the exceptional.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Setup: present by opening line. Development: Nessar's tongue-tasting of memories drives his descent to the pavilion and his choice to immerse. Payoff: memory-tasting recurs in the pool ("Nessar tasted the memory—salt and iron") and shapes the closure choice to subsume and dilute guilt. All three gates met. Causal pressure and beat involvement (opening, pavilion, pool, kitchen) support mid-6s. Swappability friction: "chef who can sense emotions" could replace with minor edits; the taste-specific mechanic is ornamental rather than irreplaceable. Cost connection is present (subsumption, unsteady legs). Narrow miss of 7+ due to swappability and the fact that decisions arise from proximity to the pavilion rather than taste-specific constraints.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Setup: discovered years ago, present by first third. Development: door ritual, shelves of vials, and the pool constrain Nessar's choices across two beats (entry, immersion). Payoff: the pool's tidal formations resolve into the founder's memory and go still after subsumption, directly shaping closure. All three gates met. Beat involvement: entry ritual, vial mention, pool immersion, tidal-formation reading, post-immersion stillness (≥3 beats). Causal pressure: the pavilion's existence and mechanics enable the core action. Closure linkage: the pool's stillness is the physical marker of the remorse shift. Specificity: coral-and-ice architecture under desert dunes is irreplaceable. Cost: numbed fingers, arctic air, unsteady legs. Strong integration; narrow miss of 8.5+ because the vials on shelves are described but not used, leaving one element ornamental within the larger object.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Setup: "stored remorse...pooled here" by second paragraph. Development: the concept frames the stakes (to "sandpaper rough memories") and the pool's function as remorse container. Payoff: Nessar's subsumption of the founder's guilt and the assertion that "the pavilion's remorse was less sharp" directly tie closure to stored remorse. All three gates met. Causal pressure: the concept defines the mission and the pool's purpose. Closure linkage: the ending turn is dilution of stored remorse. Friction: the mechanics are told ("emotionally contagious," "pooled here") rather than shown through on-page constraint; Nessar could perform a similar ritual with "stored trauma" or "buried grief" with minimal edits. Cost: unsteady legs, tingling tongue. Mid-6s for concept that shapes stakes but whose specifics remain largely interchangeable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Setup: "emotionally contagious nature" mentioned in pavilion paragraph. Development: the trait is invoked when the guard retreats and when Nessar submerges, but both beats are told ("those who lingered too long risked becoming vessels") rather than shown through gesture or micro-choice. Payoff: the surge of the founder's memory and Nessar's gasp ("becoming his own") enact contagion, and the guards' "softer" expressions afterward suggest contagion's aftermath. Two gates met (development as explanation, payoff as lived moment). Causal pressure: the contagion enables subsumption. Friction: the mechanics are asserted, not constrained; Nessar could absorb memories through proximity or ritual with the same plot outcome. Cost: gasping, unsteady legs. Mid-5s for trait present and enabling but largely label-driven and swappable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Setup: "subsume" named in the resolution paragraph near closure. Development: not explicitly present mid-story; the immersion and tasting beats imply absorption but do not signal "subsume" as method. Payoff: "He'd subsumed the founder's guilt, not to keep it, but to dilute it" is the core closure statement. Two gates met (late signal, strong payoff). Causal pressure: subsumption is the mechanism of the final turn. Closure linkage: the word and concept anchor the ending image. Late-first-appearance friction (final third) applies: −0.6 to −1.0. Cost: unsteady legs, diluted burden. Swappability: "absorb," "integrate," or "consume" could replace with minimal edits. Strong payoff elevates, but late arrival and swappability cap at upper-6s.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Setup: tidal formations mentioned early ("pool of brackish water, its surface etched with tidal formations"). Development: "Analyzing them was his method" explicitly frames the means, and the pool's patterns shift and pulse during immersion. Payoff: formations resolve into the founder's image, then erase when subsumption completes. All three gates met. Causal pressure: analyzing patterns is the stated method for decoding remorse. Beat involvement: two beats (observing, resolution). Friction: the analysis itself is passive observation; Nessar kneels, dips, and submerges, but the formations shift on their own without his active decoding changing tactics. Specificity: "patterns in water" could be runes, smoke, or sand with similar edits. Cost: not directly tied to the method. Mid-5s for method present and framing but not constraining.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Setup: "desert fortress...sandstone walls...wet stone after the first rain in a decade" anchors setting by opening line. Development: rain-soaked walls carry taste-memory, damp corridors guide Nessar's wander, guards' silence reflects the fortress mood, and the desert moon after rain closes the exterior frame. Payoff: "the fortress felt sturdier, its brittleness tempered by the rain" ties closure image to setting. All three gates met. Causal pressure: rain triggers the tasting walk and softens the brittleness metaphor. Closure linkage: the "sturdy/brittle" payoff is setting-driven. Friction: much of the setting is atmospheric postcard (moon, silver, shroud); the rain's effect on memory-tasting is told rather than shown constraining a choice. Cost: not directly visible. Upper-6s for purposeful early-to-final bracket but limited tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Setup: "At the close of an unspoken dream, Nessar began to cook" appears only in the final paragraph. Development: absent; no earlier signal of dream-time or dream logic. Payoff: the phrase frames the closing cooking beat but its meaning is opaque and does not reweight prior material. One gate met (payoff as framing device). No causal pressure, no beat involvement, no cost connection. Late first appearance (final paragraph) and ornamental use. The phrase reads as decorative flourish rather than time constraint or lived frame. Low-2s for present but purely ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Setup: "to sandpaper rough memories" stated explicitly in paragraph four, within first third. Development: the metaphor frames Nessar's descent and immersion choices. Payoff: the final cooking paragraph ("chopped onions, their sharpness mellowed...broth, its bitterness softened") enacts the sandpapering metaphor through culinary tempering. All three gates met. Causal pressure: the desire drives the action sequence. Closure linkage: cooking as literal sandpapering charges the final image. Friction: the motivation is told and abstract; no on-page moment dramatizes the friction between wanting to blunt memory and the cost of doing so. The cooking payoff is metaphorical recurrence rather than lived conflict. Cost: implied in subsumption but not tied to this motivation's friction. Mid-6s for motivation present, framing, and paid off, but told rather than dramatized in micro-choices.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Setup: "sturdy" appears in opening (walls "unyielding") and "brittleness" in the resolution ("its brittleness tempered"). Development: the pavilion's "arctic" cold and the fortress's "shroud" of silence enact brittle; rain and subsumption enact tempering toward sturdy. Payoff: "the fortress felt sturdier, its brittleness tempered by the rain" explicitly names the tone shift. All three gates met. Coherence: the tone modulates from brittle (forbidden, frozen, cracked) to tempered (lighter, softer, nourished). The final image (cooking) extends the tempering. Friction: much of the tone work is asserted ("felt sturdier") rather than shown through gesture or micro-action that charges the image. Specificity: "fragile/resilient" could replace with minor edits. Mid-to-upper-5s for tone coherent and modulating but relying on statement at closure rather than charged sensory shift.</comment>
