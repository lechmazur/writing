<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Kieran's motivation is clear but his choices function more as plot unlocks than character-driven decisions under pressure. The "vigilant lock sentinel" title and "cradle of sparks" network are told rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. Elara's "calmly inventive" trait is label-only; no on-page action shows her inventing under constraint. The final choice to descend feels inevitable from the puzzle-solve rather than earned through internal conflict with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The piece opens with decent spatial anchors (fort, tower, sundial) but the blackout premise and Council threat remain abstract declarations. The puzzle-sequence (quill holder → sundial → chamber) provides causal linkage, but the stakes never tighten—success arrives without complication or reversal. Closure is a discovery (chamber revealed) rather than a Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration; no visible cost forecloses a path or crystallizes a stance under pressure. The drive lens reads Causal through the puzzle mechanics, but the ending delivers exposition ("when the lights return, the Council will see") instead of an on-page reweighting.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The luminous fort and Armory Tower are anchored early, and the sundial's bronze face and grooves matter to the puzzle. The blackout affects visibility but doesn't constrain choices—characters move freely and the puzzle proceeds unimpeded. The hidden chamber at the end supplies tools and scrolls but arrives too late to shape tactics; it's outcome rather than pressure. Micro-setting (quill holder, sundial slot) enables the climactic unlock, lifting the score slightly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—unlock the sundial cipher to find the cradle—is signaled early but never tightens. The piece advances through discovery beats (Kieran believes, Elara confirms, they succeed) without reversal, complication, or a choice that narrows options. The blackout is framed as a test yet imposes no on-page obstacle; success is frictionless. No visible cost at closure: descending the stairs is reward, not renunciation or endurance that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Theme of quiet revolution through knowledge emerges from the sundial cipher and hidden network, avoiding overt moralizing. The astronomer's quill holder and "cradle of sparks" concept carry symbolic weight, but the ending declares hope and future change rather than offering a resonant, non-literal image that reweights prior material. "And they'll know the spark can't be extinguished" is thematic summary, not earned subtext.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with Kieran as focalizer; no head-hopping. Dialogue feels functional but not distinct—Kieran and Elara share similar syntax and register under pressure. Diction is clean but occasionally overwritten: "winking hush of their footsteps," "glittering facade," "eyes bright" recur as stock descriptors. The narrative maintains distance and clarity; voice is competent but not perceptually specific to Kieran's role or history.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Prose is clear and grammatically sound, but repetitive stems and stock phrasing accumulate: "Kieran's breath caught," "Elara's eyes gleamed/bright," "heart racing," "jaw tightened." The phrase "cradle of sparks" appears five times, often in expository summary rather than scene pressure. Opening and closing sentences are competent but lack propulsive charge. Information density is moderate; several beats paraphrase prior material (blackout as test, sundial as cipher) without advancing pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The puzzle-box structure (relic key + coded sundial → hidden chamber) is familiar; the execution doesn't transform the template through specific character calculus or world logic. The "silent revolution" and blackout-as-test concepts remain abstract; no fresh inflection emerges from Kieran's or Elara's particular stakes. The astronomer's half-finished sundial and bronze quill holder are competent set-ups but feel arranged for the unlock rather than inevitable from character history or world pressure.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Kieran is present throughout and holds the quill holder, but his choices are puzzle-steps rather than decisions that narrow options or create turns. He observes, believes, and acts on Elara's confirmation; no moment where his vigilance or lock-sentinel role constrains or enables a high-stakes tactic. Setup and payoff gates met, but causal pressure is weak.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The bronze quill holder appears early (first paragraph), is examined mid-scene ("grooves match the sundial's etchings"), and unlocks the sundial at the climax. Three distinct beats with causal work; its specific grooves matter. Loses points for being a convenience key rather than an object whose evolving meaning charges the ending; it solves the puzzle it was designed to solve without cost or reprice.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The "cradle of sparks" is named early and explained as a network/idea, but it functions as destination rather than shaping on-page stakes or tactics. Characters work to *reach* it, not navigate pressures *from* it. At the ending it's revealed as a chamber of tools, but no choice or cost ties to the concept's properties. Functional setup, minimal development, payoff is descriptive arrival.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>Elara is labeled "calmly inventive" in narration and she traces angles and tracks blackouts, but no on-page scene shows her inventing under constraint or calm demeanor enabling a tactic others couldn't manage. The trait is told, not dramatized with cost or tradeoff. Ornamental use.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Intrigue" (puzzle-solving, secret network) is present throughout and drives the sequence, but it's interchangeable with "mystery" or "conspiracy." The blackout and Council whispers set mood but don't create a turn where intrigue itself (as distinct from puzzle-mechanics) narrows options. Functional, replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The "coded angles in a half-painted sundial" are signaled early, examined at midpoint, and the quill holder fits the angles to unlock the chamber at the climax. The method shapes two beats (discovery of cipher, successful use) and enables the ending. Specificity matters: bronze grooves match sundial etchings. Loses high-band eligibility because the angles are discussed more than they constrain attempts—success is frictionless.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The "luminous fort at twilight" is anchored in the opening and the Armory Tower location frames the sundial and hidden chamber. The fort's glow and architecture supply atmosphere but don't pressure choices; characters navigate freely. Twilight is mentioned once and doesn't constrain tactics. Setting is present and consistent, but closer to backdrop than crucible.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The "unexplained blackout" is named in the opening and framed as a test, but it doesn't tighten decisions—characters use starlight and a lantern without friction, and the puzzle proceeds on their timeline. Time is untracked; no clock or urgency alters moves. The blackout supplies mood and thematic frame (test by the Council) but no on-page temporal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"To spark a silent revolution" is stated early ("his motivation burned like an ember") and the network/cradle concept ties to it, but the motivation is told rather than tested by a choice that forces Kieran to weigh competing costs. The piece shows him pursuing the goal, not conflicted by it. Setup and thematic closure presence met; causal friction absent.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"Winking hush" appears once ("the winking hush of their footsteps") in the final third as a decorative phrase; tone throughout reads earnest and expository rather than playful or hushed. No modulation with pressure, no coherence across beats. Late ornamental mention that doesn't match the story's actual register.</comment>
