<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lira's prosopagnosia shapes her perception ("memorizing souls through textures and hues") but never constrains a choice under pressure. Her curiosity drives investigation, yet the discovery sequence feels frictionless—no hesitation costs, no clash between professional duty and trespassing. The final walk-away with the safe lacks visible consequence or internal conflict about theft versus preservation. Interiority remains observational rather than conflicted until the ending, where agency compresses into grabbing and leaving without dramatized cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Lira walks away with the safe and coin, a resonant reconfiguration of her role from documentarian to custodian. The lens reads Accumulative/Textural—pattern and discovery deepen rather than narrow via causal reversals. One meaningful tightening occurs when the wrecking ball strikes and she must choose, though the cost (theft,职业 breach) is more asserted than dramatized on the page. Orientation anchors cleanly by ~100 words (tree, commission, demolition crew). The before/after is legible: she arrived to paint decay, leaves as keeper of secrets.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The tree-trunk library is vividly particular: "damp bark," "fractally precise patterns in the grain," "oak panel embedded in the trunk." Setting constrains choice when the hidden panel and safe require the coin's indentations to unlock, and the wrecking ball's first blow forces her exit. Spatial choreography stays coherent (worktable, panel, exterior). The coin functions as micro-setting object that gates access and charges the final image in her pocket. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency: calm exploration gives way to dust and chaos.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserving the guild's legacy versus documenting decay—is signaled early and tightens when the panel opens. One meaningful deepening: discovering the journal reweights her commission from elegy to active guardianship. The wrecking ball's first blow forces the choice to take the safe, though the decision feels hurried rather than agonized. Cost is present but muted: she walks away, but we don't see pursuit, guilt, or tangible forfeit on the page. Escalation under Accumulative lens is adequate; under Causal it would need sharper trade-offs.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—limits and the act of preservation—emerges through the guild's "sky inside walls" and Lira's shift from portraiture to custodianship. The journal's final entry ("let the stars remain") reweights prior material without stating a moral. The face-blind artist who "sees more than wood and shelves" and "crafted something beyond sight" risks thematic echo but stays grounded in her perceptual signature. The ending avoids sermonizing, offering a quiet image (coin warm in her pocket, "map to secrets yet undiscovered") that resonates without overstatement. One line—"a legacy etched in light and wood"—tilts slightly declarative.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with Lira's perceptual signature consistent: textures, hues, fractals. Diction occasionally drifts elevated ("heightened stillness," "quiet defiance of those who dare to mirror the sky") in ways that feel imposed rather than Lira's idiom. Filter verbs ("she saw," "she'd intended") cluster but don't obscure. No dialogue to judge. The prose modulates under pressure—shorter beats during the wrecking ball—but some phrasing ("the guild's limit: they couldn't save their home, but…") reads as helpful-narrator summary rather than her immediate thought. Distance mostly holds.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Moderate loop and scaffold issues: "heightened stillness" appears twice (opening air, final "lingered"); "fractally precise" repeated without evolution; "the safe, still hidden, would survive. So would the journal's message" is near-paraphrase. Template cadence in middle: "She'd been commissioned… She saw… She dug… She pressed… She lifted." Register drifts elevated in the final third ("silent hymn to limits overcome"). Information density is good in discovery beats, but the ending paragraph stacks summary: "walked on," "faded behind her," "yet undiscovered." No major clarity breaks, but momentum drags slightly under decorative phrasing at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The tree-trunk library and face-blind artist offer fresh synthesis, and the coin-as-key is a tactile, specific mechanism. Yet the emotional arc—curious outsider discovers secret, becomes guardian—is familiar territory without sharp transformation. The "mirror the sky inside walls" conceit is visually arresting but conceptually well-trodden (ephemeral permanence). Lira's prosopagnosia remains ornamental; swapping it for another perceptual quirk would not break the story. The piece commits fully to its premise and executes competently, but risks remain modest and the closure image, while resonant, doesn't surprise in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Lira's face-blindness frames her perceptual mode (textures/hues over faces) but never constrains a choice—no moment where inability to recognize someone matters. She makes one key decision (take the safe), but prosopagnosia doesn't enable or complicate it. Present and characterizing, but functionally swappable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The safe appears in three beats: discovery inside the panel, examination at the worktable, and Lira carries it out at closure. It gates the journal (causal), and her decision to take it drives the ending. The crescent-moon lock adds specificity. Strong integration across setup, middle, and payoff with visible cost (theft/guardianship choice).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Discovering limits" is thematized in the guild's inability to save their home and Lira's own "limit had always been faces." It reweights the premise at closure ("limits overcome") but doesn't narrow on-page options during pressure. More resonant concept than tactical stake. Present in setup and payoff; shapes interpretation more than choice.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Fractally precise" appears as description (grain patterns, spirals, brushstrokes) but never enables or constrains an action. Lira uses the coin's indentations—precision matters there—but "fractal" itself remains decorative. Label-only trait without visible trade-off or cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Crafting the portrait is Lira's commission and frames the entire visit. The act shifts from documentation to preservation when she discovers the safe, and her final portrait ("shimmered with constellations") reweights the guild's legacy. Appears in setup, middle reflection, climax (midnight completion), and charges the ending. Central to both motive and closure; removing it breaks the story.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The coin's indentations unlock the panel (middle beat) and function as thematic anchor ("map to secrets yet undiscovered") in the final image. Signaled early when the guild member gives it with cryptic words. Mechanics matter: alignment of grooves is the gate to discovery. Present in setup, enables the key middle turn, returns at closure with reweighted meaning.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The tree-trunk library is indispensable: its hollow holds the shelves, panel, and safe; its grain informs Lira's painting; the wrecking ball tightens the clock. Setting pressures every major choice and supplies the tactile constraint (coin-to-panel fit). Anchored early, active in discovery and painting beats, drives the urgent exit. Would fail without this exact location.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The "hush just before" demolition frames urgency and the crew's shadows signal the countdown. The wrecking ball's test rumble interrupts discovery; its first blow forces Lira's exit. Time pressure is dramatized and tightens decisions, but the exact midnight completion and walk-away feel less constrained by the clock than by narrative tidiness. Present in setup, middle complication, and closure trigger.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"To mirror the sky inside walls" is the guild's motive (journal entry) and reframes Lira's commission. It shapes her painting (mixing ultramarine/gold, constellations) and the thematic close. Desire is told via the journal rather than conflicted in Lira's own choices—she enacts it without friction. Lyric reprise (first discovery to final portrait) reweights the stake, but lacks on-page struggle between competing wants.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Heightened stillness" appears in the opening (damp air, parchment) and closing ("lingered, a silent hymn"), bracketing the piece. Tone modulates under pressure: calm exploration, quickening discovery, dust and chaos at the wrecking ball, quiet resolve in the walk-away. Coherent through turns and charges the final image with restrained intensity. Not static; supports accumulation without shouting.</comment>
