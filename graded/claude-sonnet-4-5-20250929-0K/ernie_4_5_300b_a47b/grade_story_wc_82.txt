<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The lantern maker's grief-driven motivation is coherent and her craft provides a concrete outlet for processing loss. The brother's memory is embodied through the lantern's recorded voice and the origami cranes, creating contradictory impulses (polishing wounds vs. outrunning darkness). However, the shadow confrontation at the end feels unmotivated—she suddenly "isn't afraid" without dramatized internal progression to earn that shift. The final stance crystallization lacks visible cost; she simply decides to be ready next time.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: grief-folding imagery builds through polishing, origami, and lantern-light until the final confrontation. Orientation anchors clearly (workshop on floating island, after shadow's prior visit, twilight). The closure unit—facing the shadow with the lantern and declaring readiness—lands as Charged Poise, but the cost remains asserted rather than felt on the page. The line "I see you, and I'm not afraid" reconfigures her stance, yet no prior beat demonstrated what made this moment different from her years of basilica-building and crane-folding.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The floating island tea garden, bioluminescent moss, and workshop perch create a vivid, purposeful frame. The glass basilica's paradox (descends while ascending) is integrated into the grief-folding logic and charges the final image when its spires shed ascending stars. The gem and lantern constrain her method (polish until the stone weeps, capture light), and the workshop's lavender smoke and moonstone bowl anchor sensory particulars in her craft. Spatial choreography between workshop and tea garden below remains clear throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is legible: transform grief into something that can fly, confront the shadow without fleeing. The lantern-crafting beat tightens pressure as her brother's voice spills out, creating "luminous torment." However, the shadow's return and dissolution feel convenient rather than earned—she holds up the lantern, whispers "I see you," and it recoils without resistance or trade-off. No visible price is paid; the cranes take flight and she simply polishes the next gem. One meaningful tightening (the lantern's emotional flood) occurs, but closure lacks felt cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The theme of grief-as-transformation emerges organically through the polishing/folding motif and the basilica's paradox. "To transform was to carry the old into the new, to let grief and hope intertwine like vines" is direct, but the surrounding imagery (origami cranes catching lantern-glow, spires shedding ascending stars) embodies the concept without sermonizing. The final image—polishing the next gem—offers a resonant answer: survival through perpetual transmutation. The piece resists tidy resolution; the shadow will return, and she'll fold that too.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable; perceptual signature is craft-specific (facets, moonstone, bioluminescence) and grief-colored. Voice is distinct: "Dreams are just grief with wings" and "her heart a knot of ache and awe" carry lyric compression without obscuring clarity. However, under peak stress (brother's voice cascade, shadow confrontation) the diction remains ornate and controlled rather than degrading authentically. Psychic distance stays consistent; no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout: "facets catching twilight like a thousand captured stars," "conversations soft as moth wings," "sound brittle as winter ice." While imagery is vivid, the relentless metaphoric texture in nearly every sentence—even during the shadow confrontation—creates a static lyricism that flattens urgency. Paraphrase appears: "to fold grief into something that could fly" repeats the transform-through-carrying idea stated two paragraphs prior. Rhythm is controlled but uniform; sentence openings vary, yet the syntactic register never modulates with pressure. No scaffold loops or generation artifacts, but information density suffers under ornamental layering.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The grief-as-craft frame (polishing wounds into gems, folding sorrow into cranes) offers a fresh synthesis, and the descending-ascending basilica paradox is memorable. However, the shadow-as-antagonist and magical-object-confrontation beats follow familiar fantasy templates without transformation. The emotional core—artisan processing sibling loss—is authentic, but the tea-garden patrons and miraculous light show feel ornamental rather than thematically integral. The final gem-polishing image commits to the premise, yet the shadow's convenient dissolution undercuts boldness.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The lantern maker polishes the gem, presses it into the lantern's heart, and holds the lantern up to confront the shadow—three distinct on-page actions that drive beats. Her choice to "be ready" for the next shadow and polish another gem closes the arc. Early signal in opening line. However, the shadow confrontation choice feels reactive rather than a turn that narrows options; she simply holds up the light and it works.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The glass basilica appears in paragraph one, its spires "twisting upward" and humming; paragraph three elaborates its descent-while-ascending paradox and its origin (built after the shadow detached). In the climax, it "shuddered, its spires shedding shards of light that spiraled into the sky"—the ascending stars embody the transformation theme. Three beats, early signal, charges the closure image. Structural role (foundation sinking, spires piercing) is specific and irreplaceable. Slightly ornamental in middle paragraphs but essential to grief-folding logic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dream recording is introduced paragraph two: lanterns hold "a sliver of someone's dream, a fragment of sleep spun into glass." Tonight's lantern will "hold the memory of her brother's last words"—the core stake. The climax dramatizes the recording: "Her brother's voice spilled from the lantern, a cascade of memories." Early signal, shapes the dominant stake, and the method (capture dream-light in glass) drives her craft. The concept is indispensable; without it, the lantern is merely a light source and the brother's voice has no vessel.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The attribute is introduced paragraph three: "her basilica descended while ascending. Its foundation sank into the island's core, but its spires pierced the heavens, a paradox of gravity and yearning." It's explicitly tied to grief-folding: "Grief, she'd learned, could not be buried; it had to be folded." The climax image (spires shedding ascending stars) embodies the paradox. However, the attribute remains metaphoric rather than constraining an on-page choice with cost. Early signal, thematic resonance, charges closure image, but no tactical consequence.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Transform is the story's engine: "The shadow wasn't something to flee—it was something to transform." She transforms grief into lanterns, origami cranes, and ascending light. The climax enacts transformation: "This was her magic: to descend while ascending, to fold grief into something that could fly." The final paragraph commits: "She'd fold this moment into a crane too." Early signal (paragraph four: "only the shadow's visit" led to folding), drives every beat, defines the closure stance. Swapping "transform" for "contain" or "release" would break the paradox logic.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Gem polishing appears in the opening line: "fingers trembled as she polished the final gem." Paragraph two details the method: "polish until the stone weeps, then capture the light"—a technique she'd "perfected." The gem "shuddered, its facets reflecting" her brother's face, then she "pressed the polished gem into a lantern's heart." Final paragraph: "already polishing her next gem, its surface dull and pitted. Soon, it would shine." Four beats, early signal, the mechanics matter (weeping stone captures light), drives the recording process, and brackets the story. Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The floating island tea garden is established in paragraph one (workshop "perched on the edge") and paragraph three (islands drifting, patrons sipping jasmine tea). Paragraph six: patrons gasp as light fragments descend. Final paragraph: "the floating island tea garden buzzed with tales." It provides spatial context and witnesses the miracle, but does not constrain her choices or supply resources that alter outcome. Early signal, recurs across beats, but remains backdrop rather than pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Timeframe is anchored paragraph one: "after the shadow detached—that nameless, hungry thing that had torn her brother from the world." Paragraph two: "But tonight, she'd craft one for herself." Paragraph six: "The shadow detached again that night." Final: "By dawn, the floating island tea garden buzzed." The timeframe (years after first shadow, tonight's crafting, shadow's return, dawn aftermath) structures the sequence and the recursive threat (next shadow will come) tightens the ending stakes. However, no live countdown pressures tactics during the crafting or confrontation.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Origami crane motivation is introduced paragraph four: "she'd begun crafting origami cranes from her sorrow, each one a plea to the void. But the cranes kept unraveling." This failure drives her turn to lanterns. Paragraph seven: scattered cranes "began to stir. One by one, they caught the lantern's glow and took flight"—the cranes finally succeed when charged by the lantern, vindicating her persistent effort. Paragraph eight: "She'd fold this moment into a crane too." Early signal, shapes her method across beats, and the cranes' flight at climax validates the grief-folding logic with visible cost (years of unraveling attempts). Desire is dramatized through repeated failure and final success.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Tone is signaled paragraph two: "lanterns weren't for illumination—they were for recording" (craft meets loss). Paragraph six: "The light swelled, filling the basilica with a luminous torment, beautiful and agonizing." The oxymoron "luminous torment" is restated and embodied: beauty (ascending stars, crane flight) intertwined with pain (brother's voice as "cascade," her "heart a knot of ache and awe"). Tone modulates from workshop calm (lavender smoke) to emotional flood (climax) to brittle resolve (laughter "brittle as winter ice"). Coherent through turns and charges the final image (polishing wounds into shine).</comment>
