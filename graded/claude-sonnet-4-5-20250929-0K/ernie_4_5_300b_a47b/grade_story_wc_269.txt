<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Lira's interiority relies heavily on abstract labels ("mosaic of grief," "drumbeat of defiance") rather than embodied contradiction. Her tapping practice is asserted as meaningful but never shown constraining a choice or revealing internal conflict in action. The final decision to follow the path lacks visible cost—no demonstrated sacrifice or foreclosed option grounds the choice. Kael appears only to validate her findings, applying no genuine relational pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation Test penalty: who/where/when anchors arrive promptly, waiving the deduction. However, the closure unit lacks on-page cost. Lira and Kael "descend into the storm" and sail toward a reef, but no concrete consequence, forfeiture, or reweighted stance appears—the final paragraphs assert healing and change without showing what was lost or altered. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural (clues assembled, cyclical islands, bioluminescent spelling), but the ending delivers summary ("assembling a new world") instead of a charged image that reweights prior material with felt pressure. Cost proof test fails: no identifiable sentence shows a price paid at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The sea-level station, atlas page, and bioluminescent plankton provide vivid anchors. The storm and observation deck are used to stage the revelation beat, but the reef itself—central to the ending—remains abstract ("corals pulsing with life," "glowing like embers") without spatial constraints or sensory specificity that alters tactics. The atlas page constrains one choice (cross-referencing coordinates) but does not charge the final image, capping the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—discovering why paths disappear—is signaled early and drives assembly of clues. However, escalation is tepid: Kael's dismissal poses no obstacle Lira must navigate, and the bioluminescent coordinates arrive as coincidence rather than protagonist-driven pressure. The storm complicates but does not test commitment. The decision to follow the path is announced, not earned through a visible trade-off or cost, leaving the tightening incomplete under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Theme of cyclical reality and oceanic memory emerges through the atlas, flickering islands, and coral imagery. The fossil-fuel-ban backdrop and "periodically eternal" concept are present but remain abstractly stated ("it was awakening something older") rather than arising from concrete particulars. The ending attempts resonance ("one tap at a time") but the final paragraph resorts to thematic summary ("The ocean was healing, but it was also changing") instead of letting the image speak. No non-literal answer; the moral is stated outright.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Lira's perceptual signature (tapping, assembling clues) is asserted but her internal voice often slips into elevated, generic diction ("currency," "mosaic of grief," "drumbeat of defiance") that reads ornamental rather than character-specific. Dialogue is minimal; Kael's lines are functional. The prose modulates with emotional intensity but lacks a distinct rhythmic texture under peak pressure. Filter verbs ("she realized," "she recognized") appear frequently without voice motivation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Patterned-artifact penalty: paraphrase loops ("The paths that disappeared were not lost—they were waiting" echoes "the way the paths reappeared"; "atlas page" touched repeatedly without new pressure), template cadence in final paragraphs ("The fossil fuel ban had been... The ocean was healing... And the corals..."), and stock metaphors ("bones in a graveyard," "lighthouse beam") cluster in closure beats. Deduction: −1.0 in Q7 for loops and template runs touching the ending. Simultaneous-action error: "her fingers drumming" while she cross-references lacks clear sequence. Line-level clarity is serviceable elsewhere, preventing a steeper drop.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The premise—post-ban ocean mystery with cyclical islands—is competently executed but derivative of climate-fiction templates and magical-realist tropes (atlas as portal, bioluminescent signs). The "periodically eternal" concept and tapping practice are present but not transformed into fresh synthesis; swapping them for other mystical markers would leave the arc unchanged. No bold risk heightens stakes. The ending's assertions ("awakening something older") replace specific discovery with abstract wonder.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Lira witnesses bleaching and assembles data, but her choices (cross-referencing, tapping) do not create reversals. Her decision to follow the path is stated, not tested. Present across beats but replaceable with any investigator role.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The atlas page appears in three beats: discovery, cross-reference, and pressed to chest at climax. It supplies coordinates that enable the final move. However, its meaning does not evolve—it remains a clue throughout. Closure linkage is gestural (pressed to chest) rather than causal. Two-gate credit (setup, middle); payoff is cameo only.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>Delayed revelation is asserted in the title and summarized ("The delayed revelation came three days later"), but the bioluminescent coordinates arrive as coincidence, not as a reweighted prior clue. The concept frames expectation but does not constrain tactics or alter options on the page.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Periodically eternal" is applied to islands as a label ("they existed in cycles, flickering in and out of reality") but never constrains an action or imposes cost. It is explained rather than used. Ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Assembling clues drives the middle (atlas, satellite images, sensor data) and culminates in the decision to follow coordinates. The action is present in multiple beats and essential to the arc. However, it does not redefine options at closure—the final assembly is summarized rather than shown altering tactics. Three-gate credit with mid-band causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Tapping appears in four beats but remains habit-level description ("a practice she'd developed," "her tapping grew urgent," "a drumbeat of defiance"). It never enables or constrains an on-page action with cost; removing it would leave the plot intact. Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The station houses the lab and observation deck, staging two key beats (cross-reference, bioluminescent reveal). Spatial choreography is clear. The setting does not constrain choice—any coastal research outpost would serve equally. Functional across beats but not irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>The fossil-fuel ban is mentioned in exposition and tied to the "awakening" at closure, but it does not tighten decisions or impose a ticking clock. Time is vague ("two weeks prior," "three days later"). The ban's effect on healing is asserted, not dramatized as a constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The desire to discover why paths disappear is stated early and drives clue assembly. However, it is not dramatized as conflicted—no competing want or cost friction appears. Lira's pursuit is unopposed; Kael's skepticism evaporates instantly. Motivation is clear but frictionless.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Drifting moored" tone is pursued through images of the station clinging like a barnacle, silence as currency, and the final voyage. However, the tone flattens into assertive summary in the final third ("a drumbeat of defiance," "they were assembling a new world"), losing the drifting ambiguity. Coherent early but does not modulate under pressure or charge the closure image.</comment>
