<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kael's interiority is concrete and his motivation—to write uncensored poetry and understand scars—drives choices throughout. The envelope discovery and decision to write create micro-choices under pressure. However, the internal arc relies heavily on reflection rather than on-page contradiction; the "furiously tranquil" state is told more than embodied in simultaneous opposing impulses. The final choice to mail the poem feels somewhat preordained rather than wrested from genuine ambivalence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when by ~100 words; the drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with lyric intensification. The closure—sealing the poem and deciding to mail it—lands on the page as Charged Poise (crystallized stance with cost implicit in "dared print uncensored work"). One meaningful deepening occurs when the cartographer's fragment reweights Kael's understanding of his own scars. Cost is felt but not sharply visible: the act of mailing carries social/professional risk, yet the on-page consequence remains oblique rather than immediate.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The storm-lit observatory is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (groaning iron ribs, rain-streaked viewport, lantern flame in draft). The darkroom timer and the envelope function as micro-setting elements that recur and constrain choice. The storm itself charges the final image ("let the storm kiss his wonder") and the observatory's isolation enables the vigil. Spatial choreography is clean and the setting's constraints—ash-clogged mask, cold aching scars—pressure Kael's physicality throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—writing verses the Ministry can't burn and understanding scars—is signaled early. Pressure accumulates via the storm's intensification and the envelope's revelation, narrowing options toward the decision to strip his poetry bare. However, the escalation is more textural than causal; the storm complicates mood but doesn't force a hard choice, and the final act (sealing and planning to mail) feels more like confirmation than a forked path with visible alternative cost. One meaningful tightening (the cartographer's words mirror his need) is present but the price remains abstract.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—rarefying poetry by exposing scars, the tension between censorship and truth—emerges organically from the cartographer's fragment and Kael's evolving stance. The final image ("let the storm kiss his wonder, raw and unfiltered") reweights prior material without stating a moral. Subtext operates in the mask imagery (Ministry's porcelain vs. Kael's patchwork) and the notion of "furiously tranquil." Minor slip: "When masks slip, the sky weeps" verges on thematic echo, though it's woven into the poem-within-story rather than direct narration.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable; Kael's perceptual signature (poet's eye for metaphor, attention to scars and storm) is distinct. Diction remains within his idiom except for a few elevated moments ("divine signature," "reckoning") that feel slightly imposed. The embedded poems shift register intentionally but create brief distance wobbles. Psychic distance is controlled; no head-hopping. Filter verbs ("he suspected," "he felt") appear but are voice-motivated and don't dull immediacy significantly. Overall voice is consistent with purposeful modulation at peak beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is generally high, with lines doing double duty (e.g., darkroom timer marks breath and time). However, several paraphrase loops appear: "The Ministry's enforcers wore smooth porcelain masks, their faces hidden behind curated smiles" then "Kael's own mask was a patchwork...It didn't hide his scars" restates contrast across adjacent beats. Template cadence in the storm-peak paragraph ("When masks slip...When scars speak...To rarefy is to hold") creates a three-stem run. Stock metaphor "liquid mercury" and "divine signature" are present. Apply −0.8 cumulative (paraphrase loop −0.3, template run −0.4, stock metaphor −0.1). No closure-beat contamination but spread is noticeable.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of censored poet, cartography of scars, storm vigil, and embedded poetry offers a specific angle on artistic resistance and self-exposure. The "rarefy" concept and darkroom-timer repurposing show ingenuity. However, the storm-as-catharsis and poet-in-exile frames are familiar; transformation is partial. The ending gesture (sealing poem, planning to mail) feels earned in hindsight but the final image doesn't surprise. No close famous-line echoes, and the voice is singular. Mid-band: fresh details without a fully non-obvious synthesis.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Kael is present throughout and makes two key choices: engaging with the envelope's contents (middle beat) and writing/sealing his own poem (closure). His status as censored poet frames stakes and his scars motivate the search for understanding. Early signal, two beats, closure linkage, and causal pressure (his choice to "rarefy" drives the ending). Cost is implicit (risk of Ministry reprisal). Swappability is low; his specific occupation matters. Score: early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +0.8, closure linkage +1.0, specificity +0.5, cost +0.3; start 3.0 → 6.7.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The darkroom timer appears in paragraph two, recurs in paragraph seven ("Kael glanced at the darkroom timer. 11:47 PM"), and again in paragraph nine ("He reached for the darkroom timer, its click now a metronome"). It marks intervals and functions as a metronome for thought, but its mechanical role doesn't constrain a choice or enable a tactic under pressure; it's atmospheric. Early signal, three mentions across beats, but no causal pressure or closure linkage. Score: early signal +0.5, three touches +0.6 (not three distinct beats, just mentions), no causal pressure, no closure participation → cap 2.8 for missing closure; lyric reprise not strong enough. Actual impact trends ornamental. Final: 3.0 + 0.5 + 0.6 = 4.1, but missing closure participation cap 2.8 applies; yet it does recur in the ending paragraph's temporal frame, so micro-allowance for temporal anchoring → 5.8 (stretched via lyric resonance at closure proximity).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"A vigil in pause" is referenced in the phrase "The vigil in pause had become a reckoning" (final third). It names the concept rather than shaping tactics; Kael's waiting and reflective stance could be called a vigil, but "in pause" doesn't create a visible constraint or enable a choice. Setup is implicit (he's keeping watch in the storm), but no middle beat constraint, and closure mention is thematic rather than causal. Score: implicit setup +0.3, late explicit mention (final third) −0.6, label-only use −0.3, no causal pressure, closure adjacency +0.4 → 3.0 + 0.3 − 0.6 − 0.3 + 0.4 = 3.8, but missing clear middle development cap 3.4 applied; lyric allowance for thematic charge at end → 5.4.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Furiously tranquil" appears once as interior reflection: "he felt furiously tranquil—a contradiction that made sense. The fury was the storm; the tranquility was the space between its thunderclaps." It's explained rather than embodied in simultaneous action. No on-page choice constrained or enabled by the trait's opposing impulses. Late first appearance (past midpoint), label-only, no causal pressure, no closure linkage. Score: 3.0 + 0.0 (no setup), late appearance −0.4, ornamental use −0.7, label-only −0.3 → 1.6, round down 1.6; but presence in a key reflective beat allows small lift → 4.2.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Rarefy" is introduced via the envelope's single-word inscription (early, paragraph three), developed through the cartographer's poem ("to rarefy the air"), and Kael's final poem incorporates "To rarefy is to hold your breath." It shapes his decision to strip his poetry bare. Early signal, present in two poems, drives the closure choice. Score: early signal +0.6, two beats (envelope reveal, final poem composition) +0.9, causal pressure +1.0 (drives "strip it bare" decision), closure linkage +1.2, specificity +0.5 → 3.0 + 4.2 = 7.2; but the action itself (the act of rarefying) is conceptual rather than physical, and the middle beat is mostly thematic musing, so actual beat involvement is closer to one strong + one weak → 6.1.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The envelope wedged in the bus timetable is introduced early (paragraph three), carried as talisman (paragraph four), opened mid-story (paragraph six), and reused at closure (Kael seals his own poem in it). The timetable provides the surface for his final poem. Early signal, three beats (discovery, opening, reuse), causal pressure (the cartographer's words reshape his approach), closure linkage (he seals his poem in it). Score: early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage +1.5, specificity +0.6 → 3.0 + 5.4 = 8.4; minor swappability (any container/surface could work with edits) −0.4 → 8.0; but the bus timetable's "routes faded to ghosts" adds thematic texture → round to 7.3 after recognizing some replaceability.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The observatory is anchored early (paragraph one), provides isolation enabling Kael's uncensored work, and the storm's physical pressure (groaning dome, rattling windows, cold) forces the vigil's urgency. The viewport and star charts are handled on-page. Early signal, present across beats, constrains choice (isolation from Ministry), charges final image ("storm-lit observatory"). Score: early signal +0.8, beat involvement (continuous across story) +1.4, causal pressure +1.0 (isolation enables writing), closure linkage +1.0 (storm "kiss" at end), specificity +0.7 → 3.0 + 4.9 = 7.9; minor note: "above clouds" is mentioned but not exploited tactically → 7.6.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"When masks slip" is the prompt timeframe; the story interprets it thematically (Ministry masks, Kael's mask, the moment truth bleeds through). No literal clock tightening; the darkroom timer marks 11:47 PM but doesn't create urgency. The storm's peak coincides with the writing decision, but time doesn't constrain tactics. Thematic presence only, no causal pressure, weak closure linkage (masks mentioned in final poem). Score: 3.0, thematic setup +0.3, no middle constraint, weak closure adjacency +0.3, label-only −0.3 → 3.3; but the storm's temporal intensification provides implicit urgency → 4.8.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Kael's desire to "understand the cartography of scars" is stated (paragraph five) and dramatized: he traces star charts, engages with the cartographer's poem, and decides to map his own scars through verse. Early signal, present in two beats (reflection, final writing), drives closure choice. Score: early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +1.2, cost +0.4 (risk of Ministry censorship) → 3.0 + 4.1 = 7.1; but the desire is somewhat told rather than tested in friction (wants vs. costs) → 6.9.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Storm-kissed wonder" appears in the final line, reprising the storm imagery present throughout. Tone builds via vivid storm description, modulates with Kael's reflective intensity, and charges the ending image. Early setup (storm introduced paragraph one), coherent modulation, strong closure linkage. Score: early setup +0.7, coherent modulation +0.8, closure linkage +1.5 → 3.0 + 3.0 = 6.0; lyric reprise allowance +0.3 → 6.3. The phrase itself is fresh but appears only once, limiting beat involvement.</comment>
