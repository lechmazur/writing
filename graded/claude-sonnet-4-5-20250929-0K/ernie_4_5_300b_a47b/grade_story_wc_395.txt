<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is clear but her interiority relies heavily on stock phrasing ("pulse quickening," "heart raced"). The final decision to upload coordinates and flee reads more as plot necessity than earned character choice—we see determination asserted but not the internal contradiction or cost that would make her renunciation of safety credible. Hale is a one-note obstacle whose lies are telegraphed rather than dramatized through behavior. Elara exists only as archived voice, which suits the premise, but Lira's emotional connection to her case lacks embodied specificity beyond repeated gazing at the patch.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story anchors who/where/when adequately in the opening paragraph. Causal lens is attempted: Lira follows numbers → finds encrypted video → discovers coordinates → uploads them. However, the closure relies on convenient timing (alarms blare exactly when she cracks the code) and Lira's escape is asserted off-page ("was already gone") without showing the cost or mechanism. The video revelation that "they're using it to delete people" arrives too late to shape her prior tactics, functioning more as exposition than earned discovery. One meaningful tightening occurs when Hale confronts her, but the final beat substitutes declaration ("she was done") for visible consequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The archive setting is established with concrete details (servers humming, cold light, holographic interface, red drone lights) and the patch functions as a recurring tactile anchor. However, the environment doesn't constrain Lira's choices—she accesses restricted files, cracks encryption, and uploads data without meaningful friction from the space itself. The "derelict research station on the edge of the system" is mentioned but never charges the closure. Spatial choreography is clear in the final confrontation, but the setting operates more as backdrop than pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake (finding Elara/exposing the cover-up) is signaled early. Escalation is present but formulaic: obstacles (Hale's lie, restricted files, encryption) are overcome in sequence without forcing difficult trade-offs. The video reveal provides new information but doesn't deepen the conflict—it simply confirms what Lira suspected. The alarm/drone arrival feels manufactured to inject urgency rather than arising from her choices. Her final act (uploading coordinates to her neural implant) happens off-page with no visible cost—we're told she's "already gone" but don't see what she sacrifices or risks in that escape.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The theme of erasure and institutional memory emerges from the premise but is stated rather than embodied. Elara's video delivers the thematic thesis directly ("they're using it to delete people"). The recurring numbers function as mystery mechanics rather than charged motif—their meaning is decoded but they don't reweight prior material or force moral calculus. The final paragraph asserts resolve ("she would make sure the world remembered") in place of a resonant image. The patch appears three times but remains static; its spiral galaxy symbol is never integrated into the closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. The prose maintains consistent distance and Lira's perceptual filter is clear. However, voice lacks distinctive texture—phrases like "her heart raced," "pulse quickening," and "unshakable resolve" are generic. Dialogue from Hale and Elara serves function but lacks subtext: Hale's lines are overtly villainous ("some truths aren't meant to be found"), Elara's are expository. Psychic distance remains constant without purposeful modulation under pressure. Filter verbs ("wondered," "knew") appear frequently but don't flatten immediacy significantly.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Prose is generally clean with varied sentence structure and no major grammatical errors. However, the text exhibits paraphrase loops: "numbers kept leading her back" / "the numbers led and the truth waited"; "her eyes brightly attentive" / "brightly attentive gaze." Stock metaphors appear in pressure beats ("sea of data streams," "footprints in snow," "beacon for those brave enough"). The final sequence relies on telling over showing: "her mind racing toward the edge of the system" asserts rather than dramatizes her escape. Information density is moderate; many sentences advance plot but few do multiple jobs simultaneously.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The core premise closely follows familiar templates: corporate whistleblower uncovers conspiracy, discovers deleted evidence, flees with crucial data just as security arrives. The "recurring numbers as key" and "gateway that deletes people" add science-fiction dressing but don't transform the underlying structure. The patch and Elara's video function as standard mystery breadcrumbs. Hale is a stock corporate villain; his confrontation follows expected beats. The story commits to its premise but offers no surprising angle or non-obvious moral territory. Emotional progression is predictable: curiosity → determination → defiance.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Lira's role as corporate memory keeper frames her access and motivation (setup present). She makes key decisions: to investigate restricted files, crack encryption, and upload coordinates (development and payoff present). However, her profession's specific demands don't constrain her choices—she operates more as generic investigator than memory keeper. Her final choice to upload and flee is asserted rather than shown with cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The patch appears in three beats: discovered in vault (setup), on her desk during decryption (middle touch), held up during confrontation with Hale (payoff). Its symbol (spiral galaxy encircled by stars) is described but never gains functional or reweighted meaning. Lira wonders if Elara touched it the same way, but this reflection doesn't alter her tactics. In the confrontation it serves as prop for her challenge ("Then why keep this?") but isn't causally active in closure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The missing persons cold case is the story's inciting premise and shapes Lira's dominant stake throughout (setup strong, development continuous). The case drives her investigation, frames the encrypted video discovery, and propels her final choice to preserve the coordinates. However, the "cold case" aspect—implying years of dormancy and investigative obstacles—isn't dramatized; Lira solves it in a single night's work. The ending connects directly to this concept but doesn't complicate it with new cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Brightly attentive" appears twice as direct label ("eyes brightly attentive," "brightly attentive gaze") but never constrains or enables action with cost. It describes Lira's focus but doesn't create tactical friction (e.g., missing social cues due to data fixation) or advantage (noticing details others miss with visible consequence). The attribute is ornamental—swapping it for "focused" or "vigilant" would require no structural change.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Hale's lie ("the data was corrupted beyond repair") is present early (setup) and drives Lira's distrust, spurring her to dig deeper into restricted files (development). His second lie ("Sentimental value") occurs at the confrontation and underscores the cover-up (payoff). However, the lie's mechanics don't redefine options—Lira already suspected deception and proceeds on her initial course. The lie motivates but doesn't pivot the plot; the encrypted video's revelation does more causal work.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Recurring numbers (7-14-21) appear in multiple contexts: file timestamps, error logs, access codes, Elara's logs and dreams, static patterns (setup strong). Lira cross-references them to find Project Lazarus and the encrypted video (development). They resolve as coordinates to the research station (payoff). However, their "everywhere" quality is asserted more than demonstrated—we see three mentions of their locations but don't experience Lira noticing them accumulate pressure. The method shapes the investigation's structure but could be replaced with another breadcrumb trail (e.g., encrypted fragments) without major rewrites.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The social network archive is established early with sensory detail (servers humming, cold light, holographic interface) and frames Lira's access to company data (setup). She uses the archive's metadata and global map to trace coordinates (development). However, the setting doesn't constrain her actions—restricted files and encryption are overcome without spatial or systemic friction. The archive functions as backdrop for her investigation rather than pressure source. At closure, she uploads data "to her neural implant," a body-tech element that supersedes the archive setting.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Across the echo of forgotten songs" appears once as transition phrase before Lira digs deeper, evoking erasure thematically but not functioning as temporal frame. The story spans "through the night" to "dawn" (one session) but this timeframe doesn't tighten tactics—Lira works steadily without time pressure until the alarm arbitrarily triggers. The phrase is metaphorical color rather than structural element; removing it changes nothing about pacing or choice. No clock or deadline shapes her moves.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Lira's desire to find where deleted files go is stated ("hunting for something deeper: the truth") and drives the investigation throughout (setup and development continuous). She pursues Project Lazarus files, their "ghostly impressions," and ultimately the gateway coordinates (payoff). However, the motivation remains abstract—her personal stake in Elara's case (why this astronaut haunts her) is asserted ("haunted her for years") but not dramatized through memory or embodied connection. The friction between wanting truth and institutional opposition is declared rather than shown through difficult trade-offs on the page.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The phrase "sensed absence" appears once directly ("The sensed absence of information gnawed at her") and thematically echoes in "forgotten songs," "deleted folders," and "ghostly impressions." The tone of erasure and void is coherent but operates at a single register throughout—Lira's determination remains constant rather than modulating under pressure. At closure, absence doesn't charge the final image; instead, the story shifts to action and assertion ("she was already gone"). The tone is present but doesn't deepen or reconfigure meaning in the ending beat.</comment>
