<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Mara's retrocognitive gift is stated but never dramatized through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. Her decision to descend feels obligatory rather than earned by visible internal conflict—we're told "her own identity fraying" but see no on-page micro-choices that show this cost altering her tactics. The final emergence with blank diary pages offers no legible transformation or renunciation with felt price; the protagonist simply executes plot moves without embodied struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation is functional (zeppelin, dunes, lagoon anchored early), but causality fractures at key junctures: Mara's descent into tunnels occurs because the ghost "leads," not from protagonist agency; the antagonist's sudden appearance in the chamber is convenient staging, and his defeat via trapdoor is unearned by prior set-up. The closure—diary pages now blank, "truth's out there"—asserts resolution without showing what changed on the page or what Mara forfeited. No persistent constraint shapes the ending image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The obsidian lagoon and zeppelin library are vividly described, but setting operates as backdrop rather than constraint. The tunnels, fungi-lit chamber, and trapdoor appear only when plot requires them, with no prior spatial grounding or tool/environment interaction that narrows Mara's choices. The final beat—emerging at dawn, lagoon calm—resets atmosphere without spatial consequence, missing the opportunity to charge the closure image through changed or constrained space.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake (uncover hidden codex before regime descendants do) is declared but never tested through on-page reversals driven by Mara's agency. The antagonist's reveal and chamber collapse happen to her rather than from her tactical choices under pressure. The ending asserts "bought time" and "truth's out there" without dramatizing what was gained or lost; no live option was foreclosed with visible cost, and coincidence (trapdoor conveniently placed) resolves the confrontation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>Theme of erasure vs. truth is announced repeatedly ("They'll erase us all," "history's written by victors") rather than emerging from image and action. The final line—"Let them find it"—reads as a thesis statement, not a resonant image that reweights prior material. Mara's arc from "trapped in loops" to holder of blank diary offers no non-literal answer to the central question; the codex destruction and her survival feel like plot mechanics rather than thematic reckoning with cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping, and some passages carry distinct texture ("obsidian water reflecting her face like a distorted mirror"). However, diction slips into exposition at pressure points: "retrocognitive gift had trapped her" is summary; dialogue from Joran and Elara sounds interchangeably informational rather than character-specific. The antagonist's "We're all 'them,' dear" is villain-speak cliché. Psychic distance remains flat across emotional peaks, missing the chance to tighten or widen for effect.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Prose is largely clear with purposeful imagery ("dunes painted crimson," "chamber glowed with bioluminescent fungi"), but several beats loop or scaffold: "The lagoon shuddered. The water rippled" restates the same effect; "temple cadence" appears in consecutive description blocks without variation. Filter verbs cluster in the retrocognitive vision sequences ("she saw," "she also saw"), dulling immediacy. The closure beat—"diary pages now blank"—is clean, so non-closure artifacts are contained, but momentum sags in the tunnel descent where summary replaces scene.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The core premise—retrocognitive archivist decrypts resistance diary via lagoon threshold—synthesizes familiar elements (ghost mentor, fascist legacy hunters, encrypted artifact) without transforming them through specific moral calculus or world logic. The beach-debris messaging system is mentioned once and never constrains tactics. The antagonist reveal (Historical Preservation Society head) gestures at irony but resolves via convenient trapdoor rather than Mara's insight or sacrifice. The ending's assertion that "truth's out there" substitutes declaration for earned consequence, missing the opportunity for a non-obvious reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Mara is present throughout and makes several decisions (kneeling beside trunk, descending to lagoon, triggering trapdoor), but these choices feel obligatory to plot rather than creating key turns. Her archival profession is label-only; we see no on-page use of research skills or archival method that shapes tactics. The final emergence with blank diary is a state change, not a choice-driven turn. Swappable with "determined historian" or "obsessed scholar" with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The obsidian lagoon appears early (framing beat), is handled in the middle parley scene (Mara arranges debris at its edge, Elara emerges from it), and returns at closure ("lagoon calm once more"). Its threshold property—"stay past sunset, and you'll stay forever"—is stated but never tested on the page, so no cost is visibly tied to it. The staircase it reveals enables the descent, a functional beat. Integration is solid but stops short of indispensable; the specific obsidian-mirror quality doesn't narrow a climactic choice.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The encrypted diary is introduced early and drives Mara's retrocognitive visions and the search for the final codex. It reappears at closure with "pages now blank," a state change that suggests meaning but without clear causal link to what Mara did or forfeited. The encryption itself—symbols pulsing, maps revealed by lagoon light—is described but never shown constraining Mara's tactics or forcing a decryption choice with cost. Present across setup, middle, and ending, but its mechanics remain ornamental rather than pressure-bearing.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>Mara's retrocognitive gift is stated in exposition ("trapped her in loops of the past since childhood") and summarized ("visions were different… whole scenes"), but never dramatized as a trait that constrains or enables an on-page action with visible cost. We're told "her own identity fraying" but see no moment where the trance forces a trade-off or alters her present tactics. The gift functions as background color rather than live pressure; easily swappable with "psychic sensitivity" or "historian's obsession."</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The parley with Elara's ghost occupies the middle third and delivers key information (final codex location, regime descendants' threat). Mara's choice to spell "Lead on" with debris triggers the staircase reveal, a functional turn. However, the parley itself is exposition-heavy dialogue without tactical friction or cost; Elara provides answers rather than forcing Mara to negotiate under pressure. The action appears in setup and middle but does not decisively shape the closure image or redefine final options—the trapdoor trick, not parley skill, resolves the confrontation.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Beach debris messaging is mentioned by Joran as "the only language the dunes understand," then shown in two beats: Mara etches symbols (circles, angles) spelling "Who are you?" and later hurls debris spelling "Lead on." The method enables contact with Elara and triggers the staircase, giving it functional middle involvement. However, its mechanics are gestural—no on-page detail about how the symbols work or constrain Mara's choices. Swappable with "ritual incantation" or "threshold offering" without altering story logic; specificity is low.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>The zeppelin library is vivid in the opening line ("gondola… bookshelves that seemed to defy gravity") and provides spatial anchor, but never pressures a choice or supplies a resource that affects outcome. Mara kneels beside a trunk there, then leaves for the lagoon; the zeppelin serves as staging and exit vehicle (Joran's horn, rope ladder). The floating library could be replaced with "desert research camp" or "anchored airship" with no change to tactics or closure. Setup present, no development or payoff involvement.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the letters are found" is stated early and orients the reader to the discovery phase. Joran's warning about sunset ("stay past sunset, and you'll stay forever") introduces a ticking clock, but this constraint is never tested—Mara descends, spends unspecified time in tunnels, and emerges "at dawn" with no on-page consequence for the timing. The time pressure evaporates rather than tightening decisions. Functional setup but no middle or closure involvement that alters tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Mara's desire to uncover truth is dramatized through her descent and parley choices ("I have to parley with her," "I just bought time"), and tension arises when Elara shows Mara her own death in a vision, forcing the whispered "I can't." This moment offers brief friction between want (find codex) and cost (personal survival). However, the resolution—triggering the trapdoor—sidesteps the forecasted death without on-page reckoning, so the motivation's cost is asserted but not fully paid. Present in setup, one middle beat, and echoed at closure, but the final choice feels convenient rather than deeply conflicted.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Tone is established early with "obsidian cover etched with symbols that pulsed like a heartbeat" and "obsidian water… black as midnight," sustaining a dreamlike, trance-like atmosphere through the parley and descent. The label "searing reverie" fits the retrocognitive trance descriptions. However, the tone flattens during action beats (trapdoor trigger, antagonist dialogue) into straightforward thriller cadence, then returns to calm at closure ("lagoon calm once more") without modulation that charges the ending. Coherent but static; no tonal deepening or break that reweights the final image under pressure.</comment>
