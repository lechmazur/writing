<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lila's motivation is established (the cataloging of kindnesses, the need for proof), but her decisions feel reactive rather than driven by internal contradiction. The 97-hour insomnia is asserted without embodied cost affecting her perceptions or choices. Mr. Voss's arrival and recognition of his mother function as convenient revelation rather than a choice Lila earns through prior struggle. The final teaching moment is warm but lacks visible foreclosure of an alternate path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with lyric ambitions: the brush, moon, and greenhouse accumulate symbolic weight. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration ("Kindness outlives the tongue that speaks it"), but the cost remains conceptual and diffuse—no tangible option is foreclosed on the page. Mr. Voss's appearance is coincidental; his recognition of Elena solves Lila's search for proof without her agency driving the discovery. The waxing moon timeframe is mentioned but does not tighten decisions. Orientation is clear early, but the closure image ("To love is to translate") leans toward theme statement rather than felt pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The rooftop greenhouse, smog-choked city, and vermilion/sapphire inks establish vivid sensory anchors. The brush's moon-tipped bristles and the lexicon *The Whispering Tongues of Forgotten Seas* are specific and tactile. The greenhouse functions as sanctuary and the smog as ambient menace, but neither constrains a choice or alters tactics—the setting supports mood more than plot. The brush's weight and the moonlight slicing through grime charge the final image but do not shift Lila's options in the peak beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—proving strangers remember kindness—is signaled early but remains abstract until Mr. Voss's arrival. His recognition of Elena provides confirmation rather than forcing Lila to trade competing goods or endure a loss. The escalation is a deepening through accumulation (brush, moon, portrait) rather than a causal tightening, but the final moment lacks a visible price. Coincidence delivers the proof Lila seeks; her agency does not compel the turn. One meaningful pressure point exists (painting Elena's eyes), but it does not narrow options with cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme—kindness as a language that outlives its speakers—emerges organically from the brush, extinct dialects, and the portrait. The final lesson "To love is to translate" risks overt statement but is dramatized through Mr. Voss's offer to teach. The vermilion eyes as "saffron quiet" and the chamomile scent provide sensory resonance. However, the ending leans toward platitude ("remembered warmth") rather than a non-literal answer with undeniable cost. The conceptual repricing is legible but not charged by prior friction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Lila; perceptual signature is consistent (charcoal smudges, ink-stained hands, daydreams). Diction balances lyric compression ("defiant lips," "saffron quiet") with concrete action. Mr. Voss's dialogue ("Brought chamomile. For the… the *restlessness*") carries age and hesitation. Free indirect style is clean. Psychic distance modulates purposefully when Lila imagines Elena in 1947. Minor register drift: "methodically hopeful" and "tangible proof" edge toward elevated abstraction but remain voice-plausible. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks in peak beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies; sentence openings shift. Information density is high in the greenhouse description and brush handling. Minor scaffold appears: "She'd become methodically hopeful" tells rather than shows the trait in action. "The smog seemed less dense" at the end is a soft atmospheric claim without causal trigger. Paraphrase near "kindness was a language too" and "Kindness outlives the tongue that speaks it" restates the same idea within close proximity (−0.2). No major loops or template cadence. Figurative language (moon slicing, ferns dripping) is vivid but dense; "saffron quiet" verges on mixed metaphor yet remains legible.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of insomnia, extinct dialects, and rooftop sanctuary is specific and non-obvious. The moon-tipped brush and smog-choked greenhouse create memorable texture. The plot—artist seeking proof of remembered kindness via a portrait—leans on familiar redemption-through-art templates. Mr. Voss's convenient recognition of his mother as the portrait subject stretches plausibility and reduces earned surprise. The "To love is to translate" lesson offers warmth but not a bold moral calculus. The piece commits fully to its lyric mode, but the ending retreats to safety rather than following its implications into harder territory.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Lila is present throughout and her insomnia is asserted early. She paints Elena's eyes (one key choice), but her other actions—unwrapping the brush, tracing symbols, imagining Elena—are observational or preparatory rather than causal turns. Mr. Voss's arrival, not Lila's decision, delivers the proof she seeks. Her final choice to ask him to teach her is warm but does not alter prior stakes or foreclose a path with visible cost. Two gates (setup, middle choice); closure participation is passive. Swappable with "obsessive painter" with minor edits. Early signal +0.5, one distinct beat +0.4, late-scene decision without prior causal pressure caps growth.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The brush appears in three distinct beats: unwrapping and tracing symbols, painting Elena's eyes with vermilion, and handing it to Mr. Voss at the end. Its moon-tipped bristles and grandmother's history are specific and irreplaceable. The brush's weight "felt like a promise" and its final position "fanned like a starfish" bookend the arc. It enables the portrait that summons Mr. Voss's memory and charges the closure when passed to him. However, the brush does not constrain a choice under pressure—it facilitates rather than complicates. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.0, specificity +0.5, but lacks visible cost tied to its use. All three gates met.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Lost languages shape the premise: the lexicon *The Whispering Tongues of Forgotten Seas*, the grandmother's extinct dialects, Elena's untranslatable letters, and Mr. Voss's offer to teach his mother's dialect. The concept drives Lila's cataloging impulse and the final "To love is to translate" lesson. However, on-page choices do not hinge on language mechanics—Lila does not decode a text or use dialect knowledge to solve a problem. The concept charges theme and the ending image but remains symbolic rather than tactical. Early signal +0.7, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, but swappable with "forgotten traditions" or "lost art forms" without structural change. All three gates met.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Methodically hopeful" is asserted ("She'd become methodically hopeful since the smog arrived, cataloging kindnesses like fossils") but not dramatized as a trait that constrains or enables action with cost. The cataloging (baker's loaf, child's dandelion) is told summary. Lila's choices—painting, imagining Elena, accepting Mr. Voss's offer—do not visibly trade optimism against a competing impulse or pay a price for methodical persistence. The trait labels her stance without shaping tactics. Setup gate met (first third), middle and closure gates missing. Label-only −0.5, summary-only −0.4, swappable with "cautiously optimistic" −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Rouse" appears thematically: moonlight could rouse dormant seeds/memories, Mr. Voss is roused to speak of his mother, the truth "Kindness outlives the tongue" is roused. The concept frames expectation but does not drive a major turn—Mr. Voss arrives coincidentally, not because Lila's moonlit work summons him. The final lesson and Lila's return to painting suggest she has roused her own capacity to continue, but the mechanics are conceptual. Early signal +0.5, two thematic beats +0.9, closure linkage (via "roused a truth") +0.8, but easily swappable with "awaken" or "revive" −0.5. Setup and closure gates met; middle gate (causal choice) missing.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Method is signaled: "let daydreams spark" and "She imagined the woman in her portrait—Elena—alive in 1947." Moonlight is present (waxing moon, "moonlight pooling at her feet"). However, the daydreams do not enable a tactical choice or reveal knowledge that alters Lila's approach—they are illustrative mood rather than a tool. The final insight ("captured her worry," "ache in Mr. Voss's voice") arises from Mr. Voss's presence, not from a moonlit daydream. Setup gate met (first third), middle and closure gates missing. Ornamental −0.7, swappable with "intuition sparked by observation" −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The rooftop greenhouse is established early with vivid detail (glass dome, ferns, orchids, grime, smog). It functions as sanctuary and workspace, sheltering Lila's insomnia and the portrait. Mr. Voss enters through the greenhouse door, and the chamomile scent lingers at dawn. The setting pressures mood (smog versus blooming defiance) but does not constrain a choice—Lila could paint anywhere. The greenhouse charges the final image (scent of chamomile, "quiet rebellion against the smog") but does not alter tactics. Early signal +0.8, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.9, but swappable with "studio apartment" or "hidden garden" without structural break. All three gates met.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The waxing moon is mentioned in the opening third ("under the waxing moon's glow") and at the end ("The waxing moon set"). It signals time passing and charges the lyric texture, but it does not tighten decisions or create a deadline. Lila's 97-hour insomnia suggests accumulated time but is not tracked causally. "By dawn" marks the end, yet no choice hinges on the moon's phase or the approach of sunrise. Setup gate met, middle and closure gates missing. Early signal +0.4, closure mention (non-causal) +0.3, but no pressure on tactics. Swappable with "full moon" or "midnight" −0.5, ornamental −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The motivation is stated clearly: "proof—tangible proof—that strangers remembered kindness eluded her." Lila catalogs kindnesses (baker, child) and paints Elena seeking connection. Mr. Voss's recognition of his mother provides the proof Lila seeks, fulfilling the motivation at closure. However, the desire does not create friction—Lila does not face a trade-off between seeking proof and another want, and the proof arrives via coincidence rather than her choice under pressure. Early signal +0.7, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, but no visible cost tied to the desire. Setup, middle (cataloging), and closure gates met.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Saffron quiet" appears in the final third ("vermilion eyes gleamed, alive with a saffron quiet—the color of remembered warmth") and charges the ending. The tone throughout is hushed, lyric, and warm despite the smog; modulates slightly when Mr. Voss arrives (tears, trembling hand) but remains cohesive. However, the phrase "saffron quiet" is introduced late and functions as descriptor rather than a constraint. It reweights the portrait's mood but does not shape a prior choice. Late first appearance (final third) −0.7, closure linkage +1.2, specificity +0.4, but ornamental use (label without action pressure) −0.5. Lyric-resonance allowance applies: the tone seeds early (twilight, dew, quiet concrete) and the final phrase reweights with undeniable warmth, qualifying for mid-5s to low-6s.</comment>
