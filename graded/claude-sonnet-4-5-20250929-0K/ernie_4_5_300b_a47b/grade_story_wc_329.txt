<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lira's motivation to reawaken beauty is clear and consistent, but her interior remains abstract through most beats—"resonantly soft," "trembled like moth wings"—label-heavy phrasing rather than embodied contradiction. The moment she notices the statue's crack and presses the shell shows micro-choice under pressure, but the final act (blowing into the shell, watching statues crumble) reads more as wish-fulfillment than earned agency with visible cost that forecloses a path. The violin-string snap gestures toward sacrifice but doesn't alter her next move or constrain the closure beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with a Resonant Reconfiguration attempt at closure. Orientation anchors (enchanted orchard, sky-bridge, Lira) land within the first 120 words. The escalation sequence—crack noticed, music played, peaches fall, geyser erupts, statues crumble—reads more as causal dominoes than accumulative deepening; the orchard's transformation feels externally triggered rather than earned by Lira's sustained pressure. Closure unit: "breaking free wasn't about destruction… about trusting the chaos" is thesis-stated rather than image-delivered, and the "orchard listened… it answered" ends on assertion without legible cost on the page (the snapped string was already replaced by the shell, no tactical shift followed).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The enchanted orchard with glowing peaches, humming grass, and the sky-bridge provides vivid sensory anchors filtered through a lyric lens. The locust shell's iridescent wings and hollow chambers constrain Lira's method (she uses it to vibrate against the crack, then blows into it), charging the final sequences. Minor spatial drift: the eastern wall is mentioned once without later payoff, and the geyser's eruption from "the orchard's heart" lacks prior grounding. The setting actively shapes the climax through the statues' cores and the trapped starlight, meeting the 9+ gate partially but not indispensably—remove the orchard's magic and the plot still runs on Lira's music.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: reawaken the orchard's wild magic. The crack in the statue's knee tightens options once, and Lira's sustained playing escalates pressure until the string snaps—but the geyser and statue collapse feel externally granted rather than forced by her tactical choices. The snapped string is a visible cost, yet she switches to the shell without narrative friction or a new tradeoff, so the price doesn't narrow later options. Coincidence (the geyser erupting, statues crumbling on cue) resolves rather than complicates. Under the Accumulative lens, one deepening is sufficient at this length, but the escalation reads linear (more music → bigger effects) without a reversal or choice that reweights stakes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The theme—order vs. chaos, mechanized beauty vs. wild magic—emerges through concrete images (metallic peaches, grass obeying schedules, liquid starlight). The locust shell's hollow chambers and the statue's empty heart-sockets provide purposeful motifs that shift meaning across beats. However, the penultimate paragraph states the theme outright: "breaking free wasn't about destruction… trusting the chaos to hold its own kind of order"—thematic echo that replaces image pressure. The final line ("The orchard listened. This time, it answered.") offers resonance, but the "understanding" Lira reaches is delivered as epiphany rather than earned through a specific failed attempt or renunciation. The tarnished-wonder tone charges many images (peaches like tears, sap that smelled of honey and memory) but the ending tips into thesis rather than implication.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Single POV, stable third-limited focalization, no head-hopping. Diction remains lyric and consistent: "moth wings," "fallen star," "liquid starlight." Register slips once into therapy-speak ("the gap between knowing and understanding" repeated as thesis in the closure paragraph rather than earned through perception). Perceptual signature is present (Lira notices cracks, vibrations, the shell's pulse) but the voice doesn't modulate under peak stress—the final paragraph's syntax stays decorative ("a lullaby for the world she'd helped remake") rather than compressed. Free indirect style is clean; no dialogue present so those bullets are N/A. Elision is minimal and doesn't obscure causality. Minor: "resonantly soft" recurs as a motif-label without evolving into action-specific description under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and figurative language is dense but controlled in most beats. Overwriting shows in the final third: "bleeding gold through the trees," "sound like wind chimes," "swirled into the air, settling on the statues like a curse," "bent double, their branches weeping sap that smelled of honey and memory"—stacked metaphors in rapid succession without clear propulsion. Paraphrase loop: "The orchard shuddered. The trees bent double…" restates transformation across adjacent lines. Template cadence in the climax: "She played…, until her fingers bled, until the locust shell's wings shivered… And then, something shifted." Sequential "until" stems and vague payoff ("something shifted"). No major grammar errors; pronoun references clear. Information density is moderate—many lines do atmospheric work but few advance multiple story jobs simultaneously. The prose is competent and legible but decorative phrasing dulls momentum in the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The enchanted-orchard-under-tyranny premise and musician-liberator arc follow familiar templates. The locust shell as a vibration tool offers a fresh inflection, but the statues-with-crystalline-cores and trapped-magic-geyser read as stock fantasy furniture. Emotional specificity is present in Lira's trembling hands and bleeding fingers, yet the final realization ("trusting the chaos") arrives as abstract thesis rather than a non-obvious synthesis grown from prior particulars. The piece commits to its lyric voice and doesn't retreat, but the core emotional and plot beats (lone artist vs. oppressive order, final triumphant transformation) are well-worn. No close echoes of famous lines, and the tarnished-wonder tone maintains coherence. Mid-band: functional premise executed with care but not transformed into something irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lira appears in paragraph one, frames the dominant stake by paragraph three, and her choices drive all major beats: noticing the crack, pressing the shell, playing until the string snaps, blowing into the shell. She is causally active across setup, middle, and closure. Her final choice to "pick up her violin" and play again participates in the ending image. Slight swappability: another musician with a different tool could run similar beats with minor adjustments, so irreplaceability is moderate. Cost is visible (bleeding fingers, snapped string) but doesn't foreclose a path—she switches instruments without narrative friction. Two gates clearly met (setup, payoff); middle development is present but not pressure-decisive. Integration is strong but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The locust shell is introduced in paragraph two (early setup), used in two distinct beats (pressed to the statue's crack to vibrate, blown into like a flute at climax), and its iridescent dust settles on the statues in the final sequence, directly shaping closure. Its hollow chambers teach the heart-rhythm language that Lira employs. Cost linkage: the shell's wings "shiver with the effort" and it is dropped after use, embodying expenditure. Specificity: the shell's unique vibration properties matter; a generic object could not replace it without rewriting mechanics. Three gates met (setup, middle use, closure involvement). Causal pressure and irreplaceability are high; this pushes into the 7+ band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Breaking free" is named in the thesis paragraph ("breaking free wasn't about destruction…") but does not shape on-page tactics or narrow Lira's options before that moment. The orchard's transformation from order to chaos enacts the concept, yet the concept itself functions as theme rather than a constraint that forces trade-offs. Lira's goal is to "reawaken beauty," which overlaps with but is not identical to "breaking free." The statues break, the orchard is freed, but the mechanics of that freedom (music, shell, geyser) are more about magic than the concept's inherent friction. Setup and payoff are present as thematic echoes; middle development (a choice driven by the concept's tension) is absent. Functional but not causal.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Resonantly soft" is used twice as a descriptor of Lira's music (paragraphs one and final) but does not constrain or enable any on-page action with visible cost. It describes tone rather than forcing a tactical trade-off (e.g., soft music can't be heard vs. loud music alerts enemies). The attribute is label-only; swapping "resonantly soft" for "hauntingly quiet" or "gently insistent" would not alter any beat. Setup and closure mention are present, but no middle development where the trait narrows options. Ornamental use trends low; no causal pressure or cost tied to this exact phrasing.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Uproot" is named once in paragraph three as the statues' historical action ("the statues had uprooted that chaos") but does not drive any major turn on the page. Lira does not uproot anything herself; the statues' cores are overwhelmed and they crumble, but the verb "uproot" is not the enacted method. The concept of removing/reversing imposed order informs the stakes, yet the literal action "uproot" is absent from key beats. Setup as backstory only; no middle beat or closure beat enacts uprooting as a decisive move. Thematic presence without causal work; swappable with "suppressed" or "erased." Functional as theme, but not as action.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Signaling through heart rhythms" is introduced in paragraph two (the shell's hollow chambers taught her this language) and used in paragraph five when Lira plays "in a rhythm that matched the shell's pulse." The method is signaled early and its mechanics (vibration merging with her heartbeat) matter at the climax when she presses the shell to the statue's core. However, the method's specific advantage over ordinary music is not tested—Lira's violin alone was already working before she added the shell's pulse. Setup and middle use are clear; closure involvement is moderate (the shell is blown into, but the heart-rhythm aspect fades in favor of generic vibration). Two gates met; causal pressure is present but not decisive. Mid-6 band: purposeful but not irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The enchanted orchard with living statue guardians is established in paragraph one, frames all action, and its features (peaches, grass, sky-bridge, statues' cores, trapped geyser) supply resources and constraints throughout. The statues' patrol and the sky-bridge's location enable Lira's position; the orchard's trapped magic provides the geyser that overwhelms the cores. The setting is indispensable: remove the statues and cores, and the plot collapses. Three gates met (setup, middle pressure from statues, closure participation via geyser and transformation). Spatial choreography is mostly clear (sky-bridge, eastern wall, orchard's heart). Specificity and irreplaceability are high; the setting is not a postcard but a causal actor.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"The gap between knowing and understanding" appears twice as abstract framing (paragraph three and the thesis paragraph) but does not function as a timeframe that tightens decisions. No clock or deadline pressures Lira; the passage of "one evening" is vague and untracks. The phrase is thematic rather than temporal. No setup as a live time constraint, no middle beat where a ticking clock alters tactics, and no closure where time runs out or is reweighted. The element is present only as a conceptual metaphor, not as a functional timeframe. Ornamental use; swappable with any liminal-state phrasing. Cap at 2.8 per the guidelines; actual score reflects zero causal work.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Lira's motivation "to reawaken the beauty that had been mechanized" is stated in paragraph three and drives her goal across all beats: she plays to soften the statues' grip, to make the orchard remember its soul. The desire is dramatized through her sustained effort (bleeding fingers, snapped string) and conflicted slightly by the risk (statues might stop her, string breaks). Cost is visible (physical pain, tool failure) but the friction between want and obstacle is moderate—no moment where Lira must choose between reawakening beauty and another urgent need. Setup early, middle beats enact the motivation, closure image (orchard answering) fulfills it. Three gates met; causal pressure is present. Slightly swappable with "restore magic" or "break the statues' control" without deep rewrite. Solid integration, not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Tarnished wonder" is not named but expressed through diction: "peaches glowed like captured sunsets" paired with "tasted of metal," "liquid starlight" trapped beneath roots, "statue faces crumbled, revealing… empty sockets." The tone is coherent and modulates with pressure—lyric and strange at the start, intensifying through the climax, then returning to softer lyricism at the end. The final image ("a lullaby for the world she'd helped remake") charges prior material with that tarnished-wonder blend. Tone is consistent, not static, and supports the closure without melodrama. Setup, middle, and closure all reflect the tone. Specificity is high; irreplaceability moderate (another bittersweet-lyric tone could fit). Solid integration into the 6–7 band.</comment>
