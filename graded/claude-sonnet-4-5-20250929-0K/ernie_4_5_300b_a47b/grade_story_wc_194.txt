<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lirael's motivation to uncover truth is clear and her interiority shows embodied tension ("tremor in her chest," crying at discovery). However, the character remains at arm's length—her specific personality beyond "last heir seeking secrets" never crystallizes through distinct micro-choices or contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The father's ghost and ancestors blur into generic regret without individuated friction. The final choice to "build something new" feels declared rather than earned through on-page struggle that forecloses a live path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly in the opening. The piece follows a causal sequence: crank → visions → compartment → letters → resolve. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration (moving from "tomb" to "cradle"), but the cost remains abstract—no visible sacrifice or foreclosed option appears on the page. The letters deliver exposition that tells rather than dramatizes the dynasty's choice, weakening the felt price at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The sepia reading room is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail ("dust-mottled shelves," "golden shadows"). The gramophone and desk's false compartment constrain Lirael's search and enable the discovery beat. Spatial choreography (corner ghost, desk groove, horn emission) tracks clearly. The recurring golden-shadow motif charges the final image when the room shifts from "tomb" to "cradle," meeting the 9+ gate test for Q3.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—uncovering the hidden truth—is signaled early and pursued coherently. The gramophone sequence tightens pressure through escalating vibration and visions. However, the final revelation (letters explaining the dynasty's choice) arrives without Lirael making a decision under competing costs; she passively receives information and then declares intent. No live option is foreclosed, and the standing-wave method resolves the mystery without tactical trade-offs shaped by her agency.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Theme of legacy-as-sacrifice emerges through the letters and the tomb-to-cradle transformation. "Sound is memory made flesh" and the dynasty-ender frame cohere with the closure concept. Yet the final paragraph edges into direct statement ("not a tragedy but a rebirth") rather than letting the image alone reweight prior material. The gramophone crank recurs purposefully, but its thematic weight is partially undercut by the expository letter dump that tells the dynasty's choice instead of dramatizing cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Single-POV distance is stable; diction is elevated and consistent ("eloquently silent authority," "liquid gold"). The opening "first yawn of evening" and closing reprise create purposeful framing. However, peak-beat phrasing occasionally slips into stock lyricism ("bridge of intuition between the past and whatever lay beyond the veil") and therapy-adjacent insight ("self-awareness"). Perceptual signature remains generic; Lirael's way of noticing doesn't carry character-specific bias beyond "heir seeking truth."</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is generally strong. However, multiple passages rely on template stems and abstract intensifiers: "as if the machine itself resisted," "a force that could bend time, if wielded correctly," "bridge of intuition," "veil of her ignorance." The final paragraph stacks scaffold phrases ("not a tragedy but a rebirth," "from the ashes of their secrets") and paraphrases the tomb/cradle image already shown. Figurative language clusters without always advancing the beat—"liquid gold" shadows and "seam" phrasing dilute propulsion at key moments.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The gramophone-as-time-access device and standing-wave method offer a steampunk-adjacent freshness, and the dynasty's self-erasure premise has potential. Yet the execution leans on familiar "heir uncovers ancestor secret via magical object" scaffolding without transforming it through irreplaceable lived detail or a non-obvious moral calculus. The emotional arc (discovery → tears → resolve) follows a median template, and the letters function as convenient exposition rather than a choice-driven reveal.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Lirael is named "last heir of a dynasty" and her goal structures the narrative. She operates the gramophone and opens the desk, but these are reactive moves prompted by her father's instructions rather than decisions under competing costs. The "dynasty ender" label applies thematically at closure when she resolves to "build something new," yet that shift is declared rather than dramatized through a choice that forecloses a path. Present in setup, middle action, and ending claim, but causal pressure and irreplaceability are moderate.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The crank handle appears in the opening (tracing its rim), is inserted and turned multiple times to trigger visions, and is pressed into the desk groove to unlock the compartment. It drives two key beats (vision sequence, compartment unlock) and is returned to the desk at closure with "its job done." The object's spiraling pattern and cold brass surface give it specificity, and its mechanics directly enable the truth discovery. Strong causal role and beat involvement; nears indispensability but the story could substitute another keyed mechanism with moderate edits.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Bridge of intuition" is named explicitly ("a bridge of intuition between the past and whatever lay beyond") and the gramophone visions function as intuitive leaps. However, the concept remains metaphorical rather than shaping on-page tactics or choices. Lirael does not wrestle with competing interpretations or pay a price for relying on intuition over evidence. Present as a thematic label and method frame, but does not constrain or enable a turn with felt cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Eloquently silent" describes the ancestors' authority in the opening and reappears when Lirael realizes "her family's silence had been eloquent, a final act of love." The trait frames the discovery but does not constrain an on-page action or force a trade-off. It functions as a thematic echo rather than a lived attribute that alters Lirael's choices under pressure. Swappable with "strategic silence" or "deliberate quiet" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Muse" appears once: "Lirael's muse had always been the quiet between notes, the space where meaning pooled like ink." It motivates her to use the standing-wave method but does not drive a key turn or return with reweighted meaning. The vision sequence and letter discovery would function identically if she were motivated by curiosity or duty instead. Present as character color, but replaceable and not causally essential.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Standing waves are signaled in the father's journal margin ("Turn the crank, and the room will sing its truth") and enacted through the gramophone's resonant hum. The method produces the vision beat and unlocks the desk compartment, shaping two key moves. However, the mechanics remain vague ("frequency that vibrated in her bones," "standing waves...could bend time"), and the story does not show Lirael adjusting her approach based on how standing waves behave. Present across setup, middle, and payoff with moderate causal weight.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The sepia reading room frames the entire narrative, supplies the desk with its hidden compartment, and transforms from "tomb" to "cradle" at closure. The books and shelves anchor the family legacy, and the room's golden shadows recur to charge the final image. The setting enables the discovery and its atmosphere modulates with the gramophone's hum. Strong setup and closure presence; the room itself does not pressure a choice, but its resources (desk, compartment) alter outcome.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"First yawn of evening" opens and closes the piece, and "golden shadows" track the light shift. However, the timeframe imposes no urgency or constraint—Lirael could conduct the same search at dawn or midnight without altering stakes. The evening mood colors tone but does not tighten decisions. Present as framing device and lyric reprise, but functionally ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The desire to uncover her father's secret drives every beat from the opening ("gnawed at her since childhood") through the gramophone operation to the letter discovery. The motivation is embodied in her physical actions (tracing the crank, inserting it, opening the desk) and produces visible emotional reaction (crying). It shapes two major turns (vision access, compartment unlock) and persists to closure when she vows to honor the truth. Friction between the desire and its cost is moderate—she receives the truth without sacrifice—but the motivation is well-dramatized across the arc.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Golden shadows appear in the opening ("bathing the leather armchairs...in golden shadows"), intensify during the gramophone sequence ("deepened, stretching...like liquid gold"), and soften at closure ("golden shadows softened" then she steps "into the golden shadows"). Tone modulates purposefully with pressure and charges the final image when the room shifts from tomb to cradle. However, the tone remains consistently elegiac without sharp contrast, and "golden" as descriptor trends toward decorative lyricism in some beats. Solid lyric reprise with moderate charge.</comment>
