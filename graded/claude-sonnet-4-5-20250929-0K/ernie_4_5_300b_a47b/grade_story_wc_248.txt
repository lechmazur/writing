<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation (grandmother's promise) is stated rather than tested under pressure. Her actions trace a predetermined path without internal contradiction or visible cost that forecloses options. The "analytically intuitive" label appears once without constraining a choice. Emotion is described ("tears streaming") rather than embodied through contradictory impulses or micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed: who Mara is and why she's at this archive remain unclear past 120 words, costing −0.4. The closure—grandmother's face appearing and Mara accepting her role as "gardener"—reads as conceptual repricing, but the cost is asserted rather than legible (what path has she foreclosed?). The lens wavers between causal (finding clues) and accumulative (adding art), never fully cohering. Applying Orientation Test penalty and lens drift: cap all categories at 8.3, Q3 at 7.0, Q6 at 7.8.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The archive's chambers are named (astronomical maps, forgotten languages, self-portraits) but function as backdrop rather than constraint. The obsidian ink vial and tapestry fragment appear but do not limit tactics or charge the ending image beyond thematic echo. Spatial choreography is clear within rooms. The micro-setting (ink, canvas) could constrain but does not—Mara's brushwork succeeds without friction.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—uncovering the archive's hidden message—is signaled early but never tightens. Mara moves room to room without opposition or cost; each act of "vandalism-turned-art" succeeds on the first attempt. The acid burn healing when Mara paints a tear is coincidental resolution, not earned by her prior choices. No reversal or deepening narrows options; the ending reveals information (grandmother's face) rather than forcing a trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The garden-versus-tomb metaphor and "vandalism as rescue" frame are stated early but resolved through explanation rather than image. The final paragraph moralizes: "the archive was not a place to be preserved but *revisited*." The tear that heals the portrait gestures toward emotional resonance but the thematic question (how to tend living knowledge) is answered in assertion, not through specific choice with visible cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with clean access to Mara's perception. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("volcanic tenderness," "tactile memory of paper and ink") that feels authorial rather than character-particular. The grandmother's quoted speech ("It's not a tomb... It's a *garden*") carries subtext, but most of Mara's interior is reflective summary. Perceptual signature is present (noting brushstrokes, gold spiral) but does not degrade under stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Multiple loops and scaffold phrases: "not destruction but translation," "not a tomb... a *garden*," "not a thief or an arsonist, but a gardener." Stock metaphor "holding its breath" and therapy-speak "volcanic tenderness" appear without payoff. Paraphrase loop in paragraph 2: "not vandalism but rescue" rephrases the opening's "not destruction but translation." Template cadence in paragraph 5: "In the chamber... In the hall..." Applying patterned-artifact penalty: −0.8 in Q7, disallow 9+ globally, cap high-band entries at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The premise (arsonist-turned-artist restoring a mystical archive through symbolic vandalism) is high-concept but executed through familiar beats: cryptic clues, magical transformation, dead mentor's wisdom revealed. The acid burn healing when Mara paints a tear is convenient mysticism rather than transformation grounded in prior causality. "Volcanic tenderness" and "translation through fire" are asserted moods rather than fresh synthesis. The grandmother-as-Elara reveal lacks groundwork.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Mara is present throughout but her arsonist identity is mentioned only in the opening and never enacted on the page (the portrait was defaced with acid, not her fire). Her choices (painting symbols, adding a tear) do not create key turns; each action succeeds without opposition. Present in closure (leaves as "gardener") but the decision is declared rather than tested.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The tapestry fragment is introduced early (paragraph 2) and mentioned again as the source of symbols Mara paints (paragraph 4), but it does not return with reweighted meaning or constrain her tactics. Its "symbols from a civilization that vanished before the first pyramid" are described but not integral to the closure. Two touches across beats, but both are passive (she carried it, she copies from it).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The vandalized self-portrait is present in the opening, middle (Elara's intact portrait in the chamber), and ending (the acid burn heals). It shapes the method (Mara adds to rather than restores) and the closure (grandmother's face revealed). However, the concept is echoed thematically (vandalism as rescue) more than it constrains tactics. Removing this exact portrait and substituting another damaged artifact would not fundamentally break the plot.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Analytically intuitive" is mentioned once (paragraph 4: "Analytically intuitive, Mara noted the brushstrokes") but functions as a label rather than a trait that constrains or enables action with cost. She notices the gold spiral signature, but any character could perform that observation. No visible tradeoff between analysis and intuition on the page.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Portray" appears throughout (opening: "fires were not destruction but translation—a method to portray truths"; Mara paints symbols, sketches, adds a tear) and shapes multiple beats. However, the action is passive description rather than driver of turns. Swapping "portray" for "reveal" or "restore" would require only minor edits. Present in closure (she portrays the tear that heals) but not indispensable to the logic.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The trail of artistic creations is signaled early (paragraph 5: "a trail of artistic creations leading to a hidden message") and enacted in the middle (constellations, scrawled phrases). The method shapes her movement room to room and is present at closure (the tear completes the trail). However, the "hidden message" is revealed as feeling rather than puzzle solution, weakening the mechanic's payoff. Two gates (setup, development) with partial closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The lost civilization archive is introduced early, provides spatial structure (chambers of maps, languages, portraits), and is present at closure (she leaves "the archive"). The setting pressures Mara by containing the grandmother's hidden presence and requiring her to move through layers. However, the archive does not constrain her tactics (no locked doors, guardians, or resource limits) or supply obstacles. The environment hums and shivers but does not act.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"After going off the grid three years ago" is mentioned in paragraph 2 but the timeframe does not tighten present decisions. "On the third day" (paragraph 7) marks duration but no urgency or deadline pressures her choices. The past (three years) and present (three days) are static context rather than live clock. Present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The forgotten promise to her grandmother is stated in paragraph 2, recalled in paragraph 6 ("her grandmother's hands... her voice"), and fulfilled at closure ("You kept your promise"). The motivation is told rather than dramatized through friction between wants and costs. Mara never doubts the promise or sacrifices competing desires; she simply executes. Setup and closure gates met, but middle development lacks conflicted choice.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Volcanic tenderness" is declared in paragraph 6 ("The tone of her work was volcanic tenderness—fierce, yes, but born of love") but functions as assertion rather than modulation under pressure. The prose maintains consistent lyricism (metaphors, elevations) without tonal shift when Mara finds the grandmother's face. A single static mood from label rather than rhythm and imagery that charge the final image.</comment>
