<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Aurelia's interiority is concrete and character-particular ("catalogued miracles like unpaid invoices"), and her methodical hopefulness drives the central action. The nurse, cyclist, and balcony man are sketched vividly through embodied memory-flashes that feel earned. However, Aurelia herself makes no choice under pressure—she executes a plan without friction or cost to her own stance, so the arc reads more observational than transformative for the protagonist.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through parallel memory-flashes (nurse, cyclist, man) that demonstrate the theory Aurelia sought to prove. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Conceptual Repricing variant): "her theory was already partly proven" reweights the premise with undeniable confirmation. Orientation anchors early (rooftop greenhouse, smog-choked city, waxing moon). The cost is conceptual and social—strangers' worlds shift—but Aurelia pays no visible price herself, which slightly softens the closure's charge.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The rooftop greenhouse is sensorially vivid and POV-filtered ("plants breathe," "loamy and slow"), and the smog-choked city below provides contrast that charges the saffron quiet. The calligrapher's brush—its moon-tipped bristles and "breath on glass" glow—functions as micro-setting, constraining Aurelia's method and charging the final image. Spatial choreography (above/below, glass panes as interface) remains clear throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—proving strangers remember kindness—is signaled early and pursued through a single deliberate action. The piece delivers one meaningful deepening: the three parallel daydreams accumulate evidence and reweight the premise. However, Aurelia faces no opposition, reversal, or trade-off; the theory simply succeeds as designed. The escalation is textural (density of recalled kindness) rather than causal friction, which fits the lens but limits high-band reach.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: the lost-language brush as metaphor for inarticulate kindness, three strangers' memories as proof that warmth outlasts forgetting. The final line—"her theory was already partly proven"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The "lost languages" conceit avoids heavy-handedness; it's woven into Aurelia's practice and the brush's properties. Minor slip: "the world is larger than what hurt you" flirts with platitude, though the surrounding texture rescues it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: Aurelia notices "drip lines and cracks" as alphabets, plants "breathing," the moon's glow "smeared softly." Diction remains character-particular ("catalogued miracles like unpaid invoices," "forehead pressed to cool metal"). The three stranger-vignettes shift focalization briefly but cleanly, anchored by Aurelia's observational frame. No dialogue is present. Minor overwriting appears in stacked modifiers ("thin seams of pearl," "saffron quiet"), but voice control under pressure holds.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully, and the prose carries high information density (brush backstory, lost-language practice, three stranger-flashes). However, several lines loop near-synonyms: "forgot itself" echoes "misplaced"; "angles the lamps away, letting only the moon's diluted shine" restates what "angled away" already implied. The figurative load is heavy throughout ("clogged lung," "breath on glass," "vines teaching themselves to climb"), occasionally blurring momentum. The closure image is clean. Apply −0.6 for loops and density in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of calligraphy, lost languages, and moonlight-sparked daydreams feels specific and non-obvious. The piece transforms a familiar "art heals strangers" premise through the brush's translator conceit and the accumulative proof structure. The three parallel memory-flashes avoid formula by varying content and emotional texture. Risk-taking is moderate: the no-conflict design and Aurelia's untroubled success lean toward safety. The "saffron quiet" and "loamy slow" details anchor freshness.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Aurelia frames the theory, trades for the brush (backstory beat), paints the lost-language sentences (middle action), and observes the result (closure participation). Her insomnia and methodical hope motivate the attempt. However, she makes no mid-scene decision that narrows options; the plan executes without friction. Setup ✓, Development (weak—action but no choice-under-pressure) ~, Payoff ✓. Two gates plus causal role in two beats allow mid-6s; lack of on-page cost caps higher reach.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The brush is introduced early (potting bench, wrapped in linen), handled in the painting beat (dipped, strokes glow, "translator of lost languages"), and its properties (moon-tipped, remembers every hand) enable the entire method. It appears in three beats: acquisition backstory, unwrapping/use, and implicit presence in the closure ("each word settle"). The brush's unique mechanics (absorbs moonlight, writes invisible scripts) are irreplaceable. Setup ✓, Development ✓, Payoff ✓. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage; specificity high.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Lost languages shape Aurelia's sketchbook practice (backstory), provide the syntax she paints on glass ("long loops and sudden hooks"), and frame the thematic premise: inarticulate kindness survives forgetting. The concept is named early, drives the method (she writes in a lost script), and the ending validates that "the kindness inside it might still be understood." Setup ✓, Development ✓, Payoff ✓. The concept constrains her tactic (invisible words rather than direct images) and charges the closure. Two beats plus thematic weight.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Methodically hopeful" is named early ("the sort of woman who catalogued miracles like unpaid invoices") and embodied in her deliberate plan and lack of urgency under the "saffron quiet." It motivates the rooftop experiment. However, the trait is label-adjacent and does not force a visible trade-off or cost on the page; Aurelia's hope is validated without friction. Setup ✓, Development (motivation but no constraint) ~, Payoff (implicit in success) ~. Two weak gates; no on-page cost tied to the attribute.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Rouse" is the engine: Aurelia paints to "rouse the sleeping kindness in strangers," the nurse straightens and smiles, the cyclist's anger drains, the man on the balcony pauses mid-sentence. The action is signaled early, executed in the middle, and validated at closure ("her theory was already partly proven"). Setup ✓, Development ✓, Payoff ✓. The verb is irreplaceable—"awaken," "trigger," "summon" would alter tone and metaphor. Strong causal role across three beats; closure depends on it.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Daydreams sparked by moonlight are explained early (plan to "let the glow seep downward"), demonstrated in three beats (nurse's hot-bread memory, cyclist's stranger-lifting-bike memory, man's landlord-envelope memory), and the moonlight mechanics are signaled ("rainwater mottled with moonlight," "strands of light coiling up into the bristles"). Setup ✓, Development ✓, Payoff ✓. The method is specific and constrains the tactic (must be night, moon-phase matters, rainwater required). Two beats plus closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The rooftop greenhouse is anchored early with sensory detail (plants, glass panes, condensation, soil) and provides the above/below spatial structure that lets Aurelia paint downward toward the street. The smog-choked city below contrasts the "saffron quiet" up top. The greenhouse's glass panes are the literal substrate for the invisible writing. Setup ✓, Development (spatial enabler) ✓, Payoff (implicit—words on glass shape the closure) ✓. The greenhouse is irreplaceable as the interface; another rooftop would lose the plant/breath/soil texture that charges the atmosphere.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The waxing moon is named in the opening paragraph, its glow described ("smeared softly, filtered through particulate haze"), and the moon-tipped brush draws power from it ("rainwater mottled with moonlight"). The timeframe is stable (one night) and the moon's phase matters (waxing, not full or waning). Setup ✓, Development (atmospheric and method-linked) ✓, Payoff (moon mentioned in closure paragraph via "steady gaze") ✓. However, no ticking clock tightens decisions; the night simply unfolds. Three gates but low time-pressure; lyric reprise in closure image lifts score.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Aurelia's motivation—to prove strangers remember kindness—is stated early ("Tonight she had come here not to paint for galleries, but to prove a theory") and dramatized through the painting action and three stranger-vignettes. The ending confirms partial proof. Setup ✓, Development ✓, Payoff ✓. The desire drives two beats (painting, observation) and the closure validates it. However, no friction tests the motivation; she never doubts, hesitates, or pays a visible cost. Strong causal role but low internal conflict caps higher reach.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Saffron quiet" is named early ("steeped in a saffron quiet that made every sound distant"), recurs in the closure paragraph ("Up in the saffron quiet"), and modulates with the accumulative proof: the initial hush holds through the stranger-flashes, which are emotionally warm but texturally consistent (no anger-spikes break the tone). Setup ✓, Development (stable but purposeful) ✓, Payoff ✓. The tone charges the final image by sustaining the atmosphere through validation. Coherence high; modulation slight but intentional (quiet persists as kindness spreads).</comment>
