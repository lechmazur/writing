<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Iri's interior contradictions are present—"calmly inventive" yet carrying revolutionary intent—and her micro-choices (examining the sundial, activating the rods) reveal hierarchy of values under pressure. Interiority is specific ("storing murmurs as carefully as she logged keys") and embodied through her appraising gaze and deliberate movements. However, Trann remains functional rather than dimensional, and the final beat where "locks forgot which side was inside" is more conceptual than a felt choice with visible cost on the page. The motivation is clear but the earned change or renunciation lacks the concrete forfeiture that would push this higher.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes orientation (Iri, tower, blackout) and follows a Situational/Accumulative lens: pressure accumulates through the blackout, Trann's arrival, the sundial message, and culminates in Iri's activation of the hidden circuits. The closure is a Conceptual Repricing—the locks "forgot which side was inside"—reweighting the fort's binary logic, with the conceptual cost legible (surveillance collapses, revolution begins). One meaningful tightening occurs when the sundial reveals the map she had drawn years ago, narrowing her options to act tonight. The cost is conceptual and the final image reconfigures the premise, satisfying the lens, though the physical consequences remain off-page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The luminous fort, bottled daylight, bronze quill holder, and copper rods create a vivid micro-setting where objects constrain and enable Iri's choices. The sundial's etched rays and hidden sockets beneath the desk are tactile, specific, and drive the final action. Spatial choreography is clean (tower, desk, window, gatework below) and sensory detail is purposeful without catalog excess. The fort's shifting light—from shimmering to "smoky bruise"—mirrors the narrative arc and charges the final image when darkness owns the room and gears clear their throats.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>One dominant stake is signaled early: Iri's silent revolution through rewired locks during the blackout. The arrival of Trann and the sundial message tighten pressure by offering both invitation and risk, and Iri's final act—slotting the copper rods—forecloses the status quo with on-page mechanical consequence. The cost is immediate (alarms don't ring, but locks lose directionality) and tactical, though the broader fallout remains off-page. One meaningful pressure point drives the escalation; coincidence (the blackout) complicates but does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: locks, keys, light, and the fort as cradle of sparks embody control versus liberation. The final image—"locks forgot which side was inside"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of who holds the threshold. Subtext operates in Trann's hesitation, the sundial's coded angles, and Iri's calm against systemic pressure. The piece resists tidy morals, embracing the ambiguity of a revolution sparked in darkness. No overt thematic statements; the revolution is felt through image and action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited focalization is stable and controlled, filtering all detail through Iri's professional and revolutionary priorities. Diction is distinct—"winking hush," "bottled daylight," "locks that no longer pointed inward"—creating a purposeful texture that modulates under pressure without obscuring clarity. Dialogue is sparse, natural, and goal-driven; Trann's "Nobody" carries subtext and advances plot. Perceptual signature is consistent: Iri notices gears, shadows, and codes where others see routine. Psychic distance tightens appropriately during the sundial examination and final activation without head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies naturally, and information density is high: most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "She wore the slate uniform of the wardens, but her gaze wandered like a calmly inventive mechanic appraising a broken engine" establishes role, trait, and stance). No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs detected. Minor overwriting appears in figurative density during setup ("bottled daylight," "winking hush," "smoky bruise") but remains voice-consistent and legible. The final beat's clarity is untouched. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes effectively.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of fort-as-light-source, lock sentinel, and coded sundial offers a specific, non-obvious angle on institutional control and quiet rebellion. The transformation of the bronze quill holder into revolutionary tool and the locks forgetting directionality feel earned in hindsight. However, the "silent revolution" and "rewriting stories" frame echo familiar templates; the piece elevates through tactile detail (copper rods, etched rays, seized gears) and the final conceptual payoff. Risk-taking in the quiet, machinery-focused climax heightens stakes without gimmickry, warranting a modest +0.2 adjustment within band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Iri's role as lock sentinel shapes all three acts: she observes the blackout (setup), interprets the sundial message (middle choice), and activates the hidden circuits (closure). Her decisions—examining the sundial, asking for a written order, slotting the rods—create key turns. The trait "vigilant" is embodied in her listening and appraising, "sentinel" in her threshold position. Present in closure with causal agency. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage +1.5, cost connection +0.4, specificity +0.5 = base ~5.6 + adjustments = 6.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The bronze quill holder appears in three beats: initial description as bureaucratic prop (setup), the copper rods leaning in its sockets (middle texture), and the final act where Iri removes the rods to activate hidden circuits (closure). The transformation from official object to revolutionary tool is charged and specific. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.3, closure linkage +1.6, specificity +0.7 = base ~5.6 + adjustments = 7.4 (rounded down).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"The cradle of sparks" frames the fort's role as light source and shapes the stakes: if light falters, the story can be rewritten. It appears in setup (explaining the fort's function) and is present thematically at closure when Iri's act destabilizes the fort's control. However, it does not directly constrain middle tactics or alter a choice on the page. Early signal +0.5, thematic presence in two beats +0.9, weak causal pressure +0.6, closure linkage +0.8 = base ~3.0 + ~2.8 adjustments = 5.8, round to 5.9.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Calmly inventive" is demonstrated through Iri's appraisal of the fort as broken engine, her conversion of the quill holder, and her measured response to Trann. The trait enables her mechanical solution and constrains her to patient planning rather than overt action. Present in setup and closure, visible in choices. Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +1.2, cost connection +0.3 = base ~3.0 + ~4.0 = 7.0, but swappability (could be "clever resourceful") −0.6 and label-only in one mention −0.3 = 6.1, round to 6.2.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Intrigue" arrives with Trann and the sundial, driving the middle turn and Iri's decision to act. The blackout enables, but Trann's arrival and the coded message redefine her options from waiting to immediate action. Present in setup (anticipated), development (Trann's arrival), and closure (the act it triggers). Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.4, closure linkage +1.4, specificity +0.5 = base ~3.0 + ~4.7 = 7.7, but late arrival (second third) −0.3 and some swappability −0.5 = 6.9, round to 6.7.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The sundial and its coded angles are signaled early (Trann carries it), examined in detail mid-story (the etched rays spell the map), and directly enable the final action (the message gives Iri the map to act). The mechanics are specific and irreplaceable. Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.5, closure linkage +1.7, specificity +0.8 = base ~3.0 + ~6.1 = 9.1, but introduced in second third −0.2 = 8.9, round down to 7.1 under conservative cap for late-middle entry.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The luminous fort at twilight provides spatial constraints (tower, desk, gatework below) and atmospheric charge (shimmering to smoky bruise). The setting's dimming mirrors Iri's opportunity and the final darkness ("let the blackout own the room") intensifies the closure image. The bottled daylight and hidden sockets are micro-setting elements that enable her tactics. Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.3, closure linkage +1.6, specificity +0.6 = base ~3.0 + ~5.6 = 8.6, minor postcard description in opening −0.3 and some generic fort elements −0.2 = 8.1, conservative round to 7.6.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The blackout is the catalyst, signaled immediately and shaping all tactics: it creates the opportunity (no watch posted), tightens the window (administrators will respond), and charges the final act (darkness owns the room). Time pressure is implicit but present. Early signal +0.8, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.4, closure linkage +1.5, cost connection +0.4 = base ~3.0 + ~5.5 = 8.5, but somewhat passive (coincidence enables rather than constrains choice) −0.7 and clock not explicitly tracked −0.3 = 7.5, round to 7.3.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"To spark a silent revolution" is stated early and drives Iri's preparation (copper rods, listening for years) and final choice (activating the circuits). Friction exists between her calm exterior and revolutionary intent. However, the desire is more told than dramatized in conflicted micro-choices. Early signal +0.7, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.1, closure linkage +1.4, cost connection +0.5 = base ~3.0 + ~4.6 = 7.6, but label-heavy articulation ("silent revolution," "rewriting stories") −0.6 and some summary rather than scene friction −0.4 = 6.6, round to 6.4.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Winking hush" is present in the opening ("corridors inside kept a winking hush"), modulates through Trann's tense arrival and the sundial examination, and charges the final image where Iri dims the lantern and lets the fort's gears "clear their throats." Tone is coherent and supports the quiet-revolution premise. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.3, specificity +0.5 = base ~3.0 + ~3.8 = 6.8, but static mood in places (consistent calm without modulation under peak pressure) −0.3 and some label-reliance ("winking") −0.2 = 6.3, lyric reprise at closure +0.6 = 6.9.</comment>
