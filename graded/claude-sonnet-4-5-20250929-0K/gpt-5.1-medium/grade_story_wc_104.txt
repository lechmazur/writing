<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara's interior logic is consistent and her strategic patience manifests in concrete micro-choices (timing the cough, counting pendant swings, studying his key-wear patterns). Internal contradiction appears when she simultaneously embraces chains as strategy while pursuing liberation—a productive tension. The Overseer remains functional but thin; his pacing and ego are asserted more than embodied. Embodied emotion is strong in peak moments ("chain-links rasping like reluctant applause") but occasionally slips into label-speak ("impossibly large").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Mara guides the Overseer's hands away from ruin with visible cost (her voice soft, her position chained, the vault's survival dependent on sustained deception). The causal lens holds—her prior observation of his key-handling hierarchy enables the final deflection. Orientation anchors cleanly (carnival center, chained stool, Overseer pacing, distant detonations). One meaningful tightening occurs when the keys spill and she decodes his sequence, narrowing her tactical window and raising the cost of error.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The carnival setting supplies concrete constraints: the arrow on the pegboard, the piano bench lock, the bolted stool, dust and ticket stubs that ground spatial choreography. Micro-setting (arrow fletching, piano veneer) charges the final tactical moment when Mara uses the Overseer's own logic against him. Sensory detail is vivid and selective ("popcorn oil and cheap plastic," "molted scales") and filtered through Mara's strategic priorities. The space evolves causally as the Overseer drags the piano forward and the keys spill, altering her tactical options.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—protecting the seed vault—is signaled early and tightens when the Overseer begins decoding the bench, forcing Mara's real-time misdirection. Her agency is renunciation and endurance under chains combined with active deflection (the timed cough, the hand-guiding). One clear escalation: keys spill, she reads his hierarchy, and her window to impede collapses to spoken guidance. The cost is legible—sustained deception while chained, with the building's collapse as the alternative. Coincidence does not resolve; her prior study and present choices drive the turn.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme of constrained agency and strategic patience emerges through image and action: chains chosen to stay close, seeds hidden beneath prizes, the arrow-key-song triptych. The final line ("guiding his hands away from ruin with staggering grace") reweights her earlier assertion that "freedom was only useful if you could aim it" without stating a moral. Some phrasing leans abstract ("impossibly large," "resilience in dry soil") where a tighter image would serve better. The seed vault functions more as stakes-device than thematic charge; its symbolic weight is asserted rather than earned through scene pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV distance is stable and Mara's perceptual signature—strategic attention to pendulum arcs, wear patterns, spatial choreography—is distinct and consistent. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("staggering grace," "lacquered slivers of circuit board") that feels writerly rather than interior under peak stress. No head-hopping. Psychic distance modulates purposefully, tightening during the key-spill beat. The Overseer's interiority is withheld cleanly; we read him only through Mara's tactical lens. Free indirect style is clean, though some filter verbs ("she had learned," "she knew better") stack without voice motivation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines advance setting, character motive, or tactical pressure. Figurative language is frequent and occasionally overwritten ("molted scales," "constellations," "dull teeth," "reluctant applause" clustered in adjacent beats) without pattern-teaching or payoff, triggering density and coherence flags. Template cadence appears in the middle third: repeated "The [noun] [verb]" and "He [verb]" stems across multiple paragraphs. One paraphrase loop: the arrow's function as key is restated in two adjacent paragraphs without added pressure. No clarity breaks at closure, but cumulative artifact load lowers momentum in the second third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The chained-liberator paradox and the arrow-as-circuit-key offer fresh synthesis; the carnival-as-vault-cover and piano-bench-decoder transform familiar post-collapse tropes through specificity. Emotional arc (strategic patience under constraint) feels earned rather than template-driven. The seed-vault premise and "wall coming down" frame echo widely used dystopian templates; transformation occurs through the tactical micro-layer (key arrangement, pendant swing counting) rather than the macro premise. Risk-taking in the nested puzzle (arrow → piano → vault) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, warranting a modest within-band lift.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Mara (chained liberator) is present throughout, frames the opening paradox, and makes the final deflection choice that alters tactics. She decides to time the cough, study the pendant arc, and guide the Overseer's decoding—each action narrows options with cost. Her chained status constrains all moves and charges the ending image. Three gates met (setup, development, payoff); causal pressure and closure linkage are strong. Cost is visible (sustained deception, physical restraint). The element is indispensable to story logic.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The arrow appears early (setup), its circuit-fletching diagrams are recalled in Mara's interiority (development), but it does not return or act in the closure beat (payoff gate missed). It enables her prior knowledge but does not constrain the final choice on the page—the piano keys and Overseer's hand do. Two gates met; one beat involvement (recall); causal pressure is moderate (past study → present knowledge). Swappable with another encoded object without major structural change. Late first functional mention (second third) and no closure participation cap the score.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The seed vault is named early, establishes the dominant stake, and shapes all of Mara's tactical choices (why she accepted chains, why she must impede the Overseer). It does not appear physically in the closure beat but decisively shapes the final deflection—her guidance prevents its destruction. Three gates met (setup as motive, development as pressure source, payoff as unseen beneficiary of closure action). Causal pressure and irreplaceability are high; removing it collapses motive and stakes. Cost connection is strong (vault survival vs. building collapse).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Patiently strategic" is labeled early and demonstrated on the page: she counts pendant swings, times the cough to clip his wrist, and decodes his key-hierarchy in real time. The trait enables the key-spill beat and the final deflection with visible cost (sustained observation under chains, risk of exposure). Three gates met (setup, development in the cough/spill sequence, payoff in the guiding moment). One clear causal beat (the timed cough) and closure linkage (her strategic patience enables the final deflection). Moderate irreplaceability; another patience-variant could substitute with minor rewording.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Impede" is Mara's explicit task and structures the entire second half: she must slow or deflect the Overseer without revealing her knowledge. The timed cough (impediment via accident) and the final soft guidance (impediment via misdirection) are two distinct beats. Three gates met (setup as stated goal, development in the key-spill, payoff in the hand-guiding closure). Causal pressure and closure linkage are strong; removing this action collapses the turn and the ending. Cost is visible (risk of detection, sustained deception). Highly specific to her constrained position.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The piano-bench key arrangement is seeded early (Mara recalls the arrow diagrams), becomes the active problem in the second half (Overseer decoding the bench), and is the mechanism Mara must deflect in the closure. Three gates met (setup via arrow recall, development when Overseer begins decoding, payoff when she guides his hands). Two beats (keys spill, final deflection). Causal pressure is high—wrong arrangement triggers collapse. Closure linkage is strong. Moderate swappability; another hidden-mechanism puzzle could substitute with rewrites, but the piano-keys-as-circuit specificity is tight.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The carnival setting is named in the opening line, supplies all key props (arrow, piano, stool, bolted chain anchor, pegboard, prize counter hiding the vault), and constrains Mara's movement throughout. Three gates met (setup, development via spatial choreography and prop use, payoff as the Overseer works within this space at closure). Multiple beats (stool drag, piano haul, key spill). The bolted stool and prize-counter vault are irreplaceable; removing the carnival collapses spatial logic and thematic resonance (prizes → seeds). High causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The wall's imminent breach is named early and recurs as auditory pressure (distant detonations, "countdown she had no clock for"). It tightens urgency but does not directly constrain Mara's final choice—she acts to impede the Overseer regardless of external time. Two gates met (setup, development as mood/urgency layer); payoff is weak (not present or reweighted in closure image). One beat involvement (repeated auditory cues treated as continuous background). Moderate causal pressure (urgency) but no specific cost tied to the timeframe's mechanics. Swappable with another ticking-clock variant.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Mara's seed-planting motive is stated early ("to plant resilience in dry soil, to coax stubborn green from exhausted dust") and explains why she accepted chains and why the vault matters. It drives her entire tactical arc and charges the closure (guiding his hands protects future planting). Three gates met (setup, development as the why behind all choices, payoff implicit in closure success). Strong causal pressure and closure linkage. Cost is visible (her captivity, sustained risk). Slight abstraction in phrasing ("impossibly large," "resilience") where a concrete image would tighten, and the desire is told more than dramatized in conflicted action.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Tone blends lyric compression ("chain-links rasping like reluctant applause") with tactical procedural clarity (pendant counting, key-wear observation). It modulates under pressure: dense figuration in the opening, tighter syntax during the key-spill beat, and a quiet charged final line ("guiding his hands away from ruin with staggering grace"). Coherent through turns. The phrase "staggering grace" appears only in the final line, making it a capstone image rather than a sustained texture. Strong closure charge; moderate consistency across beats due to occasional register drift into elevated diction mid-pressure.</comment>
