<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Rhea's internal contradictions shine: "combative tenderness barbed with fury," refusing to let fear be final, promising that forgetting will hurt. The walking-backwards nervous tic is deployed once with visible embodiment. Jun's defiance wrapped in fear reads authentic, though their arc compresses slightly. Minor slip: "theatrical reluctance" edges toward summary rather than dramatized resistance in the tea-reading beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure. The opening establishes reversible exile as the dominant stake; the tea-leaf reading deepens it; Rhea's vow to hold the exit open and Jun's demand that forgetting hurt crystallize a Charged Poise closure with felt cost (the promise binds both). Orientation anchors quickly (forgotten library, Council decree, mirror wall). One meaningful tightening through Rhea's refusal converts Council punishment into fragile hope. Cost is visible: Rhea guarantees pain, Jun enters exile.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The library interior (dust, mirrors, shelves, porcelain cup, brass spoon) grounds the scene; the afternoon shadow caught in glass is evocative but functions more as atmosphere than constraint. Spatial choreography holds (central aisle, mirror wall, low table, stack where Jun hides). The micro-setting of the chipped cup and spoon charge the tea-leaf ritual, but the environment does not force a tactical choice—Rhea's actions would proceed identically in a plainer room. Misses the 9+ gate slightly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (Jun's exile versus erasure) is signaled early and tightens when Rhea wins the compromise. The tea-reading is the visible escalation: Jun's demand and Rhea's promise foreclose retreat with on-page cost. Agency is clear: Rhea's combative tenderness drives the negotiation, the annotation, and the binding vow. One small slip: the Council's threat remains off-page summary rather than a dramatized pressure point within this scene, so escalation feels slightly one-sided.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme—memory, fear, and the ethics of forgetting—emerges through the mirror wall, the tea leaves, and the vow to keep the exit open. The reversible-exile conceit reweights the premise: changing minds later becomes survival, not compromise. Rhea's "That, at least, I guarantee" offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Minor deduction: "someone needed to decide which banishments could be reversed" edges toward thesis statement rather than letting action alone carry the weight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "afternoon shadow caught in glass," "dust that glittered," "combat tenderness barbed with fury." Free indirect style is clean; diction matches Rhea's archival role. Dialogue carries subtext ("Fine, if we are doing this, then I want you to promise that forgetting me will hurt"). One slip: "tiny topographies of futures that might yet be negotiated" in peak tension drifts slightly above the established register, risking elevated abstraction rather than embodied perception under stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs. Rhythm modulates well ("doors groaned open like reluctant witnesses," "smiled like a drawn blade"). Three spots reduce momentum: "the way of those who had run out of places to run" paraphrases the prior "defiance like a second spine" without adding pressure; "emotional flatlining" is absent but two adjacent metaphors (ink in water, shadows amused) risk decorative stacking in one beat. No loops or scaffold, but figurative density in the opening third reaches threshold without teaching a lyric pattern early enough.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The reversible-exile frame is specific and fresh; the shard-mirror archivist role avoids stock fantasy tropes. Tea-leaf geometry as the method of adjudication is memorable. The tone (combative tenderness) coheres across beats and charges the closure. Risk is present: the decision to exile Jun into mirrors rather than permanent forgetting is morally ambiguous without false balance. One deduction: the "city that erased its own name" opening image, while evocative, remains ornamental—it does not return or constrain later choices.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Rhea's choices create the central turn: she argues until her throat burns, wins the compromise, brews the tea, annotates the vellum, and promises to hold the exit open. Present throughout; drives two beats (argument aftermath, tea-reading vow) and shapes the closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The afternoon shadow caught in glass is introduced early, returns in the mirror-wall description ("turning each shard into a thin, dark reservoir"), and charges Rhea's touch of the mirror ("feeling the cold nothing just beneath"). Two beats, lyric reprise, but does not constrain a choice—Rhea's actions proceed independently of the shadow's presence.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Reversible exile is the dominant stake, signaled in paragraph seven, frames the conflict (permanent forgetting vs. mirror exile), shapes Rhea's entire argument and the compromise, and defines the closure choice. The vow to hold the exit open and the promise of pain both hinge on reversibility. Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Walking backwards when nervous appears once: "she walks backwards when nervous, so now each cautious step carried her away even as she tried to approach." The trait is embodied and constrains movement in that beat, but it does not recur or shape the closure. One-beat causal work; not essential to the ending.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Annotation is present early (she records decrees among the splinters), returns in the climax ("began to annotate the patterns of leaf and light on a long strip of vellum"), and defines her role as archivist. Two beats; the vellum annotation is the physical act that bridges Jun's exile and return. Essential to her function, though the story could theoretically pivot to another method of recording.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Tea-leaf geometry is signaled early ("analyzing the geometry of tea leaves"), enacted on-page (brewing, swirling three times, overturning, reading the patterns), and produces the reading that structures the vow. The method matters: the leaves' "crooked line that rose, broke, and rose again" gives Rhea evidence to support her promise. Two beats, closure-adjacent.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The forgotten library houses the mirrors, provides the table and cup, and isolates the scene from the Council. Present throughout; the shattered mirrors are the mechanism of exile. The setting enables rather than constrains—Rhea's actions would differ in content but not in intent elsewhere. Two beats (arrival, mirror wall), closure-relevant but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"The hush as an empty playground swing drifts in the breeze" is an evocative opener but does not recur or tighten decisions. No clock pressure; time remains untracked. Present in tone (hesitation, suspension) but not as a constraint. Ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Mentoring resilience quietly is present in Rhea's argument with the Council, her compromise win, and the vow to hold the exit open "as long as my hands remember how." The desire shapes the conflict and closure. Two beats; visible friction between the quiet intent and Jun's demand for pain. Drives the ending choice.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Combative tenderness is embodied throughout: "argued until her throat burned, her combative tenderness barbed with fury," "gentle and sharp at once," "smiled like a drawn blade." The tone modulates with pressure, coheres across beats, and charges the closure vow. Present in voice, action, and the final promise. Integral to the ending's emotional register.</comment>
