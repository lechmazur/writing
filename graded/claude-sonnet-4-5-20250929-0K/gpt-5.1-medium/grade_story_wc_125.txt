<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's interiority shows concrete reflection anchored to the present (rope, dust, sky) and micro-choices emerge (unrolling one's own life, recognizing the texture question). The poet, however, remains largely a vessel for philosophy rather than a fully embodied character with contradictory impulses in scene. "Ethically playful sin against time" and similar phrasing veer toward diagnostic label-speak without embodied cost. The final choice moment ("The choice was mine alone") arrives as assertion rather than dramatized renunciation or commitment with visible cost on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchors cleanly: protagonist, coastal highway, grotto, poet present by ~15% mark. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through layered images (energy beings, rope, dust patterns, unrolling life) toward a Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing at the end where the narrator recognizes choices as texture-expanding rather than good/evil binary. Cost is implied (lover, job, scholarship all at stake) but the final beat does not show a foreclosed path on the page—only recognition. The ending reconfigures meaning with undeniable pressure but stops short of a visible action or forfeiture, landing it as RR (Charged Poise) with felt rather than paid cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The grotto functions as both shelter and crucible: cooled clay, ember-glow, dust between characters all ground the exchange. The rope is handled ("fingers brushing"), and its silvered fibers anchor the prison-escape backstory. The energy beings overhead press the scene from outside, stalling buses and silencing roads, which constrains the protagonist's arrival and frames the stakes. The final image does not lean heavily on setting, but the grotto's wound/womb duality and the dust circles charge the thematic question without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether to expand or shrink one's life-texture—is signaled midway and crystallizes at the end. The poet's prison escape and rope provide a prior example but do not create a reversal for the protagonist. The piece offers one meaningful deepening: the protagonist's recognition of their own "safe job / lover / scholarship" triangle and the shift from binary (good/evil) to textural (shrinking/expanding) thinking. No on-page tightening forecloses a live option; the cost remains potential rather than paid in scene. Escalation operates via accumulative density rather than causal pressure, fitting the inferred lens but lacking a visible price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: the rope as souvenir of choice, dust circles as pattern-seeking, the energy beings as witnesses rather than wardens. The core question—texture of time versus safety—avoids tidy morals and grows from the poet's escape story and the protagonist's unrolling life. The final beat offers a resonant answer (choice between shrinking/expanding) without stating a moral, though "passionate subtlety" in the rope-rustle laugh feels slightly overwrought. No thematic echo in the last paragraph; the piece trusts image and implication.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>POV remains stable first-person, anchored in the protagonist's perception. Diction is elevated but mostly consistent ("rust-colored hills," "texture of time," "ethically playful"); occasional slips into register ("posed a question," "ontological" absent but hinted in tone) tilt academic. Dialogue feels slightly essay-like ("Would I rather live safely inside one small moment, or taste how all moments rub against each other?") but serves the poet's character as a wandering philosopher. Perceptual signature is selective (backpack bite, clay cool, rope glare) and the free indirect style remains clean. Under peak stress (life-choice revelation) the prose holds texture without compression artifacts.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines advance atmosphere, character, or theme. However, paraphrase loops appear: "terra-cotta grotto under starlight" restated as "hollow of cooled clay, walls glowing like low embers under starlight" within two lines; "choices" and "texture" recur frequently without added pressure. Template cadence in the poet's monologue ("They always stop… Only then do we see…") reads as intentional patterning but flattens momentum in the middle third. Figurative language is dense (wound/womb, frayed coil, silvered fibers) without muddle, but "passionate subtlety" in the final beat feels label-like rather than embodied. No major line-level artifacts touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of post-apocalyptic energy beings, a drifting poet-philosopher, and the prison-escape rope offers a fresh premise. The "texture of time" framing and the choice trilemma (inform/silent/escape) feel specific rather than template-derived. Emotional specificity in the protagonist's unrolling life (job, lover, scholarship) grounds the abstraction. However, the poet as wise-stranger archetype and the grotto as liminal-space setting lean familiar; the transformation lies more in voice and concept than structural risk. The ending's "choice was mine alone" moment feels inevitable in hindsight but stops short of bold irreversibility.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Present throughout; frames the protagonist's question via backstory and dust-pattern ritual. His choice (rope escape) models the third-way logic but does not create a key turn for the protagonist on the page; he observes and articulates rather than deciding. His laugh and refusal to advise charge the final beat but do not alter the protagonist's options—only illuminate them. Two beats (arrival, final exchange) involve him causally. Swappable with another philosophical guide without major loss.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Introduced early (~20% mark), handled twice (glare, poet's fingers brushing it), and carries reweighted meaning: souvenir → promise → answer-in-poems. The rope grounds the poet's credibility and the escape story. It does not constrain a present choice but charges the thematic pattern (third-way agency). Present in the final beat via "rustle of the rope" laugh. Essential to the poet's arc; swappable only with significant rewrites to his backstory and the third-way logic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Signaled early via stalled roads, developed through the poet's prison trilemma (inform/silent/escape), and reweighted at the end when the protagonist recognizes their own impossible triangle (job/lover/scholarship) as shrink-or-expand rather than good-or-evil. The concept shapes stakes and tactics: the poet chose a third way, the protagonist must now choose texture over safety. It drives two beats (poet's story, protagonist's realization) and articulates the closure reconfiguration. Not easily swappable; removing it collapses the thematic spine.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Label appears twice ("ethically playful sin," "ethically playful tilt") without on-page demonstration of the attribute constraining or enabling action. The poet's cheerfulness and smile suggest playfulness, and his escape could read as ethical defiance, but no single choice on the page shows the attribute in friction with cost. Functional as tone marker but replaceable with "wry" or "ironic" without structural loss. No middle development or closure participation beyond atmosphere.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Signaled midway ("uncovering layers") and articulated as method in the poet's monologue: "Each layer is a choice; peel one back and another waits." The protagonist's life unrolls in layers (job, lover, scholarship) and the realization that fear and desire share a root follows the layering logic. The method shapes one key turn (protagonist's recognition) but does not drive earlier beats; it arrives as explanation rather than dramatized technique. Swappable with "seeing through" or "questioning assumptions" with moderate edits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The poet describes the method explicitly: "uncovering layers… until you find the place where your fear and your desire share a root." The protagonist applies it immediately (life unrolls, layers reveal the shrink/expand choice). Present in setup (poet's dust circles suggest pattern-seeking) and payoff (final recognition), but not in a middle beat that dramatizes the mechanics under pressure. One key turn traces to it; mechanics matter at closure but are told rather than shown in action.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Established early (~10% mark) with vivid detail (cooled clay, ember-glow, wound/womb imagery) and grounds the entire exchange. The grotto provides shelter that enables the conversation and the dust floor supports the poet's pattern-drawing. It does not constrain a choice—characters could converse anywhere—but it charges the tone (liminal, womb-like) and the final image's pressure. Present across all three gates (setup, middle staging, closure atmosphere). Swappable with another liminal space (cave, ruin) but the terra-cotta specificity and starlight anchor theme.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Signaled early (energy beings short-circuit engines, buses stalled) and frames the premise: a paused world where "futures felt suddenly optional." The timeframe enables the protagonist's walking arrival and the poet's witness-not-warden claim. It does not tighten decisions on the page—no clock pressures the choice—and the energy beings remain atmospheric rather than tactical. Present in setup and thematic framing but absent from escalation and closure mechanics. Functional but largely replaceable with any post-rupture moment.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Stated explicitly ("I had come to the hills for the same reason… to discover the texture of time") and dramatized through the protagonist's unrolling life and final recognition. The desire is conflicted: safety (job, lover) versus expansion (scholarship, new choices). Friction between wants and costs appears in the final beat but is recognized rather than enacted. Present in setup (arrival motivation), development (articulation), and payoff (realization), but the protagonist does not choose on the page—only sees the choice. Swappable with "understand my choices" without major loss.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Tone coheres across turns: elevated diction ("terra-cotta," "ethically playful," "passionate subtlety") modulates with pressure (backpack bite, clay cool, rustle of rope). The "passionate subtlety" label in the final beat feels slightly forced but the laugh and rope-rustle image embody it. Tone charges the final image (quiet recognition rather than shout) and supports the accumulative lens. Static elevated register in the middle third (poet's monologue) flattens momentum slightly but recovers at closure. Present in all three gates and irreplaceable without rewriting voice.</comment>
