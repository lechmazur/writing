<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The archivist's interiority is concrete and embodied through his handling of quills and crystals, with "preemptive nostalgia" manifesting as physical chest-tightening when he watches shadows shift. His motivation to preserve collective memory drives consistent micro-choices (pausing midstroke, working faster, calculating seasons). However, the piece operates at such distance that internal contradiction never surfaces—he remains a contemplative observer executing his role without competing impulses or genuine struggle that would force a harder trade-off.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density increases through layered sensory particulars (crystal visions, shadow measurements, storm shifts) and the final image—"certain of things it did not know it had almost forgotten"—delivers Conceptual Repricing with undeniable cost (the city's ignorance of its own rescued memories). Orientation anchors immediately (archivist, observatory, twilight). One meaningful deepening occurs when he realizes "children might soon forget" and works faster, tightening urgency. Cost is conceptual and felt in his "chest tightened" and the city's oblivious dependence, landing cleanly under the accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The observatory setting constrains choice throughout: thin air and storm pressure frame urgency, the crystal forecourt whispers when touched (beat involvement), and shadow lengths on monuments provide the archivist's diagnostic tool, driving his decision to prioritize fading memories. The stormlight's shifting angles become a live clock that alters his transcription tactics. The final railing touch and dimming lamps charge the ending image, making the setting indispensable to both method and closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving collective memory before it dissolves—is signaled early and remains coherent. One meaningful tightening occurs when storm-shadow shifts reveal a market memory "thinning," prompting the archivist to work faster with visible urgency ("chest tightened," "worked faster"). The cost is legible: neighborhoods lose their reasons for rituals if he fails. However, the archivist's agency never faces a hard trade-off or renunciation; he simply succeeds at his appointed task, so escalation reads as intensification rather than a narrowing of live options under competing pressures.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: the archivist sculpts the city's identity yet finds himself "tucked into the margins," allowing "its multitudes to sculpt a memory of him in return"—a resonant inversion delivered without moralizing. The ending image ("certain of things it did not know it had almost forgotten") reprices the premise with conceptual cost, avoiding statement. Recurring motifs (shadows, quills, crystals) constrain choice and charge closure. Minor slip: "preemptive nostalgia" occasionally edges toward label-speak rather than pure dramatization, but the final reciprocal recognition earns its weight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: the archivist notices "shadow lengths" before trusting carvings, filters sensory detail through archival priorities, and uses elevated yet consistent diction ("accumulated sky," "sediment waited to be named"). Voice modulates purposefully from contemplative arrival to urgent transcription. However, psychic distance remains uniform across emotional shifts—the prose texture doesn't degrade or sharpen under peak pressure, missing an opportunity to embody intensification through syntax and rhythm.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Information density is high: most lines advance atmosphere, world logic, or stakes ("emotions evaporated from plazas and kitchens, now drifting upward"). Rhythm varies naturally and figurative language is controlled and coherent. Minor issues: "deepening hush" recurs four times without reweighting, edging toward motif checklist; a few near-paraphrases ("shadows revealed... he noted where the stormlight shortened some, sharpened others" closely restates the prior shadow-reading concept). No loops touch closure, so non-closure cap applies: baseline strong execution with −0.3 for the hush repetition and mild synonym drift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of weathered collective memory materialized as crystals, decoded through shadow-length at monuments, offers a fresh angle on archive-keeper tropes. Specific world mechanics (summer-quills absorbing voices, raindrops whispering giggles, shadows measuring belief) ground the fantastic in tactile constraint. The reciprocal recognition—archivist becomes archived—provides a non-obvious thematic turn. However, the role itself (solitary scholar preserving culture against forgetting) is a familiar archetype, and the plot executes the premise without structural risk or subversion, landing mid-7s for strong but not bold originality.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The summer-quill archivist drives all on-page action: he chooses to examine shadow lengths, pauses midstroke to calculate memory lifespan, works faster when urgency mounts, and his transcription choices shape the city's retained identity. Setup immediate, development across multiple beats (shadow calculation, crystal handling, parchment stacking), and closure participation (his recognition that he is now part of the archive). His decisions alter tactics under pressure, making the character essential to the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The crystal whispering forecourt after rain appears twice: arrival (tiles hum with unfinished stories, raindrops whisper a child's giggle when touched) and departure (forecourt quiets, drops finish whispering). The object provides sensory texture and thematic echo (evaporated emotions stored), but does not constrain a key choice or shift the archivist's tactics. Its reappearance at closure notes resolution without reweighting stakes. Present in setup and payoff but uninvolved in development beats, reaching mid-5s for purposeful bookending without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Collective memory is the dominant stake: the archivist's goal is explicitly "to sculpt identity from experience, citywide," and the story's central action—transcribing crystallized vapor into parchments—enacts the concept on the page. The concept shapes tactics (prioritizing fading monuments, calculating how many seasons remain) and delivers the closure repricing ("certain of things it did not know it had almost forgotten"). Setup immediate, development across beats, payoff in final image. The concept is indispensable to both stakes and closure logic.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Preemptively nostalgic" is stated early ("He was preemptively nostalgic, aching for memories even as he approached their appointed birthplace") and embodied once at the midpoint ("His chest tightened with that future absence, a nostalgia arriving early, heavy as incoming rain"), where it drives his decision to work faster. However, the trait does not constrain a harder choice or impose a visible trade-off—it colors perception but does not foreclose a path. Setup and one development beat without closure-shaping cost, reaching low-5s for functional but limited integration.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Conjecture" is signaled as method ("he began to conjecture which would soon fade") and drives one key choice: calculating memory lifespan prompts urgency and prioritization ("Those fading ones would need transcription before dawn"). The action appears in setup and development, shaping tactics under pressure. However, it does not recur at closure or impose a hard constraint; the archivist's conjectures prove correct without friction or error. Two gates met with moderate causal weight, mid-6s for purposeful but replaceable role.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Examining shadow lengths at monuments" is introduced as explicit method ("His training taught him to read their shadows first"), drives multiple beats (noting where stormlight shifts shadows, calculating seasons remaining, recognizing when beliefs are questioned below), and provides the diagnostic tool that determines transcription priority. Setup immediate, development across beats, and the method's consequences ("children might soon forget") charge his urgency at closure. The mechanics matter and shape attempts, making the method essential to the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The stormlit observatory above clouds frames all action: thin air and altitude isolate the work, storm shifts below provide the shadow-clock that drives urgency, and the glass dome houses the instruments that compress vapor into memory crystals. The setting supplies the resources (lens, crystals, forecourt) and constraints (storm timing, shadow angles) that define the archivist's task. Setup immediate, development across beats, and the dimming lamps and pale morning at closure punctuate completion. The setting is indispensable to both method and stakes.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"After fog becomes solid" establishes the temporal precondition for the archive's opening ("It happened only after fog becomes solid, when dreams and forgotten afternoons gain the weight of stone") and frames the night's urgency. However, the timeframe does not tighten visibly as the story progresses—the archivist works "hours" but no countdown or missed deadline materializes. The storm thins and morning approaches, providing atmospheric closure rather than a live clock that alters moves. Setup and payoff present but development lacks escalating time pressure, mid-6s for thematic anchoring without tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The motivation "to sculpt identity from experience" is stated explicitly ("His motive was simple and impossibly large: to sculpt identity from experience, citywide") and dramatized through choices: prioritizing fading memories, working faster under urgency, stacking parchments that "bloom into crowded rooms." The desire is tested by the scale of the task and the cost of future absence ("chest tightened"). Setup immediate, development across beats, and closure delivers the reciprocal insight that he is now sculpted into the archive. The motivation is essential, but faces no internal conflict or competing want, capping it below 8.0.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Deepening hush" appears four times, framing the story's tonal arc from arrival ("deepening hush of accumulated sky") through work ("steady counterpoint to distant thunder") to closure ("listening as the deepening hush turned inward"). The tone modulates with pressure: contemplative arrival, urgent transcription, quiet resolution. However, the repetition edges toward motif checklist without functional reweighting—each mention is atmospheric rather than constraining choice. Coherent through turns and present in the final image, reaching mid-7s for consistent tonal charge without tactical impact.</comment>
