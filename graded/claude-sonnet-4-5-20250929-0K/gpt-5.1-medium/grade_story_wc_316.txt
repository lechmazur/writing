<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The narrator's motivation to "defeat emotional numbness" is dramatized through choices in the memory-duel, particularly the final refusal to erase guilt. Internal contradiction appears when the narrator seeks custody "not to win, but to feel," creating purposeful tension. However, embodied emotion remains thin—"faintest spark of panic, almost like real fear" tells rather than shows the numbness through concrete sensory shutdown. The climactic choice is earned but the emotional texture throughout lacks the contradictory layering required for higher bands.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Causal with lyric texture. Orientation anchors (floating dojo, two Arins, brain jar, arbiter Kesh) land cleanly in the opening third. The memory-duel escalates through a series of because/therefore beats: each blade swing threatens erasure, the narrator's defensive choices spark feeling, and the final refusal to erase guilt prevents monstrosity. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the narrator lowers the weapon and voices understanding, crystallizing a stance that forecloses the path of hollowing-out with visible relational and moral cost. The cost is legible in the line "whatever we vivify from the jar will be monstrous and numb," reweighting the custody question into an ethical recalibration.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The floating-rock dojo, glass tendrils, translucent sound-floor, and training blades all constrain the duel's choreography and charge the speculative atmosphere. The projected childhood bedroom provides a concrete anchor for the memory-strikes. However, spatial relations remain impressionistic—rocks "drift closer" without affecting tactics, and the environment never forces a micro-choice or alters an option on the page. The setting vivifies tone but does not reach the 9+ gate of constraining a choice or charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—custody of the jarred consciousness—is signaled immediately and pursued through the memory-blade duel. Pressure escalates as each strike threatens erasure, narrowing the emotional and tactical options. The climactic choice (lowering the weapon, refusing to erase guilt) is driven by protagonist agency and forecloses the path of winning by "hollowing him out." The cost is visible: the narrator risks losing custody and archives by sparing the memory, and the line "understanding that we hurt someone" articulates relational and moral price. One meaningful tightening under a causal lens with legible cost satisfies the 600–800 word standard.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—selfhood, authenticity, and the cost of duplication—emerges through the duel's structure and the memory-blade mechanic rather than through statement. The final refusal to erase guilt offers a resonant, non-literal answer: authenticity requires owning harm, and infinite copies without conscience are monstrous. The "complementary opposites" frame (black/white blades, Kesh's robe, history rewriting) recurs purposefully, and the closure reweights the custody question into an ethical calculus. Minor deduction: "defeat emotional numbness" and "vivify" appear as prompt echoes rather than fully dramatized particulars, and the arbiter's silent nod risks a soft thematic handwave rather than a fully earned image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Single-POV first-person maintains stable distance and a melancholy, slightly elevated register that fits an "ego death survivor" attempting philosophical precision. Diction remains internally consistent ("faint shadows," "data, not life," "recursive appeals"), and the voice modulates subtly under pressure ("for the first time my voice trembled"). Arin-2's dialogue ("duplication is origin here, not fraud") carries distinct idiom and goal-pursuit. Minor slip: the arbiter's lines ("Today we will vivify the question of self") and some narration ("incision," "annotation") drift toward a shared elevated register that flattens voice distinction slightly, preventing entry to the 9+ band.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies, sentence openings shift, and information density is high in the duel beats. However, three artifact patterns accumulate: (1) template cadence in the opening third ("Wind curled… carrying," "I stood… masquerading," "After my mind… feelings"), (2) filter-verb stack ("I watched, feeling almost nothing," "I realized I did not want"), and (3) elevated metaphor density without pattern-teaching ("motives twitching," "algorithmic compost," "recursive appeals," "stubborn annotation") that occasionally obscures rather than sharpens. The closure beat ("wait, I said, lowering my weapon") is clean and propulsive. Artifacts in the first half and filter verbs prevent higher scoring but do not dull the closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of clone custody trial, memory-blade duel, and ego-death recovery offers a non-obvious angle on identity and authenticity. The floating-rock dojo and Kesh's dual-colored eyes create a speculative frame that integrates with the "complementary opposites" method. The emotional truth—that selfhood requires owning harm—feels specific and earned. Minor deduction: the premise leans on sci-fi/philosophical workshop conventions (clones, consciousness jars, abstract trials) and the "history rewrites itself" timeframe functions more as atmospheric recurrence than a constraining rule, reducing irreplaceability slightly.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The ego-death survivor is the protagonist whose numbness motivates the custody petition and whose choice to preserve guilt drives the climax. The trait shapes two beats: the opening stake ("I had come here to defeat emotional numbness") and the final weapon-lowering ("I realized I did not want to win by hollowing him out"). The choice forecloses the path of winning via erasure with visible relational cost, and the cost is tied to the survivor identity: without guilt, "whatever we vivify… will be monstrous and numb." Present in setup, middle choice, and closure with causal pressure and cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The brain jar appears in three beats: opening description ("secured by glass tendrils"), Arin-2's gesture mid-duel ("the fluid around it fizzed"), and the climactic line ("whatever we vivify from the jar will be monstrous"). However, it is never handled or used on the page; it remains a static prize rather than an active object. The final mention reweights its meaning from "duplicate" label to potential monster, providing lyric closure participation. Swappable with "frozen embryo" or similar custody object with minor edits. Reaches low 6s via early signal, lyric reprise, and closure reweighting, but lack of on-page handling and static presence cap it below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The clone custody battle is the story's primary engine: it structures the hearing, provides the arbiter's ruling framework, defines the stakes (winner recognized as authentic, loser archived), and drives the memory-duel mechanic. The concept shapes tactics (each blade swing attempts to erase shared memories to establish authenticity) and the climax (refusing erasure redefines what custody should mean). Present in setup, middle escalation, and closure with irreplaceable causal pressure. The entire plot collapses without this exact framing.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Master Kesh "slices through pretense" by declaring "we will vivify the question of self, not in theory but in consequence" and issuing the memory-blade test, forcing concrete action rather than abstract argument. The attribute enables the duel structure and constrains both Arins to dramatize rather than debate their claims. However, the trait is told via reputation ("famous for rulings that sliced through pretense") and demonstrated once in framing the trial; it does not recur or constrain a second choice. Present in setup and enabling one major beat, but swappable with "cuts to the heart" or similar judicial traits. Reaches mid-6s via causal enabling but lacks closure participation or irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The verb "vivify" appears three times: Kesh's charge ("we will vivify the question of self"), the narrator's climactic warning ("whatever we vivify from the jar will be monstrous"), and as metaphorical frame for bringing consciousness from the jar into authentic being. The final use reweights the concept from neutral procedure to ethical peril, charging the closure. However, the action itself is abstract and not dramatized on the page—no one attempts vivification, and it remains a future consequence. Functions as thematic keyword and closure charge but is not irreplaceable; "animate," "awaken," or "restore" could substitute with minor tonal shifts. Lyric reprise with closure participation but swappability and lack of on-page enactment cap it at mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Complementary opposites (black/white blades, Kesh's half-white/half-black robe, eyes that "never blinked in the same color twice") structure the trial's logic and are named explicitly by Kesh: "Through complementary opposites we will test your claims." The method enables the memory-duel mechanic (each blade threatens erasure, forcing defensive/offensive trade-offs) and reappears in the climax when preserving guilt preserves the complementary opposite of awe. Present in setup, shapes middle tactics, and implicitly charges closure by preserving moral complexity rather than erasing one pole. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage, but the final beat does not explicitly name the method, reducing irreplaceability slightly.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The floating rock dojo anchors every beat, provides the translucent sound-floor for the duel, and supplies the arbiter's elevated vantage. The projected childhood bedroom (micro-setting shift within the dojo frame) grounds the memory-strikes in concrete place. The rocks "drifting closer" at the ending charges the verdict moment spatially. However, the setting never constrains a choice—no character uses rock positions, proximities, or environmental features to alter tactics. Present throughout, enables the duel, and charges the final image, but lacks tactical constraint. Reaches low 6s via early signal, beat involvement, and closure presence, capped by absence of choice-constraint.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The timeframe "while history rewrites itself" recurs atmospherically (opening "Wind curled… carrying… forgotten verdicts," mid-scene "the sky above us flickered through centuries," final "our little argument hung untouched between edits") but does not constrain decisions or create urgency. The duel proceeds without a ticking clock, and the rewriting serves as metaphorical backdrop rather than tactical pressure. No character's choice is shaped by temporal limits or the rewriting mechanic. Present in setup and as motif but ornamental; easily cut without structural loss. Functional as tone but replaceable and inert re: tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The motivation "to defeat emotional numbness" is declared in the opening ("I had come here to defeat emotional numbness before it calcified"), tested in the duel ("I felt the faintest spark of panic, almost like real fear"), and drives the climax ("I realized I did not want to win by hollowing him out, because whatever survived would be… numb, just like I have been trying not to stay"). The desire is dramatized through micro-choices (defending memories that spark feeling, lowering the weapon to preserve guilt) with visible cost (risking custody loss). Present in setup, middle friction, and closure with strong causal pressure and irreplaceability. The entire arc depends on this exact motivation.</comment>
