<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Tammuz's motivations are clear and consistent—his frugal devotion to measurement, his willingness to gamble years on a hunch. His internal contradiction between empirical rigor and unquantifiable longing is embodied in concrete choices (salvaging the tile, rigging the lights, recording offsets). The final renunciation—walking out "richer by a question he could never exhaust"—is earned by the preceding causality and forecloses certainty with visible cost. Minor: the colleagues' joke about "empirically ironic" devotion arrives as summary rather than dramatized pressure, slightly weakening interiority specificity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story anchors who/where/when early (astronomer, palace-museum, dusk, between regimes). Causality is clean: Tammuz arrives with tile → decodes numerals → rigs floodlights → tests conjunction → one planet aligns → clouds reveal new stars matching old notes → he shuts down and leaves. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): "encrypted devotion reciprocated, not with certainty, but with a quiet, usable doubt" reweights the stakes with conceptual cost (he cannot exhaust the question). The lens reads Causal with Accumulative texturing; the final image lands cleanly under the dominant lens. One meaningful tightening occurs when the planet slides into the node, crystallizing his doubt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The reimagined palace is anchored early with sensory specificity (incense, dust, electrical hum, brick reliefs, tarps over reconstructions). The utility alcove breakers and control board constrain Tammuz's method; the courtyard grid becomes the experimental apparatus. The tile's tactile presence (matte, cool, river mud scent, later warm) recurs and charges the closure moment. The "between regimes" liminality subtly mirrors his existential stance. Minor: the spice shop and rented room above are mentioned but never pressure his choices.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—sealing a covenant with the unknown via empirical test—is signaled in paragraph four and sustained throughout. One meaningful tightening occurs when the planet aligns exactly, forcing Tammuz to confront his longing versus his skepticism. The resolution is earned by his agency (rigging lights, recording offsets, interpreting the new stars) and forecloses certainty with felt cost: he gains "a question he could never exhaust" instead of proof. The escalation reads Causal with visible escalation (indifferent stars → near alignments → one exact hit → new stars matching old notes). No antagonist is required; coincidence complicates but does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme—devotion encrypted in measurement, the reciprocity of cosmos and human longing—emerges through concrete particulars (the tile's sums as "names," the grid as "three-dimensional abacus," the warm clay, the "breathing stillness"). The ending offers a non-literal answer: not certainty but "a quiet, usable doubt," reweighting the opening's "covenant with the unknown" without stating a moral. The "empirically ironic" formulation and "schematic representations" motifs recur purposefully, though the astronomer's articulation of his own method edges toward thematic echo. The piece resists tidy resolution and invites reflection beyond plot.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited, anchored in Tammuz's perceptual signature (numbers as coordinates, stars as indifferent gods, the tile "asking" to uncloak its intention). Diction is controlled and purposeful ("dusky harmony," "encrypted devotion," "schematic representations"). No dialogue appears; the voice modulates from clinical observation to hushed intensity at the alignment moment. Minor: several elevated-register phrases ("provisional labels on a sky that kept rearranging itself," "devotion forced through schematic representations") edge toward essayistic distance, slightly loosening the perceptual grip during peak pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings and paragraph lengths create visual rhythm. Information density is high (most lines advance character, world, or atmosphere). The courtyard experiment sequence propels cleanly. Weaknesses: paraphrase loops appear ("Museum curators called him Tammuz, though he insisted names were merely coordinates" restates the theme stated two sentences prior in different terms; "empirically ironic" and "encrypted devotion" are glossed redundantly). Template cadence: "He set his notebook… unwrapped the tile… traced the border numerals… opened the notebook" stacks four "he [verb]" openers across successive beats. Elevated diction ("schematic representations," "uncloak its intention") in peak beats slightly dulls immediacy. Apply −0.6 for paraphrase + template stack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis—ancient Babylonian magic square as star map tested via museum floodlights—is specific and non-obvious. The frugal astronomer living above a spice shop, his notebook as devotional text, and the "between regimes" liminality transform stock tropes. The closure's "quiet, usable doubt" resists easy epiphany. The piece commits fully to its premise without retreat. Minor: the frame (lone scholar, sacred artifact, liminal space, night experiment) echoes familiar territory, though the execution elevates through lived detail (river mud scent, breaker switches, offset recording) and the understated ending.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Tammuz is introduced in paragraph one, drives every beat (arrives, decodes, rigs lights, tests, interprets, leaves), and his final choice to walk out "richer by a question" delivers closure. His frugality shapes tactics (rented room, spending more on paper than food) and the tile salvage. The attribute is causal across setup, escalation, and ending. Strong integration.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The tile appears in paragraph one (wrapped bundle), is unwrapped and traced in paragraph fifteen, its numerals shape the grid design (paragraph twenty-two), it grows warm at the alignment (paragraph twenty-eight), and is re-wrapped at closure (paragraph thirty-two). Its cuneiform sums drive the experimental method and its warmth charges the moment of reciprocity. Five distinct beats; closure linkage; irreplaceable. High integration.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Encrypted devotion" is introduced in paragraph eight, recurs in the closure paragraph ("encrypted devotion reciprocated"), and shapes his methodology (numbers as love letter, symbols only the patient can decode). It frames stakes and reweights at the end. However, it functions more as thematic gloss than as a constraint that alters tactics on the page. Mid-integration.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Empirically ironic" is introduced in paragraph seven (colleagues' joke), recurs at the alignment moment ("The empirically ironic part… was that the better the fit became, the less he trusted his own longing"), and articulates the internal friction driving his doubt. It deepens one key beat and informs closure stance but does not visibly constrain a choice with cost. Moderate integration.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Uncloak" appears twice: Tammuz asks the tile "to uncloak its intention" (paragraph sixteen) and later the clouds "uncloaked a new patch of stars" (paragraph twenty-nine). The second use delivers the story's pivot—new stars matching his old conjecture—and charges the closure. The verb is specific and irreplaceable; swapping it would flatten the mystical-empirical register. Strong integration.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>"Schematic representations" is introduced in paragraph eleven (his devotion "forced through schematic representations"), recurs in paragraph seventeen (his notebook reduces sky to "lines and angles"), and shapes his method throughout (grid overlay, assigned lamps, control board sketch). The means is signaled early, matters mechanically in the middle beats, and is implicit in the closure's reliance on his notebook. Strong integration.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The palace is anchored in paragraph one, its liminal "between regimes" status introduced in paragraph two, and it supplies the utility alcove, control board, courtyard grid, and tarps (paragraphs thirteen, twenty-one, twenty-two). The setting enables the experiment's scale and charges the ending's "reimagined palace" reprise. The reconstructions and floodlights are irreplaceable resources. High integration.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Between regimes" is introduced in paragraph two, recurs in paragraph fourteen ("still between regimes of curator and patron"), and lends thematic weight to Tammuz's liminal experiment. It does not tighten a decision or impose a deadline; the timing is dusk-to-night but not urgent. Moderate integration via tone and concept; limited causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The motivation "to seal a covenant with the unknown" is stated in paragraph four, dramatized through his preparation (decoding, rigging lights), tested in the alignment sequence (paragraphs twenty-four–twenty-eight), and resolved in the closure ("his encrypted devotion reciprocated… with a quiet, usable doubt"). Friction between his empirical rigor and unquantifiable longing is embodied in choices. Strong integration with visible cost at closure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Dusky harmony" is introduced in paragraph three ("air held a dusky harmony of incense, dust, and low electrical hum"), modulates through the night experiment (restless shadows, breathing stillness), and charges the final departure. Tone is coherent through turns and supports the mystical-empirical register. The ending's quiet restraint fulfills the opening's promise. Strong tonal integration.</comment>
