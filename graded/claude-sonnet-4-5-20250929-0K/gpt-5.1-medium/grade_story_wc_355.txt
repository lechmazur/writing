<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's pacifist stance is embodied through consistent micro-choices (refusing to break the clasp, his instruments cobbled without violence), and the final decision to unclasp the diary is earned by the realization about empathy born from prior reflection and sound-work. Interiority is concrete and character-particular ("digging toward the hidden springs of patience under his temper"). The backstory regarding Mira and his shout is substantial (~20% of text) but anchored to present stimuli (the diary, the fireworks countdown) and tilts his present stance via the micro-choice to finally open the journal. Minor deduction: the epiphany about "feeling how the world pressed her there" edges toward articulated insight rather than pure dramatization, though it remains tied to embodied experience.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when clearly in the opening paragraph. The piece operates under a hybrid lens—accumulative texture (cataloging silences) resolving into a causal turn (the decision to unclasp). Closure is a Decisive Change: Elias physically unclasps the diary after the realization reweights his understanding of Mira's choice, foreclosing his years-long avoidance with visible cost (confronting the echo of his shout and her unread words). The rocket's "brief white glare" charges the final image. One structural friction: the reflective density in the middle third risks flattening present pressure, though the countdown and sound-work maintain situational urgency.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The workshop's "open roof hatch" and "bench" anchor spatial choreography; the microphones and console function as tools that constrain Elias's method. The timeframe (pre-fireworks stillness) creates urgency as sounds recede. The diary clasp as micro-setting object charges the final beat. Sensory detail is vivid and selective ("cotton," "friction of pages pressed tight by time"), filtered through Elias's priorities. Does not reach 9+ because the workshop itself does not impose a tactical choice—it provides atmosphere and tools but the core constraint is temporal (fireworks) rather than environmental.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early: catalog silences before fireworks erase them. Pressure tightens through the receding soundscape and the escalating confrontation with the diary. The final tightening—turning the microphone toward the journal, hearing its "texture," then unclasping—is driven by Elias's agency and alters his years-long stance with visible cost (facing the grief and anger he's avoided). No explicit antagonist; pressure is situational (time) and internal (avoidance vs. need). One beat: the leap from "hearing the texture" to the empathy realization feels slightly compressed but remains plausible under the accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars: the varieties of silence, the diary clasp, the difference between dew and broken glass. The path to empathy is enacted rather than stated—Elias moves from wanting to understand *why* Mira marched to *feeling how the world pressed her there*. The firework's "brief white glare" offers a resonant, non-literal answer: illumination that makes the hidden visible. Minor slip: "the path to empathy was not about understanding why... but about feeling how" edges toward articulated thesis in the penultimate paragraph, though it remains tied to embodied discovery rather than pure assertion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with psychic distance that tightens under pressure. Perceptual signature is character-specific: "theatrical sincerity," "cobbled together... from brass scraps," "varieties of silence." Diction is controlled and voice-motivated ("shiver that seemed to rearrange his bones"). No dialogue; interior monologue is clean. Minor texture issue: occasional elevated metaphor ("corridor paved... with questions," "spiral staircase inside his own chest") slightly strains the focalizer's idiom during peak reflection, though it remains within an artisan-philosopher's lexical range.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high in the sound-cataloging beats. Two craft frictions lower the score: (1) Paraphrase loop: "She had never been brave enough to read it, so instead he listened around it" immediately followed by "Now, as the last stray noises dwindled outside, he angled one of his directional microphones toward the closed journal"—the second restates the listening strategy. (2) Figurative density in the final third occasionally stacks without clear propulsion ("friction of pages pressed tight by time and stubborn love," "corridor paved... with questions," "shiver that seemed to rearrange his bones"). These artifacts do not obscure causality but slightly dull momentum. No filter-verb stacks or template cadence; grammar and tense are clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of sound-artist pacifist + locked diary + pre-fireworks stillness is specific and non-obvious. The transformation of "cataloging silence" into a path to posthumous empathy feels earned in hindsight. Risk-taking: the premise (using sound equipment to "hear" a closed diary) borders on magical realism but is grounded in Elias's conviction and theatrical sincerity, maintaining tonal coherence. Slight friction: the "tuning frequencies to coax echoes" mechanism remains abstract—early grounding in plausible audio-artifact logic (e.g., electromagnetic hum, paper resonance) would tighten believability and raise irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's pacifism shapes choices throughout: refusing to break the clasp, cobbling instruments without violence, opposing Mira's march. The final decision to unclasp is the decisive reversal of his avoidance, driven by the empathy realization. Present in setup, middle (the avoidance vs. the sound-work tension), and closure. Causal pressure and cost are clear.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The clasp appears in setup ("avoided all evening"), middle (description of the ornamental lock and his refusal to break it), and closure (he "unclasps" it in the final line). The object embodies his pacifist vow and the barrier to Mira's words. The final unclasp is the decisive physical act that enacts the internal shift. High specificity; removal would collapse the closure gesture.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The path to empathy is the story's organizing question and named explicitly in the penultimate paragraph: "the path to empathy was not about understanding why Mira had marched, but about feeling how the world pressed her there." It shapes Elias's goal (listening to understand Mira) and the final realization. However, the concept is articulated rather than purely dramatized, and the shift from "why" to "how" is described more than enacted through scene beats. Present in closure but with moderate causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Intuitively descriptive" appears in setup ("he murmured a phrase into his recorder, intuitively descriptive") and governs the middle cataloging beats ("Market hush," "Porch light anticipation"). It enables his method but does not constrain a choice or create visible cost. The trait is functional but could be replaced with "poetic" or "impressionistic" without altering story logic. No closure participation beyond general thematic fit.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Recover" drives the middle action: Elias attempts to "recover lost moments of quiet by tuning frequencies." The sound-work and the microphone aimed at the diary enact this method. However, the verb "recover" itself is somewhat abstract—his actions read more as "catalog" or "capture" than retrieve something lost. Present across beats but not indispensable; "preserve" or "collect" would serve nearly as well. Moderate causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Tuning frequencies is signaled early ("coaxing echoes from the air... by tuning frequencies") and enacted in the middle: "He turned the dial, seeking... the faint staticky halo." The method matters to the sound-cataloging beats and the attempt to "hear" the diary. However, the mechanics remain abstract—no specific frequency, dial setting, or audio phenomenon is described that alters tactics. Present in closure's lead-up but does not decisively shape the final unclasp. Functional but not irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The workshop is established in the opening line and anchors all action. The "open roof hatch" frames the fireworks countdown and the "bench" organizes Elias's tools. The setting supplies the isolation needed for his sound-work and the spatial intimacy with the diary. The "square of sky" in the middle and the rocket's "white glare" at closure tie environment to the final beat. Does not constrain a tactical choice directly but charges atmosphere and supports the closure image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The pre-fireworks stillness is signaled in the opening ("final stillness before fireworks ignite"), governs all pressure ("In a few minutes, the encroaching thunder"), and drives the cataloging urgency. Time tightens as sounds recede and Elias confronts the diary. The first rocket's launch triggers the final unclasp, making the timeframe causally active at closure. High specificity: a different timeframe (e.g., dawn, post-festival) would lose the countdown tension. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Cataloging silence is Elias's stated goal in setup ("to catalog the varieties of silence the way botanists pressed leaves into books"), dramatized in the middle beats (naming absences: "Market hush," "Porch light anticipation"), and implicitly reweighted at closure when the diary's "texture" reveals a crowded silence rather than an empty one. The motivation is conflicted—his cataloging is also avoidance of the diary. Felt cost: years of listening "around" the journal. Strong across all three gates.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theatrical sincerity is named early ("cobbled together with theatrical sincerity") and maintained through diction ("expectant souls," "velvet curtains," "shiver that seemed to rearrange his bones"). The tone balances lyric elevation with grounded grief, modulating under pressure without tipping into irony or melodrama. The final image sustains the tone: the rocket's "white glare" is both literal and charged. Does not constrain a choice but coherently charges the ending. High consistency across beats.</comment>
