<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The negotiator's interiority is embodied through gesture (clipboard held "like fragile armor") and his professional discipline worn "like a too-heavy coat." His contradiction—disgust at compromise yet commitment to civilian survival—drives the climactic choice to offer "survivable disappointment." The general and envoy are sketched with enough specificity (scar tissue, thread-knotted ankles) to apply distinct pressure, though their interior lives remain thin. Minor slip: "operatively gentle" appears twice as a label without fully dramatized cost in action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when within the first paragraph. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: ritual elements (salt, ash, water), repeated phrases ("operatively gentle," "price of redemption"), and density build toward the signing moment where both men concede with visible cost ("something brittle grinding, like sand between teeth"). Closure is Earned Stasis—the negotiator admits justice has been "bartered for survivable disappointment," a renunciation with conceptual cost made legible on the page. The lens holds and the final image ("sky kept turning, unimpressed yet slightly less condemned") reweights prior material with undeniable pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The terrace stones "cracked, veined with grasses" and the low stone table "rounded by generations of bargaining palms" ground the ritual in tactile history. The three bowls (salt, ash, water) constrain the opening moves and charge the closure by making abstract stakes concrete. Sensory selection is purposeful: "crushed mint, dust, and the sharp memory of rain" anchor atmosphere, and torchlight "swallowing" the clipboard's surface mirrors the negotiator's internal compromise. Spatial choreography (barefoot envoy crossing threshold, touching knots) remains clear throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—interrupt killing via flawed compromise—is signaled early and tightens when the envoy asks, "You ask me to embrace the men who burned my village," forcing the negotiator's counter-choice: accept imperfect terms or condemn future villages. Agency is clear: the protagonist's offer of "survivable disappointment" forecloses purity and earns the envoy's signature. The cost is legible in "something brittle grinding, like sand between teeth" and the sky remaining "unimpressed yet slightly less condemned." No false reversals; pressure accumulates through ritual constraint and moral calculus.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme—justice bartered for survival—emerges from particulars: the negotiator's "sole remaining act of faith," the ritual bowls, the envoy's thread-counted dead, and the final image of flawed compromise under an indifferent sky. The line "not purity, but interruption of killing" offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture (touching knots, nodding) and the negotiator's internal admission of "private disgust." The piece resists tidy resolution: the sky "slightly less condemned" reweights prior material with conceptual cost. Minor deduction: "price of redemption" appears three times as a phrase, risking thematic echo, though each use ties to a distinct beat.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable, filtering all perception through the negotiator's weary professional lens. Diction is consistent and elevated without breaking character: "artillery still muttered like old gods," "civilians turned to shadows." The general's and envoy's voices carry distinct idiom in dialogue ("embrace the men who burned my village" versus the negotiator's measured bureaucratic cadence). Minor slip: "operatively gentle" appears twice identically across characters, risking voice convergence. Psychic distance modulates purposefully, tightening at the signing moment.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies effectively; sentence openings shift. Information density is high: most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "ebony clipboard...as though it were fragile armor" conveys prop, character state, and symbolic weight). Clear propulsion through the ritual sequence. Deductions: "operatively gentle" recurs as a template phrase (−0.3); "price of redemption" appears three times in similar phrasing, risking loop (−0.2); one paraphrase near the end ("those who died are beyond our reach; those unborn are entirely within it" echoes the prior framing without added pressure, −0.2). No filter-verb stacks or register drift. Figurative language is controlled and voice-consistent.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The frame—midsummer ceasefire ritual—offers a fresh angle on forever-war stalemate; the piece avoids stock peace-talk conventions by foregrounding ritual constraint and the negotiator's interior erosion. Particulars (thread-knotted ankles, bellmetal staff, moon cupped in water) anchor universals. The emotional truth—compromise as "survivable disappointment"—resists abstraction. Minor deduction: the core situation (exhausted negotiator, symbolic ritual, bitter compromise) echoes familiar templates; transformation is sufficient but not radical. The ending reweights prior material without retreat, earning solid originality.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The forever war peace negotiator is present throughout, drives the inciting speech ("We meet...not to erase the past"), offers the flawed compromise, and makes the final choice to demand forgiveness he "had no right to demand." His professional exhaustion and internal contradiction shape every beat. He constrains the ritual's opening and pays conceptual cost at closure ("something brittle grinding"). Setup, development, closure all present; irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The ebony clipboard appears in three beats: held "like fragile armor," laid on the stone table where its "dark surface swallow[s] the scattered torchlight," and read by the general and envoy. It carries the compromise document and symbolizes the negotiator's fragile authority. Setup and development present; closure participation is indirect (the signing happens on its pages, but the final image shifts to the sky). Functional but not indispensable; slightly elevated by the "swallowing torchlight" detail that mirrors thematic surrender.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"The price of redemption" is named three times and structures the stakes: clauses "weighed like coins, careful estimates of the price of redemption," the negotiator's internal calculus ("the price of redemption he could offer: not purity, but interruption of killing"), and the thematic cost of signing. It shapes the protagonist's choice to accept "survivable disappointment" and charges the closure. Setup, development, closure present; causal pressure high. Minor deduction for near-repetition of the exact phrase risking label-only echo (−0.4).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Operatively gentle" appears twice: the general's voice is "operatively gentle by deliberate training," and the negotiator "wore a softer version of it like a too-heavy coat." It signals professional discipline and reappears in the negotiator's final reply ("His voice remained operatively gentle"). Setup and development present; closure participation weak (the trait is mentioned but does not visibly constrain the final choice). The repetition reads as template phrasing rather than evolving use. Functional but replaceable with "controlled" or "measured."</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Muster" appears once: the negotiator "mustered his sentences like cautious troops" before the pivotal speech. The verb seeds the military metaphor that runs through the piece and frames his rhetorical agency. Setup present; development and closure indirect (the speech sets up the compromise, but the verb itself does not recur or reweight). Solid causal role in one major beat, but swappable with "gathered" or "marshaled" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Ritual significance structures every beat: the piece opens with "negotiations were allowed to begin" during celestial alignment, the mayor's belief that "only through ritual significance...could warriors accept what reason alone could not," the three bowls (salt, ash, water) that all participants touch, the torches and bells, and the final staff-raising. The method shapes tactics (the negotiator must wait, speak first, obey the sequence) and charges the closure (signing becomes sacrament, not mere contract). Setup, development, closure all strong; irreplaceable mechanism.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The ancient terrace at midsummer is introduced in the opening line, grounds spatial choreography (cracked stones, low table, torches in rows), and the midsummer timing enables the ceasefire ("Each midsummer, fire from the front would pause"). The terrace's history (stones "rounded by generations of bargaining palms") and condition (cracks, grasses) supply texture and constrain movement. The setting's ritual function pressures the protagonist's choice (he must honor the form to gain legitimacy). Setup, development, closure present; strong causal and atmospheric work.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"During the slow dance of celestial bodies" frames when negotiations begin and returns in "the sky kept turning" at closure. The midsummer window enables the ceasefire. Setup and closure present; middle development weak (the clock does not tighten decisions beat-to-beat; the ritual unfolds at narrative pace without time pressure). The celestial metaphor charges the ending image ("unimpressed yet slightly less condemned") but does not function as a live ticking constraint. Lyric reprise lifts it into mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"To anchor ideals in practice, painstakingly" is named as the negotiator's profession and curse, dramatized in his choice to offer "not purity, but interruption of killing." The friction between ideals (justice) and practice (amnesty for burners) drives the climactic exchange and his internal admission of "private disgust." Setup, development, closure present; the cost is felt. Minor deduction: the motivation is partly told ("his sole remaining act of faith") rather than fully enacted through prior micro-choices (−0.3).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>"Flawed beauty" saturates the piece: the terrace's cracked stones and silver grasses, the general's scar tissue and polished eyes, the moon "in miniature" cupped in water, the negotiator's compromise as "survivable disappointment," and the sky "unimpressed yet slightly less condemned." The tone modulates with pressure (ritual solemnity to bitter internal calculus) and charges the final image. Setup, development, closure all present; the tone is coherent and irreplaceable, elevating thematic resonance without becoming ornamental.</comment>
