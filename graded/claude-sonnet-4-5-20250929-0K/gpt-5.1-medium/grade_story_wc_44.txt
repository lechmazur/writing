<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lysa's interiority is concrete and character-particular: "each worn stone memorized through years of fearful, reverent ascent" embodies her disciplined caution. Her motivation to understand the shadow-slip drives multiple micro-choices (smuggling charts, using the forbidden key, correcting the rune-phrase). Internal contradiction appears in her "quietly deliberate" rebellion—checking every curve despite defying her mentor—and the final realization opens her into "disciplined, terrifying freedom" with visible cost (she knows noon holds more night than midnight, foreclosing naïve scholarship). Minor: the emotional pivot at closure feels slightly summarized rather than fully embodied in contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with causal underpinning. Orientation anchors (Lysa, observatory, after spoons bent) arrive early. Escalation proceeds through because/therefore: she climbs without permission → places the key → turns it → shadows crawl into loops → she realizes shadows go "where meaning was unfinished." Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Conceptual Repricing hybrid): the final image—"noon held more night than midnight"—reweights the premise with conceptual cost (her scholarly certainty is overturned, "something in her opened…into a disciplined, terrifying freedom"). Cost is legible in the irreversible shift from reverent scholar to one who knows the world seals awakenings. One hairline slip: the cost could be more viscerally felt rather than intellectually summarized.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The floating-isle observatory is anchored early and constrains choice: Lysa climbs the spiral stair, the brass table holds the key socket, the dome opens to stars. The seven mirrored spoons—salvaged from the kitchen madness—are handled twice (laid out, then straightening to point inward) and charge the closure by showing shadows crawling from their reflections. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered: "hot metal and rain that had not yet fallen," "worn stone memorized." The observatory's nocturnal purpose (watching "what the sun erased") directly supports her investigation of noon shadows. Minor: spatial choreography of the lower hall automaton and the central table could be slightly tighter.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—finding where shadows go at noon—signals early and tightens through one meaningful turn: Lysa's decision to use the forbidden key despite months of fearful study. The rune-phrase correction under pressure narrows options (she whispers it "not as she had been taught, but corrected by her months of secret doubt"). Agency is clear: her rebellion and precision enable the awakening. Cost is visible in the final image: "something in her opened…into a disciplined, terrifying freedom," foreclosing her prior reverent safety. Escalation could be slightly sharper—more tactical resistance or immediate consequence would lift this into high-8s.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—sealed awakenings and the cost of forbidden knowledge—emerges organically from action: shadows slip "into the space between an opening and its answer," and the world seals these moments. The spoons, loops, and key recur purposefully, each reweighted at closure when shadows crawl from the white reflections. Lysa's arc is inextricable from theme: her mind "had been circling this question for years, afraid to complete its orbit. Now that it closed, something in her opened." The final line—"noon held more night than midnight"—offers a non-literal, resonant answer without moralizing. No thematic echo or label-speak. Subtext operates in her "quietly deliberate" defiance and the simulacrum's hidden purpose.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV, stable psychic distance with clean focalization through Lysa's perceptual signature: "steps were quietly deliberate," runes "prickled her skin," loops "flared to life…an orbit of stillness." Diction remains within her scholarly lexicon ("penumbra," "simulacrum," "sanctioned atlas") with purposeful compression in lyric passages. Syntax modulates with pressure: short declaratives during the key-turn, longer layered clauses during reflection. No head-hopping. Filter verbs ("saw," "realized") appear but are voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy. Minor: one or two filter constructions in the climax could be tightened for higher immediacy, but the perceptual texture is distinctive and controlled.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully: short sentences accelerate the key-turn ("Lysa turned the automaton key once, twice…"), longer ones during atmospheric setup. Information density is high—most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "quietly deliberate even in rebellion, checking every curve of sound, every pause, as if walking a cliff" conveys character, method, and stakes). No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Opening and closing lines anchor and resonate. Minor artifacts: "doubled and tripled, all of her afraid and expectant" leans slightly purple; "smelling of hot metal and rain that had not yet fallen" is vivid but borders on overwriting in density. "Loops flared to life…an orbit of stillness" is a near-oxymoron that succeeds but risks confusion. Cumulative figurative load in the climax is high but stays legible.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Premise—shadows vanish at noon into sealed conceptual loops—is fresh and grounded in specific world logic (bent spoons, rune-etched keys, brass observatories on floating isles). The "sealed awakenings" concept integrates organically with character (a scholar's forbidden inquiry) and setting (nocturnal observatory built to watch what the sun erases). The turn—shadows go "where meaning was unfinished"—grows from established particulars (the spoons, the loops, the corrected rune-phrase). Voice and imagery feel cohesive and non-generic. Minor: the floating-isle setting, while vivid, echoes familiar fantasy motifs; the transformation lies in the conceptual specificity of the loops and the discipline/freedom duality rather than world novelty alone.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lysa, budding rune scholar, drives three beats: climbing without permission (setup), placing and turning the key (middle choice under pressure), and realizing shadows go where meaning is unfinished (closure participation). Her months of secret study and correction of the rune-phrase are causally active. The final shift—"something in her opened…into a disciplined, terrifying freedom"—is specific to her scholarly identity and forecloses her prior reverent safety. Early signal, multi-beat involvement, causal pressure, closure linkage, and visible cost all present.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The clockwork automaton key is handled in three beats: mentioned as forbidden (setup), placed in the brass socket and turned twice (middle), and goes cold after the loops dim (closure frame). Its runes ("apertures in time") shape the stakes and enable the awakening. Lysa's months of tracing the runes and the mentor's prohibition create cost. The key is irreplaceable—its specific runes and gear-teeth matter—and its cooling signals the closure of the loop. Early signal, multi-beat, causal pressure, closure linkage, and high specificity.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Sealed awakenings" frames the stakes from the start: the archives say secrets grow restless in the broken moon's penumbra, the world "sealed those awakenings away," and Lysa's goal is to reach "moments the world folded its meanings inward." The concept shapes her tactics (using the key to close loops) and the closure revelation (she can reach them "only by closing loops that were never meant to meet"). It is thematically and causally active, but the mechanics are more implied than concretely demonstrated—score reflects strong thematic integration with moderate tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Quietly deliberate" appears as a trait label early ("steps were quietly deliberate") and is dramatized in action: "checking every curve of sound, every pause, as if walking a cliff" during the rune-phrase; "quietly deliberate even in rebellion." It constrains her method—precision under risk—and contrasts with the mentor's dismissal of her question as "childish." The trait charges the closure: her mind's orbit was "afraid to complete" until disciplined choice closed it. Visible tradeoff: her caution delays but ultimately enables the awakening. Early signal, multi-beat, cost tied to trait.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Relearn" is signaled early: "Lysa had spent months trying to relearn her craft around those runes, tracing them in secret. Every misdrawn line prickled her skin." The corrected rune-phrase—"not as she had been taught, but corrected by her months of secret doubt"—is the pivot that enables the awakening. It drives the middle and closure beats. The action is causally necessary and irreplaceable. Minor: the specific labor of relearning is summarized rather than shown in a distinct on-page beat, capping the score slightly below 8.0.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"By closing loops" is introduced early via the smuggled charts: "circles crossing circles…At the center of the final loop stood a tiny sketch of a key." The method shapes Lysa's tactics: she lays out the spoons and key to match the diagram, turns the key, and watches "loops flared to life…until the whole diagram spun without moving." The closure revelation hinges on it: "a mind could reach them only by closing loops that were never meant to meet…her own mind…had been circling…afraid to complete its orbit. Now that it closed, something in her opened." Early signal, multi-beat, causal and thematic pressure, closure centrality.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The nocturnal observatory on a floating isle anchors orientation early and supplies resources: the brass table with socket, the spiral stair, the opened dome, the pendulum clock that chimes "the hidden hour." The isle's drift into the broken moon's penumbra creates timing pressure ("the island had drifted into the penumbra…where the archives said secrets grew restless"). The setting's purpose—watching what the sun erases—directly supports Lysa's investigation. It appears in the final line ("the island drifted on"). Moderate causal pressure; stronger atmospheric and thematic integration than tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The timeframe "after spoons bend reality" signals the inciting trauma early and primes Lysa's three-year obsession. "It was three years after spoons bend reality…that Lysa first saw a shadow hesitate. At noon that day, every utensil had sagged sideways." This past event motivates her present action and the salvaged spoons become active props. The timeframe does not create a live ticking clock in the present scene, but it establishes causal history and reappears when the spoons straighten at closure. Setup and thematic payoff present; limited tactical pressure in real-time.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The motivation—"to find where shadows go at noon, and why they had slipped that day"—is introduced early as "a question riding her like a quiet storm" and drives every choice: smuggling charts, climbing alone, using the forbidden key. The mentor's dismissal ("childish, a superstition") creates friction. Closure delivers the answer: shadows go "where meaning was unfinished, into the space between an opening and its answer." The revelation carries cost: "something in her opened…into a disciplined, terrifying freedom." Early signal, multi-beat, causal and thematic drive, closure payoff with felt cost.</comment>
