<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Rian's interiority is vivid and particular—"memories that never belonged to me," the phantom aches of Mara's road—with embodied emotion throughout (brass-bone hand creaking, body remembering gravel). The central choice to lie ("Yes, I lie") and map a route toward "space for ghosts" is earned by the accumulation of loss and the censer foot's charged presence. Minor friction: Mara remains offstage, reducing relational crucible pressure, and the final renunciation feels slightly abstract despite strong sensory grounding. The protagonist's navigation of grief through deliberate cartographic solace carries visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors quickly (signal station, hydraulics failed, midnight call). Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density rises through layered imagery (station settling, moon phases, reverse migration) and culminates in a Resonant Reconfiguration where Rian knowingly builds a false map ("I lie") to offer solace, forecloses honest cartography, and stakes the cost on shared imagining. The closure image—"where losing began, and maybe...where it can soften"—reweights the premise with visible emotional cost. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length; the final act charges prior material without requiring multiple reversals.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The signal station's failing hydraulics, dead lights, moon-dependent phosphorescence, and the patina bronze censer foot all constrain Rian's charting work and charge the final image. The censer foot anchors Mara's past and narrows Rian's signals "through the metal into my bones," directly enabling the map-drawing choice. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (salt flats, iron taste, gravel underfoot). The station itself pressures the midnight work: analog consoles, humming landline, and starlight through ceiling cracks are integral to the closure beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—navigating Mara home through loss—is signaled early and tightens when Rian realizes the chapel is gone yet chooses to lie and provide "raw solace." The escalation is driven by Rian's agency: the decision to draw imaginary roads and offer a false map forecloses honest cartography with visible cost ("sometimes raw solace is all that keeps a person moving"). Under the Accumulative lens, the pressure accumulates through layered memory and reversed migration until the final line reweights options. One meaningful tightening suffices; the cost is legible on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: reverse migration as return to ruin, the ethics of merciful lies, and maps as both truth and solace. The censer foot's shift from salvaged relic to constellation tool and the final image—"where losing began, and maybe...where it can soften"—offer a resonant, non-literal answer without stating a moral. Subtext operates in Rian's lie and the acknowledgment that "there will be no chapel" yet the map holds. No thematic echo or prompt language; the ending reweights prior material with undeniable pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable and richly textured: "patchwork navigator...stitched together from borrowed charts," "body does, in phantom aches," "geography of loss." Perceptual signature is consistent—navigation, cartography, metal and bone—and modulates under pressure ("Almost...will have to be enough"). The lie at climax reads naturally within established voice. Minor friction: a few elevated phrases ("buoys we drop over trenches we refuse to measure") brush against register but remain voice-motivated. No head-hopping; distance control is clean throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; figurative language is dense but mostly coherent ("cables droop like tired veins," "moon...steadies the trembling maps"). Information density is high with minimal scaffold. Friction: some metaphors edge toward overwriting ("voice...blurred at the edges, as if crossing an ocean of static"; "buoys...over trenches") and a few runs risk template cadence ("I do not remember, but my body does"; "We call it...but names are..."). The closure beat remains clear. No paraphrase loops or filter-verb stacks that dull immediacy; propulsion holds.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The synthesis—signal-station cartography, reverse migration, and the ethics of mapmaking as solace—feels specific and non-obvious. The "patchwork navigator" frame and censer-foot anchor avoid generic template plots. Emotional calculus (lying to offer comfort) is grounded in lived detail. Minor friction: the reverse-migration premise risks abstraction without fuller dramatization of Mara's journey or on-page stakes beyond the phone call. Risk-taking in voice and accumulative structure heightens stakes; the piece commits fully to its lyric design without retreating to plot convenience.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Rian appears throughout, handles the censer foot, draws the map, and makes the pivotal choice to lie—altering tactics from honest cartography to merciful fiction. Present in setup, development, and closure; drives at least two beats (receiving the call, drawing the false map). Causal pressure is strong; the final stance crystallizes around this character's agency with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The censer foot is salvaged early, handled mid-story ("When I cup it in my palm...threads gathering through the metal into my bones"), placed on the map to narrow signals, and catches starlight at the closure beat—"turning its corrosion into something almost holy." Present in setup, development, and payoff; constrains the charting work and charges the final image. Irreplaceability is high; its specific properties (patina, lion shape, chapel origin) matter. Cost connection is visible.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Reverse migration frames the premise ("people streaming back toward their ruins") and shapes Mara's path from refuge to skeleton district. It constrains Rian's task: charting a return journey through wreckage. Present in setup and development; the final image ("where losing began...where it can soften") ties directly to this concept. Two beats involved; causal pressure moderate. Not quite indispensable—story logic could survive with a different migration frame—but it reweights the closure meaningfully.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Moon phases are mentioned early ("When the moon is thin, I can barely hold a coordinate") and at closure ("the moon, almost full, steadies the trembling maps"). Constrains Rian's cartographic ability with visible cost. Present in setup and payoff; charges the final image. Development beat is thin—no mid-story action turns on moon state. Two touches across separate beats; lyric reprise reweights the stake. Specificity moderate; a near-synonym constraint could replace it with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"Build" is named explicitly ("tonight I will build through cryptic phone calls"), enacted on-page (drawing the map, piecing together Mara's path, "building a passage through the wreckage, plank by plank"), and frames the closure ("if my lines hold"). Present in setup, development, and payoff; drives at least three beats. Major turns trace to this action; removing it would break story logic. Causal pressure is high; cost connection visible.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Cryptic phone calls at midnight are signaled early ("At midnight exactly, the landline rings"), the conversation shapes the entire middle section (Mara's fragmented path), and the method is integral to the closure beat (Rian lies into "the cold mouthpiece"). Present in all three gates; mechanics matter—Mara's voice guides the map, and the lie depends on the call's medium. Two to three beats involved; causal pressure solid. Swappability moderate—another remote method could substitute, lowering irreplaceability slightly.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The signal station is present throughout: hydraulics fail, antennae shiver, analog consoles and landline enable the work, ceiling phosphorescence fluctuates, and the station "bears us" at closure. Supplies resources (censer foot shelf, map table, landline) that enable the charting choice. Present in setup, development, and payoff; constrains and enables at least two beats. Spatial choreography is clear; the setting pressures the midnight work and charges the final image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"After the hydraulics fail" frames the premise; the timeframe creates urgency (station settling, power killed, only analog tools remain). The failure constrains Rian's resources and tightens the midnight window. Present in setup; implicit in development (the call happens because analog remains); echoed at closure ("hydraulics may have failed, but the mountain still bears us"). Two beats involved; causal pressure moderate. Not a live clock that visibly alters moves beat-by-beat, limiting upper range.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The desire to "navigate the geography of loss" is dramatized throughout: Rian's phantom aches, the task of charting Mara's path, the choice to lie and build solace despite knowing the chapel is gone. Conflicted in action—honesty versus mercy—and the final lines stake the cost ("if my lines hold...where losing began...where it can soften"). Present in setup, development, and closure; friction between wants and costs is visible. Not merely told; drives at least three beats with clear causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>"Raw solace" is embodied throughout: Rian's patchwork body, the censer foot's greened metal "almost holy," the deliberate lie to offer comfort, and the closing acknowledgment of "space for ghosts" and softened loss. Tone modulates with pressure—from mechanical creaking to phantom aches to the final, quieter acceptance. Coherent through turns; charges the final image without stating a moral. Present in setup, development, and payoff; reweights the dominant stake with undeniable pressure.</comment>
