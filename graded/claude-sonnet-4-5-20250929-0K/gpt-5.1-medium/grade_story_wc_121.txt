<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lio's interiority is vivid and embodied through concrete physical sensations (floating, tablet pressing into forehead), but the emotional arc relies heavily on summary ("it felt as if a dozen fractured timelines scraped") rather than moment-by-moment contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final choice to release the tablet carries visible cost (letting go of the guide), yet the preceding corridor sequence—where he "remade" past choices—reads as exposition of internal process rather than dramatized struggle with trade-offs. Motivation is clear and intensifies, but the lack of on-page micro-choices with competing pulls in the peak beats keeps this from reaching higher bands.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes a clear conceptual lens (accumulative/textural with situational pressure) by the tablet introduction and holds it through the corridor maze to the final image. Orientation is prompt (viaduct, Lio, post-rain) within the first 120 words. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (release of the tablet after retracing past selves) with visible cost: gravity returns incrementally, the maze simplifies, and he surrenders the map. The maze sequence, however, summarizes key turns ("he stepped into the first room… listening instead of performing") rather than dramatizing even one full choice with friction, which weakens the felt texture of the closure's earned quality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The viaduct setting is particularized (slick stone, neon reflections, drains whispering) and recurs at both opening and closure, charging the final image when Lio emerges "just as the drops began to fall again." The tablet's physicality (clay, runes casting shadows, refusing rain) actively constrains handling and choice. Spatial choreography is clean through the corridor maze, though the maze itself remains abstract. The recurring water imagery (drop/ripple, beaded rain, dripping return) modulates from suspension to release and directly supports the timeframe element, meeting the micro-setting standard for this length.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—conquering the labyrinth of self by bearing witness to fractured timelines—is signaled early and tightens once when Lio steps off the railing into the corridor maze. That turn narrows options (he cannot float away; he must retrace). The corridor sequence, however, lists alternate selves in rapid summary rather than dramatizing even one full decision with visible friction or trade-off on the page. The final act (releasing the tablet, gravity returning) carries legible cost and forecloses the path of endless procedural iteration, but the escalation itself relies on told consequence rather than shown pressure, capping the score below 7.5.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—that self-integration requires witnessing, not erasing, alternate lives—emerges through concrete particulars (the tablet, corridor doors, gravity's return) without overt moralizing. The tablet's release offers a resonant, non-literal answer: the map is no longer needed once the maze simplifies. The story resists tidy resolution (Lio does not "win" but accepts gravity and singularity). However, the line "he understood then that conquering the labyrinth of self did not mean erasing his other lives, but bearing witness to them" edges toward stating the thesis rather than letting the image alone carry it, preventing entry into the 8+ band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with a consistent perceptual signature (Lio's floating motions, the physicality of the tablet, sensory specificity). Diction remains controlled and voice-motivated throughout, with no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during the visions, slightly wider during the corridor traversal). The piece teaches its compressed, lyric cadence early and sustains it. One minor slip: "The runes described a universe that iterated him endlessly through procedural generation" briefly shifts into explanatory register rather than staying in Lio's experiential frame, but the effect is minimal and does not touch closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose is rhythmically controlled with varied sentence openings and high information density (most lines advance image, action, or stakes). No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs. Figurative language is purposeful and consistent (drop/ripple, shattering futures, tablet as coals). The opening and closing lines anchor and release cleanly. Minor density slip: "The tablet, they had told him, was a map of his possible lives, encoded not in symbols but in algorithms" relies on off-stage exposition where a perceptual cue (tablet's hum, rune behavior) could have implied the encoding without the "they had told him" scaffold. No artifacts touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The premise (gravity defier with a procedurally generated timeline map) synthesizes speculative and mythic elements in a fresh combination, and the viaduct-as-liminal-space feels specific. The emotional question (how to live with infinite selves) is transformed through the corridor retrace rather than a standard multiverse battle. However, the "procedural generation" framing and the maze-of-doors structure echo familiar portal-fantasy and game-design metaphors without a fully distinct angle. The ending's choice (releasing the tablet to accept singularity) feels earned but not surprising; the story executes its premise cleanly rather than transforming it into something unforeseen.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lio (gravity defier) drives the inciting choice (lifting the tablet, stepping sideways into the seam), the corridor traversal (entering rooms to remake choices), and the closure act (releasing the tablet). His gravity-defying trait enables the sideways step and returns incrementally as the maze simplifies, directly shaping tactics and cost. Present in all three integration gates with causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The ancient clay tablet with runes appears in beat one (drawn from coat, runes casting shadows, refusing rain), is actively handled in beat two (lifted to forehead, visions triggered), hums and warms during the corridor sequence, and is released in the final beat to complete closure. The tablet's refusal of rain and warming-as-coals texture provide irreplaceable specificity. Its release forecloses the infinite-iteration path with visible cost. All three gates met with strong causal and closure work.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Fractured timelines are introduced early (tablet as map, visions of alternate selves), constrain the middle action (corridor doors each hold a frozen alternate self), and the final simplification (fewer doors, gravity returning) marks the convergence. The concept shapes the dominant stake and the closure image. However, the timelines themselves are mostly summary-described rather than dramatized as live options with friction, keeping this below 8.0.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Periodically eternal" is illustrated in the opening (Lio falls and drifts upward as a pendulum), but the trait does not constrain a middle choice or return with reweighted meaning at closure. It functions as atmospheric texture rather than causal pressure. Setup gate met; development and payoff gates missed.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Retrace" is signaled midway ("To conquer the labyrinth… retrace the turns those lives had taken"), drives the corridor sequence (stepping into rooms to remake past choices), and the final simplification (fewer doors, maze tightening) follows from it. The action is causally necessary and shapes the ending. However, the retrace itself is summary-told rather than shown in one full dramatized beat, preventing 8+ entry.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Through procedural generation" is introduced with the tablet ("algorithms," "testing new selves like random seeds") and recurs in the corridor description ("conjuring… through procedural generation"). The method provides conceptual framework but does not constrain tactics on the page—Lio's choices in the maze are not shaped by procedural mechanics, only by the existence of the doors. Setup and thematic presence met; middle development gate weak.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The glowing viaduct after rain anchors the opening (slick stone, neon reflections, water whispers), provides the literal threshold (Lio steps off the railing into the seam), and returns in the closure beat (emerges onto the viaduct as drops fall again). The setting's liminal, post-rain state charges both the inciting moment and the final image. Water drops as lenses and the drains' sound provide micro-setting that supports the timeframe element. All three gates met with strong closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Between the drop and the ripple" is introduced early as the temporal hinge, recurs when Lio steps sideways into the seam, and the final beat resolves it ("just as the drops began to fall again, the first ripples finally spreading"). The timeframe provides conceptual pressure and charges the closure image. However, it functions more as poetic motif than live clock that alters tactics beat-by-beat.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"To conquer the labyrinth of self" is stated early and drives all major actions: lifting the tablet, stepping into the seam, entering corridor rooms, and releasing the tablet. The realization midway ("he would have to retrace… not erasing… but bearing witness") shifts tactics and the final release enacts the cost. Desire is dramatized through physical choices with friction (forehead pressure, stepping into rooms, letting the tablet slide). All three gates met with strong causal work and closure cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"Darkening brightness" is established in the opening ("brightness… already darkening, shadows thickening") and modulates through the piece: the viaduct dims as he enters the seam, corridors shift and collapse, and the final emergence occurs "just as the drops began to fall again." The tone charges the final image (release into renewed rain and gravity) and remains coherent through turns without static repetition. Strong closure linkage and purposeful modulation across beats.</comment>
