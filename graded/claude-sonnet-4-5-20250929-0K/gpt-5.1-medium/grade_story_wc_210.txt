<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The alchemist's interior life is richly textured—his rejection of false comfort drives on-page choices (refusing simple revival, scraping rust, conceiving new patterns). Embodied contradictions appear: he keeps the wish "like a shard lodged under the tongue" yet uses that enhanced working memory to circle problems. The final stance—reimagining civilization rather than restoring it—is earned through prior reflection and micro-choices. Minor slip: the townspeople's exodus and his isolation are told rather than shown in a pivotal beat, slightly weakening the stakes' felt weight.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the bottle warms when his diagrams cohere, he understands its true test, and footsteps sound—options crystallize with conceptual cost (abandoning certainty, accepting fallibility). Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—density builds through layered reflection, pattern-making, and the bottle's symbolic weight until the cadence shifts at the ending image. Orientation anchors (alchemist, workshop, post-wish cove) arrive early. One tightening: from studying the bottle to conceiving civilization-scale redesign. The cost is legible in his acceptance that designs "offered no guarantees." Mild penalty: much of the middle is reflective summary rather than beats that narrow options through concrete試み.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Paper-lantern cove is vividly particular: lanterns "speckled with dead moths and flaking salt," boats "knocking softly like teeth," amber bottle fracturing light into hexagons. The bottle itself functions as micro-setting, constraining the alchemist's attempts (force, flame, thought all fail) and charging the final image when it warms. Sensory detail is filtered through his craftsman's eye. The cove's emptiness subtly mirrors his isolation and frames the return at the end. Minor gap: the workshop interior and pier remain somewhat abstract; we lack concrete anchors for his movements between them.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early: what purpose does an alchemist serve in a ghost town, and can the town return without repeating its ruin? One meaningful deepening: from "how to open the bottle" to "how to let the town enter without dragging old habits." Agency is renunciation and design—he rejects simple restoration and charts new patterns with visible cost (accepting fallibility, no guarantees). The bottle's warming and returning footsteps provide consequence. Under Accumulative lens, pressure coheres through escalating reflective density. Penalty: much escalation occurs in thought rather than confrontation with a material obstacle, so the tightening feels more cerebral than urgent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: the unopenable bottle as boundary between "what had been possible and what might yet be," shared workshops versus locked attics, rituals to remind people of fallibility. The alchemist's final realization—that the bottle tests whether he can imagine a vessel "sealed against the poisons of certainty and despair alike"—reweights prior material without stating a moral. Subtext operates in the townspeople's refusal to look back, the wish-giver's silence, and the amber bottle's warming. No thematic echo in the final paragraph; the footsteps provide resonance. The piece avoids platitudes and embraces complexity (no guarantees, only harder-to-hide illusions).</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited with stable, controlled distance throughout. The alchemist's perceptual signature is craft-specific: he "rejects rust… scraping it off before it spreads," sees symbols and patterns, notices hexagons in reflected light. Diction is elevated yet consistent—"capacity to hold entire patterns," "boundary between what had been possible"—matching a contemplative practitioner. Reflection anchors to present stimuli (bottle, lanterns, empty houses) and alters stance on the page. Rhythmic control: longer, layered sentences in reflection, shorter declaratives at key turns ("That was enough"). No head-hopping. Minor texture slip: a few stems repeat ("He had," "The bottle") without clear pattern-teaching.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense and purposeful with strong figurative control: "boats slept on the black water, hulls knocking softly like teeth," "working memory like pieces on a board," grief that "turned glass cloudy and calculations vague." Information density is high—most lines advance character, atmosphere, or stakes. Sentence openings vary; rhythm modulates. Minor deductions: paraphrase loop in the middle third (the bottle's resistance to opening is restated across multiple adjacent lines without new pressure) and a few filter-verb stacks ("he had learned," "he had asked," "he had trained") that slightly dull immediacy. No loops touch the closure beat. Grammar and sequencing are clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The amber bottle with no opening is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis—functioning as both literal puzzle and conceptual test. The wish-giver as "machine of brass and void" and working memory as a granted power avoid fantasy cliché through specificity. The premise (alchemist alone in post-wish ghost town, reimagining civilization from ruins) transforms familiar tropes via the particularized world logic and moral calculus (no guarantees, designs to prevent hiding in illusions). The ending's move—bottle never meant to open in the ordinary sense—feels earned in hindsight. Risk: heavy reflection and cerebral escalation could flatten momentum, yet the piece commits fully to its contemplative stance. Slight derivative shadow: solitary craftsman redesigning society from ruins echoes utopian fable templates, but the alchemist's rejection of certainty and acceptance of fallibility differentiate it.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Alchemist present throughout; his choices create all key turns: rejecting false comfort (refusal to pretend town is sleeping), deciding the problem is not how to open but how to let the town enter without old habits, conceiving and charting new civilization patterns, understanding the bottle's true test. These decisions alter tactics from physical attempts on the bottle to redesigning social structures, and they shape the closure (bottle warms, footsteps return). Early signal, middle development through multiple reflection beats, and closure payoff all present. Cost: accepting no guarantees, designing against certainty. High integration with visible causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Amber bottle appears in setup (found morning townspeople left), constrains middle attempts (no opening to force/flame/thought; thickens when focused on), and shapes closure (warms when diagrams cohere, signals understanding). Handled across at least three beats; its properties (cloudiness, hexagonal reflections, warming) are specific and irreplaceable. The bottle's shift from object to conceptual vessel ("test whether he could imagine a vessel… sealed against poisons") reweights prior material. Strong causal role: the bottle's resistance drives the alchemist's pivot from physical to conceptual problem. High integration, indispensable to story logic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Ghost town revival is the explicit stake ("what purpose does an alchemist serve in a ghost town") and the alchemist rejects simple revival ("seemed to him another kind of lie"), shaping his tactics: he reimagines rather than restores. The concept pressures the middle design work and motivates the closure (townspeople return to a reimagined framework). It appears early, drives the protagonist's core choice, and frames the ending. Cost: abandoning restoration certainty. Solid integration across setup, development, and payoff, with clear causal pressure, though the revival itself occurs off-page (footsteps sound but the outcome remains open).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Attribute "rejects false comfort" constrains on-page actions: he refuses to pretend the town is sleeping, rejects simple restoration ("another kind of lie"), scrapes rust before it spreads, and designs systems that make it "harder to hide within comforting illusions." This rejection drives his pivot from opening the bottle to reimagining civilization. Visible tradeoff: he accepts uncertainty and fallibility instead of guarantees. The trait appears early, shapes middle tactics, and charges the closure understanding. Good causal integration with felt cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Action "conceive" is the major turn: "he began to conceive a different sort of experiment… whose subject was… an entire pattern of living." This pivot redefines the problem from bottle-opening to civilization-redesign, drives all subsequent on-page work (charting diagrams, overlaying possibilities, designing communal structures), and enables the closure (bottle warms when diagrams hold). The action appears explicitly and its execution occupies the story's second half. Specific and irreplaceable: swapping "conceive" would require structural rewrite. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Method "through working memory" is signaled early (wish granted him "capacity to hold entire patterns… working memory") and the alchemist "trained himself to move symbols, scents, and histories through working memory like pieces on a board, circling problems until they opened." It enables his middle tactics (holding overlays of town designs in mind) and implicitly shapes the closure (diagrams cohere in his mind before the bottle warms). Two-beat involvement; causal enabler. Penalty: the mechanics remain abstract—how working memory differs from ordinary thought is not dramatized, so the method feels more label than constraint. Mid-band integration.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Paper-lantern cove is established early with vivid detail (lanterns, boats, shuttered houses, pier with dangling ropes) and its emptiness pressures the alchemist's stake ("ghost town without ghosts"). The workshop provides spatial grounding for his work. The setting supplies the amber bottle (found on the pier) and frames the closure (footsteps on the pier signal return). Solid setup and payoff. Penalty: the cove functions more as atmospheric backdrop than active constraint—the environment does not alter his middle tactics or force specific choices. Good integration but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Timeframe "after the last wish is granted" anchors the story's present and explains the town's desertion. It sets the story post-crisis, shaping the alchemist's isolation and stakes. The temporal framing appears in the opening and the alchemist's memory of his last wish returns in reflection. Closure references the wish-giver going dark "that night." Functional across setup and thematic reflection. Penalty: "after" is a static backdrop rather than a ticking clock—time does not tighten or narrow his decisions in the present action. The frame enables but does not pressure. Mid-band integration.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation "to reimagine an entire civilization" is stated explicitly ("The only motive that stirred him now") and dramatized through on-page choices: clearing his bench, charting the town, overlaying new possibilities (communal gardens, shared workshops, rotating councils), and designing systems against certainty. Friction between wants and costs appears: he accepts "no guarantees" and designs that only make it "harder to hide." The motive drives the middle beats and shapes closure (diagrams cohere, bottle warms, footsteps return as potential validation). Strong integration with visible cost and causal pressure across multiple beats.</comment>
