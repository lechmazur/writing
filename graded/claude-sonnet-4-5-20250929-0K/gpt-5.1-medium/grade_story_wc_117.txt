<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's interior is embodied through concrete anchors—the locked drawer, the guitar tuning ritual—and her professional stance is tested when she must balance residents' unease against her "cautious exuberance." The final beat earns its shift: grief and gratitude "twine instead of clash" because the eclipse moment dramatizes her ability to hold contradiction. Mr. Alvarez and Lake are lightly sketched but serve immediate pressure (his stroke-taken speech, her detox context). Minor slip: Mara's epiphany ("this, too, was ordinary magic she could share") edges toward label-speak, though the keepsake curl image grounds it.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through sensory density (sage, pine, dimming light) and the eclipse as shared event, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (the curl's return reweights Mara's grief without reversing it). Orientation anchors early (Sage Ridge rehab, sunrise routine, eclipse morning). The cost is visible: Mara's memory "did not lance but open," a felt shift that forecloses her old avoidance. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length, and the closure image (the ring of fire mirroring the curl) lands with thematic weight.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Setting is filtered through Mara's professional lens (wheelchairs in rows, oxygen tubing "like a halo") and the courtyard eclipse staging gives spatial coherence. The ash tree and flagstones anchor the climax, and the dimming light constrains perception ("shadows sharpening like ink"). The keepsake drawer functions as micro-setting, charging the final image. Idiom is consistent (rehab vernacular, "controlled exposure"). Minor: Sage Ridge itself remains a label; the ridge doesn't pressure a choice beyond atmosphere.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: Mara aims to transform residents' unease into shared wonder during the eclipse, risking that "wonder could tip into fear." The courtyard gathering forces a public test; she stops playing to let silence hold, a micro-choice that deepens pressure. Lake reaching for Mr. Alvarez's hand and Mara's exhale mark the tightening; the final image (the curl seen in the ring of fire) reweights the stake with felt cost. One meaningful turn suffices under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme (grief as openable rather than lancing; ordinary magic in shared witness) emerges from the eclipse's physical particulars and the curl's return without thesis statement. The final image—grief and gratitude twining—answers Mara's caution with embodied synthesis. Subtext operates in Mr. Alvarez's two-tap acknowledgment and Lake's whispered prayer. The concept ("ordinary magic") risks prompt echo but is anchored in concrete objects (the curl, the viewers, the ash tree). The ending avoids moralizing; the resonance is earned through the dimming light and the residents' breath.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited through Mara; distance modulates purposefully (close on the drawer ritual, wider on the courtyard assembly). Perceptual signature is selective: she notices "oxygen tubing looping around his ears like a halo" and translates "brisk instructions into jokes and hummed cues." Diction is controlled, though "softly adaptive" repeats as a label. Minor dialogue (Lake's swearing, Mr. Alvarez's non-verbal tap) serves subtext. One phrase—"beneath the hush of dreaming roots"—drifts into elevated register mid-beat without clear voice anchor, a brief but noticeable slip.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and sensory detail is vivid ("Light slanted through blinds in narrow ladders"). Information density is high in the eclipse beat. However, pervasive figurative language in non-peak moments ("a traveling nest," "bright, impatient eyes," "translating...into jokes and hummed cues") accumulates without pattern-teaching or payoff, risking overwriting (−0.5). "Softly adaptive" recurs as scaffold (three uses across beats without functional distinction, −0.2 paraphrase-loop). No major clarity breaks, but the density slows momentum in the setup third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The eclipse-as-therapy frame is familiar (music therapist uses cosmic event to unlock emotion), but the curl's return and the non-verbal exchange (Mr. Alvarez's spiral sketch, Lake's hand-clasp) add specificity. The piece commits to its premise and the ending image (curl in the ring of fire) is earned in hindsight. However, the transformation test is borderline: swap eclipse for meteor shower or rare bloom and the emotional arc holds with minor edits. Risk is modest; the piece executes competently within a recognizable template without bold structural or perspectival leaps.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Mara's choices drive key beats: she plans the eclipse gathering (setup), adjusts cardboard frames and stops playing to let silence hold (middle), and her final exhale/"ordinary magic she could share" realization charges the closure. Present across all three gates with causal pressure at the climax.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The curl appears in the opening drawer ritual (setup) and returns in the climax when Mara sees "the soft swirl of her daughter's lost hair" in the ring of fire (closure). Two beats with reweighted meaning, but no middle development; the middle of the story proceeds without the curl constraining or enabling a choice. Strong lyric reprise, but the gap between first and final mention limits integration.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Ordinary magic" is named early ("daily objects carried quiet power") and revisited at closure ("this, too, was ordinary magic she could share"). It frames Mara's motivation but remains abstract; the concept doesn't alter tactics on the page—she would gather residents and use music whether or not she labeled it "ordinary magic." Present in two beats (setup, closure) but functions more as thematic label than causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Softly adaptive" is mentioned three times (playlist description, translating nurse instructions, general characterization) but never constrains a choice with visible cost. The trait is told rather than dramatized through a trade-off; Mara adapts smoothly without friction. Label-only use across beats without on-page consequence.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Link" (as action) structures the story: Mara plans "a shared moment during a solar eclipse that might link sky and self," executes the courtyard gathering, and the final image completes the linkage (residents' breath, Lake and Alvarez's hands, Mara's grief twining with gratitude). Present in setup, middle (the gathering and silence), and closure. The action is specific to the eclipse mechanic and shapes all major turns.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The eclipse is signaled in the opening paragraph, its mechanics matter throughout (the dimming light, the viewers, the timing pressure), and it provides the final image (the ring of fire). The shared moment drives Mara's plan, the courtyard staging, and the silence that lets the residents hold their breath together. Indispensable; without the eclipse, the closure image and communal witness collapse.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Sage Ridge anchors the setting early and the southern slope's "pine and sage" scent recurs, but the ridge itself doesn't pressure a choice. The courtyard (ash tree, flagstones) provides the eclipse staging and the dimming light alters perception, which is functional. Present in setup and used at closure, but the ridge proper remains atmospheric rather than tactical.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Beneath the hush of dreaming roots" appears once, mid-eclipse, as a poetic image rather than a timeframe. It evokes depth but doesn't track elapsed time or tighten decisions. The phrase is present but ornamental; no causal pressure or clock that alters tactics. Missing setup and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Mara's desire "to nurture lifelong wonder" is stated early and tested when she must balance residents' anxiety against her plan. The courtyard gathering dramatizes the motivation, and the final image ("ordinary magic she could share") completes it. Present in setup and closure with middle friction (the staff's safety argument, residents' restlessness). However, the want doesn't conflict with a competing need or fear on the page; the cost is modest.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Cautious exuberance" is named early ("a tug between their unease and her own cautious exuberance") and modulates across beats: guarded planning, careful courtyard staging, then the exhale that resolves caution into gratitude. The tone is consistent, charges the final image, and reflects Mara's emotional arc. Present in setup, middle, and closure with coherent pressure.</comment>
