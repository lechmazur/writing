<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lina's interior motivation is clear and specific—teaching dust to tell stories through patient listening and copying—and her occupational traits (copyist's accuracy, listening between notes) drive micro-choices throughout. The boy's arrival feels embodied rather than convenient, and his dust-smeared boots create a small visual reversal that validates her work. Interiority occasionally tips into label-speak ("secretly luminous" hope) and the boy's fear/hope is more asserted than shown, preventing entry to the 8.5+ band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The piece infers an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure gathers through layered images (ash, dial glow, dust mixture instructions) and the boy's arrival crystallizes a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—Lina's solitary experiment becomes witnessed, collective work. Orientation anchors clearly by line 2 (hill, alcove, Lina). The closure lands with felt cost: her secrecy yields to shared risk. One structural friction: the pirate broadcast's instructions (grind charcoal, cloak with spit) feel ornamental rather than causally tested on the page, slightly softening escalation linkage.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The ember alcove, ash drift, and dial glow constrain choices throughout—electric lamps are avoided because they "felt official, monitored," and mist presses the space into an island. The boy's dust-covered boots provide micro-setting evidence that the mixture is working, directly charging the closure. Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through Lina's copyist attention. The alcove's former function (tram garage) adds texture without slowing momentum.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—teaching dust to remember stories—is signaled early and accumulates through the broadcast instructions and Lina's copying under pressure. The boy's arrival tightens by converting solitary conspiracy into shared witness, foreclosing isolation with the cost of exposure. One escalation gap: the pirate warning ("someone is coming") prompts Lina to hide pages, but the boy's entrance dissolves threat instantly without tactical friction, softening the turn's bite.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: accuracy shelters revolutions, dust can carry memory, stories survive through witnesses. The final image—two figures leaning into "thistled calm"—offers a non-literal answer to the famine problem without stating a moral. The "secretly luminous" hope and dial-as-metaphor risk overt symbolism, but the broadcast's method (elusive lyrics, suspended chords as subtext) grounds abstraction in Lina's trained ear. No late-paragraph moralizing; resonance is earned through prior images.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited through Lina's copyist perceptions: she hears "wrong strokes ring false," notices the boy's dust shimmer, and filters setting through her trained attention. Diction is controlled and voice-specific ("thistled calm," "cloaked the mixture with spit"). The boy's whispered line ("I heard the singing all the way down on River Street") reads natural and goal-driven. One minor slip: "secretly luminous" in Lina's interiority feels slightly elevated for peak-pressure thought, though it mirrors the established "dial glow" motif.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully and figurative language is dense but mostly coherent ("stories nudging at his outline," "thistled calm"). Information density is high; sentences advance character, atmosphere, and stakes. Two frictions lower the score: paraphrase loops appear ("Lina listened not for comfort, but for instruction" followed immediately by why she listens again), and "secretly luminous" recurs as a template modifier (dial, hope) without evolving meaning. The overwriting does not obscure closure but adds decorative weight in mid-beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The synthesis—pirate broadcasts teaching a copyist to encode memory in urban dust through musical notation—is specific and non-obvious. The premise transforms "information wants to be free" into a textured, post-famine resistance tale grounded in Lina's occupational skills. Risk-taking in the accumulative structure and lyric compression heightens stakes without gimmickry. One derivative note: the oppressive-regime-plus-underground-broadcast frame is widely used; transformation through the dust-teaching method and copyist lens restores freshness but does not fully escape the template shadow.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lina's copyist training drives key choices: she checks letters against melody, cloaks pirate ink with symphonies, and writes fast to preserve elusive lyrics. Her occupational accuracy is explicitly tied to sheltering revolutions. She appears in all three gates (setup, middle instruction-copying, closure witness scene) and her decision to include the boy constitutes the final turn. Swappability is low—remove "copyist" and the checking/cloaking/notation mechanics collapse.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The dial glow anchors three distinct beats: trusted light source in setup, "secretly luminous green" wash during instruction copying, and the boy's eyes reflecting "that secret green" at closure, validating shared conspiracy. It constrains choice (Lina turns volume down when the boy approaches) and charges the ending image. The glow's color and secrecy are causally active, not ornamental. Specificity is high; a generic "radio light" would lack the covert, trust-laden charge.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The pirate broadcast frames the entire middle section: it delivers dust-teaching instructions that Lina copies and tests. It appears in setup (tuned by instinct), drives the middle beat (grind charcoal, cloak with spit/laughter), and issues the warning that triggers Lina's page-hiding. The boy's arrival demonstrates its reach ("I heard the singing"). One friction: the broadcast's mechanics (how it evades monitoring, who transmits) remain abstract; we see its effects but not its cost or vulnerability, slightly limiting irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Secretly luminous" appears three times: dial glow (setup), Lina's hope (middle reflection), and implicitly in the boy's outline shimmer (closure). It labels the covert, fragile quality of resistance rather than constraining action. The boy's dust shimmer hints at the attribute's physical manifestation, but the connection is narrated ("as if stories were already nudging") rather than dramatized through a trade-off or tactical cost. Present across gates but ornamental in two of three touches.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Cloak" drives two key beats: the broadcast instructs Lina to "cloak the mixture with spit and laughter" so officials see only grime, and Lina cloaks pirate ink beneath symphonies when the boy approaches. Both uses constrain tactics and embody the method's secrecy. The action is thematically charged and causally necessary—without cloaking, discovery and suppression would follow. Swappability is moderate; "hide" or "disguise" could substitute with minor tonal loss, preventing top-band entry.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The method appears in setup ("guidance via elusive song lyrics"), drives the middle beat (Lina decodes lyrics as dust-mixture instructions), and the broadcast continues into closure. Lina explicitly "learned to hear the subtext behind every minor third," tying the method to her copyist skills. One gap: the mechanics—how suspended chords encode instructions—remain asserted rather than demonstrated; we see Lina write but not the translation process, limiting causal visibility and keeping the score mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The alcove shapes choices throughout: its ember light is trusted over monitored lamps, mist presses it into an island, and its former tram-garage function subtly codes abandoned infrastructure. The space enables Lina's secrecy and the boy's approach tests its vulnerability. The setting constrains (official lights avoided) and charges the closure (mist "thick at their backs" as they listen together). Specificity is high; a generic "hideout" would lack the ember/mist/former-garage texture that anchors the resistance aesthetic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The famine frames all action: it "burned the books and silenced the official archives," creating the dominant stake (restore memory via dust). Ash drifts as ongoing evidence, and Lina's entire method responds to post-famine scarcity. The timeframe appears in setup and closure but does not tighten decisions within the scene—no countdown, no officials closing in due to famine enforcement. The phrase "story famine" is evocative but its mechanics (how stories were banned, what penalties exist) remain abstract, limiting tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The motivation is dramatized: Lina grinds charcoal per broadcast instructions, copies "so that even a smear might contain the memory of a phrase," and accepts the boy as witness despite exposure risk. Internal conflict is present—she chooses a "peculiar purpose" knowing dust "did not learn from commands"—and the boy's dust shimmer validates her effort with visible cost (secrecy yielded). One friction: the desire is stated early ("chosen a peculiar purpose") rather than shown through a prior failed attempt, slightly weakening earned commitment.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The tone—"thistled calm, quiet yet full of tiny spines of interference"—is established early and modulates coherently: coals provide stillness, the broadcast hums with interference, mist muffles sirens. Under pressure (boy's arrival), the tone tightens ("froze her pen") then releases into shared witness. The final line ("ready to catch whatever the next verse chose to save") recycles the tone's core paradox (calm readiness amid danger). The phrase "thistled calm" charges the ending image and is not easily swappable, but one use feels slightly ornamental (applied to hope's luminosity mid-scene).</comment>
