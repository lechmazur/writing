<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Leila's interiority is concrete and specific—"suspended between languages, between airports, between unfinished prayers"—and her contradictory impulses (scholar vs. believer, observer vs. restorer) act simultaneously on the page. Her micro-choices carry visible cost: proposing the teaching garden risks rejection but forecloses pure detachment. The final turn toward "fragile continuity" and root-like faith feels earned by her cumulative devotion to the stone and villagers' stories. Rafi's secondary presence applies pressure without stealing focus, though his arc remains sketched rather than embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening bus arrival, establishing diaspora returnee, grandmother's village, and research context. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through layered images (roots around skulls, carved names, calendar of fruit and mortality) and the final sundial alignment offers Resonant Reconfiguration—Charged Poise where Leila's faith "crept…uncertain but unstoppable" and her life "traced a circle instead of a straight, severed line." The cost is felt (renunciation of linear certainty, acceptance of fragility) and legible in the closing image. One transition from arrival to excavation work across days is clean; causality holds under the accumulative mode without contradiction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard is both vivid and functional: tree roots "snake between bones," fermenting fruit mingles with "rainstone," and the sundial base half-buried with "roots clasping it like fingers" becomes a tactile anchor. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from ridgeline village to orchard to trench collapse. The setting constrains action—villagers stopped using old footpaths, the stone's toppling "drifted" seasons—and charges the closure when the sunbeam touches the dial just as the bell rings. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered ("something older she could not yet name"), and the teaching garden rebuild transforms space into a "map of generations."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—restoring lost faith—is signaled early and tightened through purposeful wandering, listening to villagers, and tracing travelers' names. The trench collapse delivers a meaningful reversal that narrows options (halt excavation, reveal calendar pattern), and Leila's proposal to rebuild the arrangement forecloses pure observation with visible cost (priest's resistance, Rafi's muttered reluctance). The sundial alignment at closure reweights the stake from intellectual restoration to embodied fragile continuity. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure coheres through density increase and cadence shift rather than causal turns, and the cost is legible in the final image of faith "creeping…uncertain but unstoppable."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the particulars of interrupted journeys mapped onto orchard, graves, and the broken sundial rather than explicit statement. The teaching garden—"not as a shrine but as a teaching garden" honoring "the dead as storytellers, not relics"—synthesizes disruption and continuity without moralizing. The final image of faith creeping "like a root seeking water" and life tracing "a circle instead of a straight, severed line" offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of restoration. Leila's notebook "woven with villagers' own memories and myths" anchors the thematic work in concrete action, and the piece resists tidy resolution while achieving earned resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable and filtered through Leila's perceptual bias: "warmly curious despite her jetlag," noticing "cursive prayers written in wood," thinking of her parents who "died abroad without ever returning home." Dialogue is sparse but functional—Rafi's "interrupted journeys were the only constant" and the priest's quiet blessing carry subtext and goal pursuit. Diction stays consistent with Leila's educated diaspora voice ("material religion," "accented village dialect") without unmotivated register drift. Psychic distance modulates purposefully: close during stone-tracing moments, wider during collective rebuild. The prose texture—lyric compression in the orchard descriptions, reflective cadence in memory beats—reflects the focalizer's state without head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies effectively: short declaratives during physical action ("They had uncovered only fragments"), longer accumulative clauses in reflective beats ("suspended between languages, between airports, between unfinished prayers"). Information density is high—most sentences advance setting, character, or pressure—but some scaffold remains: "The orchard seemed to lean closer, trunks and bones listening together for what would happen next" tells what was already shown. A few repetitive stems appear ("Something in…," "She traced…," "Leila…") and the phrase "interrupted journeys" recurs without always adding pressure. The final image's clarity and propulsion compensate, and no loops or metaphor muddles touch the closure beat. Grammar and mechanics are clean; copy consistency holds.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The premise—diaspora returnee seeking faith restoration in a catacomb orchard—transforms familiar material (return-to-roots, faith crisis, archaeological dig) through the specific synthesis of bones-as-calendar and teaching garden rather than shrine. The sundial's alignment just as the bell rings risks sentimentality but is earned by the prior particulars of broken time and calendar of fruit and mortality. Leila's voice and the orchard's tactile specificity anchor universals in lived detail. The conceptual move from "straight, severed line" to "circle" feels inevitable in hindsight yet non-obvious in execution. Risk-taking in the lyric-accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, warranting a small within-band adjustment.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Leila's decisions create key turns: she chooses to walk down to the dig, traces the sundial base devotedly, proposes the teaching garden rebuild (which the priest initially resists), and stays through the season to guide visitors. Her choice to show the priest her notebook of villagers' memories shifts his stance, and her final commitment to "charting every new question the place asked" forecloses the option of pure academic detachment. The character is signaled early (opening line), drives multiple beats (introduction, stone devotion, garden proposal, closure guidance), and shapes the ending's fragile continuity. Setup, development, and payoff gates are met; causal pressure and closure linkage are strong.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The sundial base appears in at least four beats: Leila finds it half-buried, traces travelers' names, witnesses the trench collapse revealing the calendar pattern around it, and participates in lifting it onto a new plinth where the sunbeam touches the first hour at closure. Its broken state shapes the villagers' drift from seasonal moorings, and the rebuild reweights its meaning from relic to living measure. The object constrains the garden proposal (priest's concern, villagers' hope) and charges the final alignment image. Setup (found early), development (traced, collapse reveals pattern, rebuild proposed and executed), and payoff (sunbeam alignment) gates are met. Irreplaceability is high; the story's logic depends on this exact object's history and restoration.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Interrupted journeys frame the narrative: Leila's parents died abroad without returning, her own research grant is temporary, Rafi mentions "interrupted journeys were the only constant," and villagers' seasons drifted after the sundial toppled. The concept shapes Leila's motivation and the climactic choice to trace "a circle instead of a straight, severed line." However, it functions more as thematic echo than on-page tactical constraint during middle beats. The closure explicitly reprices the concept, meeting the payoff gate, but the setup and development are less causally direct. The concept is signaled early and reweighted at the end, qualifying for mid-band via lyric-resonance allowance, but it does not narrow options in the middle as forcefully as required for higher scores.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Warmly curious" appears on-page in the phrase "warmly curious despite her jetlag" and manifests in Leila's actions: walking down to introduce herself, listening to villagers after prayers, tracing letters on the stone, proposing the teaching garden. The trait enables these choices but the cost tied specifically to curiosity is not isolated—her devotion risks Rafi's reproach ("you are an observer, not a restorer"), yet the friction is mild. The attribute is present early and influences multiple beats, but the visible tradeoff moment where curiosity itself forecloses an alternative path is not sharply dramatized. Setup and development gates are met; closure linkage is indirect.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The rebuild action is the story's pivotal turn: Leila proposes it, the priest resists until shown the notebook, villagers and archaeologists execute it together, and the sundial's restoration enables the closure alignment. This action redefines options—from pure excavation to teaching garden, from relic to living calendar—and the final image depends on it. The rebuild is prepared by the trench collapse (reveals calendar pattern), contested (priest's concern, Rafi's reluctance), and completed on-page ("lifted the sundial base, set it on a new stone plinth"). Setup (proposal mid-story), development (negotiation and execution across multiple beats), and payoff (sunbeam alignment) gates are met. Causal pressure and closure linkage are exemplary; swapping it would break the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Through purposeful wandering" is signaled on-page: "She practiced moving among the graves through purposeful wandering, tracing old footpaths villagers had stopped using." The method shapes her discovery of the sundial base and her accumulation of villagers' stories, which later fill the notebook that persuades the priest. However, the mechanics of wandering are not detailed—no on-page scene shows her choosing a path or its cost—so it reads more as summary than dramatized tactic. Setup (explicit mention early-mid) and development (leads to stone and stories) gates are met; payoff is indirect (notebook content used at closure). The method enables key beats but is not irreplaceable; "careful observation" could substitute with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard where tree roots snake between bones is the story's spatial and thematic heart: it pressures Leila's faith question, supplies the sundial base and calendar pattern, and hosts the excavation and rebuild. Roots "curling around skulls like protective hands" become the image of continuity, and the orchard "leaning closer, trunks and bones listening together" charges the alignment moment. The setting constrains choices—villagers stopped using paths, priest worries about disturbing the dead—and the final teaching garden transforms it into a "map of generations." Setup (opening description), development (excavation, collapse, devotion), and payoff (closure image of orchard listening) gates are met. The setting's unique properties drive multiple beats and the ending would fail without it.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The timeframe "across excavating a tomb" is present: the story spans "the next days," "after evening prayers," "one stormy afternoon," and "through the season." However, the excavation functions as backdrop more than live clock—no on-page deadline or ticking pressure tied to the dig's progress constrains Leila's choices. The trench collapse is a meaningful beat but reads as coincidence rather than time-driven escalation. Setup (excavation mentioned early), development (collapse mid-story), and payoff (season closure) gates are met, but the timeframe is replaceable with another seasonal marker. The element is functional but does not tighten decisions or alter tactics under pressure, capping it in the mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Leila's desire "to restore lost faith" is signaled early ("privately she wanted to restore lost faith") and dramatized through her devotion to the stone, listening to villagers, and proposing the garden. The motivation creates friction: Rafi warns her she is "an observer, not a restorer," and her faith does not "roar back" but "crept instead like a root seeking water, uncertain but unstoppable." The cost is visible—she foregoes academic detachment and stays through the season, "charting every new question the place asked." Setup (opening paragraph), development (stone devotion, garden proposal), and payoff (closure image of fragile faith) gates are met. The motivation shapes multiple beats and the ending's charge, qualifying for the upper mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The tone of "cautious enchantment" is established early—Rafi's voice "kept the tone of cautious enchantment the place demanded"—and sustained through Leila's observations ("something older she could not yet name"), the villagers' watchful waiting, and the priest's "quiet blessing." The tone modulates under pressure: cautious during Rafi's warning and priest's resistance, enchanted at the sundial alignment ("eerily precise," old women cross themselves). The final image holds both caution ("fragile continuity") and enchantment ("unstoppable" faith, orchard "listening together"). Setup (explicit mid-first-third), development (modulates with turns), and payoff (charges closure) gates are met. The tone is coherent and serves the ending, warranting a solid score in the 7-band.</comment>
