<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Ira's "calmly intuitive" training is dramatized through the mirror-reading method and the decision to reconstitute rather than enforce the accord. The anomaly's contradiction—stubbornness wrapped in fear—comes through in her shadow's lag and the fragment she nearly breaks. However, interiority leans abstract ("mapping fear onto vision," "choices kneeling on his ribs") rather than embodied micro-choices under stress. The final turn feels motivated but the protagonist's internal conflict remains more declared than viscerally contradictory in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through mirrored futures and converges in Ira's proposal to "reconstitute the accord" via the mirrors, reweighting the treaty from ownership to voice. Closure is a Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing: the final image shows Ira using mirrors to co-create rather than dictate, foreclosing the Keeper model with felt cost (they will resist, the anomaly's shoulders ease but her shadow "leaned a little closer"—poise, not resolution). The cost is conceptual and relational, legible in "slowly, via glimpses" and "something the orchard chose." One meaningful deepening is present. Orientation anchors arrive cleanly by the fourth paragraph.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The orchard's fog-rings, swinging lanterns, and grinding ice provide vivid sensory anchors. The vintage-store mirrors inside the lighthouse constrain Ira's method at closure—he holds the fragment "up to the vintage store mirrors, letting each reflection catch and alter the light"—which charges the final image. Spatial choreography (stairwell widening, counter, leaning mirrors) remains clear. The ice and orchard pressure the geopolitical stakes but do not directly constrain an on-page choice until the mirror method at the end.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake: prevent the orchard from becoming the Keepers' excuse for war. Pressure tightens when the mirrors show burned orchard and refugee ships, then Ira's complicity, forcing his proposal to "reconstitute the accord...not to own this orchard but to recognize it as a deciding voice." The anomaly's resistance ("The Keepers will never agree") and shadow lean create a micro-turn. Agency is clear: Ira lifts the fragment and experiments with reflections, cataloging reactions to shape the new treaty. Cost is visible in the anomaly's eased shoulders vs. tightened jaw and in Ira's acceptance that he must "show them" rather than enforce. One meaningful tightening is sufficient for this length under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—power as co-creation vs. colonial enforcement—emerges from particulars: Ira's mirror method, the anomaly's refusal, the treaty as "broken crystal" showing only jagged futures. The final image ("via glimpses in vintage store mirrors, he reconstituted the accord into something the orchard chose") answers the central question (what does it mean to map empathy onto action) non-literally, reweighting the Keeper model without stating a moral. The mirrors function as more than symbol; they operationalize the theme by constraining Ira's method. Minor slip: "maybe...the treaty itself was the broken crystal" edges toward articulation, though it remains interrogative rather than declarative.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited holds cleanly to Ira's perceptual signature: "silence tasted like fear wrapped in stubbornness," "cataloging not only outcomes but reactions." Diction fits his training ("shadow-laced peacekeeper," "using other minds as mirrors"). The anomaly's dialogue carries subtext and goal pursuit ("I refuse to become their excuse"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully during the mirror sequence, tightening as Ira experiments. One brief elision—"the Keepers had sent Ira here because the ordinary treaties were failing"—anchors backstory without flattening present pressure. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks in peak beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and propulsion is strong through the mirror sequence. Information density is high ("One by one, he held it up...cataloging not only outcomes but reactions"). Minor loop: "He should have argued, but his calmly intuitive mind walked instead through the mirrors" immediately follows mirror work already in progress, creating a slight scaffold feel. Figurative language ("choices kneeling on his ribs," "grief hardened into borderlines") is vivid but occasionally elevated beyond immediate POV lexicon during high-pressure beats. No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs. Sentence openings vary and grammar is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The mirror-as-negotiation-tool synthesis is specific and non-obvious; "using other minds as mirrors...but he had never taken it this literally" makes the leap earned in hindsight. The treaty-as-broken-crystal metaphor and the anomaly's out-of-sync shadow offer fresh angles on power and displacement. The orchard-lighthouse-ice setting combination feels particular rather than generic. Risk: the premise (magical anomaly vs. treaty enforcers) is familiar in SFF, but the story transforms it through the mirror method and the co-creation resolution rather than capture/destroy.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Ira ("shadow-laced peacekeeper") is present throughout, pursues the accord goal, and his key decision—"reconstitute the accord...to recognize it as a deciding voice"—drives the closure turn. His training is invoked early ("calmly intuitive, trained to hear arguments before they were spoken") and tested when "dreams made his training unreliable." He lifts the fragment, experiments with mirrors, and catalogs reactions, shaping the new treaty on the page. Setup, development, and payoff all present. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage. Specificity: his discipline is irreplaceable ("using other minds as mirrors...never taken it this literally").</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The crystal fragment appears early on the counter, is held by the anomaly, flipped to show futures, and Ira lifts it from her hand to use with the mirrors in the final sequence. Three distinct beats: initial encounter, flip showing futures, reconstitution experiment. It enables the ending method (held up to mirrors to "catch and alter the light") and its "restless light" and "hairline cracks" charge the treaty metaphor. Setup, development, and payoff present. Strong closure linkage and causal pressure. Specificity: its fragmented, multi-future property is irreplaceable to the mirror method.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Courageous anomaly" is seeded early ("the world hated anomalies...a courageous anomaly that refused every command but compassion") and shapes Ira's stakes: he must bring it into the accords or face war. The anomaly's refusal ("I refuse to become their excuse") and her desire ("I want this place to choose itself") drive the conflict. However, "courageous" reads more as label than dramatized trait; her stubbornness and shadow-lag are shown, but courage as a distinct on-page cost or choice is less visible. The concept frames the problem but does not constrain a specific middle tactic. Setup and payoff present; development is thematic rather than action-pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Calmly intuitive" is introduced early and invoked when Ira uses silence to read the anomaly ("silence...told him more than testimony") and when he "walked...through the mirrors, letting each glass offer him a different angle." However, the trait's constraint is mild: the orchard "made his training unreliable" is mentioned but not dramatized as a costly tradeoff. The attribute enables his method but does not visibly fail or force a pivot under pressure. Setup and payoff present; development is functional but the cost remains implicit. Swappable with "perceptive" or "patient" without major structural change.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Reconstitute" is the climactic action: Ira proposes to "reconstitute the accord...not to own this orchard but to recognize it as a deciding voice," then physically reconstitutes it "via glimpses in vintage store mirrors...into something the orchard chose." The verb appears twice, bracketing the ending sequence, and its meaning shifts from proposal to enacted method. It redefines options (ownership → voice) and drives the closure turn. Setup (metaphor "the treaty itself was the broken crystal"), development (proposal), and payoff (mirror experiment) all present. High causal pressure, closure linkage, and irreplaceability; no near-synonym ("rebuild," "rewrite") captures the shard-reassembly specificity.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Mirrors are introduced early ("Mirrors leaned against every curved wall"), appear in the middle beats (showing futures: "In one mirror, Ira saw the orchard burned..."), and anchor the ending method: "One by one, he held it up to the vintage store mirrors, letting each reflection catch and alter the light." Three distinct beats. The method constrains Ira's tactics (he must catalog reactions via mirrors rather than direct negotiation) and shapes the closure image. Setup, development, and payoff present. Specificity: "vintage store mirrors" is irreplaceable to the reconstitution metaphor. However, the mirrors' mechanics (why vintage, why multiple) remain lightly motivated beyond atmospheric effect.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The lighthouse orchard is anchored early with vivid detail (bare-limbed trees, fog rings, swinging lanterns, grinding ice below). It frames the geopolitical stakes (nations want it; it "birthed a courageous anomaly") and provides atmosphere. However, the setting does not constrain an on-page choice or supply a resource that alters tactics. The orchard as sanctuary-versus-spoil drives the conceptual stakes but remains abstract; no tree, ice, or lighthouse feature forces a pivot. Setup and thematic payoff present; middle development is atmospheric rather than action-pressure. Swappable with another contested refuge without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"During the weighted breath before reply" appears once mid-story: "Ira let the accusation rest between them during the weighted breath before reply." It signals a pause Ira uses to read silence, consistent with his intuitive method. However, the timeframe does not recur, tighten decisions elsewhere, or structure the scene's clock. The story's temporal span is broader (arrival, negotiation, mirror experiment), and no ticking urgency derives from this single breath. Setup present; development and payoff absent. Functional but ornamental; the pause could be "a long silence" without structural change.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"To map empathy onto action" is introduced as Ira's core drive ("your instructors brag; show me how that works when every option is cruelty") and tested when he proposes joint governance and uses the mirrors to co-create rather than dictate. The motivation shapes his refusal to enforce the Keepers' treaty and his cataloging of the anomaly's reactions. However, the phrasing is abstract and arrives via the anomaly's dialogue rather than Ira's embodied choice. The final action enacts it, but friction between empathy and cost (e.g., risking his career, angering the Keepers) is implied rather than viscerally felt on the page. Setup, development, and payoff present; cost connection is conceptual rather than immediate.</comment>
