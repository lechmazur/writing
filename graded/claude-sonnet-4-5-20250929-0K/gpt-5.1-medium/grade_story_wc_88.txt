<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The protagonist's interiority is vivid and embodied throughout—"my head felt scraped and polished, a bare plate where history used to sit"—and the motivation to reclaim guilt drives concrete choices (following the map, using the torch, wading into the lake). Internal contradiction surfaces in the tension between wanting a clean slate and needing to remember cruelty. The final wade into the lake with images "rushing me" feels somewhat told rather than dramatized as bodily cost, and the shift from discovery to reflection in the closing lines softens what could be a sharper renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—density increases through layered images (city → stadium → tunnel → cavern → lake) and the final wade reweights the premise (memories stored externally). Orientation anchors early (city post-procedure, evening, solo journey). Closure reads as Conceptual Repricing: the lake as "reservoir" of erased cruelty reconfigures the cleanse premise with conceptual cost (empathy vacuum upstairs). The cost is legible in the final image of "possibilities, branches… reaching back like accusing arms," though the last beat tilts toward summary rather than a decisive physical or perceptual snap.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Setting escalates through concrete layers—oil slicks, dust-drowned stadium, welded tunnel door, bioluminescent lake—that constrain choices (torch required, cold bites through boots). The lake's "bruised turquoise light" and algae chandeliers charge the final image and reweight the cleanse motif. Spatial choreography remains clear across transitions. The underground cavern functions as both literal and conceptual pressure, making empathy's absence palpable.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: recover erased memory to understand past cruelty and kindle empathy. Pressure tightens through the journey's physical obstacles (welded door, descent) and conceptual deepening (baseball's future signature, lake as reservoir). The protagonist's agency drives each turn (following the map, using the torch, wading in). The final wade forecloses retreat and forces confrontation with "sins pressing down through my skin," though the cost remains more conceptual than visceral in the closing lines.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme—memory, guilt, and empathy as civic necessities—emerges through concrete particulars (cleanse clinics, bioluminescent reservoir, the baseball's future date). The lake as literal storage of erased feelings avoids allegory by integrating with plot mechanics. "If the city could not remember its own cruelty, then someone had to" risks explicit statement but earns it through prior imagery. The final image of "branches… reaching back like accusing arms" reweights the cleanse premise without moralizing, though one wishes for a sharper non-literal close.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and consistent—jaded lyricism with noir-tinged syntax ("wet and shining and wrong," "conscience like the guts"). Psychic distance holds steady in tight first-person. Perceptual signature is character-specific: notices soot "like old war medals," reads weather in riverbeds, filters the lake through moral metaphor. Reflection is anchored in present stimuli (baseball in hand, cold water biting) and modulates from clinical distance to immersive dread. No head-hopping or filter-verb clutter.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong figurative control in peak beats ("history used to sit," "stamina, injury recovery, or object behavior used for convenience" never applies). Information density is high; nearly every line advances discovery or thematic charge. Minor paraphrase loop: "This, then, was what I had been protecting" followed immediately by "Not treasure, not escape, but a place…" restates without added pressure. Template cadence in the cleanse-clinic paragraph ("scrubbed away… scoured off… leaving") slightly flattens momentum. Clarity and propulsion otherwise excellent; no filter stacks or register drift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The premise—externalized memory storage as bioluminescent lake—transforms the amnesia trope through vivid world logic and specific stakes (civic empathy vacuum). The baseball signed by future-self and the newspaper-code map offer fresh inflections. Risk-taking in the lyric-noir voice and concept-driven closure heightens stakes. The "cleanse clinic" frame echoes familiar SF templates (Eternal Sunshine, Black Mirror) but the underground reservoir and empathy-reservoir twist supply non-obvious synthesis. Slightly more specificity in the protagonist's pre-cleanse crime would deepen irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Setup: protagonist is post-cleanse, left self a map. Development: choices at stadium (retrieve baseball), tunnel (use torch), cavern (wade into lake) are driven by this character's recursive trust and guilt. Payoff: wading in triggers recognition of "sins pressing down" and reframes the cleanse. Causal pressure across three beats; cost is conceptual (empathy confrontation) rather than visceral forfeiture. Early signal, beat involvement (three), closure linkage present; swappability moderate (another amnesiac archetype could substitute with edits). Score: 6.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Setup: baseball found at stadium, signed by future-self with "DO NOT HESITATE." Development: arrows on seams point to tunnel; protagonist turns it over, reads it, uses it as guide. Payoff: held in final paragraph during lake reflection ("rough against my fingertips, the future date… like a pulse"). Causal pressure (enables navigation), beat involvement (two distinct), closure linkage (present in final image), specificity (future signature is unique). Swappability low; time-loop motif charges the object. Score: 7.2.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Setup: implicit in title framing and newspaper-code map ("labyrinth of choices everyone had made and then thrown away"). Development: descent through layered city acts as literal maze; lake as choice-repository makes concept concrete. Payoff: final paragraph names it explicitly ("reservoir… of choices… glowing softly"). Causal pressure moderate (maze structure shapes journey but doesn't narrow tactics); closure linkage present but somewhat declared. Beat involvement (one extended), specificity moderate. Score: 5.8.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Setup: phrase appears in paragraph three ("as if that difference were delicately robust instead of a fragile lie"). Development: no on-page action constrained or enabled by this trait. Payoff: absent from closure. Ornamental mention; no beat involvement, no causal pressure, no cost connection. Label-only use in a single sentence. Score: 2.4.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Setup: journey begins immediately after procedure, framed as "the journey the dead version of me had prepared." Development: every major beat is a journey stage (stadium, tunnel, cavern, lake). Payoff: arrival at lake triggers conceptual climax and wade into stored memories. Causal pressure high (journey structure drives all escalation), beat involvement (four stages), closure linkage (wading is final act), irreplaceability high (removing journey collapses structure). Score: 8.1.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Setup: newspaper classified ads and obituaries coded by grandfather's weather-reading method, mentioned in paragraph six. Development: method enables protagonist to begin journey ("Tuesday edition carried a phrase… it spelled out directions"). Payoff: not revisited in closure; functions as enabling device. Causal pressure moderate (unlocks map but mechanics not tested under stress), beat involvement (one), specificity high (grandfather's weather-reading is distinct). Lyric early→final reprise absent. Score: 6.3.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Setup: lake introduced two-thirds through; cavern opens to reveal it. Development: "bruised turquoise light," algae chandeliers, cold biting through boots constrain protagonist's perception and prime the wade. Payoff: wading into lake triggers image-rush and conceptual climax; water "reacted, brightening in nervous flares, as if it recognized my sins." Causal pressure (water's reaction matters), beat involvement (two), closure linkage strong, specificity high. Late arrival (past 40%) caps at 4.6 waived by strong payoff integration and transformation of prior descent. Score: 7.6.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Setup: "after the procedure, when the stabilizers stopped humming… I stepped out into the evening." Development: journey unfolds "eventually" and "down there" without tight clock; time is sequence rather than constraint. Payoff: no urgency tied to elapsed time at closure. Causal pressure low (timeframe present but doesn't tighten tactics), beat involvement (setup only), closure linkage absent. Score: 5.9.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Setup: desire stated in penultimate page ("to kindle empathy where none remains"). Development: realization that city "scoured off empathy" drives wade into lake. Payoff: final wade is attempt to absorb stored pain and restore conscience. Causal pressure (motivation explains risk), beat involvement (one stated, one enacted), closure linkage present. Told more than tested under friction; no competing want visible. Score: 6.7.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Setup: opens with "almost clean enough to believe in" and "pigeons still limped through oil slicks"—jaded wonder anchored immediately. Development: tone modulates from detached wit ("delicately robust… fragile lie") to immersive dread ("wet and shining and wrong") to awe ("chandeliers, dripping slow sparks"). Payoff: final image of "branches… reaching back like accusing arms" sustains duality. Coherent across turns, charges closure. Score: 7.8.</comment>
