<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Tomas is embodied through concrete action—removing the wind chime, tightening bolts, following the photograph trail—and his grief and duty create contradictory impulses that press him toward the ending choice. The internal shift from engineer to storyteller is earned by the trail's accumulation and Mara's final image. Minor slip: his "precisely humane attention" reads more as authorial assertion than demonstrated trait under pressure. The ending choice to begin with story rather than warnings forecloses his prior stance with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (Tomas, ridgeway, twilight, after wind chime falls silent) land within the first paragraph. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the photograph trail deepens through density increase and pattern break, reweighting Tomas's engineer stance toward storyteller. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant): he holds up photographs and "began…with a story," crystallizing a new stance with undeniable pressure—the council will demand reports, neighbors wait in silence, and his choice forecloses his prior engineer-only mode. Cost is felt in the mirrored hush and the fragility of their listening. One meaningful deepening is present and sufficient for this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The ridgeway, reservoir, exposed mud, and rising steeple constrain Tomas's path and charge the final image. Sensory detail is filtered through his grief and vigilance: "boots sucking at wet ground," "sapphire hued even under the dull sky," "mirrored hush." The photographs scattered along the slope function as micro-setting, physically guiding his trajectory and reweighting memory. The steeple "peering from the water like a question" charges the closure moment. Spatial choreography remains clear across the slope, water, and ridgeway.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early: Tomas must reconcile his engineer's duty with the town's resurfacing past. Pressure accumulates through the photograph trail, each image narrowing his engineer-only stance. The tightening occurs when Mara's photograph and the steeple converge, forcing him to choose storytelling over structural reports—a trade-off with visible cost as he walks toward waiting neighbors who expect engineering answers. The council's imminent demand and the "fragile as glass" hush make the cost legible. One meaningful deepening is present and sufficient under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: the liqueur label, photographs, resurfacing streets, and Mara's image accumulate into a question about memory versus erasure, stories versus structures. "He believed in structures that held, even when people did not" versus "stories could hold water too" creates tension without stating a thesis. The ending offers a resonant answer—listening faces "become another kind of levee"—reweighting the premise without moralizing. The sapphire label's "small defiance of drowning" and the steeple "like a question" avoid symbolic convenience by constraining his path across beats.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is consistent and character-specific: Tomas notices pressure gauges, cracks, rivets, and the reservoir's foot-drop before he registers the photographs' emotional charge. Diction remains stable in his engineer's lexicon ("subsidence and stress," "tightening bolts") even as grief colors perception ("thin bruise," "dead insisting"). No head-hopping; focalization is locked. Purposeful compression in "a thin bruise between land and sky" and "stories could hold water too" is voice-motivated and legible. Psychic distance modulates intentionally: close during the photograph trail, pulling back at the ridgeway's end to frame the neighbors.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Information density is high: "vigilant by habit and by grief," "broken rooftops breached the surface, chimneys poked out like gray fingers" compress backstory and setting into action-driven lines. Rhythm varies naturally without template cadence. Minor slip: "The label in his hand smelled of river rot, but the color was unabashed, a small defiance of drowning" stacks two appositives in quick succession, creating brief density overload. No paraphrase loops or scaffold. Sentence openings vary; clarity and propulsion remain strong through the photograph trail and final turn.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The premise—drowned town resurfacing—is familiar, but transformation occurs through Tomas's dual identity (levee warden and widower), the photograph trail as investigative thread, and the sapphire label's material specificity. The ending's move from reports to storytelling, with "listening faces become another kind of levee," synthesizes structure and narrative in a non-obvious way. Risk-taking in the accumulative structure and lyric compression heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The trail's anonymity (whoever laid it) adds ambiguity that enriches rather than confuses.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Tomas's choice to follow the trail, retrieve the label, and examine each photograph drives three distinct beats. His decision at the ridgeway's end to begin with story rather than warnings alters tactics and forecloses his engineer-only stance with visible cost. Early signal: named and role-established in paragraph one. Closure linkage: his final action (holding up photographs, beginning to speak) is causally earned by the trail. Causal pressure: the trail narrows his options from engineering reports to storytelling.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The sapphire label appears in two beats: retrieval from mud (paragraph 16–19) and held up at closure (paragraph 39). Its color "unabashed, a small defiance of drowning" reweights meaning from decay to persistence. Early signal: introduced at ~25% mark. Closure linkage: included in the final held-up collection. Friction: swappable with another keepsake (photograph, bottle fragment) with minor edits; the liqueur's link to Mara is functional but not irreplaceable. Cost connection is present but modest.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The reservoir town resurfacing frames every beat: water drop exposes streets (paragraph 7), photographs scattered on slope (paragraph 25), steeple emerging (paragraph 30), and council's imminent demand to "expunge the awkward half life" (paragraph 35). It shapes Tomas's stake—guard the wall versus preserve memory—and changes his options at closure. Early signal: paragraph 6–8. Causal pressure: the resurfacing forces the choice between engineering and storytelling. Closure linkage: the town's half-life state is what the neighbors must now reckon with through his story.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Precisely humane attention to every crack and rivet" (paragraph 13) is asserted but not dramatized under pressure. It informs his vigilance and contrasts with the storytelling choice at the end, creating mild thematic friction. No on-page action where this trait constrains a choice with visible cost—he follows the trail rather than inspecting cracks. Modest thematic integration: the trait seeds the engineer/storyteller tension but does not drive a beat. Appears mid-first-third; absent from closure action.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Expunge" appears once (paragraph 35) as the council's anticipated demand: "ask whether houses could be salvaged or should be blasted and buried again…expunge the awkward half life." It sharpens the stakes by naming the opposition to Tomas's emerging choice. Causal role: the threat of expunging pressures him toward storytelling. Friction: introduced late (~85% mark) and not revisited at closure; the word itself could be replaced with "erase" or "remove" without structural loss. Functional but not irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The photograph trail is signaled at paragraph 24 ("photographs were not random debris"), guides three beats (following, examining scenes, finding Mara's image), and delivers the closure trigger (Mara's photograph convinces him to tell stories). Early signal: ~40% mark. Development: each photograph narrows options by revealing forgotten details. Closure linkage: the trail's endpoint (Mara's image at the steeple) precipitates his final choice. Causal pressure: the trail's breadcrumb structure constrains his physical path and reweights his stance. Irreplaceability: high—removing the trail collapses the middle escalation and the closure's earned quality.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The midnight ridgeway at twilight anchors spatial choreography (paragraphs 1–2, 10, 30, 36) and charges the final image ("walked back up the ridgeway," paragraph 36). The ridgeway's narrowing beside the gatehouse (paragraph 10) and its endpoint at the steeple (paragraph 30) constrain Tomas's path. "Twilight bled…a thin bruise" sets tone and filters perception. Closure linkage: he walks back up it to meet the neighbors. Causal pressure: the ridgeway's slope and proximity to exposed mud enable the photograph discovery. Friction: "midnight ridgeway at twilight" is contradictory (midnight ≠ twilight); this inconsistency slightly weakens specificity.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"After the wind chime fell silent" anchors the opening and primes Tomas's grief (paragraph 1, 11–12). The chime's absence recurs as a marker of Mara's death and his refusal of "random consolations." It frames the before-state but does not tighten decisions in real time—no live clock pressures his pace. Lyric reprise: the chime's silence seeds the mirrored hush at closure, reweighting emptiness from personal to shared. Two-gate integration: setup and thematic payoff, but no middle development. Modest cost connection: the chime's removal is a past choice, not an on-page one.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The motivation "to spin stories into shared meaning" is articulated explicitly (paragraph 32) and dramatized at closure when Tomas begins with story rather than warnings (paragraph 39). Friction with his engineer identity creates conflict. Early seed: paragraph 13 ("structures that held") and paragraph 31 ("stories could hold water too") prime the shift. Closure linkage: his final act enacts this motivation. Cost: he forecloses the engineer-only stance the council expects. Friction: the phrase "spin stories into shared meaning" reads slightly abstract and prompt-like rather than arising from concrete action, lowering embodiment.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>"Mirrored hush" appears three times: reservoir surface (paragraph 3), wind chime's ended song (paragraph 11), and the neighbors' silence (paragraph 37). The tone is coherent through accumulative beats and modulates with pressure—stillness deepens from landscape to social fragility. Closure charge: "mirrored hush…felt as fragile as glass" (paragraph 37) reconfigures the tone from passive reflection to charged tension, making the neighbors' listening a pressure point. The tone constrains Tomas's final choice—he must break the hush carefully. Causal role: the hush's fragility raises the cost of his storytelling.</comment>
