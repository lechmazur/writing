<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara's interiority is concrete and embodied—"her throat tightened," the bolt "warmed, then tugged downward"—and her trajectory from pyramid-scheme survivor to mushroom farmer is causal and particular. The final choice (grasping the hatch) is earned by her established pattern of stepping forward when asked and by the pressure of accumulating promises. Internal contradiction is present: she distrusts shortcuts yet reaches for a new door. Micro-choices throughout (checking moisture, texting variants, approaching the hatch) reveal values under rising pressure, though the volunteer trait is told more than dramatized in a prior beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Mara grasps the hatch wheel as the bolt clicks in sympathetic rhythm, crystallizing the tension between old lie and new door with undeniable pressure and felt cost (she risks repeating a trap). Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly in the opening lines. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density increases from failing pumps → messages from parallel Maras → hatch revelation, culminating in a final image that reweights her past prop as present tool. One meaningful tightening (the hatch reveal) narrows options and the ending reconfigures her relationship to shortcuts versus novelty.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The bioluminescent mushrooms anchor setting viscerally ("blue-green caps pulsed…painting her hands") and constrain choice: their accelerating cycle signals the weight of promises, and their respectful dimming as she approaches the hatch charges the closure. The submarine-porthole hatch design echoes her bolt, functioning as micro-setting that shapes the final move. Sensory detail is filtered through Mara's professional lens (moisture levels, gills shimmering with half-formed notions), and the cavern's humidity slows the change, adding tactical pressure. Spatial choreography from far corner to hatch is clear and purposeful.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preventing promises from "eating everyone"—is signaled early and tightens when the pumps fail and the other Mara's messages arrive. One meaningful escalation: the hatch revelation forces Mara to choose between her distrust of shortcuts (a trap set by remaining faith) and her trust in novelty, narrowing options with visible agency. The final act (grasping the wheel) is protagonist-driven and forecloses retreat. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens: density builds from irrigation failure → dimensional messages → hatch sigh, though the cost of opening the hatch remains prospective rather than paid on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme—transformation of weight/pressure into something generative—emerges through concrete particulars: the bolt as former prop now honest weight, promises demanding bodies, the instruction to "let the weight see it can become something else." The submarine porthole motif charges the closure by aligning past deception with present threshold. The ending image (old lie aligning with new door) offers a resonant, non-literal answer to whether shortcuts betray or redeem, avoiding stated morals. Subtext operates in the bolt's warming, the hatch's "polite accusation," and Mara's trust in "novelty more than nostalgia," though the quantum-promise concept remains more thematic echo than dramatized pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited with tight focalization; Mara's perceptual signature is consistent (wary patience, translating metaphors into physical stakes). Diction stays character-particular ("shadowseam wonder," "slang-bent but legible") and the prose rhythm modulates with pressure—short bursts during the hatch approach, longer reflection earlier. The dimensional-message formatting (spiral text, vortex tightening) is purposeful and legible. Some filter verbs ("she realized," "she knew") appear but stay voice-motivated. No head-hopping; narrative distance is controlled. The phrase "virtuously mischievous" is told in summary rather than shown through a prior micro-choice, a minor miss in embodiment.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully and figurative density is high but mostly coherent ("drowned city," "ideas…congealing into something with teeth," "tidal lines"). Two frictions: register drift into elevated diction ("barometric storms," "depthless") occasionally clashes with the grounded mushroom-farmer POV during high-pressure beats, and a paraphrase loop appears ("the bolt warmed, then tugged" / "gravity had remembered something personal"). Information density is strong—most lines advance atmosphere and stakes—and sentence openings vary. Clarity holds throughout; no ambiguous pronouns or simultaneity errors. Propulsion is consistent, though the metaphorical layering in the middle third risks slight momentum drag.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of bioluminescent farming, parallel-dimension contact, and concepts-become-physical is specific and non-obvious; the submarine bolt's transformation from pyramid-scheme prop to threshold key feels earned in hindsight. The piece takes risks with dense speculative layering and dimensional-message formatting without losing clarity. Emotional truth (Mara's distrust of shortcuts versus her forward-stepping reflex) anchors the speculative premise in recognizable psychology. The final turn—old lie aligning with new door—is fresh and stakes-driven. Minor swappability: the mushroom farm could be another underground setting without breaking logic, though the gills-as-listeners motif is well-integrated.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's identity as pyramid-scheme survivor frames her causal arc (distrust of shortcuts, the bolt as prop-turned-weight) and drives the central tension at closure (is the hatch a new trap?). Her past informs the decision to grasp the wheel, though the volunteer trait is told more than shown in a prior beat. Present across setup, middle (bolt warming), and ending (bolt clicks in sympathy), with visible cost (risking repetition of past mistakes).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The submarine porthole bolt appears in setup (around her neck, prop from the scheme), middle (tugs downward when the hatch sighs), and ending (clicks in sympathetic rhythm as she grasps the wheel). Its transformation from imaginary-fleet prop to honest weight to threshold key is causally charged and irreplaceable. It enables the final choice by echoing the hatch design and reweights her relationship to past lies. Strong closure linkage and specificity.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The quantum promise is mentioned once in backstory ("a quantum promise, whispering it to the bolt") but does not shape on-page tactics or alter present options. It remains thematic ornament—label without dramatized pressure. The concept of promises demanding bodies drives the middle escalation, but "quantum" itself contributes no unique causal work. Swappable with "desperate vow" or similar without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>The trait "virtuously mischievous" is told in summary ("broke rules only when they were stupid or cruel") but never dramatized in an on-page choice with visible cost. It does not constrain or enable the hatch decision. Mentioned once in setup, absent from middle beats and closure. Label-only use without visible tradeoff or friction.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The volunteer action is seeded in setup ("in every universe where she survived…she would still step forward") and contextualizes the final choice to grasp the hatch. It does not appear as a discrete on-page beat but frames Mara's forward-stepping reflex causally. Present in setup and implicit at closure, though the dimensional message tells rather than shows the volunteering pattern. Functional but partially summarized rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Glitchy text messages from parallel dimensions arrive in the middle (first message when pumps stall, second spiral-text instruction) and shape Mara's tactics by providing the "open a window" directive. Signaled early, used twice with distinct mechanics (reordering letters, spiral vortex), and the method's instability mirrors the story's premise. Does not appear in the final image but enables the closure choice. Mid-band for two-beat involvement and causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The bioluminescent mushroom farm is present throughout: setup (checking moisture), middle (mushrooms listening, gills shimmering with half-formed notions, cycling faster as if waiting), and ending (rows dimming "respectfully" as she approaches the hatch). The setting supplies resources (the hatch itself) and its sensory signature (humidity slowing change) pressures Mara's choices. The mushrooms' accelerating cycle signals rising stakes. Strong beat involvement and closure participation, though the farm itself is not the final image—the hatch is.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The timeframe "when concepts become physical" is signaled in the opening ("the era when concepts become physical") and pressures the middle escalation (promises demanding bodies, the hatch's appearance). It does not tighten decisions with a live clock but establishes the world rule that drives causality. Present in setup and middle with thematic charge; absent from the final image. Functional causal frame, mid-band for rule-setting without tactical time pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The motivation to "translate pressure into diamonds" is told in backstory and echoed in the dimensional Mara's instruction ("we found a way to cut gems from it"). It frames Mara's choice to grasp the hatch (turning weight into generative action) but is not dramatized through on-page friction between wants and costs. Present in setup, middle (implicit in her trust of novelty), and thematically at closure. Lyric reprise with some cost, though primarily told rather than embodied in conflicting micro-choices.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Tone—shadowseam wonder—is established early ("blue-green caps…painting her hands in shadowseam wonder") and sustained through figurative density (promises as storms, the hatch's "polite accusation"). It modulates slightly under pressure (shorter syntax as she approaches the hatch) and charges the final image (the bolt's sympathetic click). Coherent across beats with purposeful cadence shift at closure, though the elevated register occasionally tensions the grounded mushroom-farmer frame. Mid-high band for consistent atmospheric control with minor friction.</comment>
