<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Leon's motivation is clear and embodied through his piano playing as sustained longing; the broken clock and scarf provide concrete anchors. His decision to enter the projection shows agency with visible cost (leaving the station). Mara's choice at closure—"let us end nothing" versus "come back with me"—arrives earned by her stated weariness of rehearsed endings, and her final laugh resolves the internal conflict. Minor: some interiority leans slightly abstract ("steely longing," "strategically creative") but the embodied choices compensate.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Hybrid (causal entry via film discovery, accumulative texture in the arbor, situational crystallization at closure). Orientation anchors within opening lines (station, pianist, clock). The closure lands as Charged Poise: Mara's invitation and Leon's counter-offer crystallize options with felt cost (leaving refuge versus returning with transformed stance); the arbor's pathways unfolding and the compass flaring signal reconfiguration. One meaningful tightening occurs when Leon challenges the arbor's purpose, narrowing the stakes from hesitation-as-refuge to action-as-encore. Cost is legible in Mara's wary posture and the arbor's groan, though slightly more concrete consequence would elevate further.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The arbor functions as micro-setting that constrains choice: its hanging compasses and root-walkways pressure Leon's challenge ("maybe it tests whether we can strike the next chord anyway"), and the final image of unfolding pathways charges the closure. The station piano, broken clock, film reels, and projection provide concrete anchors early. Sensory detail is selective and voice-filtered ("grain buzzing in his ears," "bench sway with some invisible tide"). The arbor's environment—roots, mist-tides, chrome-blue sky—directly shapes the final moment when "new pathways unfolded in the air."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake: Leon seeks reunion with Mara and resolution of unfinished duet. Pressure tightens when he discovers the hidden staircase, enters the projection, and confronts Mara's refuge-philosophy. The arbor scene deepens stakes from "find Mara" to "choose action over hesitation," with visible cost in his broken clock and her acknowledgment that he "should not be here." Agency drives escalation: Leon's insistence ("I have been hovering long enough") forces the compass to flare and pathways to open. The final choice—stay versus return—offers competing goods with felt weight. One micro-turn (compass flaring) sets up the closure without diluting pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: hesitation versus improvisation, refuge versus encore, rehearsed endings versus offbeat arrival. The broken anniversary clock shifting one second and the compasses "turning not north but toward remembered choices" concretize the question without stating it. The closure image—"we will arrive offbeat, together, as an unplanned encore"—reweights prior material (her scarf, his longing, the film as map) with a non-literal answer. Mara's crooked smile and "strategically creative" harmonies add specificity. No late moralizing; the arbor's groan and pathways unfolding earn the final insight through scene pressure rather than assertion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV held cleanly throughout; Leon's perceptual signature filters via music metaphors ("dissonant chord resolving," "cello groan," "muted trumpet"). Diction remains stable and voice-motivated ("steely longing," "flickering compasses," "strategically creative") with minimal register drift. Dialogue serves subtext and goal pursuit: Mara's "You were supposed to stay" and Leon's counter-offer advance conflict. Minor: a few constructions lean slightly elevated ("chrome-blue until the horizon invited night with a purple rim") but stay within the lyric-realist blend the piece teaches. No head-hopping; psychic distance stable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines serve character, atmosphere, and pressure. Rhythm modulates well (short urgency at discovery, longer breath in arbor). Some minor text artifacts: "flickering" appears three times in close proximity (projection, compasses, monochrome), and "strategically creative" + "until the horizon invited night" repeat verbatim across beats, creating slight template echo. "Flickering compasses" recurs purposefully but "flickering" as descriptor spreads beyond need. No major loops or scaffold, but tightening these would sharpen momentum. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent; "slow-motion waves of mist" and "catching slow-motion waves" risk redundancy but remain legible.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The tidal arbor as refuge-for-unfinished-moments offers a fresh angle on liminal-space tropes; the film-reel-as-map and compasses-toward-choices add specific synthesis. The premise transforms familiar "lost love in magical place" via the hesitation-versus-improvisation calculus and the "unplanned encore" resolution. Leon's profession and the broken clock integrate organically rather than as checklist items. Risk-taking in the lyric density and metaphor load heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Slightly derivative echoes (arbor above clouds, hidden staircase) are personalized through music metaphors and the specific refuge logic, avoiding close template match.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Leon present from opening; his choice to follow the staircase and enter the projection are key turns. His challenge to Mara ("maybe this place does not just shelter hesitation; maybe it tests whether we can strike the next chord anyway") drives the compass-flaring and pathway-opening that enable the closure offer. His final invitation ("Stay… or come back with me") crystallizes options with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Clock introduced early (paragraph 3), trembles forward one second at the threshold decision (paragraph 11), and Leon touches it inside his coat during the arbor confrontation ("feeling its stillness challenge him"). Reweighted from symbol-of-loss to permission-dare to challenge-of-action. Not causally indispensable (the choice could occur without it) but charges two beats and the final stance. Could score higher with more direct closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Compasses introduced mid-arbor (paragraph 16), described as "turning not north but toward remembered choices." One compass flares bright in paragraph 24, needle swinging and then snapping upward, directly enabling the pathway-opening and final choice. Shape stakes (hesitation versus action) and constrain the arbor's logic. Present in closure beat when pathways unfold. Integration solid but late arrival (~40% mark) and single strong beat limit higher score.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Strategically creative" appears twice: Mara's harmonies (paragraph 23) and implicitly her choice of refuge. Label-only; no on-page action where this trait constrains or enables with visible cost. Describes rather than dramatizes. Swappable with "inventive" or "bold" without structural impact.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Refuge is Mara's stated motivation for seeking the arbor ("tired of rehearsed endings," paragraph 20) and the arbor's explicit function ("for people who choose not to choose," paragraph 25). Leon's challenge to the refuge concept drives the compass-flaring turn and final pathways. Central to thematic question and closure choice (stay in refuge versus return). Could not be swapped without rewriting core logic. Present across setup, development, and payoff with causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Film reels discovered in attic (paragraph 8), mechanics explained (slow the reel to reveal staircase, paragraph 10), and Leon enters the projection (paragraph 12). The film's nature reappears when Leon understands it as "map of possible exits" and pathways sketch "in lines of stuttering monochrome, as if drawn through hidden sections" (paragraphs 28–29). Shapes two beats (discovery and entry; closure realization) but resolution is more about the choice than the method. Functional across gates but replaceable with minor edits (magical doorway, hidden stairs).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Arbor introduced paragraph 14, detailed across paragraphs 15–16 (roots, mist-tides, compasses, bench). Environment supplies the refuge logic that Leon challenges, the swaying bench that accompanies dialogue, and the groaning-cello response when pathways open. Directly pressures choice: the arbor's nature as hesitation-shelter versus test-of-agency is the pivot. Specific properties (compasses, roots, tides) constrain the final image. Present in closure beat when arbor groans and pathways unfold. Essential to stakes and ending.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Until the horizon invited night" appears in the opening interiority (paragraph 2: "to play until the trains forgot their timetables, until the horizon invited night and still refused to close the curtain") and Mara's description of arbor-dwellers living "between beats." The phrase recurs in Leon's reply (paragraph 23). Functions as thematic accent and lyric reprise but does not tighten decisions or track elapsed time on the page. No live clock altering tactics. Lyric resonance present but swappable with another temporal image.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Mara's motivation stated explicitly (paragraph 20: "tired of rehearsed endings and wanted to surprise fate with an unplanned encore") and dramatized in her wary posture and crooked smile. Her choice at closure—to laugh and agree to "arrive offbeat, together"—enacts the motivation with visible cost (leaving refuge, accepting uncertainty). Present in setup (her disappearance, scarf, promise of duet), development (her explanation), and payoff (her final laugh and agreement). Friction between want (surprise fate) and cost (abandoning refuge) is legible. Strong integration but slightly tell-heavy in the explanation beat.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Tone established immediately ("wistful station pianist… hardened by a steely longing") and sustained through imagery: broken clock, frozen pendulum, patient tides, trembling compasses, muted trumpet voice. Modulates appropriately under pressure (grain buzzing, arbor groaning) without breaking. Final image—"we will arrive offbeat, together, as an unplanned encore"—charged by accumulated longing transformed into action. Diction coheres across all beats. "Steely longing" verbatim recurs (paragraph 22) purposefully. Tone charges the closure and remains distinct throughout.</comment>
