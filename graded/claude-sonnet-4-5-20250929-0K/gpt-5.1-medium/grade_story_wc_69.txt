<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maro's internal contradiction between past violence ("the insults he had flung as a young soldier") and present peacemaking is embodied through conducting gestures rather than stated, and his micro-choices—closing drapes, dimming lamps, placing the zither between Dari and Ilan—advance pressure. The choir members show distinct motives (Dari's beaten brother, Ilan's blamed cousins) that constrain their participation with visible hesitation. Minor deduction: the cast is large and some members remain generic placeholders without individual pressure, though the core triangle (Maro, Dari, Ilan) sustains focus at closure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece coheres through density increase and pattern break (silence → wary note → bridge tone → final tentative chord) with the zither rosette recurring to charge the ending image. Orientation anchors who/where/when clearly in the opening paragraph. One meaningful deepening occurs when Dari and Ilan move from group singing to standing together over the instrument, reweighting the dominant stake (bridging refusal). Cost is legible but oblique: "the patience that precedes" forgiveness and chairs that "shrank" show incremental change rather than a decisive rupture, landing as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in the final beat's uncertainty ("unsure whether to speak or play").</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The velvet library, wine-colored curtains, and high windows supply atmosphere and the closed drapes/dimmed lamps constrain the exercise (subtracting noise). The zither's soundhole rosette—seven interlocking hands—is handled in multiple beats and charges the closure when placed between Dari and Ilan, making it a micro-setting object that constrains the final choice. Spatial choreography (circle, chairs shrinking, standing by the zither) remains clear throughout. Minor gap: autumn and the hill above town are postcard touches that do not pressure tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (bridging ethnic/dialectal refusal) is signaled early and tightens through "the space between chairs shrank" and voices that "cracked on certain names," forcing micro-choices (waiting until tremor passes). The final beat—Dari and Ilan hovering over the zither, Maro placing it between them—narrows options with the tentative chord as a meaningful deepening that crystallizes stance. Cost is visible in the incremental erosion of barricades and the acknowledgment that "this was not forgiveness yet." One tightening point suffices for this length under Accumulative lens; escalation reads as cadence shift from group safety to dyadic risk.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme (unlearning hatred through shared vulnerability) emerges from the soundhole rosette of interlocking hands, the teaching method (listen by subtracting noise, answer only when there is space), and the closing image of the chord "between them." No explicit moralizing; the piece invites reflection through the question "not forgiveness yet, merely the patience that precedes it." The final image—tentative chord, hands hovering—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without stating a thesis. Maro's past as a young soldier who flung insults roots his present work in concrete regret rather than platitude.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV through Maro is stable; perceptual signature shows his musician's ear ("small tremor of breath," "dissonances small stings that made the moments of resonance feel honestly earned"). Diction is elevated but consistent with a reflective, educated focalizer ("traveled stillness," "unlearning hatred"). Dialogue is sparse and purposeful; Maro's lines carry subtext and advance the exercise without exposition. Minor density note: several metaphors cluster in high-concept phrasing ("question tugged at them," "music that seemed itself to have traveled stillness sewn into its seams") without overtaxing clarity, but the elevated register is unvarying—no modulation under peak stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Information density is high; sentences layer action, atmosphere, and interiority. Rhythm varies purposefully, especially in the opening lines ("quiet as frost," "music lingered there like breath between pages"). Two minor frictions: "denote" appears twice with identical usage ("to denote the circle," "those silences stand, for they too denoted a kind of music"), creating a loop, and one paraphrase near the end ("as rain ticked faintly" / "stood by the zither...unsure" rehashes the transition already clear from the scene break). Figurative language is dense but remains coherent; no mixed metaphors or register drift. The closing beat is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of music pedagogy, post-conflict reconciliation, and the zither's symbolic rosette is specific and non-obvious. The teaching method (subtracting noise, answering a note only when there is space) transforms familiar "art heals" tropes through concrete technique. Risk-taking in pacing—minimal dialogue, heavy reflection, accumulative rather than causal structure—succeeds without obscuring closure. Minor limitation: the velvet library and autumn setting lean on familiar aesthetic markers (wine curtains, quiet as frost) that do not sharply distinguish this locale from generic literary spaces.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maro's choices (asking for the room, selecting music, dimming lamps, placing the zither between Dari and Ilan) create key beats and the final turn. Present in setup, drives middle rehearsal decisions, and shapes closure by orchestrating the dyadic encounter. His attribute (traveled stillness, expectantly resigned) informs his patient method.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The zither soundhole rosette (seven interlocking hands) is handled in three distinct beats: Maro runs his thumb along it at the first session, touches it "as if to denote the circle," and places the instrument between Dari and Ilan in the closing image where the rosette catches lamplight. Early signal, causal involvement (it frames the exercise), and closure charge. Irreplaceable: the seven-hand motif encodes the story's central stake.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Vanishing arts" is named once ("teach vanishing arts") and implied through old hymnals in ten languages and the zither as handmade treasure, but it does not constrain tactics on the page—Maro could teach any repertoire. Present in setup, echoed thematically (songs "born at borders"), but the concept is more atmospheric than operational. Lyric reprise without middle development caps the score in mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Expectantly resigned" appears once as a label ("an ache worn thin and expectantly resigned") and is embodied in Maro's patience ("he let those silences stand," "he did not confess these to the choir"). The trait enables his method (not forcing progress) and informs his final gesture (placing the zither without speaking). Present early, shapes middle choices, appears at closure in Maro's silent gesture. Cost is oblique—his own past remains unspoken—but the trait alters his teaching approach.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Denote" is used twice: Maro touches the rosette "as if to denote the circle they had entered" and silences "denoted a kind of music." The action frames the entry ritual and recurs to validate pauses as meaningful. Present in setup and middle, but its closure participation is weak—the final beat shows Maro placing the zither and a chord rising, with no explicit denoting gesture. Two beats and thematic echo, but not indispensable to the ending.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"By subtracting noise" is stated explicitly ("He taught them first to listen by subtracting noise") and demonstrated through closing drapes, dimming lamps, eyes shut, and breathing until shoulders loosen. The method structures the entire exercise (answer the note only when there is space, silences that "denoted a kind of music"). Early signal, drives multiple rehearsal beats, and the final chord emerges from this practice. Mechanics matter and are shown, not merely told.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The velvet library in autumn supplies atmosphere and the music salon with bowed shelves houses the rehearsals. The closed drapes and dimmed lamps enact "subtracting noise," a small constraint that enables the exercise. Setting is present throughout, but its autumn season and hilltop location are postcard details; the room's acoustic properties or layout do not alter tactics. Two gates (setup, middle) plus a weak reprise (rain ticking on high windows at closure); functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Across unlearning hatred" is named once in narration ("the slow work across unlearning hatred") and the temporal span is marked by "Week after week they returned" and "One night, as rain ticked." Time structures the accumulation but does not tighten a decision on the page—no deadline or live clock pressures the final beat. Present as a thematic frame and middle development marker, but absent from closure as a constraining force. Lyric reprise without urgency caps mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"To braid diverse voices into harmony without asking any singer to disappear inside the chord" is Maro's explicit goal, stated in narration and dramatized through his careful song selection, conducting gestures, and the final act of placing the zither between Dari and Ilan. The desire is conflicted by his own unconfessed past, creating friction. Motivation drives setup (asking for the room), middle (choosing repertoire, waiting through silences), and closure (the tentative chord). Specific cost: patience without resolution, the risk of remaining "not forgiveness yet."</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Traveled stillness" is used twice: "walked with a traveled stillness" in the opening and "music that seemed itself to have traveled stillness sewn into its seams" in the middle. The tone—quiet, patient, weighted by history—holds across the piece and modulates only slightly under pressure (rain ticking, fingers hovering). It charges the final image ("a tentative chord rose and held") by extending the quality into the outcome. Coherent, modulates subtly, and recurs with reweighted meaning at closure.</comment>
