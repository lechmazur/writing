<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's internal conflict between pride and genuine care for the sea is embodied through concrete actions—unpacking the vial, pressing her palm to the lens—and her motivation evolves credibly under pressure. The embodied emotion is strong ("screaming tenderness that made her throat ache"), though some interiority edges toward poetic abstraction rather than character-particular thought. Jorah's transformation feels slightly rushed; his fear retreating "from the edges of his eyes" after one scent exposure lacks the resistance expected from someone who "trusted noise, blunt and heavy." The final choice is earned by prior causality with visible cost: Mara risks professional standing and Jorah's trust to enact her quieter method.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Orientation is clean by the opening paragraph (who, where, when). The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through contrasts (heat/cool, shout/whisper, horn/scent) and the closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the boats turn without the horn, Jorah's shoulders drop, and Mara's final line crystallizes her method's success with undeniable social and relational cost (she has defied protocol and altered their dynamic). One meaningful deepening occurs when the scent "purifies intentions" and the lens glows unbidden, narrowing Mara's path to full commitment. Cost is legible: she has bypassed the established system, and Jorah's whispered question signals the relationship is now on uncertain ground.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The cobalt lighthouse, cooling rail, and lamp room constrain Mara's choices—she must climb to the lens to enact her method, and the "great lens, that eye of the coast" becomes the instrument of her beckoning. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful: "cooled basalt and wet rope," "black-backed gulls mocked him," the scent of "watered earth, moonlit stone, and forgiven arguments." The post-heatwave dawn filters through Mara's relief and urgency. Spatial choreography is clear across vertical zones (platform, lamp room, harbor below), and the setting's verticality mirrors the hierarchy Mara is challenging.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake—proving whispers travel farther than shouts—is signaled early and tightens when Mara opens the vial, knowing Jorah will hear or see the result. One meaningful turn: the lens glows before the lamp is lit, forcing Mara to commit fully ("she whispered welcome, apology, and gratitude"). The fishing boats' immediate response and Jorah's climb to confront her raise the relational and professional cost. Agency is clear: Mara's decision to use the Night Garden perfume drives the escalation, and the ending choice ("I stopped shouting") forecloses the path of loud assertion with visible cost—Jorah's pallor and the "careful quiet between them."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: the sea's exhaustion under the heat wave, the fragrance that "purifies intentions," the contrast between Jorah's blunt noise and Mara's "vibrations of intent." The final image—"I stopped shouting, she said, and I asked it to forgive us, and to come home safe"—offers a resonant answer to the central question (volume vs. subtlety) without moralizing. The Night Garden vial and its history with Mara's grandmother accumulate meaning across the piece, and the scent's effect on both sea and Jorah demonstrates the theme's reach. Subtext operates in Jorah's curse falling silent mid-word and his shoulders dropping, implying his recognition without explicit concession.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and close to Mara; perceptual signature is strong ("vibrations of intent that threaded quiet as spider silk"). Diction is controlled and voice-motivated: "reluctant sorcerer of signals," "radiating anger," "a screaming tenderness." The brief grandmother flashback is concretely anchored ("old honey" cork, "years ago") and tilts the present by framing Mara's interpretation of the instruction. Jorah's dialogue ("What did you do, girl") and Mara's reply are natural and goal-driven. Under peak pressure, syntax tightens without losing clarity. Minor friction: "purifies intentions" in the fragrance description edges toward abstract diction not fully filtered through Mara's lived lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high: most lines advance character, atmosphere, or action. Figurative language is generally strong ("mist slipped from the ocean like breath easing from a feverish chest"), though density is occasionally high in non-peak beats ("vibrations of intent that threaded quiet as spider silk through the world" followed immediately by more metaphor). No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. One minor register drift: "purifies intentions" in the scent's effect reads slightly elevated for the visceral moment. The opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes effectively, and spatial choreography is clear throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The premise—magical realism in a lighthouse setting, scent versus sound—is executed with specific, grounded choices: Night Garden distilled from night-blooming flowers, the lens glowing before the lamp is lit, the boats turning without the horn. The contrast between Jorah's blunt trust in noise and Mara's belief in "lighter things" avoids binary simplicity through embodied cost (his fear, her throat ache). The grandmother's instruction recontextualized from romance to professional conflict is a fresh inflection. Risk-taking in the quiet, scent-driven climax heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. However, the magical lighthouse keeper premise echoes familiar templates (novice challenges tradition with gentler magic), and while the execution is strong, the core arc follows a recognizable shape.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara (assistant lighthouse keeper) is present throughout and her choices create the key turn: unpacking the vial, opening it at the lens, pressing her palm to the glass, and speaking the final line that defines her stance. Setup is immediate (first paragraph), middle development occurs when she climbs and uses the perfume, and payoff is her direct answer to Jorah. Her agency drives escalation and closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The vial cork appears in two beats: "stoppered with a chipped vial cork the color of old honey" (setup) and "the old cork sighing as if relieved from duty" (use). The cork's color and "sigh" add texture, but its role is ornamental—removing it does not constrain the choice or alter the scent's effect. No closure participation; the cork is not reweighted or causally active in the ending.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Vibrations of intent" is signaled early ("vibrating with everything shouted into the fog and everything merely thought"), shapes Mara's tactics ("she believed in lighter things, in the vibrations of intent"), and is enacted on the page when she presses her palm to the lens and her intent travels "down the tower, over the cliffs, into the water." The concept drives the middle choice and is causally active at closure: the boats turn in response to the intentional vibrations, and Mara's final line restates the method ("I asked it to forgive us").</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Purifies intentions" appears when the scent touches Mara's chest: "it simply, quietly, purifies intentions. Her impatience thinned, leaving behind something sharper and kinder." This moment enables her to proceed without anger, altering her internal state before the key action. The trait constrains her approach (she cannot beckon while still impatient) and touches Jorah at closure ("some old fear retreated"). Cost is visible: the purification requires her to confront and release summer anger. Setup is mid-piece; it participates in both middle and closure beats.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Beckon" is signaled early (grandmother's instruction: "You beckon not with noise"), drives the middle action ("the beam seemed to beckon them with a patient, listening pull"), and defines the climax: the boats drift inward in response to the beckoning light rather than the horn. The action is irreplaceable—shouting, calling, or summoning would alter the thematic contrast. Beckon shapes tactics (whisper, scent, patient pull) and is causally indispensable at closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"By the scent of a garden at night" is seeded via grandmother's instruction early, and the Night Garden vial is unpacked and used at the lens. The method's mechanics matter: the scent "braided with her pulse, sinking into the quartz," and the boats respond to the olfactory signal carried by the beam. The method shapes Mara's attempt (she must use the perfume, not just the light) and is causally active at closure when the crews "turn toward it at once" and Jorah smells it too. Early signal, middle enactment, closure payoff all present.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The cobalt lighthouse at dawn is present from the title line and pressures choices: Mara must climb to the lamp room to access the lens, the vertical structure stages the conflict (Jorah below, Mara above), and the lighthouse's function as a signal device is the pivot for her method. The cooling after the heat wave enables her to act ("the stone finally stopped radiating anger"). The setting supplies the tool (lens) and constrains approach (must be at the lamp to enact the beckoning). Micro-setting (lamp room, lens, rail) alters tactics and charges the final image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"After the heat wave breaks" anchors the opening and enables Mara to act—the oppressive heat that made the waves "sluggish and mean" is over, and "when the weather finally softened, when the air let people breathe again, she unpacked the small wooden box." The timeframe sets up causality (relief permits new methods) and is present in the opening and middle, but the dawn window itself does not tighten decisions or create a live clock. No escalation tied to elapsed time or deadline.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mara's motivation—"to prove that whispers travel farther than shouts"—is stated early and dramatized through her choice to use the Night Garden perfume instead of waiting for Jorah's horn. Internal friction is present: "Not for pride, though Jorah accused her of that, but because the sea itself seemed tired of being yelled at." The want (prove her method) conflicts with cost (risking Jorah's trust, defying protocol), and the final line enacts the proof with visible relational cost. Setup, development, and closure all hinge on this desire.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Screaming tenderness" appears once explicitly ("something sharper and kinder, a screaming tenderness that made her throat ache") and modulates the tone throughout: Mara's fierce care for the exhausted sea, the "patient, listening pull" of the beam, Jorah's pale confrontation that ends in "careful quiet." The oxymoron charges the final image—Mara's whispered answer is both gentle and defiant. Tone is coherent through turns, intensifies under pressure, and supports closure without becoming static.</comment>
