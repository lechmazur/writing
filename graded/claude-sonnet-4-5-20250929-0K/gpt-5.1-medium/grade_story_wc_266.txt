<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's flight and choice are rooted in believable fear versus nascent courage, and the metaphor of the broken leash is sustained through micro-choices. However, her interiority leans toward elevated register ("the thin tether between a frightened life and the small, unused courage inside it") rather than embodied specificity under pressure, and the ferry guides remain observational archetypes without a choice that alters the ending. The stairway sequence dramatizes memory as constraint, but the star-stamp passage veers close to symbolic convenience rather than earned psychological progression.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece infers an Accumulative/Textural lens and delivers Resonant Reconfiguration via the final breath-and-star answer, reweighting prior imagery with conceptual cost. Orientation anchors (Mara, ridgeway, ferry house) arrive by ~15% and transitions are legible. The closure image ("the star within her answered") reconfigures the "unused courage" motif with felt cost, though the cost remains oblique—she has descended but her father's silence and the shop's future hang unresolved. One meaningful deepening occurs in the stairway spiral, sufficient for this length under the chosen lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The harbor mist, cliff path, and ferry house on stilts are vivid and purposeful, and the stairway spiral constrains Mara's descent through memory-triggered steps. Sensory detail is filtered through urgency (lungs burning, mist-slick walkway, tar and salt scent) and the setting charges the closure image. The ridgeway functions as both physical and metaphorical pressure. Spatial choreography is clear throughout, and the body-as-setting element (the star sinking into her chest) charges the final beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Mara's flight from the family shop versus finding her courage—is signaled early and coheres under the Accumulative lens. The stairway descent tightens options through memory-revealed costs (swallowed words, undefended friend, unseen brochure), and the final hum narrows her stance. However, the ferry guides' role is passive; they frame but do not oppose, so pressure remains internal and one-note. The cost at closure is conceptual rather than viscerally felt on the page, meeting the minimum but not exceeding it.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the leash/courage/crossing motif without overt moralizing, and the final image reweights prior particulars (the star, the shoreline lullaby hum) into a resonant answer. Subtext operates in the guides' weathered tenderness and Mara's list of silences. The stairway as internal traverse avoids allegory-as-answer by grounding each memory in specific cost. The ending resists a stated moral, offering instead an embodied breath and response that reconfigures the opening question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV distance is stable third-limited on Mara; focalization is clean and no head-hopping occurs. The prose carries a distinct lyric texture ("mist held the harbor like a breath not yet decided between sigh and song"), though elevated diction occasionally drifts from Mara's embodied state under stress. Dialogue is minimal but functional; the guides' lines carry subtext and goal (to signal passage). Under peak pressure (the stairway descent), syntax compresses appropriately, but earlier beats lean toward writerly register rather than character-particular perception.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Sentence openings vary and rhythm modulates with scene pressure. However, the piece carries moderate overwriting: figurative density in the opening and guide-dialogue beats ("like a breath not yet decided," "a tide-line curve etched by many midnights," "through darkness that thinned not by lamps but by memory") without strict pattern-teaching. Mixed metaphor in "the leash around her chest had snapped" (leash as internal tether, then physical constraint) and repetitive "she saw" stems in the stairway sequence. Information density is generally high, but the elevated register in peak beats (the stairway, the final hum) dilutes immediacy. Apply −0.6 for density and stem repetition in Q7 only.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The ferry-as-internal-crossing premise transforms the threshold-crossing trope through specific micro-setting (stilted ferry house, ticket punch marking passage in air) and the stairway-of-memory mechanism. The ending's quiet certainty (star answering breath) feels earned in hindsight and avoids the explain-everything trap. However, the wise-elder-guides and courage-journey frame echo widespread templates; the story individualizes through lyricism and the micro-turn of the star-stamp, but does not fully escape the derivative guardrail. Risk-taking in structure (long descent through reflection) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, meriting modest bonus within band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The ferry guides appear in three beats (opening vigil, door greeting, ticket-punch blessing) and frame the crossing, but make no choice that alters Mara's tactics or the ending. They observe and bless; Mara's descent is solitary. Early signal and thematic coherence present, but causal pressure and closure linkage absent. Swappable with generic threshold-keepers.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The ticket punch appears in two beats: the man lifts it as explanation, then clips the air before Mara's chest, imprinting the star that reappears in the final line ("the star within her answered"). Early signal, causal enablement (marks her passage), and closure linkage present. However, the mechanism feels symbolic rather than tactically constraining—Mara would descend regardless. Specificity (star stamp) charges the ending image, preventing full swappability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The vigil-in-twilight frames the opening ("This night began their vigil in twilight") and the ferry house exists in perpetual dusk, but the concept does not constrain Mara's choices on the page. It enriches atmosphere and tone, and the "purple so thick it felt like walking inside a bruise" image charges the ridgeway beat, but the vigil remains thematic backdrop. Lyric reprise (twilight → "darkness that thinned...by memory") reweights but does not alter tactics.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Gently persistent" describes the ache in Mara's ribs that pushes her onward after the leash snaps. It appears once, drives her flight up the ridgeway, and distinguishes her fear from her compulsion. However, the trait is label-only after introduction; no visible tradeoff or cost tied specifically to gentleness versus urgency. Functional in one beat, swappable with "insistent" or "quiet."</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Traverse anchors the core action: Mara traverses the ridgeway, the cliff path, and finally the stairway through memory. The guides explicitly name it ("the water you must traverse lies inside you") and each step down the spiral is a traverse-action with memory as terrain. The verb redefines the ferry crossing from physical to internal, driving the central turn. Removing "traverse" and its mechanics would collapse the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Through indirect routes" is signaled early by the man ("Right places…are usually found through indirect routes") and enacted in the stairway spiral, where Mara's descent is not linear but memory-triggered. The method shapes the mechanics of her crossing and primes the reader for the internal journey. However, it does not constrain a middle choice—Mara follows the path given—so causal pressure is modest. Closure linkage is thematic rather than tactical.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The veiled ridgeway appears in one extended beat (Mara's flight through fog, "where fog gave every stone a ghost to wear") and provides the spatial link between harbor and ferry house. It charges atmosphere and supplies the "purple so thick it felt like walking inside a bruise" image. Early signal and one key turn (her arrival at the cliff path) present, but the ridgeway does not constrain tactics afterward—once she reaches the ferry house, it is static. Purposeful but replaceable with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"After the leash breaks" is seeded in the guides' opening murmur and enacted when Mara's metaphorical leash snaps at dinner, triggering her flight. The timeframe tightens all subsequent action: she runs until exhaustion, reaches the ferry house at dusk, and descends the stairway in one continuous sequence. The clock is felt (lungs burning, twilight deepening) and drives urgency. Closure linkage is implicit—the star answers only after the descent completes. Two gates and causal pressure present.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The motivation "to find where unused courage waits" is articulated by the woman guide and immediately recognized by Mara ("I do not know if I have any courage"). It drives her descent and is tested in each memory-step (swallowed words, undefended friend, hidden brochure). The final breath-and-star answer dramatizes the finding. However, the friction between want and cost is told more than shown—Mara's choice to descend faces no on-page obstacle or tradeoff. Functional across beats but lacks embodied resistance.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The "shoreline lullaby" tone is introduced in the opening ("their silence had the softness of a shoreline lullaby") and sustained through lyric cadence, muted diction, and the steady hum at closure ("like a shoreline lullaby played on a single held note"). Tone modulates from hushed vigil to panicked flight to meditative descent without breaking coherence, and the final image charges the lullaby motif with resolution. Coheres through all turns and shapes the ending's emotional register, meeting high integration.</comment>
