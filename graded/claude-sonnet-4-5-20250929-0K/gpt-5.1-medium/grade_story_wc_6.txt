<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maris's interior life is richly embodied through concrete details—"boots sinking into hot sand as if wading through years she preferred not to own"—and her choices under pressure show contradictory impulses (father's voice versus chief's voice carried "like tools in the same hand"). The final act of threading her father's coin onto the boy's jar demonstrates earned character change rooted in prior causality. Minor weakness: the boy's motivation feels slightly convenient, arriving fully formed without friction, though his trembling and the jar's weight keep him grounded.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Maris's gesture of returning the coin *with* the jar reweights her relationship to her father's legacy with visible cost (surrendering the "only thing of her father's the court had not burned"). The causal lens holds throughout; her choice to graft one story to another arises from established interior pressure and the boy's plea. Orientation is swift (who/where/when anchored by line 5), and the single meaningful tightening—fire advancing while she decides whether to turn her back—narrows options with felt stakes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The obsidian lagoon and volcanic black sand constrain the boy's presence and charge the final image; the setting provides both the curse's origin and the site where Maris's father "wanted fire where the water could watch." Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful: "salt clung to the smoke, softening the smell," "marram grass," "kelp-drift peace curling in slow hieroglyphs." Spatial choreography is clear (dune crest, water line, advancing fire). The setting drives one key choice (Maris positions her body between boy and flame) but does not escalate further, keeping it just shy of the high band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—saving the boy while honoring compassion over her father's crimes—is signaled early and tightens when she must "turn her back on the flame for a moment." The calculus ("water, distance, wind") and her choice to carry both voices show agency under pressure. The fire's advance provides escalating threat, and her decision to thread the coin visibly forecloses a path (she can never reclaim that last possession). Cost is legible, though the water-crew arrival deflates the physical danger slightly before full resolution.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme—legacy, compassion as reply rather than rejection, and the sharing of burdens—emerges organically through action and image without overt statement. The ending delivers a resonant, non-literal answer: "curses break easier when you let someone else hold the jar for a while" reweights the premise through the grafted coin, a specific particular that deepens prior material. The line "something quiet inside finally ease" risks slight abstraction but is anchored by the on-page gesture and the boy's "shuddering breath," keeping thematic payoff concrete.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and controlled: "a silent calculus she had learned in academy drills and childhood nights alike," "fire loved distraction." Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during crisis, pulling back for lyric observation of the lagoon). The boy's dialogue—"cursed him with restless feet"—carries natural idiom and subtext. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping. Minor slip: "obsidian lagoon beneath the dunes" repeats verbatim twice within a short span, creating a slight template echo that doesn't obscure but nudges rhythm toward predictability.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and imagery is dense: "kelp-drift peace curling in slow hieroglyphs," "eyes, dark as wet pumice." Information density is high; most lines advance character, setting, or pressure. Two minor artifacts: "obsidian lagoon beneath the dunes" appears identically twice (paraphrase loop), and "the migration of clouds" recurs without reweighting, creating faint template cadence. These don't obscure causality but dull momentum slightly. No filter-verb stacks or register drift; clarity and propulsion remain strong overall.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The premise—arsonist's daughter as firefighter—transforms a familiar trope through specific lived detail: the drilled coin, the volcanic sand curse, the lagoon as both crime scene and redemption site. The ending's synthesis (threading coin to jar) feels earned and non-obvious, rooted in prior particulars. Risk-taking in the lyric compression ("hose couplings and safety checks" as emotional language) heightens without obscuring. Slight echo of redemption-arc templates, but the specificity of the graft metaphor and the boy's agency lift it above median execution.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maris's identity as arsonist's daughter firefighter shapes every beat: her memory of the pier fire, her silent calculus, her choice to carry both father's and chief's voices, and the climactic decision to thread the coin. Removing this element breaks the story's logic and closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Black sand appears in three beats (boy's jar at water line, Maris's recognition of curse-thinking, the grafted return), drives the boy's presence and Maris's empathy, and charges the closure by grounding the "give it back together" directive in a concrete object with reweighted meaning and visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Unyielding compassion is named once ("the chief called it") and demonstrated in Maris's choice to save the boy and return the coin despite personal cost. It shapes the dominant stake but does not generate visible friction or tactical constraint beyond the single climactic choice, keeping it mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Gracefully alert" appears in the opening line and informs Maris's perceptual signature (noticing crackles, running calculus, reading the boy's urgency). It enables her successful rescue but does not constrain a choice or create visible cost; it functions as consistent trait rather than dramatic lever.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The graft—threading the coin onto the jar—is the story's climactic turn, redefining the boy's solitary return into a shared burden and Maris's relationship to her father's legacy. Removing this exact action collapses the closure; no near-synonym could replace it without losing thematic and causal integrity.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The drilled coin on red thread is signaled mid-story as "the only thing of her father's the court had not burned," appears in Maris's pocket under pressure, and becomes the graft mechanism at closure. Its unique properties (foreign, drilled, threaded, last possession) make it irreplaceable and causally active in the final image.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The obsidian lagoon is introduced early, anchors the boy's location and the curse belief, and serves as the site of both the father's crime and Maris's redemptive gesture. It pressures Maris's memory and the boy's presence, shaping two key beats and participating in closure as the return destination.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"During the migration of clouds" appears twice as atmospheric detail but does not tighten decisions or track elapsed time in a way that alters tactics. The fire's advance provides urgency, not the clouds; the timeframe remains ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The motivation "to prove that scars can sing, not just scream" is dramatized through Maris's choice to graft the coin rather than reject or hide her father's legacy. It drives the climactic decision with visible cost (surrendering the coin) and friction (carrying both father's and chief's voices), though it is articulated once in summary before being enacted.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Kelp-drift peace" appears once as a lyric descriptor and sets a contemplative undertone that modulates with the fire's urgency and eases at the ending ("something quiet inside finally ease"). Tone coheres and charges the final image, though the single static phrase limits its developmental arc across beats.</comment>
