<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's embodied interiority is strong—she inhales "not smelling anything, yet sensing how stories condensed here, drop by drop"—and the client's grief is felt through gesture ("blinking hard"). The parallel loss (her smell, his grandmother) drives the central dynamic. Minor slip: the client's shift from "I do not know how to read pauses" to accepting ambiguity feels slightly compressed, though the screw-placement ritual earns it. Internal contradiction and micro-choices under pressure meet the 9+ bar with a hairline gap in the final turn's embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the screw installation reweights grief into "ordinary miracles" with visible cost ("does not fix her absence"). The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—water-clock motifs accrue until the screw becomes a gravity point. Orientation anchors quickly (aromatherapist, shop, fog). One tightening deepens the dominant stake (humanizing absence). Cost is legible but slightly abstract ("humanizes the time that follows"), keeping it shy of 9+.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The water clocks constrain and charge every beat: Mara unscrews a bolt, the screw is placed "beneath the channel," water "pooled above the new metal." The shop's "trembling calm of ticking water" filters all perception. Fog anchors the opening, then lifts as interior density increases—environmental shift tracks causally. The screw's placement alters the spatial logic of the climax, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (humanizing grief through ritual) signals early and tightens in one decisive act: placing the screw. The client's agency is soft (he protests "not how physics works" but assents), so the turn hinges more on Mara's decision. Cost is felt ("does not fix her absence") but not viscerally dramatized—no live forfeiture on the page. Under the Accumulative lens, the deepening is sufficient, but protagonist-driven escalation is muted, capping the score below 8.5.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through water-clock particulars: time as "hesitant confession," the screw as "point of quiet gravity." The ending's "I do not have to see everything clearly to continue" reweights the opening's occluded views without stating a moral. Mara's last line ("unveil ordinary miracles") risks label-speak but is anchored by prior ritual. The core question—reading meaning through absence—lands with resonance, though "ordinary miracles" echoes the prompt phrase slightly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Mara "listened to the world as if scent might suddenly return," the client sees clocks as "hazy constellations." Diction is lyric but controlled ("water...a slow heart leaking grains...instead of blood"). Dialogue carries subtext ("you think it is broken...but you are afraid you are"). No head-hopping. Minor slip: "the world writes what we need inside the pauses" edges toward essayistic register, though it reads as Mara's idiom.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies (short "It does" / long lyric builds). High density: "damp air rolled in like a quiet wave" advances mood and transition in one image. No loops or scaffold. Minor overwriting in the opening third: "mapped emotional terrain" repeats across two sentences, and "trembling calm of ticking water" stacks modifiers. The closure beat is clean. Figurative language is coherent but dense—"river deltas," "constellations," "condensed...drop by drop"—approaching but not crossing the penalty threshold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The water-clock repair shop as grief-processing space transforms a familiar trope (object as ritual anchor). The screw-as-memory synthesis is specific and non-obvious. Risk: lyric accumulation without causal spine could alienate some readers, but the lens holds. Derivative friction: "reading between lines" and "ordinary miracles" echo self-help idiom, and the parallel loss (smell/grandmother) is a known template. Specificity (midwife's birthing clamp screw, water-clock mechanics) mitigates but does not fully erase the template shadow.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Mara (aromatherapist who lost smell) is present in setup, drives the screw-placement decision at closure, and her parallel loss shapes the emotional logic. Her attribute (mapping by listening) enables the ritual. Causal pressure is strong, but the client's grief dominates the surface conflict, so Mara's arc is supportive rather than foregrounded in all beats.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The midwife's birthing clamp screw appears early (tin rattling), is handled and placed in the climax, and charges the final image ("water pooled above the new metal"). Its specificity (size, threading, stain) and irreplaceability (grandmother's occupation, "hands that once caught lives") are high. Removal would collapse the closure. Three-gate presence, closure linkage, and visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Reading between lines" is named early ("reading between lines people barely knew they drew"), constrains Mara's method ("let us fix something...not what you expect"), and the client's admission ("I do not know how to read pauses") pivots the ritual. It shapes one key turn and returns at closure ("keep walking" without clarity). Functional across beats but not irreplaceable—"interpreting silence" could substitute with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Maps emotional terrain" is stated twice (perfumes/smoke, then listening) and enables Mara's diagnosis ("you think it is broken...you are afraid you are"). It constrains her tactic (ritual instead of repair). Cost is implied (loss of scent forced the shift). Present in setup and middle, with closure participation via her final sensing of "stories condensed...drop by drop." Solid integration, shy of indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Humanize" is named at the climax ("humanizes the time that follows") and defines the ritual's goal. It drives the screw-placement turn and reweights the stake from repair to meaning-making. The client's final acceptance ("I do not have to see everything clearly") traces to this action. Strong causal role, but late explicit naming (appears only in final third) and replaceability ("honor," "sanctify") prevent top-band score.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Through occluded views" is signaled early (fog, rippled glass, "let him remain an outline") and sustained (blurred vision, hazy constellations). It shapes Mara's tactic (obscurity as teaching tool) and charges the closure ("do not have to see everything clearly"). Method is present in two beats and at the end. Functional but not mechanically irreplaceable—"partial sight" could serve similarly.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The water clock repair shop anchors every beat: Mara "wound valves, checked brass floats," the tall glass columns provide spatial choreography, and the "oldest clock" supplies the climax mechanism. Setting is setup, development (shop rituals pressure the client's doubt), and payoff (the screw placement). Removal breaks the closure. Essential across the arc.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Morning fog" frames the opening and lifts at closure ("Morning thinned outside, the fog lifting"), marking temporal progression. It supports the occluded-views motif but does not constrain a choice or tighten a decision. Lyric reprise reweights atmosphere but not stakes. Present in setup and ending; weak middle development limits the score.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Unveil ordinary miracles" is named in the final line and motivates Mara's ritual ("labor into ordinary miracles," "humanizes the time"). Her loss of scent creates friction (she "would never again distill comfort into bottles, yet she could still try"). Setup and closure participation are strong, but the motivation is told more than dramatized in conflicted micro-choices. Cost is visible but not viscerally tested on the page.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>"Trembling calm" is established early ("trembling calm of ticking water"), sustained through "quiet wave," "soft percussion of dripping," and modulates at closure ("tenderly dense"). Tone charges the final image and coheres across turns. It does not flatten under the grief beat. Strong tonal control that supports but does not independently drive a choice, placing it in the high-functional band.</comment>
