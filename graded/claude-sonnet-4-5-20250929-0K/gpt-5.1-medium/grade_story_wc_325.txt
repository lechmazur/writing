<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Noah's claustrophobia and need to "stand by the unremembered" create a coherent internal conflict that drives his choices under pressure. The final decision—turning for the exit while the sphere "whispers of return"—reads as Charged Poise: options crystallize, cost is felt, but the choice itself remains poised rather than executed on the page. Interiority is concrete and embodied ("claustrophobic panic," "cold water" crawling up his spine), though the therapy-adjacent phrasing "need to stand by the unremembered" and the reflective blocks about forgotten engineers approach but do not cross into diagnostic label-speak. Minor penalty for the slightly elevated register in reflective passages that edges toward philosophical summary rather than immediate perception.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure arrives as Charged Poise: Noah turns for the exit with the sphere "whispering of return," crystallizing the choice between payday and witness with undeniable pressure and felt cost. The causal lens holds cleanly—discovery of the codex leads to the thread, thread leads to the sphere, sphere's properties trigger the choice—and orientation anchors (who, where, when) land within the first few paragraphs. One tightening occurs when the rig translates the gold fleck into a guiding thread, narrowing Noah's options and pulling him deeper; the tidal clock adds a second pressure layer. The cost is legible in the final image: he exits but the sphere's whisper charges his departure with renunciation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The undersea facility is vividly realized through selective, pressure-driven detail: cables like "black roots," rust flakes in stairwells, observation window "starred by pressure fractures." Spatial choreography remains clear across descent, and the tidal equilibrium directly constrains the mission window, shaping tactics. The sphere's "almost negative" weight and the rig's visor-thread function as micro-setting elements that charge the final choice. The crashing hush recurs purposefully, modulating from external threat to internal echo, and the gold fleck guides navigation, transforming setting detail into causal infrastructure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>One dominant stake—retrieve the artifact before the tide shifts—is signaled early and tightened by the rig's temporal-drift warning. A second deepening occurs when Noah realizes the sphere contains "captured presence," reweighting the job from salvage to ethical witness. The final choice between escape and staying "with the sphere a little longer" narrows options with visible cost: he turns to leave, foreclosing the path of witness, yet the sphere's whisper ensures the price is felt. Agency is clear; coincidence does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme—what we owe the forgotten, the cost of listening versus profiting—emerges through concrete particulars: the codex's ruined pages, the engineers' ghost transmissions, the sphere that "caught the unnoticed thoughts." The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: Noah chooses the payday but cannot unhear the whisper, leaving the tension unresolved and the ethical calculus open. No overt moralizing; the final image reweights prior material (the "unremembered voices") without stating a thesis. The lab notes' description of separating "memory from information like cream from milk" provides fresh conceptual texture without becoming allegorical.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited throughout; perceptual signature is consistent (Noah filters setting through tactile dread and ethical responsibility). Diction is controlled and voice-motivated, though occasional elevated phrasing—"the arterial undersea links that once fed continents their whispers"—edges toward lyric register that slightly exceeds a working spelunker's likely idiom under stress. Filter verbs ("told himself," "thought of") appear but remain sparse and voice-appropriate. The phrase "crashing hush" recurs purposefully, charging atmosphere without becoming mechanical. No head-hopping; psychic distance is intentional.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is clear, concrete, and propulsive with high information density—most sentences advance setting, character, or stakes. Figurative language is controlled: "the sea above breathed like a sleeping beast," "cables ran along the ceiling like black roots." No paraphrase loops or template cadence; sentence openings vary. Minor deduction for one moment of slight overwriting: "the arterial undersea links that once fed continents their whispers" stacks metaphor and elevated diction in a way that momentarily slows the beat. The final line—"the sphere whispering of return"—is vivid and specific, charging closure without sentimentality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The premise—undersea data archaeology meets ethical salvage—synthesizes familiar salvage-mission and forgotten-tech tropes through specific, grounded choices: the tidal-window constraint, the visor rig that tracks "electromagnetic ghosts," the sphere that separates "memory from information like cream from milk." The core concept (undersea cables as unconscious conduit) offers a fresh angle on surveillance infrastructure. The emotional calculus—payday versus witness—avoids binary resolution, and the final image (turning away while the sphere whispers) feels earned rather than imposed. Some proximity to broader "liminal salvage" genre conventions, but the execution is specific enough to avoid derivative penalties.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Noah's claustrophobia and ethical drive shape his descent choices and the final decision to leave; the character's internal conflict between profit and witness is dramatized across multiple beats and directly informs the Charged Poise ending. Introduced early, active in the middle (following the thread despite panic), and central to closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The gold fleck appears in the archive room, triggers the rig to project a guiding thread, and "tugs" the visor toward the sphere in the core lab, reappearing with reweighted meaning. It functions as a calibrant that links codex to sphere, enabling the descent. Present in three beats (discovery, thread projection, sphere resonance) and participates in closure by completing the causal chain. Swappability is low—its resonance property is specific—but its role is more enabling than constraining.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Undersea cables frame the facility's original purpose (listening to data storms and leaks) and motivate the experiment that created the sphere. The cables are described vividly and anchor the world logic, but they do not constrain Noah's choices directly; he navigates the facility's physical space, not the cables themselves. Present in setup and thematic payoff (the sphere's content derives from cable traffic), but lacking middle development as a tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The rig that "tracks invisible things" is introduced early, enables Noah to follow the gold-fleck thread through the facility, and flashes a temporal-drift warning that triggers the exit choice. It appears in at least three beats (initial description, thread projection, final warning) and directly shapes tactics and closure. The device's specificity (rendering EM ghosts as visor threads) makes it irreplaceable; swapping it for a generic scanner would require structural rewrites.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The action of return structures the entire piece: Noah's decision to turn for the exit is the climactic choice, charged by the sphere's whisper. The concept of return also echoes in the tidal cycle and the sphere's invitation to "stay a little longer." Present in setup (the escape window), middle pressure (the ticking clock), and closure (the physical turn toward the exit). The ending image—"the sphere whispering of return"—makes the action indispensable and redefines the stakes from binary escape to haunted departure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Phase transitions are described in the lab notes as the method for separating memory from information ("freezing and boiling its quantum states"), explaining how the sphere works. The method is signaled and its mechanics matter to understanding the artifact's function, but it does not shape Noah's attempts or tactics on the page—he does not perform or interact with phase transitions. Present in setup via notes and thematically relevant, but lacks middle or closure participation as an active constraint.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The forgotten research facility pressures every choice: the tidal-window constraint forces urgency, the facility's layout (stairwells, archive room, core lab) structures the descent, and the observation window's pressure fractures signal danger. The setting supplies the codex, rig-guiding architecture, and the sphere itself. Spatial choreography is clear and the facility's abandonment charges Noah's ethical stake. Present across all three gates (setup, middle navigation, closure in the core lab) and indispensable to plot and tone.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The tidal equilibrium that allows four hours of access is signaled early, tracked through the rig's temporal-drift warning, and directly triggers Noah's exit decision. The timeframe tightens tactics (he cannot linger) and adds urgency to the final choice. Present in setup, pressures the middle descent, and participates in closure by forcing the turn. The ticking clock is legible and creates visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Noah's motivation—"a need to stand by the unremembered"—is introduced early, contrasted with the payday motive, and dramatized in the final choice: leave rich or stay with the voices. The friction between profit and witness creates the story's ethical tension and forecloses a path at closure. Present in interiority across multiple beats (thinking of forgotten engineers, the ethical weight of the sphere) and central to the Charged Poise ending. Slightly elevated phrasing ("stand by the unremembered") edges toward abstraction but remains grounded in concrete choices.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The tone of "crashing hush"—muted, pressurized quiet—is established in the opening line ("the sea above breathed like a sleeping beast") and recurs with variation ("a damp thud," "sound dulled at once," "the sphere whispering"). Tone modulates with pressure: external silence in the entry sequence, interior dread during descent, final ambiguity in the sphere's whisper. The tone charges the final image by sustaining the paradox of loud silence, making the ending resonate without overt statement. Coherent through turns and indispensable to atmosphere.</comment>
