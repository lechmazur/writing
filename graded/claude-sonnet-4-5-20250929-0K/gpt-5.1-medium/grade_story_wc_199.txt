<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lio's interiority is sustained through concrete micro-choices—prodding leaves, building monuments, answering the voice aloud—and the final planting decision feels earned by prior causality. The character remains consistent across beats, translating listening into action with visible cost (opening the floor, pressing seeds). Weakness: the transformation lacks embodied contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene; Lio's progression reads more as steady realization than internal conflict. The voice's appearance bypasses genuine struggle, delivering insight rather than forcing Lio to wrestle competing desires.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The arbor, leaves, and monuments accumulate meaning across beats; the moonstone leaf triggers a deepening that reweights Lio's sorting into an alphabet the valley can share. Closure lands on-page with Lio planting seeds, a Decisive Change with felt cost (stepping from listening into speaking). Orientation is anchored early (arbor, Lio, seed-sorting). Weakness: the voice's arrival and leaf-map feel slightly convenient, delivering the pattern rather than forcing Lio to decode it through prior pressure. The causal chain from sorting to planting is present but leans on the voice's exposition.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The ashen arbor, hollowed trunk, and heartwood grooves are tactile and specific, shaping Lio's workspace and constraining choices (guiding leaves, building monuments along inner bark). The moonstone leaf and leaf-map charge the final beat, making setting an active pressure. Sensory detail (wet stone and sap, mossy coolness) reflects urgency and anchors the voice's arrival. Minor slip: the valley below remains abstract; spatial choreography inside the arbor is clear, but the larger geography stays postcard-level.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—decode the message in falling leaves—is signaled early and tightens when the moonstone leaf offers a map. Lio's final choice (planting the questions) is protagonist-driven and forecloses the prior stance with on-page cost (opening the floor, pressing seeds into roots). Weakness: escalation reads as one meaningful deepening rather than sustained pressure; the voice's invitation arrives without prior resistance or trade-off, so the turn feels more gift than earned reversal. Under the Accumulative lens, the pattern-break is sufficient but not maximally charged.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—listening versus speaking, absence versus presence, alphabet without sound—emerges through monuments to forgotten things and the leaf-map's ghost streams. The ending reweights sorting as punctuation in a larger sentence, offering a non-literal answer (planting questions to grow shareable answers). Subtext operates in the voice's tenderness and Lio's fear of misunderstanding. Minor weakness: "the valley felt a new story beginning" edges toward assertion; the final image (seeds pressed into roots, sky brightening) carries the resonance more cleanly without the summary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited; perceptual signature (prodding leaves, building monuments) is character-particular. Diction is controlled and lyric, with purposeful compression ("mossy delight tingling in veins"). The voice's dialogue feels natural and purposeful. Weakness: a few register slips approach ornamental lyricism ("remembered promise that refused to land," "slow green comets") where the texture slightly exceeds narrative necessity. Dialogue advances the thematic question cleanly, and filter verbs ("feeling a coolness seep," "realized the pattern") fit the reflective mode.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies across beats; figurative language is dense but mostly coherent. Information density is high (each monument, each leaf touch advances understanding). Weaknesses: several paraphrase loops—"sorted them not just by shape, but by the stories they whispered" echoes earlier sorting descriptions; "the monuments to forgotten things are how the valley remembers what it has not yet experienced" restates the alphabet concept without new pressure. Template cadence in monument descriptions (proverb/husks, letter/stems, word/seed) reads slightly mechanical. Final third avoids these patterns, so closure remains clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of skyborne arbor, seed-sorting as decoding, and monuments to forgotten things feels specific and non-obvious. The transformation of sorting into an alphabet that remembers the not-yet-experienced offers a fresh angle on folklore-as-answer tropes. Risk: the lyric frame and quiet closure commit fully to the premise. Weakness: the arbor-as-question and leaves-as-answers premise echoes familiar "ancient tree holds wisdom" templates; specificity (moonstone cabochon dust speck, ghost streams) elevates but does not fully escape the archetype. The final planting choice is inevitable in hindsight, raising the score.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Lio's choices—sorting, prodding, monument-building, answering aloud, and planting—create the key turns. Present throughout, causally active in middle beats, and decisive at closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The moonstone cabochon dust speck appears in the climactic leaf, triggers the voice and leaf-map, and pulses "like a tiny, patient heart" in the final decision. Used across three beats with reweighted meaning; irreplaceable trigger for the turn.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Regional folklore frames the premise (arbor sprouted from a question, drops answers) and shapes Lio's stake. Present early, referenced in middle, and echoed at closure ("the valley felt a new story"). Functional but somewhat ornamental; the concept could be replaced with another myth without breaking the core arc.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Emerges transformed always" is told folklore, not an on-page constraint. Lio's transformation is enacted (planting seeds, stepping into speaking), but the attribute itself is label-only and does not visibly cost Lio or alter tactics.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Prod" recurs across beats (prodding leaves with a twig to guide them), directly shapes Lio's method, and distinguishes the sorter's agency. The final planting uses hands instead, marking a shift. The action is essential to the sorting-to-speaking arc.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Building tiny monuments to forgotten things" is signaled early, demonstrated across three examples (proverb/husks, letter/stems, word/seed), and reframed by the voice as alphabet-building. The method shapes middle beats and is causally linked to the closure (monuments echo hidden currents). Mechanics matter and constrain Lio's listening posture.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The ashen skyborne arbor anchors all action, provides the hollowed trunk workspace, and its roots receive the planted seeds at closure. The inner bark hosts monuments; branches encircle Lio. Micro-setting that alters tactics (guiding leaves to niches, opening the floor).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"During the hush where past meets prophecy" is poetic framing, present in the fourth paragraph. It sets tone but does not tighten decisions or track elapsed time. The timeframe remains vague and does not alter tactics; "one hush-dim hour" is noted once without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"To decode the message in falling leaves" is stated twice, dramatized through sorting and monument-building, and tested at closure when Lio chooses planting over continued listening. Friction between the desire to listen and the cost of never speaking is embodied in the final choice.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Mossy delight" appears once ("mossy delight tingling in veins") when Lio catches the moonstone leaf. The tone is lyric and tender throughout, modulating slightly with the voice's arrival and final planting. Coherent but not dynamically charged; the single mossy-delight moment does not recur or reshape the ending image.</comment>
