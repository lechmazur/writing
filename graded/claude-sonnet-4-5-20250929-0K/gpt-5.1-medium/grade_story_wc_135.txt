<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's interior is sustained through specific embodied details (salt-wet boards soaking her skirt, the valve's chill against her wrist) and her archival motivation shapes micro-choices throughout. The final beat—waiting reactively until Caven reaches for the valve and produces the tremulous note—embodies her core contradiction of passive agency without therapy-speak. Old Caven's characterization is economical: his scarred throat and sea-salt beard give him texture, and his hesitant attempt to sound again feels earned by the exile backstory. Minor deduction: the crowd's collective awakening ("shoulders uncurling") verges on summary rather than individuated reaction, slightly flattening the interpersonal pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The piece anchors who/where/when cleanly in the opening paragraph and sustains a single continuous scene on the harbor. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: Mara's walking, listening, and fragment-gathering intensify through "staggered intervals" until the crowd assembles and Caven's tremulous note reweights the absence-as-music motif with palpable cost (his uncertainty, the city's unfulfilled hope). Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the question-like note crystallizes options without resolving them, and the cost—exile's lasting scar, communal silence—is felt on the page. One causal hairline: the crowd's arrival feels more summoned by narrative necessity than by traceable on-page causality, though the misted light and Mara's placement of the valve provide some spatial logic.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The ivory harbor gleaming "like a polished bone" and the "bruised, retreating sky" anchor tone and establish the post-storm setting with sensory precision. The seawall, bollards, and salt-wet boards constrain Mara's movement and focus her attention on debris, satisfying the micro-setting test. The harbor's spatial choreography is clear: quay stones, pier edge, harbor center, and the shift from shuttered windows to open ones track the return of the exiles. The trumpet valve resting on the bollard as "a small sun of tarnished brass" charges the final image by making the object a beacon that draws Caven forward, meeting the 9+ gate for environment shaping the closure moment.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—compiling fragments into meaning before the tide edits them—is signaled early and sustained through Mara's systematic archival walk. Pressure tightens when she finds the herald's valve and identifies it as Caven's, narrowing her task to one specific absence. The ending crystallizes the stake: Caven's thin note is the first live sound attempting harmony, and Mara's reactive stance ("met his gaze without expectation") embodies the cost of waiting for others to act. One meaningful deepening occurs when she shifts from collecting objects to "charting not the debris but the absences themselves," reweighting her method. Minor gap: the crowd's assembly lacks a traceable catalyst beyond Mara's placement of the valve, slightly softening the escalation's causal bite.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The theme of navigated absences emerges organically through Mara's method, the blank rectangles in her notebook, and the metaphor of "rests as important as notes." The piece resists overt moralizing; instead, the final tremulous note—"a question above the ivory harbor"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to whether fragments can cohere without forcing resolution. The exile motif reweights from political punishment to collective silence and tentative return, and the "unsure music" charges the ending by refusing closure while making the cost (Caven's scarred voice, the city's broken confidence) undeniable. The story earns wisdom through Mara's specific practice rather than assertion: "Hope…was just another kind of fragment, powerful only when placed beside others at the right angle."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The third-person limited POV holds steady on Mara's perceptual signature: her archivist's eye for categorization (glass, bone, string, words), her reactive waiting, and her selective attention to what the storm left behind. Diction is purposeful and controlled—"reactively visionary," "exile that had emptied the harbor of its loudest voices," "absences beginning…to navigate themselves toward meaning"—with rhythmic modulation that breathes during reflective beats and tightens during the crowd scene. Caven's silent gesture (lifting the valve, breathing the note) avoids dialogue clutter and lets action carry subtext. Minor slip: "letting the white spaces speak louder than ink" verges on overt meta-commentary about the text's own method, nudging toward authorial intrusion rather than staying fully within Mara's practical frame.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies effectively—short declaratives ("Words were the hardest to carry") punctuate longer, layered observations—and figurative language is dense but mostly coherent ("words…leaked into each other, smearing meanings the way rain smeared chalk"). The opening and closing images bookend the piece with tonal consistency. However, two patterns accumulate minor drag: (1) "staggered intervals" recurs in three separate paragraphs with near-identical phrasing ("walking ten measured paces, pausing, listening," "Through staggered intervals of walking, listening, and writing," "Through those staggered intervals of silence and speech"), creating a paraphrase loop that dulls momentum mid-piece; (2) "Old Caven…beard clotted with sea salt, eyes leaking the same water that slicked the stones" stacks two liquid metaphors in quick succession, blurring the image. These artifacts do not obscure causality but prevent entry to the 9-band. Overall density and propulsion remain strong.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The ocean-spray archivist role and the post-exile harbor setting synthesize into a fresh premise, and the metaphor of absences as musical rests avoids cliché by grounding it in Mara's literal archival practice. The staggered-intervals method and the trumpet valve as a召oning object offer specific, non-obvious choices. Transformation test: the emotional arc and closure depend on these exact particulars (the herald's exile, the reactively visionary trait, the brass valve on the bollard), not generic stand-ins. Minor limitation: the "hope is a fragment" insight and the "music of loss" frame draw from a familiar lexicon of post-disaster storytelling, and while executed with specificity, the thematic territory does not break entirely new ground. The piece takes moderate risk with its accumulative, meditative structure and earns its synthesis, landing in the strong-but-not-exceptional band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The ocean-spray archivist role is established in the second sentence, drives Mara's fragment-gathering across multiple beats (finding the valve, mapping absences, placing the valve on the bollard), and shapes the closure when she reacts to Caven's approach "without expectation," embodying her reactive stance. The character trait constrains her agency—she waits rather than initiates—and this limitation charges the ending when the city's absences finally "navigate themselves toward meaning" only after Caven acts. The role is indispensable to the story's logic and closure image.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The herald's trumpet valve appears early (pier edge, mid-story), is pocketed and carried by Mara (physical handling), placed deliberately on the bollard as a beacon, and returned to Caven's hand in the final beat where he lifts it to his lips and sounds the tremulous note. The valve's tarnished state and blackened fittings signal the cost of exile, and its reprise at the ending as the instrument of the "unsure music" reweights it from relic to live catalyst. The object drives two key beats (discovery, closure) and is irreplaceable—no other object would tie Caven's silence to the city's need for sound.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The core concept of navigated absences is signaled early ("her work…began after the exile ends") and operationalized through Mara's method: walking to "give space for what was not there to announce itself," sketching blank rectangles for missing homes, and describing the crowd's tentative approach as "absences beginning…to navigate themselves toward meaning." The concept shapes stakes (fragments must be compiled before the tide edits them) and tactics (Mara charts absences rather than debris). The closure depends on this frame: Caven's hesitant note is the first sound attempting to fill the silence, and the ending hinges on whether absences can find direction. The concept is not merely thematic—it alters on-page choices and charges the final image.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The attribute "reactively visionary" is introduced early ("she merely waited, reactively visionary, seeing futures only when others created the gaps") and constrains Mara's on-page behavior: she waits for the storm to deposit debris, places the valve and waits for someone to claim it, and reacts to Caven's gesture "without expectation." The trait enables her role as archivist but also imposes a visible cost—she cannot initiate the fanfare, only witness and facilitate. However, the attribute remains more explanatory than dramatized in a high-pressure choice; it flavors Mara's stance but does not force a trade-off that visibly alters tactics under duress. Present across beats and linked to closure, but not indispensable at the decision level.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The action "to hearten" appears obliquely: Mara's stories about found fragments are offered "not as evidence of ruin but as a note waiting for harmony, inviting anyone listening to supply what had been missing," and this telling causes the crowd to "slowly straighten, shoulders uncurling, as though a buried rhythm were rising." The act of heartening enables Caven to step forward and attempt the note. However, "hearten" is not foregrounded as a named action or distinct beat—it diffuses across Mara's speech and the crowd's response—and could be approximated by "encourage" or "inspire" without major structural change. The action shapes a key turn (crowd engagement → Caven's choice) but lacks the irreplaceability or on-page cost that would push it higher.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The method "through staggered intervals" is taught early ("walking ten measured paces, pausing, listening, then resuming") and repeated across three beats: Mara's initial walk along the seawall, her shift to charting absences ("Through staggered intervals of walking, listening, and writing"), and the crowd scene ("Through those staggered intervals of silence and speech"). The method shapes Mara's archival practice, embodies her reactive stance, and structures the narrative rhythm itself—pauses accumulate meaning. The ending depends on this pattern: the tremulous note emerges from the interval of silence Mara creates by placing the valve and waiting. The method is indispensable to both tactics and closure, though the repetition verges on overstatement in the middle third.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The ivory harbor after rain is established in the opening line and recurs through specific details: the seawall, salt-wet boards, rusted bollards, shuttered windows, quay stones, and the bollard where the valve is placed. The setting pressures Mara's search (storm debris, tide threat) and provides the spatial stage for the crowd's assembly and Caven's approach. The harbor's "missing teeth" metaphor and the gleaming, bone-like quality charge the tone and anchor the exile theme. The setting enables key beats (valve discovery, crowd gathering) and the final image of the "question above the ivory harbor" ties closure to place. The setting is essential but not uniquely irreplaceable—another post-disaster coastal site could substitute with minor adjustments.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the exile ends" is signaled early ("exile…had ended three weeks ago") and shapes the dominant stake: the returned exiles' silence still hums, and Mara's archival work depends on this liminal window before the tide edits the debris. The three-week gap explains the unlit lanterns and unclaimed moorings, and the fact that "their silence still hummed" creates pressure for Caven's eventual attempt to sound again. However, the timeframe does not impose an urgent clock that alters tactics beat-by-beat—Mara's pace is meditative, and no on-page deadline forces acceleration. The timeframe enables the story's premise and closure context but does not visibly constrain moment-to-moment choices.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The motivation "to compile fragments into meaning before the tide edits them again" is stated early and dramatized through Mara's systematic walk, her labeled satchel compartments, her notebook sketches of blank rectangles, and her placement of the valve as a召oning fragment. The desire faces friction: words "leaked into each other," the crowd is hesitant, and Caven's throat is scarred. The motivation drives multiple beats (debris collection, crowd address, waiting for Caven) and the closure hinges on whether fragments can achieve harmony—the tremulous note is the first test of Mara's archival premise. The motivation is essential and shapes the story's causal spine, though the cost is more implied (Mara's waiting, the city's unfulfilled need) than viscerally dramatized in a peak choice.</comment>
