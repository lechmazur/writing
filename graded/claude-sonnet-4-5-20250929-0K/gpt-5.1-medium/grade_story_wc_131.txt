<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Marrow's motivation is clear and his methodical nature shapes his actions consistently. The librarian's interior state is conveyed through embodied moments (hospital antiseptic, raw coffee, shaking frame), though his arc remains largely observed rather than chosen. The sense-memory mechanism risks feeling like a device rather than character-driven interiority; Marrow's final realization ("visible now… through their own awakened senses") borders on epiphany without sufficient on-page struggle. The librarian's breakdown lands with genuine emotional weight, but we lack micro-choices that would deepen his agency.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes a clear Accumulative/Textural lens held throughout: sense-memory fragments accumulate pressure that deepens into the librarian's collapse and Marrow's realization. Orientation anchors (shadowed library, dawn, outage, Marrow in crawl space) arrive cleanly within the first 120 words. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Marrow's invisible interventions crystallize into a method with felt cost—he remains unseen but present through others' senses—and the final image reweights his opening wish. One cost-proof slip: the conceptual price (永久 invisibility accepted) is legible but not viscerally dramatized in a single beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The library's architecture (crawl spaces, pipe chases, vent grilles, central aisle) directly enables Marrow's caching and guides his intervention. The outage silences electrical chatter, making the tape scrape "thunderous" and Emergency lanterns create spatial choreography for the librarian's movement beneath the vent. Micro-setting constrain choices: Marrow navigates by joist memory, withdraws tools from a cache, threads tape through a vent—each environmental detail alters tactics. The "sapphire hush" and phantom pulses charge the atmosphere without becoming postcard description. The final image ("trembling hands," "emergency light haloing") fuses body and space to support closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—Marrow's wish to become visible to those who need him—is signaled early and tightens through the tape discovery and the librarian's passage below. The outage creates a window; Marrow's decision to play the tape narrows options (he cannot step into the light himself, so he acts through echoes). The librarian's sag and covered face constitute a visible response, though it reads more as Marrow's observation than a mutual pivot. One meaningful deepening occurs: Marrow realizes he is "visible now… through their own awakened senses," reconfiguring his original wish with felt cost (permanent hiddenness). Agency leans observational; a more visceral trade-off at the tape-playing beat would elevate pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme—presence through absence, witnessing as intervention, the archive of pain—emerges organically from the tape fragment, caching practice, and Marrow's final realization without thesis statements. The ferromagnetic tape as carrier of "sense memory" (smell, sound, texture) integrates concept with image. The librarian's collapse and Marrow's recognition that he is "visible… to those who need you most, through their own awakened senses" offer a resonant, non-literal answer to the opening wish. One near-slip: "living proof" in the penultimate paragraph flirts with abstraction, but the surrounding embodied detail (shaking frame, muffled sobs, library leaning closer) grounds it. The ending resists moralizing and invites reflection on indirect care.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable, filtered through Marrow's kindly methodical perceptual signature: he hears wire hum, feels tape kiss his temple, navigates joists by memory. Diction is consistent and purposeful ("sapphire hush," "ferromagnetic," "sediment of voices"). One tension: the tape-triggered visions of the woman and the librarian's past read as external omniscience rather than Marrow's subjective interpretation, blurring focalization slightly. The prose modulates well under pressure (short clauses during the intervention: "He wound… feeling it cling… pressed the play button"). No dialogue present; interior voice remains distinct. Psychic distance deepens appropriately at the realization beat without filter-verb clutter.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high; most lines advance image, character, or pressure. Figurative language ("sapphire hush," "phantom pulses," "cobweb") is vivid but clustering in early paragraphs risks overwriting without functional payoff. One paraphrase loop: "cache small beacons of sense memory" / "cached fragments and whispers" repeats the caching concept without added pressure. Template cadence: multiple paragraphs open with "He [verb]" or "Marrow [verb]," flattening propulsion slightly. Stock metaphor: "standing at the ledge of giving up" is a familiar phrase. The closure paragraph ("In the trembling… as presence") lands cleanly with no artifact muddle. Proofreading is clean; no grammar slips.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The premise—an unseen caretaker who caches sense-memory fragments to help future strangers—offers a fresh angle on witness and care. The ferromagnetic tape as vehicle for layered sensory experience (wet wool, toner, autumn rain, hospital antiseptic) is specific and non-obvious. Marrow's realization that visibility occurs "through their own awakened senses" transforms the opening wish in hindsight. One derivative note: the kindly invisible helper in a library setting echoes established guardian-spirit tropes, though the sense-memory mechanism and accumulative structure distinguish it. The piece commits fully to its premise and follows implications without retreat. Emotional truth—grief recognized through echo—feels earned rather than ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Marrow (crawl space dweller) appears early, maps the building nightly, discovers the tape, and decides to play it through the vent—a sequence of on-page choices that narrow options and enable the librarian's moment. His final realization (visible through others' senses) reconfigures his opening wish with cost (永久 hiddenness). Present in setup, development (tape discovery and intervention), and payoff (realization). Causal pressure is moderate; the intervention feels more facilitative than agonistic. Specificity is high (methodical care, joist memory). Visible cost is present but conceptual rather than visceral. Two beats (discovery, intervention) plus closure linkage support mid-7s, but swappability (another hidden helper could perform similar acts) and lack of a high-stakes trade-off cap the score.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The ferromagnetic tape reel fragment is introduced early (tenth paragraph), handled across multiple beats (discovery behind bracket, pressed to temple, wound onto cassette spools, played through vent), and its sensory payload (woman's laughter, hospital antiseptic) directly triggers the librarian's response and Marrow's realization. Present in setup (discovery), development (sensory visions, threading), and payoff (the tape's ache resonates, enabling the final recognition). Causal pressure is strong: without this exact object, the intervention and closure would collapse. Specificity (ferromagnetic, crescent of brown tape, cold plastic kiss) is high. One friction: the tape's magical sense-transfer mechanism is asserted rather than constrained by cost or failure risk, reducing irreplaceability slightly. Three beats plus closure linkage and high specificity justify mid-7s.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Sense memory (core concept) is signaled early ("sense memory was a secret language"), shapes Marrow's caching practice, and drives the tape's function: layered sensory impressions (wet wool, toner, rain, antiseptic, coffee) trigger the librarian's resonance. The concept enables the central tactic (playing the tape to create echo) and underpins the closure realization (visibility through awakened senses). Present in setup (Marrow's belief), development (tape visions), and payoff (resonance and realization). Causal pressure is moderate; the concept structures the world but is not tested or constrained. Specificity is high (ferromagnetic sediment, texture of need). One friction: the mechanism is more thematic than tactical—Marrow never struggles with sense-memory's limits. Two functional beats plus closure linkage support upper-5s, but lack of on-page friction or cost tied to the concept itself caps the score.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Kindly methodical" (attribute) is established early ("kindly methodical soul, careful with dust, cables") and demonstrated through Marrow's actions: navigating crawl spaces with flat palms and knees finding joists by memory, winding tape with slow precision, planning his next quiet intervention. The trait enables his successful caching and intervention but does not constrain a choice with visible cost—Marrow's care never forces a trade-off or mistake. Present in setup (label and early demonstration), development (joist navigation, tape threading), and payoff (planning next intervention). One beat of causal work (precise threading enables playback) plus consistent demonstration, but no friction or price tied to the trait itself. Label-only in opening; embodied in middle beats. Mid-5s reflects functional demonstration without high-stakes constraint.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Cache" (action) is signaled early (Marrow "built small caches of memory for future finders") and drives the plot: Marrow withdraws tools from a cache built years ago, threads the tape, and plays it to create resonance. The caching practice underpins his wish (to be visible through future finds) and the closure realization (he will continue caching beacons). Present in setup (night mapping and cache-building described), development (cache withdrawal, tape threading), and payoff (planning next cache). Causal pressure is moderate: the cache enables the intervention, but the act itself is described more than dramatized in a high-stakes beat. Specificity (cache built years ago, cracked cassette player and battery) is good. One friction: "cache" as verb and noun recurs but feels narratively convenient rather than costly. Two beats plus closure linkage support low-6s, but lack of a visible trade-off or constraint caps the score.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Uncovering in pipe chases and cable runs" (method) is signaled early ("Night after night, he mapped the building by uncovering in pipe chases and cable runs") and demonstrated when Marrow discovers the tape "lodged behind a rusted bracket" in a cable run. The method enables the discovery that drives the intervention. Present in setup (mapping described) and development (tape discovery), but absent from payoff (the ending focuses on the intervention and realization, not further uncovering). Mechanics are mentioned but not detailed: we know Marrow navigates tight spaces but not how uncovering differs from routine inspection. One functional beat (discovery) plus setup, but no closure linkage and low specificity. The method feels replaceable (Marrow could find the tape by other means). Mid-4s reflects functional presence without deep integration.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The "shadowed library at dawn" (setting) anchors the opening line ("sapphire hush over the crooked stacks") and structures the intervention: crawl spaces, vent grilles, central aisle, reading room, and basement breakers create spatial choreography. The outage silences electrical chatter, making the tape scrape audible and emergency lanterns guide the librarian's path beneath Marrow's vent. The library's architecture (hollow bones, pipe chases) directly enables Marrow's caching and hidden presence. Present in setup (opening image), development (spatial navigation, vent as intervention point), and payoff (library "leaning closer in sympathy"). Causal pressure is strong: the space constrains and enables. Specificity (crooked stacks, rusted bracket, central aisle) is high. One friction: "dawn" as timeframe matters less than the outage; the light level does not alter tactics. Strong spatial integration justifies mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The outage ("while the city's lights flicker after an unexpected outage") is introduced early (second paragraph) and creates urgency: it silences electrical chatter (making the tape scrape "thunderous"), prompts librarians to fumble through protocol, and sends the librarian to the breakers, placing him beneath Marrow's vent. Emergency lanterns blink awake, providing spatial light for the collapse. Present in setup (outage described), development (breaker trip, lantern light), and payoff (emergency light haloing the librarian). The outage functions as a window but does not tighten a ticking clock—Marrow has time to thread tape and wait. Causal pressure is moderate: the outage enables the intervention but is not tracked beat-by-beat as a constraint. Specificity (phantom pulses, silenced hum) is good. One beat of strong enabling plus closure participation supports upper-5s, but lack of temporal tightening caps the score.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Marrow's motivation—"to become visible to those who need you"—is signaled early (sixth paragraph: "his heart ached with one quiet wish") and drives every action: mapping the building, caching fragments, playing the tape, and the final realization ("He was visible now… through their own awakened senses"). The wish is tested through the tape discovery and intervention, and the closure reconfigures it with cost (永久 hiddenness accepted). Present in setup (opening wish), development (intervention as enactment), and payoff (realization). Causal pressure is strong: the wish structures all tactics. Internal conflict is present but muted—Marrow never doubts or struggles with the wish itself; he simply enacts it. Specificity is high (visible to those who need you, not to all). Friction between want (visibility) and cost (永久 hiding) is legible but understated. Three beats plus closure linkage and visible cost support low-7s.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Sapphire hush" (tone) opens the story ("breathed a sapphire hush over the crooked stacks") and recurs at the intervention ("The sapphire hush deepened, no longer empty, but filled with breath, muffled sobs, and living proof"). The tone is coherent—quiet, attentive, elegiac—and modulates with pressure: phantom pulses and thunderous scrape introduce tension; the hush deepens and fills at the climax. The color-coded quiet charges the final image of Marrow's invisible presence. Present in setup (opening line), development (atmospheric continuity), and payoff (reweighted hush). Causal pressure is low: tone supports but does not constrain. Specificity ("sapphire," not merely "quiet") is distinctive. One friction: the phrase risks ornamental lyricism in the opening and feels slightly forced at the reprise. Strong coherence and closure linkage justify mid-6s, but lack of tactical constraint caps the score.</comment>
