<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's involuntary truthfulness shapes micro-choices throughout ("Because I could not lie, I told her..."), and interiority remains concrete with embodied detail ("taste of iron in my mouth"). Risa's chord-hearing is specific and consistently deployed. The partnership work feels earned, though the final transformation ("less haunted and more like a choir") edges toward summary rather than showing a discrete choice that forecloses a path with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure. Orientation anchors arrive early (ravine orchard, post-virus isolation). Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—the glass eye clears and becomes "only ever a mirror we had agreed to fear," a conceptual repricing that disperses collective terror into mutual witness with felt cost (the loss of mystical safety). The mycelial mapping tightens pressure across beats, and the storm arrival triggers the final reweighting. One small cost-legibility issue: the precise mechanism by which "seeing one another" constitutes survival remains slightly abstract.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The ravine setting pressures choices throughout: cables, hanging pods, storms that "crawl," the humming ladder. The glass eye functions as micro-setting object, constraining attention and charging the closure image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("velvet that smelled of salt and dust"), and spatial choreography remains coherent. The orchard's physicality—roots, truffles, pods—shapes the mapping work and final realization.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: map the fungal network to make collective empathy bearable. The work with Risa tightens pressure through shared vulnerability ("clumsy and exposed, a praxis of fractured grace"), and the storm escalates to the clearing of the eye. Agency is present in the collaborative mapping and the choice to "practice seeing one another." The final cost—dispersing the focal point of terror—feels conceptual and real, though the precise tactical price of that dispersal could be sharper.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges cleanly from particulars: truth as exposure, empathy as contagion, and the mirror we agree to fear. The glass eye shifts meaning across beats, and the "discredited textbooks" motif charges the question of whether truth arrives too early. The final image—"surviving the sight"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of psychological safety without moralizing. The line "sometimes discredited meant only that the truth had arrived too early" borders on thematic echo but is dramatized through Risa's action and the subsequent mapping work.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct and consistent: "the truth sheared out of me in sharp strips," "the orchard groaned like a dreaming animal." Psychic distance remains stable; no head-hopping. Diction is controlled and voice-motivated throughout, with purposeful compression ("a praxis of fractured grace") that heightens rather than obscures. Dialogue carries subtext and goal-pursuit ("whether it saw more than we did"). The final tonal modulation—mysticism dissolving into plain seeing—fits the arc without breaking voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally; no template cadence. Information density is high, with lines often doing multiple jobs ("After the virus, that kind of defect made people feel safer"). The opening anchors voice and stakes; the final line recharges the mirror motif with precise resonance. Minor issue: "excoriated the thin skin between selves" and "porous, flooded by the moods of strangers" are adjacent paraphrases that slightly loop the same concept. No other artifacts touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The empathy-virus premise is familiar, but the combination with involuntary truth-telling, truffle-mood absorption, and the ravine orchard as quarantine creates a fresh synthesis. The glass eye as agreed-upon focal point for collective terror is non-obvious and transforms cleanly. The emotional calculus—surviving mutual witness—feels earned and specific. Risk-taking in the lyric compression and the discredited-textbook motif heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The transformation test passes: plot and emotional arc would fail with generic substitutions.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Present early as the frame and contract. The forager role enables the truffle-mapping work that structures all middle beats and primes the closure realization. Rational observation drives tactical choices with Risa, though the final turn hinges more on the glass eye than on a discrete foraging decision. Two of three gates; causal role in middle beats; closure-adjacent but not the hinge mechanism.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Introduced early ("wrapped in velvet"), handled in multiple beats (placement on table, dreaming from the eye outward, clearing during the storm), and the clearing is the hinge of the closure unit. Its transformation from clouded relic to plain mirror reweights all prior fear and enables the final "surviving the sight." Irreplaceable; high causal pressure; closure-defining.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Signaled early (smuggled relic, quarantined borders, hollowed walnuts) and shapes the elders' contract and the ravine's mystical frame. The concept pressures the narrator's investigative stance and the collective's projection of power onto the eye. At closure, the revelation that the relic is "only ever a mirror we had agreed to fear" reweights the smuggling backstory as misplaced sacralization. Two beats plus closure linkage; strong thematic charge.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Introduced early and constrains multiple on-page moments: the narrator cannot soften the initial explanation of the eye's effect, cannot lie about the textbooks being discredited, and speaks fear aloud during the mapping work. The trait enables the collaborative "praxis of fractured grace" and charges the closure by making witness unavoidable. Visible tradeoffs in at least two beats; closure-relevant.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The verb "occlude" recurs as motif and mechanism: truffles are supposed to occlude violent currents, the glass eye's clouded core occludes the reflection, and the final revelation is that nothing mystical needs occluding—the agreed-upon fear can now disperse. The action shapes the textbook investigation, the mycelial tracing, and the closure image. Three beats; thematic and tactical integration; high specificity.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Signaled early (satchel of discredited textbooks, margins filled with rumors) and structures the work with Risa ("tracing the mycelial veins"). The textbooks guide the mapping praxis, though the mechanics of how rumor becomes method remain somewhat abstract. Present in setup and middle development; lyric closure reprise when the truth "arrived too early." Functional but not irreplaceable at the level of discrete tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The ravine setting pressures every beat: the hanging pods isolate the oversensitive, the cables and ladder constrain movement, the storms escalate to the climax, and the orchard's mycelial network is the mechanism of the central work. The void below and the groaning trees charge atmosphere and stakes. Three beats; closure-shaping; irreplaceable physical logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The post-virus frame establishes who is in the ravine and why, shapes the narrator's truthfulness and Risa's chord-hearing, and primes the closure question of whether collective empathy can be made bearable. The virus aftermath is causally active in setup, middle (the elders' contract, the porous selves), and closure (the mirror that disperses agreed-upon fear). Three gates; strong thematic and causal work.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Stated early ("I wanted to cultivate psychological safety, the sort that let you risk being known") and dramatized through the mapping collaboration and the final practice of mutual witness. The desire conflicts with the narrator's involuntary truth-telling and the collective's mystical projection. The closure—"surviving the sight"—directly answers the motivation. Two beats plus closure linkage; felt friction between want and cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Tone is coherent and modulates with pressure: the ravine setting and empathy virus establish brokenness, the mapping work is "clumsy and exposed," and the closure shifts to plain seeing without tidy resolution. The phrase "fractured grace" crystallizes the tone on the page and charges the final image of practicing mutual witness. The tone shapes reader experience of stakes and ending; high integration with closure effect.</comment>
