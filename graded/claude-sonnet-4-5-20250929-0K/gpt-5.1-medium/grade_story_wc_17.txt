<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's interiority is concrete and character-particular ("listening the way a wall listens"), with embodied perceptions ("vibration I sensed...in my ribs") that avoid label-speak. The final choice—to stay and continue Mara's work—is earned by prior causality, though the emotional trajectory from discovery to commitment could show more internal contradiction or cost in the moment of decision. Minor slip: the kinship with Mara is asserted more than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. Still, the arc from cartographer to inheritor is legible and motivated.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands on the page as Earned Stasis (staying to listen) with visible cost: the protagonist accepts the burden of unfinished work and forgoes the option to walk away. Orientation anchors (ivy-veiled passage, afternoon, climate-shifted ruins) arrive early. The Accumulative lens is inferred and held: discoveries layer (diaries, film negative, echoes) and culminate in a stance crystallization. One meaningful deepening occurs when the protagonist hums Mara's pitch and receives the building's "attention," narrowing options to either flee or commit. Cost is legible in the final lines: redrawing maps, staying until "the walls finished dreaming."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The ivy-veiled passage, blackened room, and toppled fireplace constrain discovery and charge the final image; the environment is not ornamental but integral to the protagonist's work. Sensory detail is vivid and selective: "wet stone and forgotten ink," "rust and the sour smell of mold." The micro-setting (hearthstone, blistered brick) functions as setting at this length, with the protagonist pressing an ear to brick and humming into corridors—actions that would fail without these specifics. Spatial choreography is clean throughout, and the climate-shifted context subtly guides the stakes without exposition dumps.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether to continue Mara's unfinished listening—is signaled midpoint and tightens when the protagonist realizes "legacy's burden" presses down. One meaningful turn occurs when the protagonist hums Mara's pitch and the building's attention "turn[s] toward me," forcing a choice between walking away or staying. Agency is decision with visible cost: redrawing maps, accepting incompleteness. The escalation is driven by protagonist action (prying the door, reading aloud, humming) under the Accumulative lens. The price—forsaking closure, inheriting questions—is legible on the page in the final beat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme (legacy's burden, listening beyond ambition) emerges organically from Mara's diaries and the protagonist's kinship without meta-commentary. The final image—staying to listen "until the walls finished dreaming"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question (what do walls remember?) without stating a moral. Subtext operates in the building's "attention," the protagonist's "odd kinship," and the realization that the work is "inherited, unfinished, possibly doomed." The story resists tidy resolution, embracing complexity: the protagonist could walk away but chooses endurance with full knowledge of its cost, reweighting prior material through the film negative and diaries.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature: the protagonist notices "layers of conversation the way others read palimpsests" and hears "echoes...like sediment." Diction remains character-consistent ("walls dream," "intent, like the building itself straining") and purposeful compression ("half-burned diaries...pages charred at the edges like petals") reads as lyric voice, not artifact. Narrative certainty matches what the focalizer can know; inference reads as inference ("as if the building exhaled"). Minor slip: one line—"I knew the building wanted to speak through half-burned diaries"—edges toward convenient omniscience, but it reads as the protagonist's interpretation rather than external fact, so the effect is acceptable within this voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Information density is high, with most lines advancing discovery, character, or atmosphere. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and Read-aloud ear test passes cleanly. Minor loop issue: "corridors upon corridors" and "layers of conversation...layers...like sediment" repeat the stacking metaphor without added nuance (−0.2). A few figurative stacks in the opening third ("petals touched by frost," "spider silk," "underwater bells") risk density but remain legible and voice-consistent, so no overwriting penalty. The final image is propulsive and specific. No grammar, tense, or pronoun drift; no filter-verb stacks in high-pressure beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The premise—echo cartography in climate-ruined buildings—offers a fresh angle on memory and place, avoiding generic haunting or simple nostalgia. The transformation of a maintenance worker's marginal notes into inherited legacy feels specific and non-obvious. The protagonist's final choice (to stay and listen rather than report and leave) arises from established causality and character trait (sensitive perception). One risk: the "walls themselves...testing the contours of my name" flirts with abstraction, but it remains grounded in the protagonist's embodied sensation ("vibrated in my ribs"). No derivative template or famous-line echoes; emotional specificity avoids generic templates.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Present from the opening line, the role frames the protagonist's perceptual skill and drives all major beats: setting the recorder, humming the tone, prying the door, reading Mara's notes aloud, humming Mara's pitch, and redrawing maps. The protagonist's decisions—to open the door, to read aloud, to stay—create key turns and the final stance. Causal pressure is sustained across the piece, and the closure (staying to listen) is legible only because this character possesses the skill and will to continue. Cost is visible: accepting unfinished work.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The film negative strip appears in one beat (lifted from the diaries, held to light, images described) and is mentioned again in the final beat when the protagonist rewinds it into its canister before staying. It seeds Mara's prior attempt and charges the final image by linking the protagonist's choice to Mara's unfinished proof. However, it does not constrain a middle choice or alter tactics between discovery and closure; its primary role is thematic resonance rather than causal pressure. Two-gate presence (setup, closure cameo) but limited middle development caps the score in the mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Legacy's burden is named at midpoint ("settled on my shoulders like a weight") and immediately shapes the protagonist's stance: the realization that "my work was not new but inherited, unfinished, possibly doomed." It drives the final choice—whether to walk away or accept the burden—and the cost is legible in the closing lines ("questions that refused to fade," "stay and listen"). The concept is not merely thematic decoration; it narrows options and charges the closure. Early implicit setup (Mara's diaries), explicit midpoint articulation, and closure participation earn a solid score.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The trait is named early ("I have always been sensitively perceptive to echoes") and enables the protagonist's work throughout: hearing "layers of conversation," detecting the "faint tremor" in the returning sound, and sensing the building's "attention" in the final beat. However, it does not visibly constrain or impose a cost—there is no moment where heightened perception becomes a burden or forces a difficult trade-off. The trait enables action but does not generate friction. Two-gate presence (early label, closure participation via humming Mara's pitch) but no middle tradeoff caps the score in the low-6s.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The glimpse—"words pressed thin as spider silk" in the returning echo—occurs early and motivates the protagonist to follow the tremor to the sealed door. It is the inciting discovery that sets the search in motion. However, the action is singular and does not recur or transform; the protagonist could have been led by any anomaly (a draft, a stain, a sound). The glimpse is functional but replaceable with minor edits. One-gate presence (setup) and modest causal role place it in the mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The method—half-burned diaries found in a fireplace—is signaled early when the protagonist discovers the nest of notebooks in the toppled fireplace. The diaries are handled across multiple beats: gathering them, lifting the last one (which reveals the film negative), opening the first diary, and reading Mara's entries aloud. The diaries provide the knowledge (Mara's tapping method, her pitch notation) that the protagonist uses in the final beat to hum and receive the building's attention. They shape the protagonist's understanding and tactics, and their physical presence (charred edges, scrawled margins) grounds the discovery. Three-gate presence (early, middle, closure) and strong causal linkage earn a score above 8.0.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The ivy-veiled passage is the opening setting and returns as a sensory anchor throughout: the protagonist sets the recorder there, hums into it, and later presses an ear to its blackened brick. The ivy hides blistered brick and chokes the sealed fire door, creating a physical obstacle the protagonist must overcome ("took an hour to pry it open"). In the final beat, the protagonist remains within this passage-and-adjacent-room system, making the setting integral to closure. The passage constrains discovery (the door must be found and opened) and charges the final image (humming into the corridor, sensing the building's attention). Three-gate presence and causal pressure place it solidly in the 7s.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The timeframe—after the climate shifts—is mentioned in the opening fourth ("after the climate shifts, when buildings warped") and provides context for the protagonist's work (sound mapping in ruined structures). It sets the world's baseline but does not tighten decisions or tactics within this single afternoon scene. There is no live clock, no urgency tied to time passing or climate threat escalating in this moment. The timeframe is background context rather than a pressure mechanism. Setup present, but no middle or closure participation caps the score below 5.0.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The motivation—to discover what walls dream about—is stated early as the protagonist's commission and is dramatized through on-page actions: setting the recorder, humming, following the tremor, prying the door, and reading Mara's diaries. The protagonist's choice to stay and listen "until the walls finished dreaming" ties the final beat directly to this desire. Friction arises when the protagonist realizes the work is "inherited, unfinished, possibly doomed," yet chooses to continue despite the cost. The desire is conflicted (ambition versus burden) and drives the closure choice. Three-gate presence and visible cost earn a score in the low-7s.</comment>
