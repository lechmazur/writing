<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's interiority is concrete and particularized through embodied choices (trailing fingers through dust, speaking names aloud). Her motivation—finding herself through saving others—creates genuine internal contradiction that drives micro-choices across the file room. The visiting foster youth are briefly sketched but functional; the man recognizing the button delivers an earned moment. Minor slip: the ex-partner's complaint about "evidence, not home" edges toward diagnostic articulation, though it remains in dialogue rather than peak interiority.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens inferred and held: the story teaches its pattern of layered visits and dust-reading early, then deepens through the button discovery and climaxes in Mara's final resolve to "keep examining the unknown." Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): she remains broken-hearted but commits to her mission with visible cost (solitude, ongoing grief). Orientation anchors cleanly by paragraph three. One meaningful deepening occurs when the button unlocks a brother's story, reweighting all prior file work and cementing her stance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The file room is vividly anchored through dust patterns, bowed shelves, fluorescent hum, and tactile handling of folders and objects. Micro-setting qualifies: dust thickness maps neglect and becomes a diagnostic tool that constrains Mara's prioritization choices. The button—brass, worn, taped to a card—charges the climactic visitor scene. Spatial choreography remains clear across weeks of work, and the recurring image of dust-as-photography developer ties setting to theme without forcing symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (linking orphaned files to living persons, magnifying kindnesses) is signaled early and sustained. Accumulative pressure builds through the parade of visitors and tightens decisively when the man recognizes the button, proving the mission's stakes are real and recoverable. Mara's agency is renunciation and endurance: she chooses to stay in the work despite her own loss, foreclosing easier paths. Cost is visible in her solitude and the phrase "broken-hearted still, but tactfully hopeful."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—recovery of erased histories, magnification of small kindnesses—emerges organically from the button, dust patterns, and Mara's discovery process rather than assertion. The final image offers a resonant answer: she resolves to keep examining until "every silent folder offered at least one remembered kindness," reweighting prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates in the dust-as-photograph metaphor and the gap between bureaucratic codes and lived pain. No thematic echo or label-speak in the ending.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV (Mara) with stable distance and a distinct perceptual signature: her professional eye reads dust as data, her romantic loss colors metaphors ("evidence, not home"), and her compassion shapes what she lingers over in files. The prose modulates purposefully—lyric and reflective in solo beats, concrete and precise when handling documents. Free indirect style is clean. Brief dialogue (the brother's whisper) carries subtext and advances plot. Voice remains consistent under pressure, with tactful rather than diagnostic interiority.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Information density is high: most sentences layer action, atmosphere, and character motive. Rhythm varies naturally, with longer reflective lines contracting into shorter beats during visitor scenes. Minor loop: "broken-hearted" recurs three times, though the final use ("broken-hearted still, but tactfully hopeful") reweights rather than paraphrases. No template cadence, filter stacks, or metaphor muddle. The dust-as-photograph image is coherent and charged. Syntax and paragraph structure modulate with scene pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The premise—archivist recovering foster-care histories post-emancipation—feels specific and timely rather than generic. Mara's personal stake (her own missing file) grounds the mission without becoming mechanical. The button as inherited talisman and the dust-mapping method offer fresh angles. Emotional truth outweighs surface novelty: the magnification of small kindnesses (notebooks, braids, emergency contacts) transforms bureaucratic reimbursement forms into evidence of care. Slight proximity concern: "disappeared" echoes common foster-care narratives, though the accumulation of archival detail personalizes it.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mara is established early (broken-hearted, own file missing), drives the middle through micro-choices (which boxes to open, speaking names aloud, deciding to prioritize neglected files), and her final resolve ("keep examining the unknown") anchors the closure. Her arc—from personal loss to professional mission—shapes the dominant stake. Two gates clearly met (setup, payoff); middle development is present but more accumulative than decisively forked.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The button appears in setup (Box 47B discovery), is examined mid-story (Mara holds it to light, imagines the boy's invented father), and becomes the climactic trigger when the visiting man recognizes it as his brother's, unlocking a cross-county story. Its specificity (brass, worn insignia, taped card notation) matters causally: without it, that reunion cannot occur. Three gates met, with visible cost (the brother's emotion, Mara's validation).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Unknown histories frame the assignment (link orphaned files to traceable persons) and recur as Mara reads gaps in timelines and dust patterns. The concept shapes her tactics (prioritize thicker dust, speak names aloud) and drives the visits that test the mission's stakes. Final resolve ("keep examining the unknown") ties closure to the concept with felt cost. Causal pressure is moderate rather than decisive; the concept operates as much thematically as tactically.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Tactfully hopeful" is introduced early ("the tactfully hopeful smile she reserved for strangers") and constrains her interactions with visitors: she lingers over kindnesses rather than discipline reports, shaping their experience. The trait reappears in the ending ("broken-hearted still, but tactfully hopeful") with visible cost—her hope persists despite personal grief. Two gates met (setup, payoff); middle development is implied in how she frames findings but not dramatized as a forked choice.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Unfurl" appears three times: college photographs developing, the visiting man's story bridging counties, and weeks "unfurl[ing] into months." The action structures temporal progression and links discovery to revelation. The climactic unfurling (the brother's story) turns Mara's solo work into witnessed recovery, validating her mission. Three gates met with moderate causal pressure; the verb could be swapped for "emerge" or "reveal" without breaking logic, limiting irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dust patterns are signaled early ("a line appear through accumulated dust"), become a diagnostic method mid-story ("thicker on some folders, thinner on others, mapping neglect"), and shape Mara's prioritization ("those were the ones she would start with"). The method constrains her tactics causally and charges the closure by making invisible histories visible. Three gates met; specificity (dust as temporal index) matters and could not be replaced with generic "reading files."</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The file room is established early (steel cabinets, fluorescent light, bowed shelves), pressures Mara's choices (which boxes to open, where to walk), supplies the button and folders that drive the climax, and anchors the final image ("walked the aisles alone, hand trailing along spines"). Spatial choreography is clear and recurring. The room's physical constraints (dust accumulation, box labels) alter her tactics. Three gates met with indispensable causal and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"After the emancipation law" frames the assignment (making records available to formerly hidden youth) and motivates the visitors who arrive seeking origin stories. The timeframe enables the dominant stake but does not tighten decisions beat-by-beat; no live clock pressures Mara. Two gates met (setup enables the conflict, payoff sustains the mission's context). Moderate integration: the reform could be replaced with another legal trigger without breaking the arc.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The desire to "magnify small kindnesses" is dramatized early ("she wanted to magnify small kindnesses until they were impossible to ignore"), drives her middle choices (lingering over teachers, neighbors, nurses in monthly summaries), and anchors the closure ("every silent folder offered at least one remembered kindness"). Friction appears in her own broken heart versus the compassion she extends to others. Three gates met with visible cost and causal pressure shaping visitor interactions.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Examined unknown" as tone is coherent: quiet, forensic attention threading through reflective beats and visitor scenes. The tone modulates slightly (reflective solitude → concrete visitor exchanges → lyric resolve) without breaking. The final image ("feeling the pulse of lives that might yet be recalled and mended") charges prior examination with hope. Two strong gates (setup tone in opening dust-work, payoff in final trailing hand); middle modulation is smooth but not decisively reweighted until the end.</comment>
