<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The protagonist's interiority is concrete and embodied ("fingers closing around the bead," "words struck the bead, and something rang inside my chest"). The internal contradiction between doubt and commitment builds steadily, and the final vow feels earned by the vision-triggered memory rather than purely rational choice. Minor weakness: the ghost bride's motivations are dramatized primarily through dialogue rather than contradictory action, and the protagonist's embodied emotion occasionally dips into elevated register ("mournful elation, grief braided with a sweetness too intense to bear") that edges toward label-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) at closure. Orientation anchors (apprentice, greenhouse, tending trees) appear within the first two sentences. The bead triggers a memory-vision that deepens the protagonist's understanding and reweights the covenant, culminating in a sworn vow that forecloses the option of leaving—a visible cost ("Do this, and one evening the bead will fall silent, and I will walk out..."). The pattern of remembrance accumulates through sensory and metaphorical density, and the closure crystallizes the stakes with undeniable pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The greenhouse functions as micro-setting throughout: glowing glass ribs, metallic fruit, luminous seeds, branches that creak with remembrance. The carved bead is handled across multiple beats and its warming/weeping steam at the climax directly charges the protagonist's choice. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful ("ashen-veil ghost bride," "veil smoked gently," "mineral and old smoke"), filtered through the protagonist's alchemical-apprentice lens. The endless night and winter-cracked fields frame the greenhouse as a covenant-space that constrains the protagonist's departure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: honoring the broken vow and freeing the ghost bride. The bead-triggered vision is the story's central tightening, narrowing the protagonist's options from passive tending to active covenant renewal. The ghost's offer ("stay until dawn that will never come, and listen when the bead sings") imposes a visible cost—eternal work in endless night—and the protagonist's acceptance forecloses the path of departure. The escalation is driven by protagonist agency (pressing the bead to lips, swearing the vow) under the Accumulative lens, and the cost is legible on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: transmutation not of metals but of endings, death feeding fruit, souls ripening through patient labor. The greenhouse-as-covenant-space integrates with the theme organically, and the final image—branches bowing in solemn joy, her form brightening—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the question of debt and remembrance without stating a moral. The resonant awakenings concept is woven into action (sap rising like breath, branches creaking with remembrance) rather than merely asserted. Minor slip: "cage of this night will loosen by a single bar" edges toward overt metaphor.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with a consistent alchemical-apprentice register and perceptual signature (noticing metallic fruit, grafting knives, sap rising). Dialogue is sparse but purposeful, carrying subtext in the ghost's "lovingly venomous" tone and evasive phrasing. Psychic distance tightens appropriately during the vision and widens during the ghost's exposition. Minor weakness: a few elevated phrases ("mournful elation," "sorrowful and sharp, like glass left too long in running water") push beyond the protagonist's established idiom under peak pressure, though they remain legible and voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and figurative density is high but mostly coherent. Line-level propulsion is strong in the vision sequence and vow. However, several beats exhibit overwriting: stacked metaphors in quick succession ("her smile slanted, sorrowful and sharp, like glass left too long in running water" immediately following "Her words struck the bead, and something rang inside my chest"), and elevated diction in peak moments ("mournful elation, grief braided with a sweetness") that slightly obscures immediacy. No scaffold loops detected, and information density remains high throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The premise—alchemical orchard as reincarnation covenant—synthesizes familiar gothic and transmutation tropes into a specific, non-obvious frame. The ghost bride's patient debt collection and the protagonist's unwitting return transform the haunted-greenhouse setup. The bead as memory-trigger and the trees-as-echoes system feel inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in the endless-night frame and the open-ended vow elevate stakes without obscuring clarity. The piece avoids template resolutions and commits fully to its logic.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lady Veil's offering of the bead, her exposition of the covenant, and her terms ("stay until dawn that will never come") drive the protagonist's choices across multiple beats and directly shape the closure vow. Her appearance frames the story's inciting incident and her brightening form charges the final image.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The bead is offered, held, triggers the vision, warms and weeps steam, and is pressed to lips in the vow—handled across at least four distinct beats. Its properties (etched sigils, warmth, steam) enable the memory and reweight the covenant at closure, making it causally indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Resonant awakenings shapes the premise (souls ripening through cycles) and is dramatized in the vision ("the first tremor of what she called resonant awakenings") and the orchard's response ("branches creaked...with remembrance, sap rising"). It informs the protagonist's task (listening when the bead sings) and the ghost's brightening at closure, but its mechanics remain abstract and do not constrain a specific mid-scene choice.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Lovingly venomous" is attributed to the ghost's voice in one line ("Her voice, when it reached me, was lovingly venomous, each word caressing my ears while pricking at my doubts") and colors her dialogue tone. It does not visibly constrain an action or force a trade-off; the protagonist listens and responds without tactical adjustment.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The ghost action pervades the story: her appearances bookend the narrative, her offering of the bead incites the vision, her exposition reframes the protagonist's role, and her terms at closure directly impose the story's central cost. Removing the ghost would collapse the plot and closure entirely.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Ephemeral cameo appearances" is signaled early ("She never stayed long, only slipped through ephemeral cameo appearances") and describes the ghost's behavior throughout. It establishes mood and constraint (she cannot remain continuously) but does not mechanically shape a tactic or turn; the protagonist does not adjust strategy based on her fleeting presence.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The greenhouse is present from the opening line, provides the metallic fruit and luminous seeds the protagonist tends, anchors the covenant, and its "heart beat once around me, branches bowing" charges the final vow. The endless night frames the protagonist's task and the ghost's entrapment. The setting is causally active across setup, middle exposition, and closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Over the hush of winter-cracked fields" appears in the opening and recurs once near the end ("outside, over the hush of winter-cracked fields, the world had forgotten us"). It establishes atmosphere and the external world's distance but does not function as a ticking clock or tighten decisions; the "endless night" overrides seasonal urgency.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The debt is named by the ghost ("I am here to repay a debt across lifetimes, one you have forgotten"), dramatized in the vision (the broken promise), and drives the protagonist's final choice to honor the vow. It creates friction between the protagonist's present ignorance and the ghost's patient accusation, and the resolution (swearing anew) directly addresses the debt with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Mournful elation" is declared once ("the air sharpened into mournful elation, grief braided with a sweetness too intense to bear") and the tone modulates across beats—sorrow in the ghost's accusation, sweetness in the memory-vision, triumph at closure ("her form brightened, thin and triumphant"). The final image integrates both valences (branches bowing in solemn joy), but the tone is more shown through action than sustained as a coherent texture.</comment>
