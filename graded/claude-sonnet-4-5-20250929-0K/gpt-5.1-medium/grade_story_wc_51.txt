<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The fractal weaver's interiority is vivid and particular, with contradictory impulses acting simultaneously ("to be caught without boundary meant every direction might still be chosen"). The protagonist's embodied engagement with burdens shows authentic internal conflict, especially in the final beat where she must "orient properly to the fear instead of from it." Minor weakness: the character's craft and history are told more than dramatized in early setup, though micro-choices under pressure (twisting wrists to break calcification, lifting the lamp higher) earn the closure. The final renunciation—accepting that the grotto will forget her—feels motivated and forecloses retreat with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the protagonist confronts her own burden, orients to it rather than from it, and integrates it into the grotto's pattern with a felt cost ("I carried no less burden, only a clearer way to bear it"). Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density builds through layered imagery and the shingled hush, culminating in a cadence shift that reweights the opening premise. Orientation anchors arrive by the third paragraph (bronze grotto, after snowmelt, solo ritual). One meaningful deepening occurs when the protagonist's own fear surfaces and threatens to calcify, forcing the climactic choice. Minor cost-legibility issue: the "promise that even weight can learn to move" risks abstraction, though the lamp-lifting gesture and the final carried burden anchor it concretely enough.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The bronze grotto is not mere backdrop—it holds burdens in "shingled hush," pressing close as a spatial constraint that the protagonist must navigate by orienting properly. The kerosene lamp burner with whalebone ribs functions as a tool that shapes action: flame "climbed into patterns, fractal loops that beckoned the burdens inward." Sensory detail is filtered through the protagonist's craft-specific perception (bronze "shone like old coins, damp and bruised"). The grotto's bronze bones and the basin's starlight reflection charge the final image, making the setting indispensable to closure. Micro-setting and recurring object (lamp, basin, bronze walls) all constrain choices and elevate the ending.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—understanding the angles that let pain loosen—is signaled early and coheres throughout. One meaningful tightening: the protagonist's own burden emerges ("heavier than any I had ever coaxed") and threatens to calcify her chest, forcing the climactic choice to orient toward it. The decision to lift the lamp higher and join her fear to the fractal dance narrows options with visible cost: she will carry the same weight, only transformed. Agency is clear—protagonist's choice to orient rather than flee earns the resolution. No second reversal is required at this length; the single deepening suffices under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme—burdens align or devour—emerges organically from the protagonist's craft and is tested at closure when she applies the rule to her own heaviness. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer: "no less burden, only a clearer way to bear it." Subtext operates in the fractal geometry, the paradox of boundary-less entrapment, and the villagers' unknowing dependence. The whalebone lamp and shingled hush recur with reweighted meaning, avoiding token symbolism. Minor slip: "burdens align or they devour" is stated mid-piece, though it reads as the protagonist's internalized craft-rule rather than authorial intrusion, and the closure dramatizes rather than restates it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature throughout: the protagonist notices weight as geometry, flame as braid, silence as shingled pressure. Psychic distance remains stable; no head-hopping. Diction is voice-consistent—lyric register with craft-specific idiom ("fractal loops," "boundary-lessly trapped," "calcify") that feels earned by the character's practice. Purposeful compression in metaphor ("whalebone reverie," "bronze bones") is taught early and sustained. The prose modulates under pressure: when the protagonist's own burden surfaces, syntax tightens ("For a moment it threatened to close around my chest") before the climactic gesture. No filter-verb stacks or register drift. Single first-person POV with clean focalization.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Information density is high; figurative language serves pressure rather than ornament. Rhythm varies purposefully, accelerating in the closure beat. Overwriting check: dense metaphor in most lines ("bronze grotto," "shingled hush," "whalebone reverie," "fractal dance") risks saturation, but the pattern is taught early and each image constrains action or charges the ending, so no deduction for density. Minor loop: "boundary-lessly trapped" appears twice in similar phrasing without escalation. Template-cadence check passes; sentence openings vary. No paraphrase loops, filter stacks, or register drift. Strong propulsion and clarity. The slight metaphor density and one repeated phrase prevent entry to 8.2+.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of weight-work as fractal geometry, boundary-less entrapment as navigable paradox, and the whalebone lamp as tool feels specific and non-obvious. The protagonist's craft—gathering and orienting burdens rather than lifting or dispelling them—transforms the familiar burden-bearer trope. Emotional truth in the closure (accepting that the grotto will forget her) avoids tidy resolution. Risk-taking: lyric accumulation and abstract imagery ("shingled hush," "fractal weaver") could obscure, yet the piece commits fully and pays off at closure. Minor proximity concern: "bronze grotto," "shimmer," and "fractal" evoke fantasy-template diction, though the specificity of the whalebone lamp and the earned final choice lift the piece above derivative territory. Within-band bonus for sustained lyric risk: +0.3.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Fractal weaver's choices drive key turns: twisting wrists to break the calcifying burden, lifting the lamp higher to orient toward her own fear. Present in setup (first third), middle (coaxing burdens into flame), and closure (integrating her own weight). Irreplaceable: the craft of fractal patterning and orienting is the story's engine. Early signal, multi-beat involvement, causal pressure, and closure linkage all present. Cost tied to the element: accepting her own fear into the pattern. No swappability; no late arrival. High integration.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Kerosene lamp burner with whalebone ribs appears in setup (carried down), middle (lit to coax burdens), and closure (lifted higher to orient). Used concretely: flame becomes "fractal loops," protagonist twists the lamp's light to break calcification. The whalebone ribs recur as metaphor ("whalebone reverie") and charge the final gesture. Specificity: repaired with whalebone, polished to hold moonlight. Causal pressure: without the lamp's flame, burdens cannot be translated. Closure linkage strong. Two beats of active use plus charged reprise.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Shingled hush defines the grotto's atmosphere and constrains the protagonist's work—it is "a pressure, a roof of unsaid things overlapping like wet slate." Shapes tactics: protagonist must navigate this layered silence to coax burdens. Present in setup (grotto description), middle (burdens waiting "in the shingled hush"), and closure (protagonist's fear joins "the grotto's shingled hush"). Early signal, multi-beat involvement, causal role. Irreplaceable: the concept governs the setting's physics and the protagonist's method. Cost tied to it: the hush will eventually forget her.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Boundary-lessly trapped is introduced in the first third and explained as paradox: "to be caught without boundary meant every direction might still be chosen, if I could only align myself." Enables tactics: the protagonist moves through confinements by orienting. Appears again when reflecting on the village ("boundary-lessly trapped in its own ways"). Closure linkage is implicit—the final acceptance of her fear demonstrates alignment within constraint. Setup and middle present; closure participation oblique. Specificity moderate; could approach "paradoxically free" with minor edits. Causal role clear but not indispensable to the ending image itself.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Calcify drives the major turn: when the protagonist's own burden "tried to calcify around my fingers, thickening into a rigid lattice of resentment," she must turn her wrists to break the pattern. Later, her fear "threatened to close around my chest, to calcify my breath." The risk of calcification creates the stakes that force the climactic choice. Present in middle and closure; setup implied (the rule that burdens can harden). Two beats, causal pressure, closure linkage. Irreplaceable verb: "harden" or "fossilize" would lose the stony, irreversible connotation. Cost tied to it: the protagonist must act or be frozen.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>By orienting properly is signaled early: "By orienting properly, I could move through confinements." The method is demonstrated when the protagonist turns her wrists to break calcification and, at closure, "by orienting properly to the fear instead of from it," she integrates her own burden. Mechanics matter: orientation (toward vs. from) determines whether weight aligns or devours. Setup, middle, and closure all present. Causal role strong. Swappability low; "aligning" or "positioning" would lose the directional nuance. Cost tied to the method: she must face the fear directly.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Bronze grotto under starlight frames the entire story—setting as container and constraint. The grotto holds burdens "in layers," the bronze walls shine "like old coins," the basin collects rainwater that reflects constellations. The space pressures choices: the mouth "narrowed behind me," creating the boundary-less trap. Micro-setting (basin, bronze bones, starlight) alters tactics and charges the final image. Setup, middle, closure all present. Irreplaceable: the bronze's conductive/reflective quality and the grotto's layered architecture enable the fractal work. High causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>After the first snowmelt frames the ritual timing and establishes urgency: "I came there, as I always did after thaw, to collect the weights." The timeframe appears in opening and closing, creating a seasonal constraint. Middle development weak—no beats where the timing tightens decisions. The annual cycle implies the grotto will eventually forget her, adding thematic weight. Setup and closure present; middle beat absent. Lyric reprise (opening and closing lines echo) reweights the stake slightly. Functional but not indispensable; "after winter" could substitute with minor loss.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>To collect the weights of different burdens is the protagonist's explicit goal, stated early and pursued on the page. She coaxes burdens into flame, translates their heaviness into fractal patterns. Friction emerges when her own burden appears: she has gathered others' pain but refused to name her own. The climactic choice tests the motivation—she must apply her craft to herself. Setup, middle (gathering village burdens), closure (gathering her own fear) all present. Cost tied to motivation: she cannot escape the work. High causal pressure and closure linkage. Irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Whalebone reverie sets a tone of "drifting through pale structures that once bore oceans but now only remembered weight." The lyric, elegiac register is coherent through turns and modulates under pressure: when the protagonist's fear surfaces, syntax tightens but the meditative cadence holds. The tone charges the final image ("the mountains still dripping...I carried no less burden, only a clearer way to bear it"). Setup, middle, closure all present. Specificity high; "melancholy drift" or "spectral meditation" would lose the bone/ocean/weight anchor. The tone is not a single static mood—it intensifies and contracts with the stakes.</comment>
