<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's temperament as a "creeping normality noticer" is embodied through concrete observation and micro-choices (keeping the bread, bringing it to the tea house, unwrapping it). His motivation to find absolution crystallizes in the confession "I thought I would eat it when I forgave myself for not protesting," and the final stance shift—"no absolution, only a slight adjustment in his posture"—feels earned. The tea mistress functions as crucible and mirror, her observations applying pressure without easy comfort. Minor: the interiority occasionally edges toward articulate self-diagnosis ("Is noticing anything more than an excuse"), but the embodied action and contradictory impulses (waiting for purpose versus waste) keep it grounded.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lens: Accumulative/Textural with Situational pressure. The story coheres around Elias's attempt to resolve his complicity by witnessing the bread in the tea house; the tea mistress's gentle interrogation forces him to confront whether noticing is action. Closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): "no absolution, only a slight adjustment in his posture" crystallizes his stance with felt cost—the bread is consumed, the bakery remains gone, and he accepts the limit of his agency. The final image of warmth rising "slowly, defiantly" recharges the dominant stake without tidy resolution. Orientation is clean by line 2 (Elias, courtyard, post-migration timeframe). Cost is legible on the page: he eats the bread without miracle, foreclosing the fantasy of earned forgiveness.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The overgrown palace courtyard is vividly rendered with selective, purposeful detail: "glassless arches," "bamboo screens," "feral camellias root in broken pots," beans and chicory among thorns. The setting constrains choice (the tea house "only open now, in the thinning light, when regular customers have forgotten it exists") and the courtyard's "overgrown map of what once passed for order" mirrors Elias's internal state. The bread, kettle, and tea function as micro-setting objects that charge the closure: sharing the bread in this neglected, tended space makes the act of witnessing tangible. Spatial choreography is clean throughout. The setting serves as more than backdrop; it embodies the theme of noticing neglect and transforming it into soil.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake: can Elias resolve his complicity through the act of witnessing and sharing the bread? The pressure is situational and accumulative: the tea mistress's questions ("You think you could have stopped it," "Is noticing anything more than an excuse") tighten his dilemma without offering escape. The tightening is meaningful: unwrapping the loaf forces him to articulate his fantasy of self-forgiveness, and the tea mistress's response ("You are letting it be witnessed, and sharing is a form of direction, if not control") reframes the stakes from absolution to modest agency. The resolution is earned by his choice to bring the bread and eat it communally, foreclosing the comfort of symbolic preservation. Cost is visible: "Nothing miraculous happens, which feels like the closest thing to honesty either of them can manage."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—complicity, creeping normality, the limits of witnessing—emerges organically from the bread's preservation, the courtyard's guerrilla gardening, and Elias's confession. The tea mistress's observation "Others creep in like ivy, leaf by leaf, until the building wakes up strangled and everyone calls it normal" articulates the conceptual stakes without moralizing. The ending resists platitude: "no absolution, only a slight adjustment" offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. The bread functions thematically (memory, witnessing, shared cost) without symbolic shouting, and the final image of warmth rising "slowly, defiantly" reweights the piece with quiet defiance rather than tidy closure. No thematic echo or late sermon; the concept is lived in particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and consistent: lyric precision with accumulated texture ("heuristically gentle," "absence hardens into decor," "steam braided into the cold air like a question he still carries"). The narrative distance is stable third-limited on Elias; perceptual signature is selective and charged (he notices "the way absence hardens into decor"). Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext: "I did, though sometimes it feels like the bread kept me" and "You are letting it be witnessed, and sharing is a form of direction, if not control." The tea mistress's diction is distinct from Elias's interiority without convergence. Minor: occasional elevated constructions ("guerrilla gardening," "heuristically gentle") press the edge of the POV's plausible lexicon, but the effect reads intentional and voice-motivated rather than jarring.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and propulsive with high information density: "glassless arches frame the sky," "feral camellias root in broken pots," "the crumb surprisingly soft, strands stretching like reluctant threads of memory." Rhythm varies naturally, and figurative language is coherent and purposeful without muddle. Minor friction: a few template stems ("He comes here," "You think you could have") and one near-paraphrase loop (paragraphs on forgetting and the tea house opening). The filter-verb "seems" appears twice ("the tea house seems to fold closer," "people seem to sip at it"), but not clustered enough to dull immediacy. No loops touch the closure beat. Proofreading is clean; clarity and momentum are strong throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of creeping-normality noticing, guerrilla gardening, and tenuous absolution through a loaf of bread from a vanished bakery feels fresh and specific. The overgrown tea house, the bread's patient aging, and the final shared consumption create a non-obvious angle on complicity and witnessing. The emotional logic is honest without sentimentality, and the ending's refusal of miracle or epiphany ("Nothing miraculous happens, which feels like the closest thing to honesty") avoids template resolutions. Minor: the guerrilla-gardening frame is signaled but not developed enough to fully transform the premise; the piece leans more on the bread and the tea mistress's observations. Still, the combination of elements and the final image of warmth rising "defiantly" into the courtyard air feel inevitable in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elias as "creeping normality noticer" is established early ("he is a creeping normality noticer by temperament. He notices the small shifts everybody else accepts"). The trait shapes his choice to keep the bread and bring it to the tea house, and his observation drives the confession about not protesting. The tea mistress's challenge ("Is noticing anything more than an excuse") forces him to confront whether his noticing is action or evasion, and his final stance shift ("no absolution, only a slight adjustment in his posture") is a decision rooted in this temperament. The character's observation creates key turns and alters tactics, though the final beat is more acceptance than decisive action. Scores in mid-7s for strong beat involvement and closure linkage with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The bread appears in beat 1 (kept, wrapped, carried), beat 2 (unwrapped and discussed with the tea mistress), and the closure (eaten communally, dissolving into tea). Its meaning reweights: from symbol of guilt and preserved memory to shared witness and modest absolution. The bread's collapsed crust and fragrant ruin are handled on the page, and the act of tearing and eating forecloses Elias's fantasy of earned forgiveness. The final image of crumbs dissolving charges the closure with undeniable pressure. The bread is indispensable; removing it would break the story's logic and stakes. Strong causal pressure, closure linkage, and irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Tenuous absolution" frames the dominant stake: Elias seeks forgiveness for passivity, the tea mistress observes "Absolution is not on the menu," and the ending delivers "no absolution, only a slight adjustment." The concept shapes tactics (bringing the bread, unwrapping it, eating it communally) and reconfigures options at closure. It is thematic and structural, though the work is more atmospheric than plot-driven. The concept constrains the ending's emotional range (no miracle, no tidy forgiveness) and charges the final image. Scores in mid-6s for strong thematic shaping and closure linkage, though the concept is more atmospheric than mechanically causal.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Heuristically gentle" describes the tea mistress's movement and speech ("her steps heuristically gentle, as if testing each tile," "She adjusts her grey sleeves before speaking, as though language were something that might bruise"). The trait constrains her approach—she questions rather than judges, offering Elias space to articulate his guilt without easy comfort. The gentleness shapes the dialogue's rhythm and subtext, enabling the final reframing ("sharing is a form of direction, if not control"). However, the trait is more atmospheric than causally decisive; it colors the interaction but does not create a visible tradeoff or cost on the page. Scores in mid-5s for functional shaping of one key beat without strong causal pressure or closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Uncloak" appears once: "bamboo screens uncloak the secret tea house." The action is poetic and signals the tea house's hidden-then-revealed nature, but it is static description rather than a dramatized beat. The unveiling does not create a turn, narrow options, or shape the closure; the tea house is simply present and accessible. The verb fits the tone and supports the setting's atmosphere, but it is easily swappable (e.g., "reveal," "disclose") with minor edits. Scores in mid-4s for functional but replaceable use without causal pressure or closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Guerrilla gardening" is signaled in the first third ("The city forgets this place, but Elias and a few others remember it through guerrilla gardening. They turn neglect into soil, smuggling seeds in coat linings, watering at dusk from stolen cisterns") and frames Elias's motivation to find the sacred in the ordinary. The method shapes his worldview and connects thematically to witnessing and modest agency, but it does not drive a middle beat or appear in the closure. The guerrilla gardening is told rather than dramatized, and the tea-house scene does not involve seeds, watering, or transformation of neglect. Scores in mid-5s for thematic shaping of one beat (motivation) without middle development or closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The "secret tea house in an overgrown palace courtyard" is established early and anchors the entire scene. The courtyard's "overgrown map of what once passed for order," feral camellias, beans and chicory among thorns, and rainwater pools create a vivid, purposeful micro-setting. The tea house's conditional access ("only open now, in the thinning light, when regular customers have forgotten it exists") pressures Elias's choice to come and witness the bread there. The setting mirrors the theme (neglect, noticing, modest transformation) and charges the final image of warmth rising into the "cooling courtyard air." The environment constrains choice and shapes closure; removing it would break the story's logic. Strong beat involvement, closure linkage, and irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"After the birds fly south" is signaled in the opening line and establishes seasonal context (autumn or early winter), which fits the "thinning light" and "cooling air." The timeframe supports the atmosphere of neglect and transition but does not tighten decisions or alter tactics on the page. There is no live clock or deadline; the temporal framing is evocative rather than causal. The bakery's closure "last winter" provides backstory but does not pressure the present scene. Scores in low-4s for atmospheric setup without middle development or closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"To find the sacred in the ordinary" is dramatized: Elias brings the bread from the vanished bakery to the tea house, seeking meaning in the act of witnessing. The motivation is conflicted—he wants absolution but doubts whether noticing is enough—and the tea mistress's questions force him to confront the gap between desire and action. The final stance shift ("no absolution, only a slight adjustment") resolves the motivation with visible cost: he accepts the limit of his agency and finds modest sacredness in the shared act of eating. The motivation shapes two beats (bringing the bread, confessing) and charges the closure. Friction between wants (forgiveness) and costs (honesty) is clear. Scores in mid-7s for strong dramatization and closure linkage with felt cost.</comment>
