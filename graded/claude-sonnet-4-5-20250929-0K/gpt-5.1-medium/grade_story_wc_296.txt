<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Arlen's motivation is clear and consistent—his grief-driven search through the pattern of loss—and his druidic trait of feeling absence is embodied through concrete action (pressing the ice, sending awareness outward in circles). The final whispered reversal "I changed everything" earns the closure through prior causality and forecloses reconciliation with visible cost. Internal contradiction is present (guarded yet persistent, grief-locked yet methodical) and plays out in scene. Minor slip: the sister's disappearance is told in backstory rather than shown, which slightly weakens the emotional anchor, but the present-tense search compensates.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands on the page with cost: Arlen's confession cracks the ice and reverses the magician's frozen words, reconfiguring the premise of what failed and who is culpable. Drive lens is Causal with lyric accumulation; the orchard vortex tightens in response to his expanding circles, and the seed's hunger provides the mechanism that locked the original confession. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraphs. One meaningful tightening occurs when the vortex responds and the seed surfaces, narrowing options to confession. The cost is legible: admitting agency breaks the suspended state but implicates Arlen in the transformation of "nothing" into "everything."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The frozen lake, spectral orchard, and the ice as a "receptive, rippling stage" all constrain Arlen's approach—he cannot break the ice with force, only through patient druidic method. The seed pulsing beneath his hand charges the final image and provides the physical anchor for the conceptual turn. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful (frost-stiff cloak, warlike breath, branches raking the underside of ice). The micro-setting of the ice surface and the orchard's spiral motion shape tactics throughout. Spatial choreography is clear across the shore-to-orchard descent.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is established early: discovering the truth of his sister's disappearance and the magician's confession. Pressure tightens when the orchard vortex responds to Arlen's attention and the seed surfaces, forcing a choice between preserving the frozen moment or shattering it with counter-confession. Agency is clear: Arlen's whispered reversal is a decision with visible cost—he claims responsibility and cracks the suspended state. One meaningful turn narrows options (the seed's hunger clarifies why the confession froze). Escalation is driven by protagonist choice under the Causal lens, and the cost (self-implication, breaking stasis) is unmistakable on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—truth, accountability, and the cost of suspended grief—emerges organically from the orchard's mechanics and Arlen's final act. "What mirrors don't show" is dramatized: the hidden instant between choice and consequence surfaces through the seed, not through assertion. The final whispered line reweights the premise without moralizing: if the magician "changed nothing," Arlen's counter-claim "I changed everything" reprices agency and implicates him in the frozen pattern. Subtext operates through image (the seed as "black tear," confession as "warm meat of spoken guilt") and the orchard holding "scenes…people had dropped when they decided never to think of them again." No thematic echo or late-paragraph thesis; the closing image and line carry the weight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and apt; psychic distance tightens under pressure (from landscape overview to the tactile press of ice and breath). Perceptual signature is distinct: Arlen notices absence, misplacement, and the "shape of what was missing," filtering detail through his druidic lens. The prose modulates with emotional intensity ("warlike serenity," "quiet siege") without breaking voice. Slight elevation in diction ("grudging," "spectral," "bodily clichés") fits the folkloric register. No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks. The magician's three-word confession and Arlen's final whisper are clean and goal-driven. Minor slip: a few lines edge toward stock phrasing ("broken promises," "forgotten fruit"), but the overall texture remains controlled and character-particular.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings and lengths create visual texture. Information density is high—most lines advance image, character decision, or world logic. Clarity is strong except for one brief muddle: "breath came in slow, warlike serenity, each inhale a truce, each exhale a declaration of quiet siege" stacks metaphors that nearly contradict (truce vs. siege) but recover through context. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. A few figurative strings approach overwriting in the first third ("glassy and sharp as broken promises," "spectral branches like forgotten fruit"), but they remain legible and purposeful. Grammar and tense are consistent. The final line is clean and resonant. Penalty: −0.4 for minor figurative density in setup that does not obscure causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of druidic method, frozen-confession mechanic, and flesh-eating-plant seed as confessor is specific and non-obvious. The premise—an orchard that collects lost moments and a seed that feeds on spoken guilt—feels earned in hindsight through the logic of "failure left it suspended." Tropes (grief quest, cursed lake, magic trick gone wrong) are transformed through the particular mechanics of expanding circles and the seed's hunger. The final turn (Arlen's counter-confession as the key) grows from established pattern. Emotional specificity (grief as frozen icicle, the druid who "trusted nothing he could not taste in the soil") avoids generic templates. Risk-taking in structure (heavy setup, lyric accumulation, quiet climax) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. No derivative template or close echo detected.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Arlen's guarded druidic traits drive key choices: he refuses force, uses expanding-circle method, and searches for absence rather than presence. His final whispered confession is a decision that alters the frozen state and implicates him. Present in setup (opening paragraphs), middle development (choosing method over brute force), and payoff (the whisper that cracks the ice). Causal pressure is strong; his choice is irreplaceable and carries visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The seed appears at the climax beneath Arlen's hand and is causally active: its hunger for confessions explains why the lake froze and the magician's words were preserved. It enables the final turn (Arlen's counter-confession feeds or breaks the seed's hold). Present in setup (the orchard holds lost things), development (the vortex tightens toward it), and payoff (the seed surfaces and the confession cracks the ice). Its unique property—craving spoken guilt—drives closure. Slight limitation: it is described more than handled, but its presence and mechanics are indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The frozen confession is the story's engine: the magician's "I changed nothing" froze when the lake hardened, creating the central mystery and Arlen's quest. The seed's hunger for confessions explains the freezing mechanism. Arlen's counter-confession "I changed everything" directly inverts and unfreezes it, cracking the ice. Present in setup (backstory anchor), middle (drives the search and vortex tightening), and payoff (reversed on the page with visible cost). The concept shapes stakes, tactics, and closure; removing it collapses the logic.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Arlen's ability to "feel the shape of what was missing" enables his method (expanding circles to trace absence) and drives the middle action (sensing the orchard's held moments, finding the seed). It constrains his approach—he cannot use force, only patient tracking. Present in setup ("his only gift"), development (sends awareness outward, feels for his sister), and implicit in payoff (the confession is the ultimate lost thing). Visible cost: the search is slow and the final discovery implicates him. Tradeoff is clear but could be sharper.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Unbend" appears once as metaphor ("an icicle no fire could unbend") and governs the method (he will "open it…through expanding circles" rather than breaking it). It shapes the middle tactic (patient siege vs. force) and is implicit in the payoff (the ice cracks, the frozen state unbends). Present in setup and development, but not explicitly foregrounded at closure. Functional and thematically consistent, but somewhat replaceable with "thaw" or "open" without major structural loss. Score reflects solid integration across two beats but limited irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The expanding-circle method is signaled early ("he would open it…through expanding circles"), demonstrated in the middle (concentric rings of awareness from reeds to fish to orchard), and directly causes the climax (the circles converge on the seed, which surfaces). The method's mechanics matter: each circle widens his sense of the lost and tightens the vortex in response. Present in setup (declared), development (enacted across multiple beats), and payoff (the final circle reaches the seed). Causal and specific; removing it breaks the escalation logic.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The orchard vortex is the story's physical and symbolic center: it holds the lost objects and moments, spins in response to Arlen's attention, and tightens toward the seed. It pressures his method (he must search through layers of loss) and supplies the resource (the seed at its heart). Present in setup (described as swirling beneath ice), development (responds and tightens), and payoff (the vortex's convergence surfaces the seed). Its unique property—spiraling inward, holding scenes as well as objects—drives both atmosphere and mechanics. Indispensable to closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"After the magic trick fails" anchors the timeframe in setup and creates the premise (the lake froze that night, the confession was spoken then, Arlen has returned repeatedly since). It does not impose a live clock or tighten decisions in the present scene—Arlen's search proceeds at his own pace. Present in setup (opening and backstory) and implicit in payoff (the failure is finally addressed), but not a constraining pressure in the middle. Functional anchor but limited tactical impact; scores mid-band for framing without on-page urgency.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"To discover what mirrors don't show" is dramatized throughout: Arlen searches for the hidden instant between his sister's laughter and disappearance, the moment the mirrors did not capture. The orchard holds what was dropped or unseen; the seed holds the confession's hidden mechanism. The motivation drives the method (expanding circles to find absence) and the payoff (the counter-confession reveals what the mirrors concealed—Arlen's own agency). Present in setup (declared), development (search for "the instant between"), and payoff (the truth cracks the ice). Friction between desire and cost is visible: finding the truth implicates him.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Warlike serenity is established early ("each inhale a truce, each exhale a declaration of quiet siege") and sustained through patient, methodical escalation. The tone modulates with pressure: calm in the expanding circles, tightening when the vortex responds, crystallizing in the final whispered reversal. It charges the final image—Arlen's confession is not a shout but a quiet, deliberate act of war against the frozen state. Coherent across turns and purposeful; the paradox (serene yet combative) reflects Arlen's guarded druidic nature. Minimal static patches; tone supports closure.</comment>
