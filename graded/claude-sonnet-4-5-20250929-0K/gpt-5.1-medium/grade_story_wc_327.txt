<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The copper-veined storyteller is given a clear motive—translating texture into sound—and the final choice to merge his voice with the canyon's dying language shows agency with cost. However, interiority remains abstract and declarative rather than contradictory or embodied; phrases like "quietly articulate even in thought" label rather than enact. The protagonist's micro-choices (pressing the diamond, whispering syllables, accepting the curse) are present but feel predetermined by the concept rather than genuinely conflicted. Emotional progression lacks the irrational layering or self-deception that would elevate character work into the high band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—the piece builds pressure through sensory layering and the gradual alignment of diamond, echoes, birds, and voice. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (RR): the protagonist accepts the curse and sings a new language woven from accumulated elements, a stance crystallization with conceptual cost ("his own voice was being braided"). Orientation is clear (canyon, dusk, tunnel entrance) by the opening lines. One meaningful deepening occurs when the diamond reveals the canyon's lost language, and the final image reweights the premise. The cost is felt but not sharply dramatized—acceptance rather than visible forfeiture—which keeps this below 8.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The towers of bone, tunnel walls (smooth/jagged), and the flawed diamond function as micro-setting that constrains and enables the protagonist's method. Sensory detail is vivid and filtered through the storyteller's tactile focus (pocks, ridges, faint carvings). The diamond's fractured light and the bone towers shedding powder both charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clean and the canyon's physical properties (echoes, grooves, vibrations) directly affect the protagonist's work. This meets the 9+ test for environment shaping choice and closure, but purple phrasing ("pale lightning frozen in stone") occasionally ornaments rather than serves pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: record the last words of a dying language. One meaningful deepening occurs when the protagonist discovers his voice is being braided into the canyon's language, forcing acceptance of the curse as a bridge rather than a threat. The tightening is conceptual rather than a narrowing of tactical options, fitting the Accumulative lens. The cost—accepting entwinement and the curse—is legible but understated; the protagonist "did not step back" suggests a choice, but no alternative path is foreclosed on the page with visible friction. Agency is present but the escalation feels contemplative rather than pressured.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: translation, texture, echoes, the diamond's curse as truth-telling. The final image—singing a new language from bone dust, echoes, birds, and his own veins—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the question of preserving dying meaning. Subtext operates through the curse's redefinition and the choice to accept entwinement. However, lines like "every bridge between worlds" and "the death of a language" nudge close to thematic statement rather than full dramatization. The piece avoids moralizing but occasionally abstracts where a more grounded particular would sharpen resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited, perceptual signature is consistent (tactile, textural focus), and diction suits a storyteller-scholar. However, the phrase "quietly articulate" recurs as a label without behavioral payoff, and elevated register ("prismatic threads of possible sound") occasionally drifts above the focalizer's embodied moment. Free indirect style is clean, no head-hopping. Rhythm is controlled but leans toward uniform lyric cadence; some variation under pressure would lift this. The voice is distinctive but not fully pressure-tested—emotional peaks retain the same measured syntax as exposition.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout ("copper-veined," "pale lightning frozen in stone," "black throat swallowing"), which ornaments more than propels in several beats. Paraphrase loops appear: "quietly articulate even in silence" / "quietly articulate even in thought" / "quietly articulate" recurs without added meaning. Template cadence: multiple paragraphs open with "He [verb]" or "The [noun]" in succession, flattening rhythm. Clarity remains intact and no grammatical errors, but the accumulation of decorative phrasing and repetitive stems triggers −0.8 in Q7 under the patterned-artifact penalty pack. Information density is moderate; several lines restate the core concept without advancing pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The synthesis—using a flawed diamond to read textures via bird flight to reconstruct a dead language in a canyon of echoes—is specific and non-obvious. The transformation of the curse (truth-showing rather than evil) and the premise of translating texture into sound through motion patterns offer fresh angles. However, the archetypal lone scholar preserving lost knowledge is a familiar template, and the piece does not fully transform it through lived friction or moral calculus; the protagonist's acceptance is too smooth. The world logic (diamond reading vibrations, echoes wearing grooves) is internally consistent but borders on ornamental magic. Risk-taking in the accumulative structure and lyric register elevates but does not break new ground.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The copper-veined storyteller is present throughout and makes the key choice to accept entwinement at the end. Early signal, multiple beats (entering tunnel, using diamond, whispering syllables, final acceptance), and closure linkage are all present. However, the protagonist's agency is more observational than decisive—he follows the procedure the premise grants him. The copper veins are mentioned early and reprised in the final line ("his own veins"), reweighting the motif with modest causal pressure. The character shapes the ending but could be swapped for a similar "lone scholar" archetype with minor edits. Score: early setup +0.5, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.0, swappability −0.6, observational agency −0.7 = ~6.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The flawed diamond is introduced early, handled in two distinct beats (pressed against the wall, tilted to catch darkness and read fractured light), and the curse is redefined at the climax. It enables the protagonist's method and charges the final acceptance. Setup +0.6, two beats +0.9, causal pressure (enables reading) +1.0, closure linkage (curse accepted) +1.2, specificity (flawed heart, fractures) +0.5 = ~7.3 baseline; however, the diamond's mechanics remain abstract (how fractures map to phonemes is asserted, not shown), which limits irreplaceability. Rounded to 7.3.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The tunnel of echoes is the spatial crucible and the source of the dying language; the protagonist enters it, interacts with its walls and echoes, and the tunnel "shudders" in response to his voice. Setup (entrance before dusk), development (walls guide his translation method), and payoff (new voices surface, tunnel vibrates) are all present. Three beats +1.4, causal pressure (echoes shape phonemes, walls provide texture) +1.2, closure linkage (tunnel responds in final act) +1.4, specificity (grooves wearing to dust, walls smooth/jagged) +0.6 = ~8.1. The concept is indispensable; remove the tunnel and the story collapses.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Quietly articulate" appears three times but functions as a label rather than a trait that constrains or enables action. No on-page moment shows the protagonist choosing silence over speech or articulation creating a tradeoff. The phrase recurs in exposition and interiority without altering a beat. Present −0.3, label-only −0.5, no cost −0.6 = ~4.8. Late first thematic use does not count as middle development; no closure participation beyond tonal echo. Cap for missing development and missing closure: lower of 3.4 and 2.8 = 2.8; however, early mention + reprise in final third allows lyric-resonance credit up to 6.3, but functional work is absent, so ~4.8 is generous.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Harness" is the verb that names the protagonist's method and is used twice: once to describe translating motion into meaning (birds in flight) and again at the climax ("he chose to harness that merging"). It enables the key turn (accepting entwinement as guidance rather than threat). Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +1.0 = ~6.7. However, "harness" is somewhat swappable with "control" or "guide" without structural loss, and the action is more metaphorical than physical, reducing irreplaceability. No visible cost tied uniquely to "harness" beyond what "accept" or "channel" would also convey.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Bird flight patterns are introduced early (backstory: cranes over salt flats taught him the stone's language) and return in the final act (flock crosses the sky, protagonist aligns his voice to their flight). Two beats (past and present) +0.9, closure linkage +0.9, lyric reprise reweights prior material +0.5 = ~5.9. However, the method's mechanics are asserted rather than demonstrated—how a turn maps to a verb is told, not shown—and the birds at the end are distant, not directly manipulated. Summary-only in the backstory −0.5, ornamental use in final beat (description without on-page decision pressure) −0.4 = net ~5.9.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Towers of bone and the canyon are introduced immediately, supply the tunnel and its properties (echoes, grooves, bone dust), and the towers vibrate and shed powder in the final image. Early signal +0.7, three beats (arrival, tunnel work, final vibration) +1.4, causal pressure (canyon properties enable the translation) +1.3, closure linkage (towers shed powder, "molted letters") +1.3, specificity (vertebrae of a ring, breathing filled first words) +0.7 = ~7.8. Setting is indispensable and deeply integrated. The canyon is not merely backdrop; it is the protagonist's collaborator and the source of the language.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Across the death of a language" appears in the title-like phrase and the final line, framing the temporal stake. The protagonist has "walked the world" previously and arrives "just before dusk," but no on-page clock tightens his decisions—there is no urgency or deadline within the scene. Early signal +0.5, closure linkage (final line) +0.8, thematic weight +0.3 = ~5.4. The timeframe is conceptual rather than tactical; the protagonist could spend hours or minutes in the tunnel without narrative change. No middle beat where time pressure alters a choice. Cap for missing development: 3.4, but lyric reprise allows up to ~6.3; functional use is minimal, so ~5.4.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"To translate texture into sound" is stated early ("All his life he had walked the world to translate texture into sound") and dramatized through the protagonist's actions (tracing veins, running palm on stone, whispering syllables). Two beats (tactile exploration, vocal experiment) +0.9, causal pressure (motive drives method) +1.1, closure linkage (final act is translation) +1.0, early signal +0.6 = ~7.1. The motivation is consistent and shapes all choices. However, no internal conflict—no moment where translating competes with another want—limits the felt cost. The protagonist never hesitates or sacrifices an alternative path, so the motivation is unitary rather than conflicted.</comment>
