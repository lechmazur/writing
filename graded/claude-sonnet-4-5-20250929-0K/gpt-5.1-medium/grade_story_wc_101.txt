<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's interiority is concrete and embodied throughout—her desire to solve the mystery while preserving community dignity drives clear micro-choices. Kito's entrance and confession feel earned, his smudged sleeves and rice-crumb details grounding his midnight work. The final choice to "declare" rather than expose shows internal contradiction resolved through pressure. Minor: Mara's "gently persistent" trait is told more than demonstrated in contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story accumulates sensory pressure (wind, tiles, bell) and social fragments (anonymous donors) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration—Mara's declaration reweights the covenant without naming names. Closure is Charged Poise: the final image of "future assembling itself" crystallizes options with undeniable pressure and felt cost (secrecy ends, vulnerability begins). One meaningful deepening when Kito's revelation reframes the storeroom mystery. Cost is conceptual and social—exposure of the fragile system—legible in Mara's promise to "mark what we owe one another."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The terra-cotta arbor anchors throughout: its amplified acoustic (tiles chattering, then silent) marks emotional beats and the bell's resonance. The ridge, moonlight, and satchel choreography remain coherent. The arbor functions as both meeting-place and symbol, constraining the midnight encounter and charging the final assembly image. Micro-setting (the bell's curve catching moonlight through worn leather) textures the closure moment without becoming ornamental.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: preserve community cohesion while solving the mystery. Pressure tightens once when Kito's confession reframes anonymous giving as intergenerational covenant, forcing Mara to choose exposure or silence. Her decision—"I want them to know what they are building"—narrows options with visible cost (ending protective secrecy). The sanctions backdrop and midnight deliveries sustain coherent pressure under the Accumulative lens. One solid tightening suffices for this length; agency is decision with on-page consequence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme—intergenerational mutual aid as quiet covenant—emerges through Kito's midnight runs, elders' hidden jars, and the bell's history. The final image ("future assembling itself") offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in Kito's fear ("they will stop") and Mara's shift from detective to ceremonialist. Minor slip: "what we owe one another" edges toward thematic statement, though still anchored in the bell's ritual function.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Single POV, stable third-close on Mara. Perceptual signature is consistent: she notices the bell's "cracked tone," arbor acoustics, Kito's ink-smudged sleeves. Diction ("gently persistent," "patient ghosts") fits an educated exile leader. Dialogue is sparse, goal-driven, and carries subtext—Kito's "Sleep is for people who are not hungry" economically conveys desperation. No head-hopping. Rhythmic control tightens at the tiles' sudden silence, then expands in the final breath-held moment.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; the opening arbor description uses long cadences, the confrontation tightens to short exchanges, the ending expands again. Information density is high: most lines advance character, atmosphere, or stakes. Minor scaffold: "She reached into the satchel and drew out the bell" is straightforward utility; "the sound of the clapper brushing the rim was barely audible, yet here in the amplified quiet it seemed to lean forward in time" is vivid but borders on overwriting ("lean forward in time" strains the vehicle). No loops or pronoun drift. Clarity remains high even in figurative peaks.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The exile-community frame is familiar, but the anonymous-donation mechanism as intergenerational covenant offers a fresh synthesis. The midnight-run detail and the bell's dual function (school召唤 and assembly marker) feel specific and lived-in. Risk: ending on "future assembling itself" skirts abstraction, though it grows from prior particulars (tiles, bell, Kito's nod). The "amplified quiet" motif is original and well-deployed. Transformation is present but not radical; the piece executes its premise cleanly without bold structural deviation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's role as elected leader frames every choice: her decision to wait under the arbor (setup), her gentle interrogation of Kito (middle development), and her final declaration to convene the assembly (closure participation). Her leadership trait constrains her approach—she refuses to name donors, preserving dignity. Two distinct beats (confrontation, declaration) driven by this character position. Causal pressure: her authority enables the bell-ringing promise that reweights the covenant. Cost: she risks fracturing the fragile system by making it visible.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The bell appears in four beats: Mara checks it in her satchel (setup), Kito notices its curve through leather (middle visual anchor), Mara draws it out and brushes the clapper (penultimate beat), and declares it will mark the promise tomorrow (closure participation). Its antique status and school-courtyard history charge it with memory; its cracked tone becomes "an old voice insisting they were still a people." Irreplaceable: no generic召唤 device would carry this weight. Cost linkage: using it to mark rather than hide the covenant is the story's central risk.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Anonymous donations structure the entire conflict: Mara's mystery-solving stake (setup), Kito's confession that reframes them as intergenerational covenant (middle reversal and development), and Mara's declaration that whoever gives/receives is "part of the same promise" (closure participation). The concept's mechanics—midnight runs, hidden jars, stolen packets—shape tactics throughout. Removing this element collapses the story's logic. Cost: exposure of the system may end it, a risk Mara accepts to build collective recognition. Three beats, high causal pressure, closure linkage, and felt cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Gently persistent" is attributed to Mara in exposition ("she tried to be gently persistent") and demonstrated in her mild-voiced interrogation ("keeping her voice mild") and her refusal to shame Kito. It enables her non-confrontational approach and constrains her from demanding names. Present in setup (framing her leadership style) and middle (her questioning method), with closure linkage when she declares rather than exposes. Functional across two beats but somewhat label-reliant; the trait could be inferred from action alone. Moderate cost: her gentleness delays resolution but preserves trust.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>"Declare" anchors the climax: Mara's decision to "declare that whoever is giving, and whoever is receiving, is part of the same promise" (penultimate beat) and her statement "Tomorrow, we will gather...I will declare" (closure participation). The action redefines the anonymous system as public covenant without naming individuals—irreplaceable because "announce" or "proclaim" lack the ceremonial weight. Setup: her role as convener is established early. Two beats, high causal pressure, closure linkage. Cost: the declaration risks ending the donations by making them visible, a trade-off Mara accepts.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Midnight food runs appear in setup (storeroom deliveries "always at night"), are explained by Kito in the middle confrontation ("You have been on every midnight food run"), and frame the hidden labor that Mara will now make visible at closure. The method shapes tactics: the timing preserves anonymity, and Mara's vigil under the arbor is timed to intercept these runs. Two beats (mystery setup, Kito's confession) plus closure linkage (the runs will continue but under a new covenant). Causal pressure: the method's secrecy is both protective and isolating, and ending it carries cost.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The terra-cotta arbor anchors every scene: Mara waits beneath it (setup), its hollow tiles amplify the wind and create acoustic pressure (middle sensory development), and it will host tomorrow's assembly (closure participation). The arbor's central post holds Kito's box; its moonlit arch stages the confrontation. The ridge location isolates the encounter. Micro-setting: the tiles' chatter and sudden silence mark emotional beats. Three beats, spatial coherence, closure linkage. Moderate cost linkage: the arbor's public function (assembly site) will expose what was hidden in its storeroom.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The sanctions period is established early ("Sanctions had tightened again that week"), explains the storeroom mystery (legal imports shrank, donations became necessary), and pressures every choice—exile status, limited food, the risk of exposure. The timeframe shapes Mara's urgency and the community's fragility. Present in setup, sustained through middle development (explaining why donations matter), and implicit at closure (the assembly will occur within this constrained period). Two beats plus pervasive background pressure. Moderate causal linkage: the sanctions make the covenant necessary but do not directly trigger the final turn.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mara's desire to build intergenerational support is named in the climax ("the beginnings of what she had been trying to name at meetings: intergenerational support") but is dramatized earlier in her leadership role, her hope-keeping, and her recognition of Kito's youth versus the elders' stores. Setup: her organizing efforts. Development: her realization that the donations already enact this support. Closure: her declaration formalizes it. Three beats, causal pressure (the realization reframes her goal), closure linkage (the bell will mark the covenant). Cost: making it visible may fracture it. The friction between her investigative stance and her need to preserve the system creates authentic tension.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>"Amplified quiet" is established in the opening ("turning the quiet into something sharp, an amplified quiet that hummed in her ears"), sustained through the tiles' ceramic clinks and Kito's cautious footsteps, and peaks when "the tiles ceased their chattering so suddenly that the silence felt like an intake of breath." Tone modulates with pressure: the wind amplifies tension, the sudden silence charges the ending. Coherent across all beats. Closure linkage: the final "held moment" of silence reweights the quiet from absence to "a future assembling itself." Irreplaceable: no other tonal choice would carry this specific acoustic resonance tied to the arbor's architecture. Cost: the quiet that protected secrecy will be broken by the bell's public召唤 tomorrow.</comment>
