<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's interiority is concrete and specific—tapping rhythms as a decompression ritual anchors embodied memory. The choice to test the pattern on the roof and the climactic moment of "seeing" the vanished sandbar demonstrate internal pressure driving action. Minor slips: the others (Rafi, Lian) remain functional but lack contradictory impulses; their skepticism is told more than shown in choice. The final renunciation (remaining "drifting moored") fits the established stance, though the cost could land more sharply on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the protagonist glimpses the vanished sandbar, confirming the rhythm's effect, then is left "drifting moored above paths." The cost is implicit but legible: the protagonist cannot restore the paths, only witness their ghostly return. One meaningful deepening (atlas page → tapping → momentary manifestation) tightens the dominant stake. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. The lens holds; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The monitoring station, intake grate, roof rail, and tide chart constrain choices and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through professional attention: "pylons," "intake grate," "transparent tide table." The tapping on the rail and the station's "breath" anchor the protagonist's micro-choices. The vanished sandbar in the final beat is a direct product of the setting's bathymetric memory, making environment indispensable to closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early: "to discover why some paths disappear." The atlas page discovery tightens options; the protagonist's decision to tap the pattern on the roof is agency under pressure. The final manifestation of the sandbar narrows understanding—paths respond to rhythm but cannot be held—with the cost that recovery remains partial and fleeting. One clear escalation (observation → active testing → momentary success with visible limit) is sufficient at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: dying corals, fraying currents, the atlas page's penciled note. The tapping rhythm becomes a thematic carrier—memory, pattern, loss—without statement. The final image ("drifting moored above paths") offers a resonant, non-literal answer: the ocean remembers, but human action can only momentarily touch what is lost. The delayed revelation concept (paths vanish where rhythm breaks) is earned through accumulation and charged at closure without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature throughout: "slow scars," "voices that sound like distant anchors scraping," "swallowed stone." Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping. Diction remains within the protagonist's scientist-diver lexicon even under pressure. Dialogue (Rafi, Lian) is sparse but carries subtext and goal pursuit. The prose rhythm modulates with the tapping motif, and the final lines compress into lyric cadence without obscuring clarity. Filter verbs are minimal and voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High information density; nearly every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or the central mystery. Syntax varies purposefully, and figurative language ("tired lung," "storms grew teeth," "spared teeth") is coherent and voice-consistent. Minor slips: "delayed revelation sit inside me like a swallowed stone" uses a filter construction that slightly dulls immediacy, and "drifting moored above paths" at the very end risks mixed metaphor (drifting vs. moored). No loops or scaffold; rhythm propels throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of climate aftermath, oceanic memory, and rhythm as restorative force is non-obvious and specific. The atlas page device and tapping practice combine in a way that feels inevitable in hindsight. The story avoids template climate-fiction moralizing and delivers emotional specificity through the protagonist's diver past and present witness role. Minor limitation: the "rhythm breaks" note on the atlas page borders on convenient exposition, though it is earned by prior atmospheric buildup.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Present in setup (opening dive memory) and closure motivation (witness role drives testing the pattern). The coral bleaching past constrains the protagonist's perceptual mode ("counting colors") and shapes the final "inner register" that perceives the sandbar. Two beats: past as anchor, present as lens. Causal pressure moderate; closure linkage clear.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Appears in discovery beat (intake grate), lab examination (transparent tide table), and final roof test where the protagonist matches tapping to the drawn arrows. The note on the back ("rhythm breaks") seeds the climactic action. Object's unique properties (obsolete coordinates, penciled arrows) enable the protagonist's insight. Three beats, closure linkage strong, cost tied to the atlas's message.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The delayed revelation (protagonist withholds the atlas page initially, then shares it) structures the middle turn and final test. It shapes tactics: the protagonist moves from observation to active experimentation. Closure payoff is present but somewhat indirect—the revelation concept is less a closure hinge than a pacing device. Two gates (middle, ending), causal role moderate.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Periodically eternal" describes the models' expectation that tides should settle into predictable cycles. It frames the anomaly that drives investigation but does not constrain a specific on-page action with visible cost. Present in setup and thematic coloring; minimal beat involvement. Lyric resonance without tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The assembly in the main lab is where the atlas page is shared, others react, and the protagonist gauges their fear. This beat enables the solo roof test that follows. Two beats (lab discussion, implicit permission to act alone), causal role clear, though the action itself could be swapped for another group-check moment. Cost linkage moderate.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Signaled early (decompression chamber origin), repeated across beats (roof rail, matching shipping lanes), and drives the climactic manifestation. The mechanics matter: tap-pause rhythm corresponds to current flow. Three beats, causal pressure high, closure indispensable—the tapping is the method that momentarily restores the path. Specificity and cost both present.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The station provides the instruments (tide chart, intake grate, roof access) that enable discovery and testing. Spatial choreography is clear; the protagonist moves from screen to lab to roof. The setting's function (monitoring sea levels) directly ties to the mystery of vanishing paths. Three beats, moderate causal pressure, closure participation via the roof vantage and station's "breath."</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The ban frames the quieter post-crisis world and explains why currents should stabilize. It sets context but does not tighten decisions in real time. Present in setup and background logic; no live clock that alters tactics. Two gates (setup, thematic grounding), but no direct cost tied to the timeframe at closure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The motivation to discover why paths disappear drives every choice: signing a decade of shore leave, analyzing data, testing the tapping pattern. Friction is present between the desire to understand and the limits of intervention (paths appear but cannot be held). Dramatized in the atlas examination and roof test. Two beats with strong causal linkage and visible cost at closure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The "drifting moored" tone coheres across moves: suspended observation, quiet dread, lyric melancholy. It modulates from passive monitoring to active testing without breaking the elegiac register. The final image ("drifting moored above paths") charges the tone by literalizing it, making the oxymoron a felt state. Tone supports pressure and is inseparable from the closure effect.</comment>
