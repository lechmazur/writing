<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elena's interior is concrete and character-particular (the five-ring calculation, the typesetter's tongue metaphor). Her logic-driven stance crystallizes through micro-choices (opening the velvet drawer, gripping the nib like a gavel) that embody contradiction between inherited guilt and active intervention. The final choice to run the story is earned by the proof-by-contradiction sequence with visible cost (breaking her father's legacy publicly). Tariq functions cleanly as pressure but remains slightly thin; his "devotedly observant" trait is stated more than dramatized in choices.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors cleanly by line 4 (Elena, observatory, phone call). The piece follows a causal lens: journalist's revelation → Elena's internal proof-by-contradiction → decision to publish, with each step narrowing options. Closure lands on-page as a Decisive Change (switching from silence to public exposure) with felt cost legible in "if there is any trust left" and the image of presses thundering. One substantive reversal (from potential silence to intervention) tightens pressure sufficiently for this length. The logic chain holds without breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The observatory is vividly anchored (glass-limbed lighthouse, telescopes tilted toward human brightness, brass and dark wood console). The rosewood nib functions as micro-setting, constraining Elena's final choice by reminding her of her father's contradictory legacy. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (the room's "long metallic sigh," heels clicking like gavels). The setting charges the closure image (observing down through clouds, presses thundering below) but spatial choreography during the phone call remains slightly abstract—we lose track of Elena's exact position mid-scene.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (how to handle inherited surveillance machinery) signals early and tightens through one meaningful reversal: Elena moves from potential silence to active intervention via the proof-by-contradiction sequence. Agency is decision-driven with visible cost: publishing will destroy her family's reputation and break public trust. The proof structure itself narrows options logically—silence cannot be liberation, therefore intervention is required. Tariq's revelation provides external pressure that Elena converts into internal moral calculus. The cost is stated and felt but not fully embodied in a forfeiture on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme (information as liberation vs. surveillance as prison) emerges organically from the Orpheus Array mechanics and Elena's proof-by-contradiction without thesis statement. The rosewood nib recurs with reweighted meaning (from apology tool to gavel, then arrowhead pointing backward). The ending offers a resonant non-literal answer: "we aim down today, and after that, if there is any trust left, we aim up"—intervening to break the hidden orbit rather than retreating into silence. The "orbits of regret" phrase risks slight poeticism but lands as a charged conceptual frame rather than decoration. No moralizing in the final paragraph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with Elena's perceptual signature consistent (typesetter metaphors, philosophical logic, gavel imagery). Dialogue carries subtext and goal pursuit; Tariq's opening "without greeting" signals heavy truth, Elena's "Stay on the line" reveals her need for witnessing. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during the proof sequence, pulling back slightly for the final image). The phrase "solemn playfulness" appears in narration as a label rather than being fully enacted in Elena's syntax under peak pressure, though her proof-by-contradiction does carry dry philosophical wit. Free indirect style is clean with no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies effectively (short declarations during the proof, longer lyric sentences for observatory description). Information density is high with most lines doing double work. Minor loop: "observant as ever, devotedly observant" is a small synonym echo. The metaphor density is controlled but occasionally tips toward the decorative ("clouds have climbed from the sea, swallowing skyscrapers in a patient, murmuring gray" front-loads lyricism before stakes land). No scaffold or template cadence. Grammar and tense are clean. The opening and closing images both anchor stakes and voice effectively.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of newsprint heiress + emotion-mapping satellites + proof-by-contradiction offers a non-obvious angle on surveillance-state narratives. The observatory-as-surveillance-tool twist feels earned by the early detail of lenses "tilted toward human brightness." The rosewood nib transforms from apology instrument to philosophical pivot. Risk is present in the formal proof structure embedded in dialogue and interiority. However, the surveillance-guilt inheritance premise echoes common media-dynasty templates; transformation arises more from the proof method than from radically fresh stakes. Execution is confident but not structurally daring.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elena is present throughout as sole POV. Her choice to run the story (final third) constitutes the key turn and is causally prepared by her proof-by-contradiction. She also makes the micro-choice to grip the nib and decide "we aim down today," foreclosing the temptation to "switch Orpheus to the stars." Setup, development (proof sequence), and payoff (publish decision) are all on-page with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The rosewood pen nib appears in two beats: Elena opens the drawer and examines it ("arrowhead pointing backward, accusatory, archaeological"), then closes her fingers around it "like a gavel handle" during the proof. The object's meaning shifts from her father's apology tool to her own instrument of intervention. It participates in the closure image thematically but is not handled or invoked in the final lines. Causal pressure is moderate; it primes her resolve but does not enable or constrain the publish decision mechanically.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Orbits of regret" is introduced by Tariq as the data product name, then Elena uses the orbit metaphor to frame her proof ("to break this orbit is to intervene") and later considers "another tiny moon in my own private orbit of regret." The concept shapes her stakes (escaping inherited guilt cycles) and her final tactic (public intervention to break the hidden machinery). It appears in setup, middle, and thematically charges the ending. The concept is more than decorative; it redefines her inheritance and constrains her options.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Devotedly observant" is attributed to Tariq with the line "observant as ever, devotedly observant, because he has learned that attention is armor." This is label-only; we do not see Tariq make an on-page choice where observance constrains or enables action with visible cost. He delivers information and goes quiet at appropriate moments, but his observation does not alter tactics or trade off against another trait. Present functionally but not dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Intervene" is explicitly named in Elena's proof climax: "The only way to break this orbit is to intervene, to tilt the trajectory publicly." The action encompasses her decision to publish and reject both silence and cosmic escapism. It defines the major turn and closure. Setup is implicit (the phone call presents the problem), development occurs in the proof, payoff is the publish decision. The verb could be replaced with "expose" or "act" with minor edits, but the term's geometric connotation (tilt the trajectory) ties it tightly to the orbit metaphor.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Proof by contradiction is signaled ("suppose my father was right…and suppose also that Orpheus shackles; both cannot stand together"), its mechanics are spelled out on the page ("If silence is liberation…therefore silence cannot be liberation"), and the conclusion drives her publish decision. The method shapes her internal attempt and makes the turn legible and inevitable. Setup (philosophical university background mentioned), development (proof executed mid-scene), and payoff (decision follows from proof conclusion) are all present. The logical structure is specific and weight-bearing.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The observatory is established early (glass-limbed lighthouse, telescopes aimed down, console with velvet drawer) and participates in multiple beats. It provides the rosewood nib (drawer), reflects her choice spatially ("the observatory seems to lean closer"), and anchors the closure image ("below the clouds, phones will ring"). The environment charges mood and symbolism but does not mechanically constrain Elena's phone-based decision; she could reach the same choice elsewhere. Solid setup, thematic development, and closure presence, but limited tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the journalist calls" is the story's present anchor. The entire piece unfolds during and immediately after the call (Tariq stays on the line, Elena walks among telescopes, decides, then envisions tonight's presses). Time is tracked continuously without gaps. It does not create urgency (no ticking clock that alters moves), but it does provide a coherent window and the ending gesture ("tonight") marks a near-future consequence. Setup and continuity are clean; development and escalation via time pressure are absent.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"To discover hidden truths" is stated as her desire in the climax: "I want to discover the hidden truths my father buried even from himself." The motivation is prepared by her earlier realization that she inherited "invisible machinery of guilt" and drives her publish decision. It is dramatized through her proof and choice, though the friction between wanting truth and fearing cost could be more visceral—her temptation to "switch Orpheus to the stars" passes quickly. Setup (inheritance question), development (proof), payoff (publish to expose) are present with moderate friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Solemn playfulness is enacted in Elena's proof-by-contradiction ("her tone slips into the solemn playfulness she once used to argue philosophy at university") and sustained in diction like "typesetter tongues a bitten lip," "jovial and grave," "another tiny moon." The tone modulates with pressure (proof sequence is precise, final image is more lyric) and charges the ending's measured defiance. It is coherent across beats and ties to character background. The label appears once in narration, but the tone itself is performed in syntax and image choice throughout.</comment>
