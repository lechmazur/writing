<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lark's interior voice is specific and embodied through her artist's perception ("socially perceptive eye, trained on city crowds, now watched the gathered pilgrims as if they were sketches taking shape"). Her motivation to "coax [meaning] out with colors and jokes" generates the climactic decision to draw despite fear. Internal contradiction lands clearly when she realizes "her art was [never] harmless" yet kneels to draw anyway, foregrounding a credible cost. Minor slip: the boy's confession feels slightly mechanical, serving exposition more than his own arc, but it drives Lark's final choice without breaking causality.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph (Lark, grotto, during the unlearning). The piece follows a causal-accumulative hybrid lens: Lark's theft of the tile shard (causality) changes her perception, enabling the final act of drawing that reweights the grotto's "mess" into "outlined chaos." Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): she kneels, presses the flake into sand, and draws, crystallizing her stance with visible cost ("frightened her," "never again pretend her art was harmless"). The final image recharges the mandala motif and makes the emotional price legible on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The grotto's mist, dripping ceiling, and whispering gallery tiles create a coherent atmosphere that pressures Lark's choices: the tiles "learned your secrets," the hush "tugging at her tongue," and the boy "staring…at the dripping ceiling" establish spatial and sensory anchors that drive the action. The tile flake functions as micro-setting, constraining her final choice to draw in the sand. Selective detail supports the closure image without excess; the "lilac unease" modulates from opening dread to the "gentle, lilac unease" that charges her realization.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: Lark must "listen and draw whatever the hush would not say aloud" despite skepticism. The piece delivers one meaningful tightening when picking up the tile flake changes the "emergent hush" flavor and floods her with stolen whispers, forcing the decision to interject and then draw. The final act forecloses her prior distance ("never again pretend her art was harmless"), providing visible cost. The escalation reads more as accumulative pressure than causal narrowing, but the hybrid lens accommodates this and the cost is legible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme—meaning resides not in erasure but in outlining the mess—emerges from concrete particulars: the mandala's dissolution, the tile flake's whispers, and Lark's final drawing that gives "chaos…a fragile frame." The closing image offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The realization is earned through sensory and social observation rather than abstract philosophizing. Minor slip: "coax it out with colors and jokes" borders on thematic statement early, but the final beat reweights it through action rather than repeating the claim.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Voice is consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature filtered through Lark's artist's eye ("sketches taking shape," "line of color breaks gray"). Diction remains character-particular under pressure; the prose modulates cadence at peak beats without losing clarity. Free indirect style is clean, and psychic distance stays stable. The boy's brief dialogue ("Losing my brother") is efficient and goal-driven, landing subtext without over-articulation. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks obscure immediacy, and the final lines sustain rhythmic control through the closure image.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high: most lines advance character, atmosphere, or pressure. Opening and closing images anchor stakes and recharge motifs effectively. However, mild overwriting appears in the first third: "breathed a soft, lilac unease that gnawed at the edges of sound" stacks modifiers without causal urgency, and several adjacent sentences in the pilgrims' description loop similar content ("ringed the central pit," "Mist coiled between them, smudging faces," "making every profile look half-erased"). These artifacts do not touch the closure beat, so the Non-closure Accumulation Cap limits the penalty to −0.8, but they prevent entry to the high 8s.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of whimsical street artist, sacred ritual, and whispering-tile mechanics feels specific and non-obvious. Lark's skepticism and final commitment transform the "unlearning" trope through embodied choices rather than platitudes. The final image—pressing the stolen tile into sand and drawing with "every stolen whisper pick[ing] a color"—is memorable and rooted in prior causality. Risk-taking in voice and structure (accumulative-lyric pressure, no villain) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The piece avoids generic "artist discovers purpose" templates by grounding transformation in theft, fear, and a boy's confession.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lark is present throughout, drives the theft of the tile (beat 1), the interjection to the boy (beat 2), and the final drawing (beat 3). Her whimsical skepticism ("more used to sidewalk dragons") contrasts with the sacred context and her choices alter tactics across all three beats. The final act would not exist without her artist identity shaping how she interprets the whispers. Setup is early, development occurs in the middle interjection, and closure is directly shaped by her kneeling to draw. Causal pressure and closure linkage are strong; beat involvement spans three distinct moments.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The tile flake is discovered mid-scene, picked up (beat 1), "quivered, catching the echo" of the boy's confession (beat 2), then pressed into the sand at closure (beat 3). Its unique property—capturing and exhaling whispers—directly enables Lark's perception shift and final drawing. Setup arrives slightly late (~30% mark) but the element drives two subsequent beats and is causally active in the closure image. The mechanics matter: without the flake's "pressure full of half-words," Lark cannot "see" the patterns or draw. Swappability is low; cost connection is visible.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Emergent hush" is named early and recurs with shifting valence: it silences the crowd, tugs at Lark's tongue, and "changed flavor" when she picks up the tile. The concept pressures tactics (Lark must breach the silence to interject) and charges the final image when she draws "letting every stolen whisper pick a color." Setup is strong, middle development is functional (the hush prevents easy speech), and closure participation is clear in the contrast between imposed silence and Lark's colored interjection. Causal pressure is moderate; the hush constrains but does not fully narrow options.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Lark's "socially perceptive eye" is invoked early and demonstrated when she senses "which ones wanted permission to forget" and identifies the boy "clutching a broken sketchbook." This trait enables the middle interjection ("her socially perceptive instinct tugged her attention toward a boy") with visible cost: breaching ritual silence. Setup is early, development occurs in the middle beat, and the trait indirectly shapes closure by guiding her to the confession that informs her drawing. The trait is not label-only; it alters one key action. However, swappability is moderate—"observant" could substitute with edits.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Lark's whispered interjection to the boy is the hinge action: it breaks the ritual silence, elicits the confession ("Losing my brother"), and provides the emotional fuel for her final drawing. Setup occurs implicitly when the hush is established as taboo; the interjection itself is beat 2, and its consequence (the confession rewriting itself "through the patterns in a sand mandala") directly enables closure. The action is not easily swappable; without breaching the silence, Lark gains no confession and the final drawing lacks its charged specificity. Beat involvement is two (interjection, consequence in final image), causal pressure is strong.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The sand mandala is present from the opening ("ringed the central pit where the sand mandala waited"), dissolved by the master mid-scene ("scattered a fistful of new sand…turning crisp symbols into blurred gradients"), and becomes the canvas for Lark's final drawing ("she knelt by the pit…and began to draw"). Its mechanics matter: the dissolving mandala models the grotto's philosophy ("the mess was not to be erased but outlined"), which Lark enacts by drawing into it. Setup is early, development is thematic/observational (watching the destruction), and closure is directly shaped by the mandala as both surface and symbol. Causal pressure is moderate; beat involvement is two (dissolution, Lark's drawing).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The whispering grotto shapes stakes throughout: the mist "smudging faces" and dripping ceiling create disorientation, the whispering gallery tiles enable the theft, and the central pit provides the canvas for closure. The grotto's acoustic property (tiles "learned your secrets and traded them with stones in other cities") is causally active when the tile flake "exhaled into her palm" with stolen whispers. Setup is immediate, middle development occurs when the tile's mechanics are dramatized, and closure is enacted within the grotto's pit. The setting constrains Lark's choices (she cannot leave, must listen) and supplies the tile resource. Irreplaceability is high; beat involvement spans three moments.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"During the unlearning" is named early and frames the scene's purpose: "when the grotto stripped names off thoughts." The timeframe creates ambient pressure (pilgrims have gathered for this ceremony, the master performs on schedule) but does not tighten decisions with a live clock. The ceremony's ritual structure shapes Lark's breach (she interrupts the "emergent hush"), indirectly affecting closure. Setup is early, development is ambient (the ceremony continues), and closure occurs within the timeframe but is not urgently constrained by it. The timeframe is functional but somewhat replaceable; a longer or vaguer window would not break the story.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Lark's motivation "to discover meaning in the mess" is stated early ("Meaning rarely appeared for her; she usually had to coax it out") and dramatized in her climactic realization and drawing. The friction between her skepticism ("not sure she believed in such tidy transformation") and the grotto's demand creates internal conflict that drives the final choice. Setup is early, development occurs when she picks up the tile and begins to perceive patterns, and closure is directly shaped by her decision to "outline" the chaos rather than erase it. The motivation is not told-only; visible cost ("frightened her") and the forfeiture of her prior detachment land on the page.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Lilac unease" is named in the opening line ("the cavern breathed a soft, lilac unease") and modulates through the piece: from Lark's initial skepticism, to the tile's "pressure full of half-words," to the "gentle, lilac unease" of her realization. The tone remains coherent through turns without flattening into static dread. It charges the final image when fear ("frightened her") does not prevent action but colors it with hesitation and cost. Setup is immediate, development is sustained through atmospheric description and Lark's internal voice, and closure is tonally consonant. The specific color-modifier ("lilac") is less causally necessary than the unease itself, limiting irreplaceability slightly.</comment>
