<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The poet's interiority is richly embodied—"the old absence stir in his throat, that space where public language used to live"—and his internal contradictions (wanting both to forgive nothing and to go on living) drive his choice to look through the telescope. The astronomer is less developed, serving primarily as guide rather than applying her own pressure. Minor slips: some gestures feel stock ("furiously tranquil" eyes, "cracked crescent" smile), and the poet's agency leans observational until the final gaze. The closure choice to look and be changed is earned but quiet.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with Situational pressure—the vigil structure accumulates auroral imagery and censorship metaphors toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (the poet's internal rarefaction: "the air rarefied, sharp and clear as truth"). Orientation anchors cleanly by the second paragraph (who/where/when). The one meaningful deepening occurs when the poet places his eye to the telescope and sees the cartography of scars made literal, crystallizing his stance with felt cost (he must now "go on living" bearing witness). Cost is present but oblique—internal shift rather than decisive external action.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The observatory setting constrains the vigil's timing and enables the telescope revelation; "stormlit" and "above clouds" charge the metaphor of elevation beyond reach of censors. Micro-setting details (darkroom timer, copper fittings, open dome slit) anchor the space and the timer's ticking disciplines the hour, shaping the poet's window to act. The final telescope view—luminous bruise, rivers of dim light over prisons—directly charges the closure image. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful throughout, filtered through the poet's literary lens.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: to understand the cartography of scars (personal and national). The story deepens rather than reversing—external storm pressure and the astronomer's revelation tighten until the poet chooses to look, narrowing his options from passive forgetting to active witnessing. The telescope vision forecloses retreat: he cannot now "pretend [he] did not see." Cost is present but interior; no external antagonist tests him beyond his own hesitation. One meaningful tightening under the Accumulative lens is sufficient at this length, though the pressure remains largely situational rather than escalating through protagonist agency.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—witness as transformation, the persistence of silenced voices—emerges from concrete particulars: the banned verses that "spiked detectors," the auroral map of repressions, the poet's throat-space where "public language used to live." The telescope's literal revelation of metaphorical scars avoids mere symbolism by grounding it in scientific apparatus and the astronomer's data. The final image—"the air rarefied, sharp and clear as truth"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to whether forgiveness or witness matters more, without moralizing. Subtext operates richly in dialogue ("Your letter did not ask... it commanded like weather").</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Single tight POV; the poet's perceptual signature is distinctly literary ("isobars on the soul," "lines scratched from a stanza"). Diction remains elevated and metaphor-dense throughout, consistent with his voice, though occasionally borders on over-lush ("eyes were furiously tranquil, like a sea holding back its own shipwrecks"). Dialogue carries subtext and goal pursuit; the astronomer's lines advance revelation while the poet resists then accepts. Psychic distance modulates purposefully—close during interior reflection, slightly wider during the telescope vision. No head-hopping; focalization stays clean.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>High figurative density throughout—most sentences carry metaphor or elevated imagery. While voice-consistent, the accumulation risks over-writing in places: "furiously tranquil" as both attribute and repeated phrase, "bruised halos," "temporary handwriting" of lightning. Some phrases border on stock lyricism ("violence of sky," "quiet acquiescences"). Rhythm varies well; information density is strong. Minor scaffold: "The phrase hung between them, heavier than the storm" tells weight rather than showing its effect. No loops or clarity breaks, but the metaphor load in peak beats (the telescope vision) competes for attention. Closure image is clear despite density.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of censorship, auroral science, and witness is fresh and specific—"the sky remembers every syllable they crossed out" transforms the trope of silenced poet through concrete scientific apparatus. The "cartography of scars" metaphor made literal via ionosphere bruising is a non-obvious angle. Risk: sustained lyricism and metaphor density throughout could alienate readers seeking narrative drive, but the gamble pays off in thematic coherence. Some elements trend familiar (poet vs. censors, mountaintop revelation), yet the observatory frame and darkroom timer give it particular texture.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The censored poet frames the premise, pursues understanding via the astronomer's summons, and makes the pivotal choice to look through the telescope—a decision that "rarefies" his interior and forecloses retreat. His censorship history shapes the stakes and the auroral data reflects his banned verses. Present across all three beats (arrival, dialogue, telescope vision) and essential to closure. However, his agency leans reactive until the final gaze; the astronomer drives revelation more than he pursues it.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The darkroom timer appears twice: wound by the astronomer to mark the one-hour vigil window, then clicks throughout to "discipline the hour into equal beats," creating temporal pressure. It contributes to the vigil's constraint and charges the observatory's photographic metaphor (darkroom/revelation). However, it does not directly enable or block the poet's choice to look, and the timer's expiration is not shown at closure—it marks time but does not transform. Functional across two beats but not indispensable to the ending.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"A vigil in pause" is named by the poet mid-scene and structures the entire action: waiting above the storm for the ionosphere to "make the invisible visible." The concept shapes tactics (they must wait for the charged particles, cannot intervene) and the closure hinges on witness-as-transformation during this pause. The astronomer's framing—"we watch, we do not intervene, but in the watching something in us changes density"—directly articulates how the vigil reconfigures the poet. Present in setup, constrains the middle, and charges the ending.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Furiously tranquil" is applied twice: to the astronomer's eyes and later to the air "above the weather... buoyed by thunder yet steady as held breath." It captures the paradox of storm witness—intense pressure held in stillness—and mirrors the poet's internal state at closure ("the air rarefied, sharp and clear as truth"). The attribute enables the vigil's tense waiting and charges the ending's tone. However, it functions more as mood and metaphor than as a trait constraining specific actions with visible cost. Present early and reprised at closure, but does not block or enable a choice.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Rarefy" appears once at closure: "Inside him, the air rarefied, sharp and clear as truth," describing the poet's transformation after viewing the auroral scars. It names the core change (witness makes him less dense, more clarified) and links to the astronomer's earlier claim that "in the watching something in us changes density, rarefies or condenses." The action is internal and metaphorical rather than physical, serving as the story's Resonant Reconfiguration. It redefines the poet's stance but is not a tactical move tested across beats—it is the *result* of the telescope vision, not a repeated method.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The sealed envelope in the bus timetable appears in backstory only, explaining how the astronomer's summons reached the poet weeks ago. It establishes the clandestine method fitting a censored regime and primes the reunion, but does not return or constrain any present choice. The mechanics matter thematically (covert communication, erasure imagery) yet the envelope does not shape the vigil itself. Functional setup without middle or closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The stormlit observatory above clouds is indispensable: its elevation places the telescope "above the weather so no minister of culture can reach it," enabling the auroral observation that censors cannot suppress. The storm outside pressures the timing (cloud deck must open) and mirrors the poet's internal turbulence. The dome slit, telescope barrel, and copper fittings anchor the space and charge the final vision. The setting supplies the crucial resource (telescope access during the particle window) and its remoteness shapes the stakes. Present in setup, constrains middle action, and the telescope view is the closure image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"When masks slip" titles the appointed hour and the astronomer winds the timer to mark "exactly one hour" before the ionosphere flares. The timeframe tightens the vigil, creating urgency ("minutes slipped away, the storm thickened") and disciplining the conversation toward the telescope moment. However, the timer's expiration is not shown and the particle window's arrival is implied rather than dramatically clocked. The constraint is real but not live-ticking through the closure beat. Present across all three beats and shapes the decision to look now, but the mechanics soften near the end.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"To understand the cartography of scars" is named explicitly by the poet mid-scene and drives his choice to ascend the mountain and look through the telescope. The motivation is conflicted—he seeks both understanding and a way to "forgive nothing and still go on living"—and the friction between witness and survival creates the story's emotional charge. The desire is tested when he must place his eye to the telescope and confront the literal map of repressions. Dramatized through the arrival, the dialogue exchange, and the final gaze, with visible cost (he cannot now un-see). Essential to all three beats and the closure effect.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Storm-kissed wonder" permeates the prose: "stormlit observatory," "violent sky," "storm-kissed wonder and... grief too patient for crying" in the telescope vision. The tone balances awe at the auroral beauty with the weight of witness, modulating from the poet's wary arrival through tense dialogue to the reverent final gaze. It charges the ending image—luminous bruise, ghostly vortices—without collapsing into simple wonder or simple grief. Coherent across all beats and the paradox (wonder + cost) intensifies at closure. However, the dense lyricism occasionally tips toward decorative rather than pressure-driven modulation.</comment>
