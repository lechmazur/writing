<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Ariel's interiority is embodied through taste-perception and micro-choices (lifting the seed to her tongue, choosing the future that "felt most like laughter"). Internal contradiction appears when she swallows despite uncertainty, driven by a desire to create that wars with bodily risk. Kai remains functional but secondary; his panting arrival and question about safety provide pressure without deep characterization. The ending choice—feeding stories first, then soup—emerges from her trait-driven logic, though the cost (lodging the seed behind her breastbone) could be more viscerally present in the final image.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly in the opening paragraph. The piece reads under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through layered actions (tasting the seed, clearing beds, planting cuttings) that deepen the stake (waking the greenhouse) without strict causal linkage. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—Charged Poise: "something new had already taken their place, rooted now in soil and mind" crystallizes the shift from ruin to stubborn renewal, and the cost is legible (the seed lodged in Ariel's chest, the alignment fading). One meaningful deepening occurs when Ariel swallows and the warmth guides her hands, narrowing options to this gamble. The lens holds, though the final image leans more toward thematic assertion than scene-driven pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The rusted greenhouse is vivid and purposeful: missing glass panes, salt-crusted vines, cracked planters supply concrete obstacles that Ariel and Kai must clear. Spatial choreography is clean (central aisle, beds, floor crunching underfoot). The aligned moons create a ticking environmental constraint—three pale columns meet over the central bed—that times the pruning and planting. The final glow through cracked panes charges the closure image. Sensory detail is dense and filtered through Ariel's taste-centered perception, though some metaphors (vines like cathedral ribs, dust motes like tiny planets) gesture toward grandeur without anchoring tactile friction.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—waking the greenhouse to feed the quarter—is signaled early. One meaningful tightening occurs when Ariel swallows the seed and its warmth guides her planting choices, narrowing her options to this experiment with visible bodily cost (the seed lodged behind her breastbone). The alignment's light provides a ticking window, and the pruning/planting sequence under that pressure creates coherent escalation. Agency is clear: Ariel chooses to taste, swallow, and plant despite uncertainty. However, the final image ("something new had already taken their place") tells the outcome rather than dramatizing a live choice or visible consequence that forecloses a path, softening the pressure at closure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme—refusal of decay without imitating harshness, "disagreeing with [the past's] ending"—emerges organically from Ariel's actions (tasting memories, pruning dead stems, planting with whispered recipes). The knowledge fruit seed and greenhouse function as particulars that ground the theme without overt moralizing. The line "we are not fighting the past, we are disagreeing with its ending" teeters on the edge of thematic echo but is embedded in dialogue and action, not final-paragraph summary. The ending image—"rooted now in soil and mind"—offers a non-literal answer with resonance, though it leans slightly toward assertion rather than dramatized consequence. No false equivalence; the piece commits to stubborn renewal as a stance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited through Ariel; no head-hopping, and distance remains stable. Voice carries a distinct texture: "an informally wise sound, unadorned with doctrine yet dense with lived days." Ariel's perceptual signature—tasting air and memories—is consistent and character-specific. Dialogue between Ariel and Kai distinguishes their rhythms (her terse commands, his poetic hedging: "it felt rude to hurry"). Under peak pressure (swallowing the seed, clearing beds), diction compresses without losing coherence. One slip: "synaptic plasticity" in Ariel's interiority reads as a clinical intrusion that contradicts her lived-knowledge idiom, though the phrase is brief and does not obscure the beat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies; the opening ("rasped in the wind like an old lung") and final image are vivid and propulsive. Information density is high: most lines advance character, atmosphere, or plot. However, paraphrase loops appear in adjacent sentences: "We are not fighting the past, she said, we are disagreeing with its ending" is thematically rich but structurally repeats the same idea. "Dust motes turned like tiny planets" and "vines once arched like cathedral ribs" stack figurative language in descriptive beats without advancing pressure. The filter-verb "felt" appears in multiple high-pressure lines ("felt to Kai like a small betrayal," "felt more like laughter") where direct perception would sharpen immediacy. These artifacts cluster but do not obscure causality or closure; applying −0.6 for template cadence and filter stacks under the patterned-artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The chef-who-tastes-memories premise offers a fresh angle, and "gentle rebellion" through pruning and planting transforms the post-apocalyptic ruin trope. Specific details (knowledge fruit seed, veined with silver; alignment's three pale columns) anchor the fantastical in tactile particulars. However, the emotional arc and thematic resolution—stubborn refusal to accept decay—follow a familiar hope-from-ruin template without a non-obvious turn. The final image ("rooted now in soil and mind") is resonant but not surprising in hindsight. Risk-taking is present in the taste-perception idiom and the lack of overt antagonist, but the piece does not subvert or reweight its premise in a way that feels inevitable yet unanticipated.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Ariel's taste-perception is signaled early (tasting the air, tasting the seed's memories) and drives two key beats: lifting the seed to her tongue to access past knowledge, and choosing a future that "felt most like laughter" while planting. Her tasting ability constrains her method (must ingest the seed before it will grow externally) and charges the closure ("rooted now in soil and mind"). The trait is irreplaceable: removing it would collapse the story's logic. Cost is visible (the seed lodges behind her breastbone, warmth spreads through her limbs). Early setup +0.7, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.3, closure linkage +1.5, irreplaceability +0.7, cost +0.5 = strong high-7 range.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The knowledge fruit seed is introduced early (cracked planter, veined with silver), handled in three beats (brushing away soot, lifting to tongue, swallowing), and causally enables the planting sequence by granting Ariel access to past knowledge and guiding her hands. It participates in closure ("something new had already taken their place, rooted now in soil and mind"). Removing the seed would require a wholesale plot rewrite. Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.4, closure linkage +1.6, irreplaceability +0.8, cost tie +0.4 = solidly 8+.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Gentle rebellion" shapes Ariel's tactic: "refusing decay without imitating the harshness that caused it." It is voiced explicitly in dialogue ("we are disagreeing with its ending") and enacted through pruning and planting rather than fighting. However, the concept functions primarily as thematic overlay rather than generating a pivotal choice or cost. It does not narrow options at a key beat; Ariel's decisions flow from her desire to create and the seed's guidance, not from a trade-off between gentleness and force. Early thematic claim +0.4, one beat involvement +0.4, lyric reprise at closure +0.6, but swappable and ornamental −0.6, summary-use −0.4 = mid-6 band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Informally wise" is present in one vivid descriptor: "an informally wise sound, unadorned with doctrine yet dense with lived days." It colors Ariel's dialogue ("Hurry is the only courtesy we owe the dead") and guides her choice to taste rather than analyze the seed. However, the trait does not constrain a key action with visible cost; it enriches voice without generating a trade-off (e.g., wisdom enabling a gamble that caution would refuse). Late implicit setup −0.3, one beat +0.4, voice coloring +0.5, but ornamental and label-heavy −0.6, swappable −0.5 = mid-5 range.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Pruning appears explicitly in two beats: Ariel hands Kai shears and they clip dead stems, clearing beds to make space for new plantings. The action is causally necessary (without clearing, the new shoots cannot be planted) and thematically charged ("we cut away what cannot belong to the new world"). It participates indirectly in closure (the cleaned beds enable the final rooted image). However, pruning is functionally replaceable with any clearing action. Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, causal enabling +1.0, closure linkage (indirect) +0.8, but swappable −0.7 = low-7 band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Synaptic plasticity" appears once in Ariel's interiority ("tasting the new pathways forming in her mind through synaptic plasticity") after she swallows the seed. It names the mechanism but does not shape attempts or constrain choices; the warmth guiding her hands and the images flickering across her tongue do the causal work. The phrase is ornamental and clinically jarring within Ariel's voice. Late appearance (past midpoint) −0.4, one beat +0.4, ornamental −0.7, swappable (could be "magic," "connection," "bond") −0.6, summary-only −0.4 = mid-4 range.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The rusted greenhouse is introduced in the opening line and supplies resources and obstacles across the entire piece: cracked planters hide the seed, salt-crusted vines must be cleared, missing glass panes admit moonlight that times the planting, and the final glow through cracked panes charges closure. The setting is irreplaceable; the story's logic depends on this specific decayed-but-revivable space. Early signal +0.8, three beats (discovery, clearing, ending glow) +1.4, causal pressure +1.5, closure charge +1.7, irreplaceability +0.8 = strong 8+.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The celestial alignment is signaled early ("Tonight, under the once-in-a-lifetime celestial alignment") and provides a ticking window: "three moons and a bruised halo of comet light" appear when Kai arrives, their combined light pierces the roof at the planting, and the alignment fades at closure ("the last alignment beams faded"). It tightens the sequence (Ariel and Kai must work within this window) and charges the atmosphere. However, no beat shows the characters racing the clock or altering tactics because time is running out; the alignment functions more as scenic backdrop than live constraint. Early signal +0.7, setup and payoff (two-gate) +0.6, atmospheric charge +0.8, but weak middle development (no choice altered by the ticking clock) −0.5, ornamental use −0.6 = mid-6 range.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Ariel's desire "to create something beautiful from the ruins" is voiced in the seed's memory ("the low drone of bees, pulsed a desire to create something beautiful from the ruins of a world already fraying") and enacted through her choices: tasting the seed, clearing the beds, planting with whispered recipes. It drives her swallowing decision despite uncertainty and shapes the ending promise ("we will feed them stories first, then soup, then whatever grows from this"). The cost—risking her body by ingesting the seed—is visible. The motivation is slightly told rather than shown in contradictory impulses (desire vs. fear), but it coheres across beats. Early implicit +0.5, three beats +1.4, causal drive +1.3, closure linkage +1.4, cost tie +0.5, but some summary-use −0.4 = mid-7 range.</comment>
