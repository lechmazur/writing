<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Loretta's interiority is concrete and voice-particular, with clear motivation rooted in her moonshine-running past. Her micro-choices—"curiously steadfast calm," choosing which betrayal to ask, deciding to stay "until sunrise"—reveal hierarchy of values. The embodied emotion when she "staggered, clutching the fob as if it burned, yet the pain came clean" avoids label-speak and grounds the revelation in physical response. Minor deduction for the father remaining off-page; his presence would have sharpened the stakes, but the memory-work through the fob compensates adequately.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece gathers density through layered sensory detail, backstory fragments, and market atmosphere, culminating in a charged final image where Loretta's "unease settled beside her like company she had chosen." Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land by the second paragraph. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Loretta chooses to remain and listen, forgoing return and accepting estrangement as visible cost. One minor slip: the watch fob's mechanics ("thwarts the greedy through false starts") are told rather than dramatized, slightly weakening the causal texture of the middle.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The pirate market setting is vivid and purposeful: "lantern dim, stalls folded out of shadows," "teeth that remembered every bite," "planks went soft underfoot." The rotting pier functions as micro-setting that constrains movement and charges the atmosphere. Sensory detail is filtered through Loretta's POV—her moonshiner's eye for "where people hid what they were not ready to lose"—and the final image of "gentle rot" directly charges closure. The watch fob as recurring object reweights meaning from mysterious artifact to repository of painful truth.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—capturing the sound of trust breaking—is signaled early and drives the transaction and revelation. The escalation operates through Loretta's agency: she seeks out the woman, pays coin, asks the hard question, and chooses to stay. The tightening occurs when the fob delivers not words but "the tiny pause before his knuckles tapped the duffel, not the bedroom," a moment that narrows her understanding with visible emotional cost. Under the Accumulative lens, this single deepening suffices for the length, though a second reversal would have elevated the band further.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: jars as containers of both liquor and secrets, the physics of carrying versus hearing, trust as breakable substance. The watch fob's refusal to "keep time" or "keep you safe" reweights the premise without moralizing. Loretta's final choice—"collecting them like jars on a shelf, not to drink, only to know"—offers a non-literal answer to the central question of inherited silence. The "truce of hush" operates as both literal market rule and thematic container. No explicit thesis statement; subtext in gesture and image throughout.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice is distinctive and controlled: "rope pulling from water," "two sides of the same jar," "comforting unease" pervades without mechanical repetition. The psychic distance remains stable in close third, filtering market detail through Loretta's moonshiner's-daughter lens. Dialogue carries subtext and distinct idiom—the old woman's transactional terseness versus Loretta's clipped self-awareness. Minor deduction for one filter-verb cluster in the opening third ("had already mapped," "had spent," "had come") that slightly dulls immediacy, though voice remains coherent under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with strong imagery: "salt charms, teeth that remembered every bite," "tide slipped out from the pilings." Rhythm varies purposefully; no template cadence or paraphrase loops detected. Information density is high—most lines do multiple jobs. Two minor frictions: "the sagging boards and whispered barters were only another backwoods still to survey" leans slightly purple without adding clarity, and "as if already muffled by someone else's regret" tells what could be shown. These are hairline slips that do not touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of moonshiner's daughter lineage with the pirate market's "truce of hush" offers a fresh angle on inherited silence and the costs of knowing. The watch fob that plays back sound rather than keeping time is a non-obvious conceptual inversion. The piece commits fully to its sensory and atmospheric premise. Slight deduction for the pirate-market frame itself, which echoes familiar "hidden market" templates (though the execution is specific). The emotional particularity—trust breaking as a pause, not a shout—elevates beyond the template.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Loretta's identity as moonshine runner's daughter is signaled in paragraph three, shapes her perception throughout ("learning where people hid what they were not ready to lose"), and drives her choice to purchase the fob and ask the hard question. Her past carrying jars directly enables her capacity to "carry both" desire and fear. She makes two key decisions: buying the fob and staying until sunrise. Her occupational skill set (moving quiet, reading hidden things) constrains how she navigates the market. Cost is visible in her stagger and choice to remain estranged.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The watch fob appears in three beats: the transaction table, the whispered question, and the revelation/closure. Its specific mechanics—"does not keep time," "plays back what you wish you had not heard," "thwarts the greedy through false starts"—shape Loretta's approach and the story's central revelation. The fob's chain "worn thin" and smoked glass that "swallowed" light are handled physically. It delivers the pivotal sound (the pause) and is present in the final image as Loretta clutches it. Irreplaceable; no generic "magic item" would yield the same sensory and conceptual work.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Truce of hush" is named explicitly by the old woman and operates as both literal market rule and thematic frame. It shapes stakes by defining the space where "no promises spoken aloud can bleed much, but they still bruise." The concept enables the transaction and the watch fob's function. It recurs in the final image when "the truce of hush had extended itself to protect her." However, it does not directly constrain a tactical choice on the page—it functions more as atmospheric rule than active pressure. Solid lyric reprise, but agency link is thematic rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Curiously steadfast" appears in the second paragraph as Loretta's signature demeanor. It enables her to move through the market without panic and face the revelation without fleeing. The trait contrasts with the expected wariness of a moonshiner's daughter in a criminal market, adding texture. However, it does not create a visible tradeoff or constrain a choice with felt cost—it describes her capability rather than testing it. Present and character-consistent, but lacks dramatic friction.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Thwart" is told by the old woman ("it thwarts the greedy through false starts") as part of the fob's mechanics, but the actual thwarting is not dramatized on the page. Loretta whispers her father's name and asks her question; the fob "flickered once, then stayed dark" before delivering the answer. No false starts are shown, and the single flicker does not read as a credible test of Loretta's intent. The concept is present but not enacted, making it swappable with "the device will answer when you ask the right question" with minimal structural change.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The "false starts" method is mentioned once by the old woman as exposition but never demonstrated. Loretta asks her question and receives an answer after a brief flicker; no prior attempts or misdirections are shown. The method does not shape the middle beat or alter Loretta's tactics. Functional as world-building flavor but ornamental in execution—easily cut without affecting the story's arc.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The pirate market beneath the rotting pier is established in the opening line, detailed through "lantern dim, stalls folded out of shadows," and supplies the spatial logic for the transaction. The "planks went soft underfoot" at the pier's end signals risk and liminality. The market's "truce of hush" rule enables the watch fob's existence and function. The setting recurs in the final image as "gentle rot" that cradles Loretta's unease. It constrains movement and charges atmosphere but does not directly alter a tactical choice; its work is more contextual than causal.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Until sunrise" is declared twice—once in Loretta's demand ("I need it before sunrise") and again in the final paragraph ("She would stay here until sunrise"). It frames the duration and adds urgency to the transaction. However, the clock is not tracked on the page; no intermediate time markers tighten pressure or alter Loretta's choices. The timeframe functions as a boundary rather than an escalating constraint. Solid setup and closure mention, but middle development is absent.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The motivation to "capture the sound of trust breaking" is signaled in paragraph five, dramatized through the transaction and coin payment, and fulfilled in the revelation beat when Loretta hears "the tiny pause" before her father chose the duffel. The desire carries visible friction—Loretta acknowledges the cost ("you will hear them bruise") and chooses to pay it. Her choice to stay and collect more sounds extends the motivation into the closure image. The want is embodied in action (purchasing, asking, clutching the fob) and measured against fear, creating authentic tension.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Tone blends unease (rotting pier, pirate market, "menace," betrayal) with comfort (Loretta's steadfast calm, the "truce of hush," pain that comes "clean, like river water through a fresh cut"). The juxtaposition is coherent and purposeful, modulating through the transaction to the final image where "unease settled beside her like company she had chosen." The tone charges closure effectively. Minor deduction: the phrase "comforting unease" itself does not appear until the final line, and earlier tonal markers could be more densely woven to sustain the effect throughout.</comment>
