<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The narrator's internal arc from certainty to curiosity is signaled early and shapes the restoration choices, but the transformation feels abstract rather than viscerally embodied. The hobo nickel and the tramp's warning anchor motivation, yet the pivotal decision to "abandon the restoration plan" lacks a dramatized cost—no patron conflict, no professional consequence shown. The lapis woman's awakening and the narrator's reply ("I know less than I thought") land as conceptual rather than felt, missing contradictory impulses acting simultaneously under pressure. Interiority skews toward lyric meditation rather than character-particular struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes an Accumulative/Textural lens early (sound ribs, nested figures, methodical playful work) and holds it through to closure, where the final image reweights prior material: the narrator walks on "newly unsure, companioned by their endless, vivid echoes." Orientation anchors who/where/when clearly by line ~4. The closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (the narrator's stance crystallizes from certainty to curiosity with felt cost—abandoning the restoration plan), though the cost remains conceptual and occupational rather than immediately legible on the page. One meaningful deepening occurs when the mural speaks and the narrator replies, shifting from methodical work to wonder-driven improvisation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The sound wave garden is introduced early, its tuned cavities and stone ribs actively shaping the narrator's actions: the clap-and-listen test at midpoint directly alters perception and enables the mural's awakening. Spatial choreography remains clear (wall, arches, viaduct, path), and sensory detail is filtered through the restorer's professional lens (grime, pigment, plaster shiver). The hobo nickel and the garden's reflected murmur charge the final image, making the setting indispensable to closure. The garden's breathing and the echo-chord mechanics constrain the narrator's choices and enable the bewitching, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—exchanging certainty for curiosity—is signaled early and coheres under the Accumulative lens. One meaningful tightening occurs when the mural speaks and the narrator abandons the restoration plan, narrowing professional options. However, the escalation remains abstract: no patron pressure, no professional consequence, no visible price paid for the deviation. The narrator's reply and the coin-holding gesture advance the stance shift, but the turn feels thematic rather than materially costly. Coincidence does not resolve, and the garden's mechanics complicate appropriately, yet the lack of on-page friction or trade-off caps the score.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the nested awakenings image, the hobo nickel's "questions and no name," and the narrator's renunciation of certainty. The final image—"awakenings were not a ladder but a hall of mirrors"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in the tramp's warning, the mural's whispered question, and the warm coin. The piece avoids stating its thesis overtly, yet the thematic vocabulary ("certainty," "curiosity," "wonder") clusters densely in reflective passages, trending toward direct articulation. No single Thematic Echo penalty applies, but the abstraction weakens the particularity slightly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>First-person POV remains stable with a distinct perceptual signature: the restorer notices grime layers, pigment composition, sound mechanics, and nested figures through a professional-romantic lens. Diction is controlled and purposefully elevated ("ossified," "vivid," "bewitching"), fitting the narrator's voice. However, the prose occasionally drifts into expository interiority that paraphrases rather than advancing pressure ("All my neat opinions...stood up like soldiers, then sat down again"). Filter verbs ("I thought I finally understood," "I felt the garden begin to bewitch") appear in high-pressure beats, dulling immediacy slightly. No head-hopping or POV leakage; psychic distance is consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high, with lines often doing double duty (e.g., "Stone ribs arched over the path, tuned cavities that caught passing noise and gave it back"). However, paraphrase loops appear: "smaller thoughts woke, each containing an even smaller doubt" echoes the nested-figures motif without added pressure. Template cadence runs in the middle third ("The figure was...Within her pupils...The stone ribs caught...") with repeated subject-verb stems. Stock metaphor ("soldiers") and one instance of filter-verb stacking in a reflective beat ("I thought," "I felt") apply minor deductions. The final image is strong, but the prose artifacts in peak beats prevent higher scores.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of mural restoration, sound-wave mechanics, and nested awakenings is specific and non-obvious, transforming the "artist's journey" template through vivid particulars (hobo nickel, lapis woman, tuned cavities). The methodically playful approach and the tramp's warning feel earned rather than ornamental. However, the emotional arc—certainty to curiosity—follows a familiar artist-discovers-wonder path, and the lack of occupational friction (patron, deadline, professional cost) reduces risk. The piece commits fully to its lyric premise, yet the resolution into "endless, vivid echoes" trends abstract. Fresh inflection is present but not transformative.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The mural restorer frames expectation early (trade, patron, grid work) and makes two key choices: clapping to test the garden's acoustics (middle beat) and abandoning the restoration plan to "follow the hues where they wanted to go" (closure beat). Both decisions alter tactics and enable the bewitching. However, the abandonment lacks dramatized cost—no patron confrontation, no professional consequence shown—weakening causal pressure. The restorer's observation and reflection dominate over goal-driven action. Setup, development, and payoff gates are met; causal pressure is moderate; closure linkage is present but abstract.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The hobo nickel appears in three beats: initial mention with the tramp's warning (setup), held up to the reflected murmur mid-scene (development), and grows warm in the palm as the narrator understands awakenings at closure (payoff). The coin's carved traveler and "questions and no name" reweight the narrator's stance from certainty to curiosity. However, its function remains symbolic rather than tactically constraining—it does not enable or prevent an action with visible cost. Early signal, two-beat involvement, and closure linkage are present; causal pressure and specificity are moderate.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Nested awakenings are introduced early (figures within figures, woman within pupils, child reaching toward surface) and structure the narrator's arc: the realization that "awakenings were not a ladder but a hall of mirrors" directly shapes the final image and the decision to abandon linear restoration. The concept constrains tactics (following hues instead of grids) and charges the closure with the hall-of-mirrors insight. Setup, development, and payoff gates are met; causal pressure is strong; closure linkage is decisive. The concept is indispensable to the story's logic and final reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Methodically playful" is introduced early ("worked methodically playful, following strict grids while letting my wrist improvise along the cracks") and recurs at closure ("methodically playful still, but now answering to wonder"). The trait enables the narrator's hybrid approach and justifies the deviation from the restoration plan. However, the tension between method and play is told rather than dramatized in a choice with visible cost—no on-page moment where the grid fails or improvisation saves the work. Setup and payoff gates are met; middle development is weak; causal pressure is moderate; closure linkage is present but abstract.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Bewitch" is signaled mid-scene ("Through that reflected sound I felt the garden begin to bewitch the mural and, unavoidably, me") and drives the major turn: the mural wakes, speaks, and the narrator's certainty loosens. The bewitching enables the abandonment of the restoration plan and the final reweighting of awakenings. However, the mechanics remain abstract—"bewitching not my will but my arrangements of knowing"—without a dramatized choice or visible cost tied to the act itself. Setup (mid-scene), development (mural speaks), and payoff (ending references the garden's breathing) gates are met; causal pressure is strong; closure linkage is decisive.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Reflected sound is introduced early (stone ribs catch and return noise) and its mechanics matter across multiple beats: the narrator claps to test it, the echo becomes a "questioning chord," the mural's voice slips "between beats of my heart," and the hobo nickel is held up "so the reflected murmur...washed over it." The method enables the bewitching and the final transformation of traffic into "chords that rose and fell like breathing." Setup, development, and payoff gates are met; causal pressure is strong; the method is indispensable to the closure effect. The mechanics shape attempts and charge the final image.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The sound wave garden is introduced in the opening, its tuned cavities and stone ribs providing the mechanism for the bewitching. The garden constrains the narrator's tactics (clapping to test acoustics, holding the coin to the murmur) and supplies the resource (reflected sound) that enables the mural's awakening. The garden's breathing and echo-reshaping appear in the final image, making the setting indispensable. Setup, development, and payoff gates are met; causal pressure is decisive; closure linkage is strong. The garden is not swappable and its unique properties drive the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The timeframe "in the pause between question and reply" is introduced early ("In the pause between question and reply, between footstep and echo, the garden listened") and recurs at the major turn ("The question hung there, perfectly suspended in the pause...that seemed to stretch for miles") and in the final paragraph ("in the ever-renewing pause between question and reply, I walked on"). The pause shapes the narrator's reflective stance and charges the closure image. However, it does not tighten decisions or alter tactics with visible urgency—the clock remains atmospheric rather than pressing. Setup, development, and payoff gates are met; causal pressure is weak; closure linkage is strong but lyric rather than urgent.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The motivation to exchange certainty for curiosity is signaled early ("I wanted to exchange certainty for curiosity, beginning with my own. Certainty had ossified in me") and drives the narrator's reply to the mural's question and the decision to abandon the restoration plan. The desire is dramatized in the coin-holding gesture and the abandonment of grids. However, the friction between certainty and curiosity is told in reflective passages rather than shown through conflicting on-page actions with visible cost. Setup, development, and payoff gates are met; causal pressure is moderate; closure linkage is decisive but abstract.</comment>
