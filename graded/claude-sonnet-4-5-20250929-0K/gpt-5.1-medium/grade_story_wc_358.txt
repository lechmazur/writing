<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The investigator's interiority is concrete and professional, anchored in embodied habit (thumbing the patch, walking the routes). Internal contradiction emerges through the tension between protocol and experience, and micro-choices (clipping sensors, sketching arrows) reveal a hierarchy of values. The final stance—"enough to know that foresight could be trained"—reads as Earned Stasis with visible cost (the flight engineer's death, the frayed patch). One slip: the investigator's expertise is declared more than tested under genuine struggle; most moves feel competent without meaningful friction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening beat. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: density increases through the investigator's methodical survey, wind-pattern documentation, and the spiraling realization that "air in cities is as capricious as crowds." Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—"foresight could be trained, one meticulous breath at a time"—reweighting the premise with the cost of the flight engineer's death made undeniable by the frayed patch. One tightening deepens stakes: the model "refused to resolve" until the investigator walks the path and catalogs the invisible forces. The lens holds without contradiction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The container labyrinth constrains movement and perception throughout: "rows rising fifteen, twenty stories," "invisible vortices no blueprint could predict," and the investigator's paced survey that registers gusts tugging at clothing. The final image—"quiet after impact"—charges the setting with the grid's shutdown and the town's silence. Sensory hierarchy reflects professional priorities (vapor threads, trembling vane, drafts channeled by concrete). Spatial choreography is clean; the port's geometry drives the investigator's tactics. The setting is indispensable to the closure effect.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preventing future "singular convergence"—is signaled early and tightens as the investigator's model refuses to resolve, forcing the ground survey. One meaningful deepening: the realization that "air in cities is as capricious as crowds" narrows the problem from faulty logs to systemic oversight. Agency is enacted through renunciation (protocol versus experience) and endurance (the meticulous cataloging). Cost is felt: the flight engineer's death and the investigator's solitary vigil. Minor slip: the investigator's competence faces little friction; the path from mystery to insight feels more methodical than contested.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: the flight engineer's frayed patch, the "singular convergence," and the investigator's methodical breath-by-breath survey all cohere around the cost of ignoring invisible forces. The final image—"foresight could be trained, one meticulous breath at a time, in the quiet after impact"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in the patch (promotion replaced by memento), the silence (town shutdown), and the investigator's habit ("more habit than superstition"). One hairline slip: "all the almosts lining up" edges toward theme statement rather than pure dramatization.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature: the investigator notices wind, vapor threads, and container geometry with professional selectivity. Diction is controlled ("singular convergence," "capricious as crowds") and rhythm modulates—longer, meditative sentences in the opening, tighter fragments during the ground survey. The patch's tactile return ("pressed the cloth between my fingers now and felt each stitch") anchors reflection in the present. One slip: "An accident investigator learns to read silence the way a pilot reads instruments" edges toward expository self-awareness; the metaphor explains rather than enacts.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Information density is high; nearly every sentence advances the investigator's survey or deepens the causal mystery. Rhythm varies purposefully: the opening paragraph breathes with longer lines, while the container labyrinth tightens to shorter, clipped beats. Minor loop: "singular convergence" appears three times with minimal reweighting between uses. Stock metaphor: "frozen waves" and "invisible hand that had tipped fate" feel generic. Figurative density is high in the opening third but does not obscure clarity. Propulsion is steady; the closure lands cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The premise—accident investigation driven by invisible wind patterns—offers a fresh angle on procedural mystery. The flight engineer's patch and the "singular convergence" phrase particularize the investigator's stance. Emotional specificity (the frayed wings, the thumbing habit) avoids generic templates. Risk: the accumulative lens and the quiet, reflective closure commit to a non-dramatic arc. One friction: the container-port setting and drone crash feel adjacent to familiar disaster-procedural material; transformation arises more from voice and wind metaphor than from a non-obvious moral calculus.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Present throughout; the investigator's choices (walking the ascent path, clipping sensors, sketching arrows) drive the survey. Two beats: the decision to "start with the air itself" over data logs, and the ground-truth cataloging that reveals the wind's role. The final stance—foresight as trainable discipline—traces to these moves. One friction: observation dominates over contested decision; most choices feel methodical rather than dilemma-driven.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The patch appears in three beats: thumbed at the cargo gate, recalled mid-survey ("patch was all the promotion he ever got"), and pressed at the end. Early signal and closure reprise are strong. The object's cost—the flight engineer's death—charges the final image. One friction: the patch enables reflection more than it constrains a present choice; it anchors theme but does not alter tactics.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The concept shapes stakes and tactics: the investigator seeks to understand how "all vectors agreeing on catastrophe at once" occurred, and the ground survey reveals the wind's role in nudging the skiff "toward the only corridor the drone could not avoid." Present in three beats: the opening frame, the model's refusal to resolve, and the final image ("all the almosts lining up"). The concept is irreplaceable; removing it would break the investigator's mission and the closure's thematic charge.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The air is described as "rapidly adapting to tiny changes none of us had bothered to catalog," and the handheld vane "trembled between east and north, undecided." The trait constrains the investigator's model and enables the ground survey. One friction: the adaptation is more described than dramatized; the investigator observes it rather than contending with a live, shifting wind that alters a present choice.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The survey is signaled early ("began my survey at the cargo gate marked C-17") and drives all major beats: clipping sensors, walking the ascent path, cataloging wind patterns. The action is irreplaceable; the investigator's ground-truth methodology generates the insight that wind, not logs, caused the crash. The final recommendation (redesigning the yard, recalibrating routes) traces directly to the survey's findings.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The method is signaled early ("start with the air itself, documenting wind patterns between buildings") and shapes attempts: clipping sensors, sketching arrows, walking the corridor, noting direction and force every ten meters. The mechanics matter; the investigator's handwritten records reveal the rotor wash, lateral shear, and spiraling sink that the digital logs missed. The method is indispensable to the closure effect.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The setting pressures every choice: the container maze creates "invisible vortices no blueprint could predict," channels drafts, and forces the investigator's ground survey. The geometry drives the crash ("only corridor the drone could not avoid") and the investigator's tactics (walking the ascent path, counting paces). The final image—"quiet after impact"—charges the labyrinth with the town's shutdown. The setting is irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The timeframe is signaled in the opening ("By the time I reached the port, the town behind it had already gone silent") and frames the investigator's solitary vigil. The silence recurs in the container maze and the final image. One friction: the timeframe creates mood more than it tightens decisions; the investigator's survey is methodical rather than clock-pressured. The silence charges the closure but does not alter tactics mid-scene.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The motivation is stated early ("I was here to cultivate foresight in action, to see the next disaster before it assembled itself") and dramatized through the investigator's choices: rejecting protocol in favor of ground truth, cataloging wind patterns, and planning tomorrow's recommendations. The final image—"foresight could be trained, one meticulous breath at a time"—reweights the motive with the cost of the flight engineer's death. One friction: the motivation is more enacted than conflicted; the investigator faces little friction between competing wants.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The tone—"hazy precision"—is coherent throughout: exact numbers and technical detail ("fifteen, twenty stories," "thirty meters," "every ten meters") blend with uncertain, impressionistic language ("flickering," "uneasy tiers," "undecided," "hazy precision" itself). The tone modulates under pressure: longer, meditative lines in the opening tighten to clipped observation in the container maze. The final image—"one meticulous breath at a time"—charges the tone with the investigator's fragile discipline. The tone is indispensable to the closure effect.</comment>
