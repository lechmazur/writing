<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kael's internal contradiction—guarding written memory versus accepting the dream's deeper truth—is embodied in his physical handling of the seed and his restless climb. The micro-choices (asking for one night, placing the seed on stone, listening to the tree's whisper) reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. Interiority is largely abstract ("pride strain against fear," "luminous doubt pool in his chest") but remains character-particular and tied to his role. The final stance crystallization (to accept or deny) is earned by the dream sequence, though the cost is conceptual rather than viscerally felt on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (Kael, ridge, lagoon village, pre-monsoon) land within the opening block. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: pressure accretes through layered omens (children's dialects, spiral maps, goats staring seaward) and deepens in the dream sequence, where the tree's revelation reweights the premise. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—Kael's realization that "to accept it would stretch their collective memory across an ocean and admit they had once been lost"—with conceptual cost legible in the final image. The dream beats feel slightly padded with lyric repetition, and the final decision is poised rather than executed, but the reconfiguration of the island's origin story lands with undeniable pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The ridge, monsoon sky, and knowledge-fruit seed constrain Kael's tactics: he must finish rounds before the storm, the seed anchors his doubt, and the ridge becomes the site of the dream trial. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("uncertain silver," "purple long before the sea was ready," "flowers...closed as if unwilling to overhear"), filtered through Kael's role. The seed's physical presence (wrapped in seagrass, felt against palm, set on flat stone) charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clear across the village, ridge, and dream-tree sequence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether to honor written records or accept the dream's older origin—is signaled early and tightens when the council asks Kael to decide. Pressure accumulates through escalating omens (children, shells, goats) and peaks in the dream confrontation with the tree. Agency is present: Kael asks for the night, climbs, places the seed, and listens; the dream reweights his options with conceptual cost. The piece lacks a decisive on-page action at closure (Kael stands beneath branches, feeling doubt), relying instead on Charged Poise, which fits the Accumulative lens but mutes the felt price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme—whether memory begins with arrival or reaches farther—emerges organically from the seed's inert state, the dream's specificity ("chipped oars," "songs about a western star"), and Kael's rule that repeated dreams may be "reality asking to be included." The final image (standing beneath towering branches, luminous doubt pooling) offers a resonant, non-literal answer: to deny keeps the island "small and sure," to accept stretches memory "across an ocean." No moralizing; the tree's whisper avoids thesis statements. One minor slip: "protect cultural memory from dissolving into mere legend" reads slightly prompt-adjacent in the opening exposition, but the theme deepens through particulars thereafter.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited holds stable; POV distance is consistent. Perceptual signature is present: Kael notices seagrass wrapping, the seed's hard oval, flowers closing, lantern-washed wrinkles as "riverbeds cut by luminous doubt." The recurring phrase "luminous doubt" and similar poetic constructions ("empirically whimsical," "honest yet unfinished light") risk becoming tics rather than voice-specific rhythm. No dialogue to judge. Purposeful lyric compression ("the sea stood still like glass awaiting a question") is taught early and supports the Accumulative lens, but the elevated diction occasionally drifts from urgent interiority into ornamental register during peak beats ("pride strain against fear" reads slightly label-like).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; opening sentence stems avoid uniformity. Information density is high in the dream sequence. However, paraphrase loops appear: "ancient ridge in bloom" recurs four times; "luminous doubt" appears three times in similar constructions without meaningfully reweighting. The phrase "before monsoon arrives" and variants repeat across four beats. Stock metaphor: "wrinkles look like riverbeds" is functional but familiar. Template cadence in the council scene: "The island is reaching backward...It dreams of a story...You must decide" reads like stacked declaratives. Minor filter-verb stack ("felt honest yet unfinished," "felt pride strain," "feeling luminous doubt") dulls immediacy in high-pressure moments. Artifacts do not obscure causality but blunt momentum; baseline −0.6 in Q7, escalated to −0.9 for touching the closure beat ("feeling luminous doubt pool").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The premise—reality-checking through interpreted dreams, a seed that never sprouted holding first memory—offers a fresh synthesis of oral-history stewardship and speculative folklore. The turn (memory predates the island itself) is non-obvious and earned by the dream's accumulating specifics. However, the core frame (guardian of collective memory faces paradigm-shifting revelation) echoes widely used templates; transformation through "empirically whimsical" rituals and the seed's tactile presence elevates but does not fully escape the archetypal mold. The dream-tree sequence avoids cliché through particulars (chipped oars, western star, taste of grief like metal), and the closure's conceptual calculus (small certainty versus expansive loss) feels specific to this island's logic.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kael's occupation frames the premise and his duty shapes all beats: he climbs the ridge, carries the seed, asks the council for time, places the seed on stone, enters the dream, and weighs the tree's revelation. His final choice (to accept or deny the dream) is poised but not executed on the page, which limits causal drive. Present in setup, middle (council confrontation), and ending (dream/stance crystallization). The role constrains tactics (he must use interpreted dreams, carry the seed) and enables the closure reconfiguration. Swappability: a different title (memory-keeper, archivist) would require only minor edits. Cost is conceptual (risk of unsettling the island) rather than personal with visible price.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The seed appears in setup (wrapped in seagrass, shoulder satchel), middle (Kael touches it, feels the hard oval against palm), and ending (set on flat stone, tree towers from it, "its seed had been carried from another shore"). Used in three distinct beats with evolving meaning: inert heirloom → tactile anchor of doubt → dream's root revelation. The seed's failure to sprout becomes thematic ammunition ("how could he know whether its version...was even alive?") and charges the closure reconfiguration. Specific properties (never sprouted, holds first memory, from another shore) are irreplaceable. Visible cost is indirect (doubt rather than loss), and the seed does not alter tactics mid-scene, which prevents entry to the highest band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Collective memory drives the dominant stake from the opening ("to protect cultural memory from dissolving") through the council's warning ("The island is reaching backward") to the closure calculus ("to accept it would stretch their collective memory across an ocean"). The concept constrains on-page action: Kael's duty, the council's summons, his need to "waken the dream when it wandered too far." It shapes tactics (interpreted dreams, public rituals, the seed as first-memory vessel) and reconfigures options at the end (small certainty versus expansive admission of being "once lost"). The specifics (reefs forget where to grow, turtles where to crawl, lovers whom to wait for) make the abstract concrete. Present in all three gates with causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Empirically whimsical" is defined early ("disciplined as tidal charts yet guided by omens, coincidences, and stubborn intuitions") and surfaces in the rituals ("interpreted dreams, public rituals where a thousand eyes weighed each image"). It flavors the method but does not constrain a specific on-page choice with visible cost. The trait is more thematic texture than tactical lever: Kael's decision process in the dream does not hinge on balancing empiricism against whimsy; he listens and weighs. Present in setup and implicit in method, absent from a middle choice that depends on the attribute's tradeoff. Swappable with "intuitive" or "interpretive" without major edits.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Waken" appears in Kael's mandate ("to waken the dream when it wandered too far") and is implicit in his climb to the ridge and the dream trial. The action frames his role but is not dramatized as a discrete turning point with visible cost. The dream sequence is passive reception (Kael falls sideways, listens to the tree) rather than active wakening. The verb reappears metaphorically in the closure stance (waken the dream = accept or deny its claim) but does not drive a major reversal on the page. Present in setup and thematic at closure, but the mechanics are summary-only ("tugging it back toward what might once have been true"). Swappable with "guide," "anchor," or "test."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Interpreted dreams are signaled early ("They tested reality...through interpreted dreams, public rituals") and enacted in the dream sequence where Kael "fell...into the island's dreaming" and the tree's vision provides the key revelation. The method's mechanics are shown: Kael asks for a night to listen, places the seed, lets sleep take him, and the dream delivers specifics that Kael must weigh ("when a dream repeats across unrelated minds, it may be reality asking to be included"). The method enables the closure reconfiguration and constrains his options (he cannot use instruments, only ritual and collective interpretation). Present in setup, middle (implicit in the council's reliance on his role), and ending (dream trial). The method does not face an on-page obstacle or cost that tests its limits, which caps the score.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The ridge appears in setup ("climbed the ancient ridge in bloom that overlooked the lagoon"), middle (Kael asks to return there), and ending (he climbs again, places the seed on a flat stone, flowers close as he passes, the dream-tree towers from ridge to clouds). The setting supplies the vantage for Kael's ritual and becomes the dream's physical anchor. The "bloom" detail recurs but does not alter tactics; the flowers closing is atmospheric rather than a constraint. Spatial role is functional (the high place where truth is tested) but swappable with another sacred site. The ridge does not pressure a choice or supply a micro-resource that changes the outcome, though it charges the final image by hosting the dream-tree.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The monsoon timeframe is signaled early ("finish his rounds before monsoon arrives," "sky still held its uncertain silver") and recurs at the council meeting and Kael's second climb ("before monsoon arrives in earnest," "clouds tested how much weight the sky could bear"). It creates urgency in setup and flavors atmosphere, but the time pressure does not tighten a specific on-page decision or alter tactics. Kael asks for "one night" and receives it without friction; the monsoon's early arrival is treated as omen rather than clock. The timeframe participates thematically (change is imminent) but does not force a mid-scene tradeoff or accelerate the closure. Present in setup and ending, absent from middle constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Kael's motivation—to protect cultural memory—is stated early, dramatized in his duty rounds, tested at the council ("You must decide whether to let the dream rewrite us"), and conflicted in the dream sequence ("to protect...had always meant guarding what was already written, not adding what might unsettle it"). The friction between preserving written records and honoring the dream's older truth drives the closure stance. The motivation shapes on-page choices (asking for time, placing the seed, listening to the tree) and forecloses a path (denial would keep the island small, acceptance admits they were once lost). Cost is conceptual and poised rather than paid. Present in all three gates with clear conflict and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Luminous doubt" is named early ("a kind of luminous doubt spread across the sea"), recurs in the council scene ("wrinkles look like riverbeds cut by luminous doubt"), and charges the closure image ("feeling luminous doubt pool in his chest, bright and heavy as rain before it falls"). The tone is coherent across setup, intensification (the dream's plain details "too plain for myth" versus "accuracy that frightened him"), and ending, where doubt becomes the dominant emotional texture. The tone modulates under pressure (pride strains against fear, luminous doubt pools) and charges the final reconfiguration. Minor overuse (three near-identical constructions) risks flattening the effect, but the tone remains integral to voice and theme.</comment>
