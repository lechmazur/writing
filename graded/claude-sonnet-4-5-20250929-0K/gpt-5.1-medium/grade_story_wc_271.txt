<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mariam's interiority is concrete and embodied—her trembling hands, muscle-locking freeze responses, and the dense pearl metaphor anchor her trauma without therapy-speak labels. The progression from henna artist to survivor to someone attempting "a pearl of stillness" shows contradictory impulses (reaching for something gone, believing beauty could shield, then renaming resilience). Minor issue: the therapist's voice ("somatic markers") edges toward diagnostic language, though it's framed as his terminology rather than her own thought process. The final choice to fold the photograph into the notebook and walk the clear path earns the stance shift with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Mariam's refusal to discard the photograph paired with her ability to walk the path despite the absent lighthouse beam constitutes a Resonant Reconfiguration—she has foreclosed magical thinking ("belief died") but anchored a sustainable stillness. The lens reads Accumulative/Textural: density builds through layered images (fig veins/henna patterns, lighthouse/body reaching, pearl/stillness) and the cadence shift in the final paragraph reweights the dominant stake (surviving trauma while imagining tomorrow) with visible cost (permanent shoulder seizing, stitched sleep). Orientation is clear by the opening paragraph. One tightening occurs when she lists truths that "sit side by side like rocks in the tide"—this deepens her stance from passive endurance to active catalog.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The arboretum's glass roof condensation ping, the black rocks below, the numbered wristband, and the drone-forbidden airspace all constrain Mariam's choice of refuge and charge the final image. The absent lighthouse beam—plants leaning toward empty air—directly mirrors her body reaching for what's gone, and this motif returns at closure when "the absent lighthouse cast no beam, yet the path back...was clear." The fig leaf veins traced like henna hands and the sea lavender in concrete cracks provide micro-setting that tilts her stance. Spatial choreography (bench, docents in orchids, tram path) remains coherent throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—surviving trauma enough to imagine a future grounded in reality—is signaled early and tightens through her writing exercise: listing what she knows instead of what she wishes. The escalation is Accumulative: each truth (drones mistake weddings, her shoulder will seize, and also sea lavender grows) deepens the cost of her stance without requiring a causal reversal. Agency appears as endurance and attention: she traces the fig leaf, folds the photograph smaller, slips it into the notebook between pages "where ink had begun, timidly, to imagine tomorrow." The gull-dive freeze demonstrates ongoing physiological cost. One friction: the therapist's framing ("somatic markers," "resilience") risks feeling assigned rather than discovered, though she actively renames it "a pearl of stillness."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The theme—how to anchor hope in devastation without denial—emerges through concrete particulars: the wedding photo folded smaller, truths that don't cancel each other sitting "side by side like rocks in the tide," the plants leaning toward absent light. The pearl-of-stillness metaphor is earned by the surf, fog, and grinding-teeth waves rather than stated as prompt language. Mariam's refusal to throw away the photograph while also writing new lines in her notebook offers a resonant, non-literal answer: survival is neither erasure nor paralysis. The final image (absent lighthouse, clear path, unbroken pearl) reweights prior material without moralizing. No thematic echo in the final paragraph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited anchors cleanly to Mariam's perceptual signature: she notices fig veins like henna lines, reads the docent's dripping can, hears the ocean as grinding teeth. Psychic distance modulates purposefully—close during the gull-freeze, slightly wider when contextualizing the wedding attack. The therapist's diagnostic terms ("somatic markers") are attributed to him, maintaining voice discipline. Diction stays within Mariam's educated, image-driven lexicon; the "pearl of stillness" phrase reads as her deliberate coinage rather than authorial intrusion. One minor slip: "the shriek, the white light opening like a second sun" edges toward slightly elevated lyricism during the flashback summary, though it coheres with her artist's eye.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythms vary purposefully (short declaratives during the freeze response, longer accretions when cataloging truths), and information density is high—most lines do double work. The fig/henna parallel, lighthouse/body-reaching motif, and pearl image recur with reweighted meaning rather than mere repetition. Two frictions: "listening to the glass roof ping as the fog condensed" and "the ocean kept its own counsel" verge on minor overwriting, and the phrase "a thin armor against chaos" feels slightly elevated for the moment. The closing paragraph maintains propulsion without scaffolding. No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The arboretum-as-refuge angle (drone-forbidden airspace, numbered wristband, plants leaning toward absent light) offers a fresh synthesis of PTSD recovery and charged space. The "pearl of stillness" metaphor—sanded by tide, distinct from hope or denial—transforms the resilience trope through specific embodiment. The structural choice to interleave present refuge with wedding-attack memory feels organic rather than checked-off. One limitation: the therapist-assigned terminology and the trauma-survivor-finds-healing-place frame remain somewhat familiar despite the vivid particulars. The ending avoids tidy resolution, letting contradictory truths coexist, which elevates the emotional honesty.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mariam (drone strike wedding survivor) drives all choices: selecting the arboretum for its drone-free status, cataloging truths instead of wishes, folding the photograph into the notebook, and walking the path despite the absent beam. Setup early, development in the writing exercise, payoff in the closure image. Her survivor status constrains refuge choice and charges every sensory detail (gull-dive freeze, wristband, the attack memory). Strong causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The crumpled photograph appears in three beats: introduced on the bench (mid-laugh bride under jasmine), contemplated with the attack memory, and folded smaller before being slipped into the notebook. Setup and payoff present; middle beat is reflective rather than a distinct action choice. The folding gesture at closure reweights it (blur of color no wider than fingernail) and the notebook placement demonstrates her stance shift. Swappability moderate—another keepsake could serve, though the photo's specificity (wedding, laughter, crowd blur) ties tightly to her henna-artist identity.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"A pearl of stillness" is named explicitly and defined: "not hope exactly, and not denial, but a dense, quiet center where she could stand and not be blown away." It shapes her approach (anchor optimism in realism, list truths) and the final image ("the small pearl of stillness did not break"). Setup in the therapist's "resilience" reframing, development in her active renaming, payoff at closure. The metaphor's specificity (sanded by tide and grit) ties to the seaside setting. One friction: it reads slightly more as thematic lens than a tactical constraint that alters a key choice mid-scene.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Quietly talented" (henna artist skill) is established early and her trembling hands demonstrate the cost of trauma. The skill informs her tracing of fig veins "the way she used to trace the hands of brides, mapping futures." Setup and callback present; middle beat is reflective comparison rather than a choice where the talent enables or constrains. The belief that "beauty made of ink and intention formed a thin armor" ties to theme, but no on-page moment requires her to attempt henna or refuse it. Functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The freeze action (gull dive, muscles locking, heart racing) appears twice: once described as a pattern ("Sometimes a gull would dive") and again implied in her body's somatic markers. It demonstrates ongoing trauma cost and motivates her choice of drone-free refuge. Setup in the somatic-markers explanation, payoff in the freeze example. The action is specific (freeze vs. flee/fight) and irreplaceable for showing PTSD physiology, though it shapes context more than driving a turn. Strong thematic weight but mid-range causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Through somatic markers" is explicitly named by the therapist ("Each tightening muscle, each cold ripple...a signal more honest than any story she could tell") and demonstrated in her freeze response, shoulder ache, and her attempt to "learn a different language from her own nerves." Setup clear, development in her listening practice, modest payoff when she writes what she knows. The method informs her approach but doesn't shape a specific tactic in a key choice—she catalogs truths conceptually rather than reading her body's signals to decide something in scene. Lyric reprise without strong causal work.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The arboretum setting (seaside cliff, glass corridors, drone-forbidden airspace, numbered wristband requirement, abandoned after lighthouse keeper left) directly constrains her refuge choice and supplies the resources (fig tree, quiet, safety) that enable her writing exercise. The absent lighthouse beam charges the final image ("the path back...was clear enough") and the plants leaning toward empty air mirror her body reaching for what's gone. Setup immediate, development through docent/orchid detail and spatial anchors, strong payoff. Environment presses choices and meaning.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"After the last lighthouse keeper left" establishes abandonment and the timeframe, and "the arboretum...had been quiet for years" provides context. The locals' observation that plants "leaned toward the empty air out of habit" ties to Mariam's present experience. Setup present in the opening lines, payoff in the closure image when the absent beam frames her clear path. However, the timeframe doesn't tighten her choices—no urgency or constraint on how long she can stay or when the tram leaves. Functional backdrop rather than pressure device.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"To anchor optimism in realism" is explicitly stated mid-story ("she wanted to anchor optimism in realism, to imagine a future without lying about the wreckage") and dramatized in her writing exercise: listing truths (drones exist, her shoulder will seize) alongside observations (sea lavender grows, children press noses to glass). Setup in her therapist's assignment, development in the catalog, payoff when she slips the photo into pages "where ink had begun, timidly, to imagine tomorrow." The motivation generates visible friction (wish vs. knowledge) and the final action embodies the synthesis. Strong thematic and causal work.</comment>
