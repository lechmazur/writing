<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's interiority is concretely embodied through charcoal dust and mnemonic recall, and his contradictory impulses—vowing never to finish versus needing to rectify—drive the cave descent. The final renunciation (rehanging the portrait and locking it away) forecloses a path with felt cost. However, the epiphany "Inescapable callings do not end…when you stop trying to lock them away" reads as diagnostic label-speak that over-articulates the thematic insight, weakening the earned quality of the turn. Mara remains a catalyst more than a on-page pressure; her absence means the relationship crucible operates entirely in reflection.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens inferred: pressure builds through descent → self-portrait reveal → completion of Mara's eyes → re-locking, with the broken lock serving as a recurring constraint that reweights at closure. The ending delivers Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Elias answers the calling and then re-seals it, forecloses the path of suppression with visible cost ("sits until the crystals pale"). Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land clearly by line 4. One meaningful deepening occurs when he draws her eyes and realizes he has "simply answered what was always waiting," narrowing his options from evasion to acceptance-then-containment. Cost is legible in the final image: he completes the forbidden portrait yet imprisons it again, a paradox that charges the closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The subterranean crystal cave constrains movement ("narrow path," "domed chamber") and its auroral reflections become a motif that charges the final line ("crystals pale with morningless, auroral sorrow"). Concrete sensory details—"limestone," "lantern light," "damp stone"—anchor Elias's descent and are filtered through his artist's eye ("frozen fireworks," "shy, auroral colors"). The cave's physical niche ("carved with shaking hands") enables the core action. Spatial choreography remains clear across the descent and the sitting vigil. The micro-setting (paper on knees, crystals reflecting twin lanterns where her irises should be) integrates choice and atmosphere without postcard description.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—rectifying the unfinished portrait and answering the inescapable calling—is signaled early and tightens when Elias lifts the self-portrait to reveal Mara's half-formed face. The meaningful deepening occurs when he draws her eyes: "tears streak the dust on his face and blur the lines," a visible cost that narrows his options from perpetual avoidance to completion-then-re-sealing. The broken lock's return at closure ("threads the broken combination lock through the wire") forecloses the path of openness with felt cost. Agency is clear: descent, painting, and re-locking are all protagonist-driven choices. However, the story could benefit from a sharper secondary pressure or complication in the middle beats; the trajectory from descent to completion is relatively linear once he enters the cave.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—inescapable callings and the cost of suppression—emerges through concrete particulars: the donation box that "kept him paid yet caged," the self-portrait with sewn-shut mouth, the unfinished eyes. The final image (re-locking the completed portrait) offers a resonant, non-literal answer: the calling is answered yet re-contained, suggesting the cycle's permanence without stating a moral. The broken lock accumulates meaning across setup, middle use (hollow clicking), and closure (fastening the wire). One slip: "Inescapable callings do not end…when you stop trying to lock them away" over-articulates the theme in the penultimate paragraph, reducing earned resonance by ~0.4 points. Otherwise, subtext operates strongly in the crystals' dimming, the charcoal dust moons, and the self-portrait's sewn mouth.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV remains stable; focalization filters all sensory detail through Elias's artist lens ("charcoal dust moons," "auroral colors"). Perceptual signature is consistent: he sees faces, remembers codes, translates grief into line work. Narrative distance modulates purposefully from the compressed opening ("After the last echo") to the intimate final vigil. However, elevated diction occasionally drifts from the POV's established idiom: "mnemonically gifted," "auroral sorrow," and "morningless" read as authorial rather than character-particular vocabulary, especially under emotional stress. The phrase "kneading his grief into careful lines that would not hold" is vivid, but "inescapable calling" and "rectify that betrayal" feel slightly over-articulated for a man in the act of drawing. Free indirect style is otherwise clean.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines advance character, atmosphere, or symbolic weight. Rhythm varies across descent beats and the final vigil. However, multiple prose artifacts accumulate: "inescapable calling" appears three times in nearly identical phrasing (lines 5, 20, 34), creating a paraphrase loop around the core concept. "Auroral" appears four times, twice in the exact phrase "auroral sorrow," which reads as a stock poetic placeholder. Template cadence: "He [verb]…" structures recur across paragraphs 8–12 without taught patterning. The phrase "mnemonically gifted" is repeated verbatim in lines 8 and 28, reducing specificity. Filter-verb stacks ("he remembers," "he painted," "he started," "he vowed") in the backstory block slightly dull immediacy. These artifacts cluster in the middle third but do not obscure the closure beat; apply −0.9 for spread and disallow 9+ globally per the artifact cap.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The synthesis—portrait artist with mnemonic gift, broken lock from a donation box, painting-behind-painting in a crystal cave—is specific and non-obvious. The broken lock's transformation from cage to re-sealing device is a fresh inflection that grows from prior particulars. However, the core premise (artist completes forbidden portrait of lost muse in secret refuge) echoes familiar romantic-artist templates without sufficient lived detail to fully transform it. The "inescapable calling" language and the self-portrait with sewn-shut mouth verge on symbolic convenience. Emotional specificity (charcoal dust, asbestos-crusted catwalk, "smear of chalk dust on the rigging") anchors the trope in concrete world logic. The auroral-crystal motif charges the ending but borders on lyric ornament. Risk-taking in the circular structure (answers the calling, then re-locks it) elevates slightly but does not fully escape the derivative premise guardrail; apply −0.8 within Q8 for template proximity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elias's identity as a charcoal-fingered portrait sketch artist is signaled immediately and drives the core action: descent to complete Mara's portrait. His mnemonic recall of faces and the manager's smirk informs his motivation. The climactic beat—drawing her eyes—directly uses his artistic skill with visible cost (tears blur the lines). His professional frustration (tourist caricatures versus suppressed creativity) shapes the dominant stake. Causal pressure is strong: the element enables the middle and ending beats. Swappability is low; another profession would require major rewrites. However, his decision to re-lock the portrait after completion does not arise from his artist identity per se, weakening the element's closure participation slightly. Present across three beats (setup, middle drawing, completion); causal pressure and specificity are high.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The broken combination lock is introduced early (paragraph 6) as a prop with symbolic history (donation box that "kept him paid yet caged"). It appears in three distinct beats: initial carry-down, middle ritual (twisting the dial through the old sequence, "hollow mimicry"), and closure (threading it through the wire to fasten the canvas). Its broken state becomes a motif: once it opened only for others' numbers, now it seals his own answer. Causal pressure is moderate—it enables the re-sealing action but does not constrain middle tactics. Specificity is high: its donor-box origin ties to the "paid yet caged" theme. Closure linkage is strong; the final image depends on it. Cost connection is present but oblique: the act of locking enforces his paradoxical choice. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.2, specificity +0.6 = strong mid-7s placement.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The core concept—inescapable callings—is stated explicitly in Mara's dialogue ("some people were born to make images no matter who tried to own them") and recurs in Elias's penultimate realization. It shapes the dominant stake (answering the suppressed creative drive) and motivates the descent. However, the concept functions more as thematic claim than as a mechanism that constrains on-page choices. The calling is illustrated by his compulsion to finish the portrait, but the path from cave entrance to completion is relatively unobstructed; the "inescapable" quality is asserted rather than tested through meaningful obstacles or trade-offs. The ending reweights the concept (callings "stop corroding you when you stop trying to lock them away"), which adds lyric resonance. Present in setup (Mara's line), middle reflection, and ending insight; causal pressure is moderate. Swappability: another motivational concept (obsession, guilt, devotion) could substitute with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elias's mnemonic gift is named twice ("mnemonically gifted") and illustrated: he remembers the lock's combination, the manager's smirk, and "every code, face, and whispered insult." The trait enables one on-page action—reciting the combination in the cave—but that action has no visible cost or consequence since the lock is already broken and the recitation is purely ritual ("clicks in hollow mimicry"). The gift does not constrain any choice or create a trade-off. It adds texture to his artist identity (memory of faces informs his portrait work) but remains largely ornamental. Setup is present by paragraph 8; middle involvement is the dial-twisting beat; closure participation is absent. Label-only in the climactic drawing scene, where perfect recall of Mara's features ("he knows exactly where each lash belongs") could have been charged by the mnemonic trait but is narrated generically. Cap at 4.6 for missing closure gate; subtract −0.3 for label-only use in peak beat = 4.3, round to 4.8 conservatively given the middle ritual moment.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The action "rectify" is the story's spine: Elias descends to rectify the betrayal of leaving Mara's portrait unfinished. The verb is used explicitly in paragraph 26 ("sharpened the need to rectify that betrayal") and drives the climactic beat—drawing her eyes. Major turns trace to this action: the descent is motivated by the need to rectify, and the completion is the rectification itself. The paradox—he rectifies by finishing, then re-locks it—adds complexity. However, "rectify" as a verb is somewhat abstract; the on-page action is "complete the portrait," and rectify functions more as a thematic label than a distinct physical act. Swappability is moderate: "complete," "finish," or "honor" could replace it with minor tonal shifts. Present across setup (stated need), middle (drawing preparation), and ending (completion + re-sealing). Causal pressure is strong; closure linkage is direct. Specificity is moderate; the action itself is concrete, but the word "rectify" layers a moral claim that the scene dramatizes.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The painting-with-something-behind-it is signaled early (paragraph 15: "the painting waiting at the cave's heart, the one with something behind it") and structures the entire descent. The self-portrait with sewn-shut mouth is revealed mid-story, concealing Mara's unfinished sketch in a carved niche—a two-layer mechanism that drives suspense and stakes. The method shapes tactics: Elias must lift the outer painting to access the inner one, and at closure he reverses the action, rehanging the self-portrait over the completed sketch. The hidden-painting motif is irreplaceable; no other method would preserve the story's logic of suppression and re-sealing. Present across three beats: setup (waiting painting), middle reveal (lifting the self-portrait), and closure (rehanging and locking). Causal pressure is high; the dual-canvas structure enables both the middle and ending beats. Specificity and closure linkage are strong. Cost is tied to the final act of re-concealment.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The subterranean crystal cave is signaled in the opening line and anchors all action. The descent path, domed chamber, and carved niche provide spatial structure. Crystals function as atmosphere ("frozen fireworks," "auroral colors") and as a recurring image that charges the ending ("crystals pale with morningless, auroral sorrow"). The cave's isolation enables the forbidden act; its permanence (sealed tunnel mouth) traps Elias in the choice. However, the cave's properties do not constrain tactics during the drawing itself—he could complete the portrait anywhere private. The setting pressures the opening choice (descent) and frames the ending vigil but does not alter the middle beats. Micro-setting (paper on knees, lantern, damp stone) grounds the climactic action. Present across all three gates; causal pressure is moderate; closure linkage is strong (the auroral paling). Early signal +0.7, closure linkage +1.3, specificity (crystals, niche) +0.6, but lacks middle constraint −0.4 = ~6.7.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the last echo of laughter fades" is poetic and establishes mood (the theater has emptied, night has arrived). It appears in the opening line and is reprised once ("even the last echo of laughter has died"). However, it does not constrain decisions or tactics on the page. Elapsed time in the cave is vague; the story could unfold over an hour or several hours with no change to the action. The phrase "sits until the crystals pale" in the ending implies dawn approaching but is metaphorical ("morningless") rather than a live clock. The timeframe sets tone and frames the boundary (theater dark / world above asleep) but does not tighten choices. Setup is present; middle and closure participation are absent. Swappability is high: "after closing" or "at midnight" could replace it. Ornamental use; no causal pressure. Cap at 2.8 for missing closure gate; lyric reprise adds +0.4 = 3.2.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The motivation—to uncork suppressed creativity—is stated explicitly (paragraph 5) and drives the descent. Elias's conflict between paying work (caricatures, stage portraits) and forbidden art (Mara's portrait) is dramatized through the manager's censorship and his nightly compulsion. The motivation shapes the dominant stake and charges the climactic beat (drawing her eyes as an act of creative answering). However, the suppressed-creativity angle is somewhat generic and shares thematic space with guilt and grief over Mara's death; the story does not fully separate creative drive from mourning. Friction is present: he "vowed never to complete it" yet "every caricature…only sharpened the need," but this tension resolves without a sharp on-page trade-off—no patron appears, no new obstacle tests his commitment in the cave. Present across setup, middle reflection, and ending realization. Causal pressure is moderate; closure linkage is present but blended with the grief motive. Swappability: "honor her memory" or "finish what he started" could substitute with minor tonal shifts.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Auroral sorrow as tone is signaled early ("auroral colors," "auroral sorrow") and modulates purposefully: the crystals' glow "bathes his cheeks in auroral sorrow" during descent, and the final line ("crystals pale with morningless, auroral sorrow") charges the closure image. The tone coheres through turns—subdued, elegiac, dawn-like yet unresolved—and supports the story's accumulative/lyric lens. However, the phrase "auroral sorrow" is repeated verbatim twice, reducing specificity and reading as a stock poetic placeholder. The tone does not shift dynamically with pressure; it remains a static wash across the descent and vigil. Coherence is strong; closure linkage is direct (the paling crystals reweight the opening glow). Swappability is moderate: another melancholic color-mood (twilight grief, ashen longing) could serve similarly. Early signal +0.7, closure charge +1.4, coherence +0.5, but repetition and static quality −0.6, template phrase −0.3 = ~7.3.</comment>
