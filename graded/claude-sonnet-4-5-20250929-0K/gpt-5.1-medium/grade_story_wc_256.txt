<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elya's interiority is concrete and character-specific, with embodied doubt ("loosened something in her chest") driving micro-choices. Her shift from leader to co-pilgrim emerges through on-page hesitation and the visitor's honest statement, earning the final stance. Minor deduction: the visitor's paint-splattered boots and swollen eyes function as visual shorthand without deeper contradiction or complexity shaping their choices.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors cleanly by line 6 (tower laboratory, blackout aftermath, Elya's role). The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elya abandons the prescribed score and discovers connection as co-questioner rather than guide, with the cost felt in her relinquished certainty ("not pilgrims and guide, but two questions"). One meaningful deepening through the visitor's arrival transforms the solitary ritual into mutual exploration. Lens holds; cost is palpable in the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The laboratory of lost sounds is vivid and specific (cracked cylinders, jars of silent bird calls, coils of tape), filtered through Elya's professional attention. The miner's lamp lens actively constrains her choice to follow color rather than the clipboard score, directly charging the closure moment. Spatial choreography is clean (tower, stairwell door, rafters). Minor cap applied: while the bells and lens shape the final choice, the broader occupational systems (tuning protocols, grant metrics) remain atmospheric rather than tactically essential.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether Elya can guide a pilgrimage she doubts—signals early and tightens when the visitor arrives "early" yet belongs. The key reversal is Elya's choice to abandon the score and walk as co-questioner, narrowing her options (she forecloses her role as authoritative guide) with visible cost (uncertainty voiced aloud, "hearing her own uncertainty like a second voice"). Escalation coheres under the Accumulative lens through the visitor's honest statement, which reweights Elya's premise. One clear tightening with felt cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme—connection as mutual vulnerability rather than guided transaction—emerges through the bells-as-mirror insight and the final choice to walk together. The miner's lens reappears with shifted meaning (following color instead of prescription). Elya's epiphany ("the pilgrimage had already begun") is earned by the visitor's candor and her own prior doubt. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer (texture of connection felt, not mapped) without stating a moral. Minor deduction: the grant/metrics friction is told more than dramatized, slightly diluting thematic cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Elya; psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during doubt, slightly wider during bell-ringing). Perceptual signature is consistent (professional attention to sound texture, color, resonance). Dialogue feels natural and advances plot ("I needed somewhere the lights might fail again" carries subtext and reweights the scene). Minor deduction: a few filter verbs cluster in the opening third ("felt it brush her skin," "she felt the words slip") without strong voice motivation, slightly dulling immediacy during setup.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high; most lines advance character or atmosphere. The opening "chime after the blackout was almost too soft to hear" anchors voice and stakes cleanly. Minor loop present: "What if the bells were not a path but a mirror" and "What if her role was not to lead them, but to be led" are adjacent parallel constructions that restate rather than advance; applies −0.2 per the paraphrase-loop check. One figurative phrase ("color shivered over its surface like water trying to remember being rain") is striking but borders on overwriting in a quieter beat. Closure image is clear and propulsive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of sound-based pilgrimage, post-blackout vulnerability, and the guide-becomes-co-questioner reversal feels specific and non-obvious. The miner's lamp lens as a focal object for literal and metaphorical refraction is fresh. Transformation test: the emotional arc (doubt → shared uncertainty as connection) depends on the bells, the laboratory setting, and Elya's professional crisis; swapping names would not preserve the logic. Minor deduction: the "artificial pilgrimage" frame and grant-pressure backdrop echo familiar academic-project templates without full transformation through lived occupational detail.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elya's choices create the key turn: she questions her guide role (line ~27), abandons the clipboard score (line ~38), and proposes walking together (line ~52). Her decision to follow color instead of the prescribed sequence directly alters tactics and enables the closure. Present in setup, middle choice, and ending; strong causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The lens is adjusted early (line ~20) to scatter prisms, used again when Elya follows the bending colors instead of the score (line ~38), and implicitly present in the final "woven hush" image. Two distinct beats with causal involvement (color guidance enables the choice to abandon the score). Missing stronger closure linkage: the lens is not directly named or reweighted in the final lines, only its effect lingers.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The artificial pilgrimage frames stakes from line ~11 and shapes Elya's doubt throughout. The visitor's early arrival and Elya's realization that "the pilgrimage had already begun" (line ~47) transform the concept from prescribed ritual to emergent mutual journey. The concept constrains her role and her final choice to walk without a map directly enacts its transformation. Present in setup, middle insight, and ending action.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Powerfully gentle" is named once (line ~16) as the reason Elya was hired and demonstrated in the strike ("a kiss of motion so small it barely moved the air," line ~29). The trait enables her bell-ringing but does not create a visible cost or tradeoff on the page; no moment where gentleness constrains a harder choice or where power conflicts with gentleness under pressure. Functional but replaceable: the story's key turn hinges on her doubt and the visitor's honesty, not on this specific attribute mix.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Propel" appears in Elya's final line ("let us see where the bells propel us," line ~53) and captures the shift from guiding to being moved together. The word reframes the pilgrimage as dynamic rather than prescribed. Present in the closure moment and thematically resonant, but introduced only at the end without prior setup or middle beat involvement. Lyric reprise without mid-scene use; the return reweights the dominant stake.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Questioning assumptions is signaled early via Professor Saar's teaching (line ~23), enacted when Elya questions whether people need a guide (line ~24), and directly shapes her choice to abandon the score and follow color (line ~38). The method drives the key reversal and is present in setup, middle choice, and ending stance. Strong causal linkage across beats.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The laboratory of lost sounds is established early (line ~4), supplies the bells and lamp lens that enable Elya's choice, and its "golden shadows" and "trembling air" charge the final image. The setting's acoustics and isolation pressure Elya's doubt and make the visitor's arrival transformative. Present in setup, middle (visitor climbs the stairs to this space), and ending; the room's sonic properties are essential to closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the power grid stabilizes" is named in line ~3 and again in the university's pilgrim description (line ~12). It provides context (the city recovering, the visitor's need for honest darkness) but does not tighten a specific on-page choice or create a deadline. The blackout's aftermath colors tone and motivation yet remains backdrop; no live clock alters tactics. Present in setup and middle context; closure participation is thematic rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elya's desire "to discover the texture of connection" is named (line ~18), tested through her doubt about guiding (line ~24), and fulfilled in the final line when she "felt the faint, rough-edged texture of connection under her fingertips" (line ~54). The motivation drives her choice to walk as co-questioner and is dramatized through her uncertainty and the visitor's honesty. Present in setup, middle conflict, and ending payoff with felt cost (relinquished certainty).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Golden shadows" appears in line ~6 and recurs as tonal anchor ("the visitor stepped into the golden shadows," line ~42). The tone—warm, tentative, meditative—modulates appropriately (doubt, surprise, tentative hope) and charges the final image of "trembling air" and "woven hush." Coherent through turns and present in setup and ending. Missing stronger middle modulation: the tone remains largely static during the bell-ringing sequence, not shifting distinctly under the visitor's arrival pressure until the dialogue.</comment>
