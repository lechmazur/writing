<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Lio's interiority is concrete and specific—his memory of city murals forbidden, his move to illicit projectors, the realization that "he was not resurrecting his own glory… but letting everyone else's brightest moments breathe again." Embodied emotion appears in "absurdly, like an intruder," "pensive mirth," and his careful handling of moss. However, the final realization arrives through summary reflection rather than a dramatized micro-choice that forecloses a path with visible cost, limiting the score's upper reach.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates density through layered images (orchard fragment, children from past walls, fog glowing from within) and reaches a Resonant Reconfiguration when Lio realizes the projection channels a "community of forgotten feelings" rather than personal glory—a stance crystallization with conceptual cost (he surrenders ownership). Orientation is anchored early (ruined orchard, fog, Lio arrives). The closure effect is legible and the lens holds, but the cost remains oblique—felt more than visible—keeping the score shy of 8.5+.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The ruined orchard district is vivid and purposeful: branches as ribs, moss on cobblestones, fog that "glowed from within." The fresco fragment serves as both anchor and catalyst, and the projectors transform spatial properties (light threading around old paint). Sensory detail is filtered through Lio's artist lens ("exposed film developing," "crooked chandeliers"). The fog constrains visibility and charges the final image, meeting the 9+ gate test for environment shaping closure; minor lexical elevations ("photonic blossoms") nudge the score down slightly from the high band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early: Lio seeks "a wall that asked nothing except to be answered" after city murals were banned. The projectors introduce a tactical tightening (light vs. permanent paint), and the realization that the knowledge network channels communal memory rather than personal work deepens the pressure. However, the escalation is conceptual rather than decisional—no live choice forecloses a path with visible cost on the page—so the score remains below 8.0 under Accumulative lens standards.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme (rediscovering collective joy vs. personal glory) emerges organically from the projection scene and Lio's realization without sermon. The fresco fragment, recurring fog, and "exposed film" metaphor accumulate and reweight at closure when "everyone else's brightest moments breathe again." The final image—fog glowing "like a city secretly recalling laughter"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. Slight -0.2 for "daydream nobody had finished" in the opening, which edges toward thematic declaration, but the particulars dominate.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited, diction is artist-specific ("rivers of color," "flickering like captured dawn"), and perceptual signature is consistent (Lio notices curves, shine, color breathing). Psychic distance modulates purposefully from detached observation to embodied reflection. Minor register drift appears in "unruly knowledge network" and "photonic blossoms," which read slightly elevated for the established voice under peak pressure, triggering a -0.3 deduction. No dialogue to judge. The piece remains clean and voice-coherent overall.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings are diverse; information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs ("Branches rose like ribs from the collapsed greenhouses, rattling whenever the unseen sun shifted above"). No loops or scaffolding. However, figurative language is dense throughout—nearly every sentence carries metaphor or simile ("like ribs," "like an intruder," "like captured dawn," "like exposed film," "like sleeping beetles," "like crooked chandeliers")—without pattern-teaching or payoff, triggering a -0.5 deduction for overwriting density under the tightened penalty guidance.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of banned murals + illicit projectors + forgotten orchard + knowledge network is specific and non-obvious. The turn from personal glory to communal memory feels earned in hindsight. However, the "artist seeking lost creative freedom in a ruined space" frame echoes familiar templates; transformation comes through the knowledge-network twist and the conceptual repricing at closure. Risk-taking in the lyric-accumulative design is purposeful, but the emotional territory (reclaiming joy, city bans art) is well-trodden. Within-band score reflects moderate originality with solid execution.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lio is present throughout, frames expectation early (seeks a wall to answer), makes the tactical choice to use projectors (middle beat), and experiences the realization at closure that shifts his stance from personal glory to communal vessel. Three beats, causal pressure, closure linkage. However, the final realization is reflective rather than a decision that alters tactics with visible cost, capping the score below 7.0 per the cost-connection requirement for ≥7.0.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The fresco fragment appears early ("pale blues and oranges breathing shyly"), is traced by Lio (first beat), coaxed into shimmering by the projectors (second beat), and reappears in the closure image as the old and new "breathing together like lungs." Three beats, lyric reprise, charged at closure. However, its role is largely passive—a surface for projection rather than an object that constrains choice or imposes cost—limiting the score to mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The "exposed film" concept appears twice: mid-story as simile ("his work… felt… like exposed film left on a windowsill, bleaching out") and at closure ("the wall looked like exposed film developing"). Early seed and final reprise reweight the stake from loss to recovery, meeting the lyric-resonance allowance. However, it remains metaphorical description rather than a stake-shaping mechanic that constrains tactics or imposes cost, capping the score at ~6.0 per the guidance.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Paints with light" is signaled early (the projectors are the tool), enables the middle beat (mounting and activating them), and defines the closure effect (light coaxing the old fresco into shimmering, fog glowing from within). Three beats, causal pressure, closure linkage. The attribute imposes a visible trade-off (ephemeral vs. permanent, "harder to arrest, harder to own, though it vanished the moment power died"), meeting the cost-connection criterion for ≥7.0.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Display" is the action throughout: Lio mounts projectors, taps the console, the murals unfold across the wall, and the closure image is the glowing fog as public display ("a traveling orchard of borrowed memories"). Three beats, drives major turns, shapes the ending. Swapping "display" for "project" or "show" would require only minor edits, preventing a score ≥8.0, but the action is causally essential and present at closure, justifying mid-7s.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The "knowledge network" is introduced mid-story ("an unruly knowledge network of color… had learned the shapes people drew when they were happiest"), enables the projection (middle beat), and drives the closure realization ("a community of forgotten feelings"). Two beats, closure participation. However, its mechanics remain vague (how does scraping forums teach shapes?), and it arrives after the first third, triggering a -0.3 late penalty and capping the score near mid-6s per swappability and setup debt.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The ruined orchard district is anchored early, pressures Lio's choice (the quiet, the waiting wall, the fog as both concealment and canvas), supplies the fresco fragment resource, and charges the final image (fog glowing, branches as chandeliers). Three beats, causal pressure, closure linkage. The setting is irreplaceable—remove the orchard and the fresco/fog/lost-joy theme collapses—and the fog's transformation at closure demonstrates strong payoff, justifying near-8.0.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Within the fold of a daydream nobody had finished" appears once in the opening as mood-setting metaphor and does not return or shape tactics. No middle development, no closure participation. Present but ornamental, capping the score at ≤4.6 per the missing-middle and missing-closure gates. The piece's actual timeframe (single continuous scene, fog-thickening cycle) is tracked but not tied to this specific phrase.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"To rediscover lost joy" is signaled early (Lio's past murals as "public laughter," the city ban that bleached them), drives the projector choice (middle beat), and lands at closure ("letting everyone else's brightest moments breathe again," fog "recalling laughter"). Three beats, causal pressure, closure linkage. The motivation is dramatized through action and realization with visible cost (surrender of personal ownership), meeting the friction-between-wants criterion for ≥7.0.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Pensive mirth" is named once mid-story ("He laughed now, softly, the sound caught between pensive mirth and relief") and modulates coherently through turns: contemplative opening, gentle humor at the projection, wonder at closure. Tone charges the final image (fog glowing "like a city secretly recalling laughter"). Two beats (middle laugh, closure laughter-echo), closure participation. However, tone is more consistent than dynamically modulated under pressure, capping the score just above 7.0.</comment>
