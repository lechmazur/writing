<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's interior life is richly textured through perceptual signature ("silence here was not empty; it was layered") and embodied reactions (chapped fingers, stinging eyes). The motivation to repair what "had broken so quietly" is poetic but remains abstract—no concrete personal stake or contradictory impulse forces a genuine choice under pressure. The arc from arrival to thawing is more lyric accumulation than character transformation with visible cost; the locksmith observes and enacts repair but never risks or forfeits a specific personal option on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece anchors who, what, and where early (lunar-eclipse locksmith, frozen library, morning ascent). Escalation proceeds through density layering—prophecy scraps → gear-mirror interactions → sequential mirror unlockings—culminating in the library's thaw. Closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (the thaw reweights the opening frost and repairs the broken rhythm), but cost remains atmospheric rather than foregrounded in a decisive image or forfeiture; the final line gestures at transformation without a sharp before/after pivot that charges the ending with felt sacrifice.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The frozen library is vividly specific: crystal vertebra, rimed windows, ice-skinned books, frost feathers. These details constrain the protagonist's movements (frost-filmed steps, borrowed breath) and charge the final image—the thaw is both sensory and conceptual. The hall of mirrors functions as micro-setting that alters each repair beat. Selective, purposeful detail throughout; the environment shapes every tactical choice from gear selection to mirror approach.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—learning the rhythm of repair—is signaled early and pursued across beats (gathering prophecy scraps, matching gears to mirror-locks, coaxing latches). Each mirror unlocking deepens pressure by requiring finer attunement, and the scraps provide a method-constraint that narrows options. However, no reversal or on-page trade-off forecloses a live alternative; the protagonist succeeds incrementally without visible cost or refusal, so escalation reads as accretion rather than tightening with a felt price at closure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme—repair of memory, habit, regret—emerges through particulars (locks on throats, hovering letters, rooms deepening in color) without overt statement. The final thaw offers a resonant, non-literal answer: repair is possible through patient, gear-by-gear attunement. Subtext operates in the mirror images and the librarian's whispered instruction. One minor slip: "driftwood nostalgia" appears early and late but functions more as mood label than a thematic pressure that complicates or costs the protagonist something specific.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature throughout: "silence... was layered, like dust you could not brush away because it was made of other people's unfinished sentences." POV is stable first-person, psychic distance consistent, and the prose texture—lyric, metaphor-dense—suits the accumulative lens. No head-hopping. The librarian's single line of dialogue feels natural and voice-appropriate. Purposeful compression in the mirror-repair sequence maintains legibility; diction remains within the narrator's contemplative register under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully, information density is high, and most lines advance mood or action. Minor paraphrase loop: "I read them aloud, and the frozen air seemed to lean in, listening, while the gears... shifted faintly of their own accord" closely echoes "I listened to the hovering tick... matched it to the quiet chords of the gears" in structure and content without adding pressure. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent; one strain: "scatter of rescued stars" mixes metaphor with the concrete gears without clear vehicle. No major scaffold or template cadence; prose remains propulsive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The synthesis—locksmith repairing emotional locks via clockmaker gears in a frozen library—is specific and non-obvious, avoiding stock metaphor. The hall-of-mirrors conceit and the scraps-of-prophecy method feel fresh. Risk-taking in the lyric, accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. One weakness: the "lunar-eclipse locksmith" title and the bottle of melted frost are introduced but not transformed; they remain ornamental rather than causally irreplaceable, nudging toward derivative high-concept without full payoff.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Setup: protagonist is named and framed early. Development: the locksmith gathers prophecy scraps, matches gears to mirror-locks, and performs sequential repairs—three distinct beats that constrain method. Payoff: present in the final thaw, though the thaw is atmospheric rather than a sharp character-driven decision. The choices (gear selection, alignment) are tactical rather than high-stakes moral dilemmas, so causal pressure is mid-range. Cost is implied (chapped fingers, stinging eyes) but not a visible forfeiture that alters later options.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Setup: oak case introduced early with detailed description. Development: gears are opened, brushed, clicked together (one beat), then lifted to mirrors as key-teeth in sequential repairs (second beat). Payoff: gears enable every mirror unlocking and are present in the final sequence. Causal pressure is strong—removal would collapse the repair mechanism. Minor swappability: "tools" or "keys" could substitute with edits, but the clockmaker specificity (teeth, cogs, chords of motion) adds irreplaceability. No conceptual repricing of the gears at closure; they function consistently rather than gaining new meaning.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Setup: hall of mirrors introduced in the first third. Development: the protagonist must earn access, then faces it as the site of all repair work—central to every tactical beat. Payoff: the hall is the stage for the climactic mirror-by-mirror sequence and the space that houses the thaw. The concept shapes stakes (locks governing memory/habit/regret live here) and tactics (gear-to-mirror alignment). Removal would eliminate the story's core mechanism. High causal pressure, closure linkage, and irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Setup: "hauntingly bright feathers" of frost appear mid-story at the farthest shelf. Development: the brightness draws attention to the prophecy scraps but does not enable or constrain an action with visible cost. Payoff: absent; the attribute is descriptive, not causally active at closure. The trait could be replaced with "delicate" or "intricate" without structural impact. Ornamental use; no cost tied to brightness specifically.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Setup: bottle introduced mid-story with the librarian's instruction. Development: mentioned once as a future tool ("when a lock refuses every honest answer"), but never used on the page. Payoff: absent; the uncapping does not occur, so the action does not drive a turn or alter the ending. The setup primes expectation but is not paid off. Easily swappable with any reserve tool; no closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Setup: scraps of prophecy introduced at ~35% with clear location (farthest shelf, between atlases). Development: protagonist reads them aloud, hears faint ticking, uses fragments to understand the rhythm of repair—one substantive beat. Payoff: the method shapes the approach (matching gears to prophecy's rhythm) but is not foregrounded in the final image. Causal pressure is present but modest; the scraps could be replaced with a librarian's verbal instruction. Early signal and beat involvement elevate, but swappability and modest closure linkage cap the score.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Setup: frozen library above clouds established in opening lines. Development: frost-filmed steps, borrowed breath, ice-skinned books, and the hall of mirrors all constrain movement and method across multiple beats. Payoff: the library's thaw is the final image, recharging the opening frost with transformation. The setting pressures every choice (access, temperature, spatial layout) and is indispensable to closure. High causal pressure, closure linkage, and irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Setup: "soft hush of a distant morning" established early. Development: time is not tracked or leveraged to tighten decisions; no ticking clock or deadline pressure. Payoff: morning does not return or reweight the closure; the thaw occurs but is not tied to a specific temporal constraint. The timeframe is atmospheric rather than causal. Easily swappable with "afternoon" or "twilight." Ornamental; no cost or escalation tied to morning specifically.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Setup: motivation stated explicitly early ("I had come to the library to learn the rhythm of repair"). Development: dramatized through gathering scraps, matching gears, and performing repairs—two beats with visible choices. Payoff: the final thaw fulfills the goal, though the cost (chapped fingers, stinging eyes, driftwood nostalgia) is felt rather than a decisive forfeiture. The desire shapes all major beats and is present at closure. Slight swappability: "to repair" or "to understand brokenness" would serve similarly. Strong beat involvement and closure linkage, modest friction from told framing and mild cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Setup: "driftwood nostalgia" introduced early and repeated late ("slow, driftwood nostalgia for lives I had never lived"). Development: the tone is consistent but does not modulate with pressure or constrain a choice; it remains a static mood. Payoff: present in the penultimate paragraph but does not charge the final thaw image—thawing reads as hope rather than nostalgia. Coherent tone across beats, but label-only rather than embodied in specific choices. Lyric reprise earns mid-band credit; lack of pressure modulation and causal work limit the score.</comment>
