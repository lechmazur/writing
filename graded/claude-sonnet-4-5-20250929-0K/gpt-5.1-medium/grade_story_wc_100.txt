<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias is characterized through consistent interiority—"quietly, densely weary," "mistake exhaustion for duty"—and his profession shapes his perception throughout. The underwater choice feels earned by his established commitment to "give rest a permanent address," though the final line "occupying impossible spaces as chased stillness finally paused" slips into abstraction that weakens embodied cost. Internal contradiction is present (duty versus exhaustion) but the climactic decision to shelve unfinished lives could show more visible struggle. The librarian remains functional pressure rather than a fully dimensional presence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure. Orientation anchors cleanly within the first ~100 words (undertaker, harbor town, dusk). The piece accumulates through matched images (burying generations → shelving lives; surface lens → depth lens) and lands a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias recognizes his surface work mirrors the library's depth work, accepting the task with visible cost ("stepped between breaths and spines"). However, the final beat compresses the shelving action into summary ("The task was not to heal... but to shelve them properly") rather than dramatizing one specific act of placement, which dulls closure sharpness and caps the score below 8.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The broken lens functions as micro-setting, constraining the descent ("pulled in his hands... like a compass") and charging the final image when it "warmed, answering some invisible call." The underwater library is vividly particular—shelves spiraling through impossible geometry, books bound in "sea-salt... hair or fog... the moment before a person spoke"—and the ravaged chamber pressures Elias's choice. Spatial choreography remains clear (boat, steps, landing, chamber). The lens returns with changed meaning at closure, meeting the 9+ gate requirement.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: "give rest a permanent address." The librarian's revelation—"rest has gone missing"—tightens pressure meaningfully, and the broken lens provides a concrete constraint. Elias's protest ("I bury bodies, not cities") and the librarian's reframe force a trade-off that narrows options. However, the final acceptance is told in summary ("The task was not to heal... but to shelve them properly") rather than shown through one specific shelving act with visible friction, which keeps the tightening legible but not viscerally felt. Cost is conceptual (expanding his role) rather than physical or relational, fitting the Accumulative lens but limiting band height.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through matched particulars: surface burial/depth shelving, broken lens/broken reception, undertaker's "permanent address" extending to unfinished lives. The librarian's line "you revitalize what the world thinks finished" reframes rather than stating a moral. The final image—"stepped between breaths and spines, occupying impossible spaces as chased stillness finally paused"—offers a resonant answer to the rest/distress question without thesis. The "chased stillness" motif recurs with shifted weight. Minor penalty: "revitalize" risks thematic echo but is embedded in character dialogue rather than narrator summary, so remains borderline acceptable.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited to Elias; perceptual signature is consistent ("the sea and sky pressed close, chasing what little stillness remained"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully (closer during the lens moment, pulling back for the library panorama). The librarian's dialogue ("You took your time, undertaker") carries distinct formality. However, the final line's abstract compression—"stepped between breaths and spines, occupying impossible spaces as chased stillness finally paused"—strains the established concrete register under peak pressure. Filter verbs ("knew a library," "realized he was drifting") appear but remain voice-appropriate. No head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and figurative language is mostly coherent ("sea opened like an eye," "water thick as sleep"). Information density is high in the library description. However, two issues lower the score: (1) paraphrase loop in paragraph 2–3 ("three generations"/"only undertaker left"/"kept at it" all establish weariness without added pressure), and (2) the final paragraph condenses crucial action into summary abstraction ("stepped between breaths and spines, occupying impossible spaces") rather than concrete sequence, dulling propulsion at closure. Template cadence appears briefly in the chart description ("looped and crossed, diving off"). Applying −0.6 for loops and compression at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The underwater library for unfinished lives is a specific, non-obvious synthesis of undertaker and distress-signal elements. The broken lens as both object and metaphor feels purposeful rather than ornamental. Emotional truth (weariness, the weight of incompletion) anchors the fantastical frame. Risk-taking in structure (descent, chamber reveal, abstract final image) heightens stakes. However, the "library of unfinished stories" has thematic precedent in genre fiction, and the final beat retreats into abstraction ("occupying impossible spaces") rather than maintaining the story's prior concreteness, which slightly undercuts boldness. Transformation is present but not fully unique.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias present from the opening and shapes two key beats: choosing to row out alone (agency, risk) and accepting the shelving task after protest. His weariness motivates both the initial reluctance and the final recognition that his work extends to the library. However, the climactic shelving action is summarized rather than shown as a discrete choice with visible cost, which caps participation below 7.0. Setup, development, and closure presence all met; causal pressure moderate.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The broken lens appears in beat 1 (arrival), beat 2 (rowing, alignment to glow), beat 3 (opens the sea), and beat 4 (warms at the ravaged chamber). It enables the descent and charges the closure by "answering some invisible call." Removing it would break the story's descent mechanism and thematic link between surface/depth distress. Specificity high (fractured glass, spidered cracks, oilcloth wrapping). Cost tied to its brokenness (reception broken, library overwhelmed). Three gates met; strong causal and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Distress signals frame the entire structure: coded chart (beat 1), glow as signal (beat 2), library as receiver (beat 3), "lives that never found conclusion" whose signals "arrived all at once and broke the lens" (beat 4). The concept shapes the stake (restore reception/rest) and the librarian's framing of Elias's role. Closure hinges on shelving distress into "permanent address." Setup, development, closure all present; causal pressure high. Could score higher if the final shelving act were more concretely shown.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Inadvertently stubborn" is established early ("mistake exhaustion for duty") and explains why Elias rows out alone rather than seeking help. It constrains the middle choice (going alone, not delegating). However, the trait does not visibly complicate the final acceptance—he protests once, then agrees without further struggle tied to stubbornness. Setup and development met; closure linkage weak. Cost present (going alone) but not tied to stubbornness at the ending. Mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Revitalize" is explicitly named by the librarian as reframing Elias's work, and the final task (shelving unfinished lives) enacts it. However, the action is told in summary ("to shelve them properly... stepped between breaths and spines") rather than dramatized. Setup met (librarian's line), closure participation met (final paragraph), but the middle lacks a discrete "revitalize" moment. The verb is slightly generic (could swap for "restore," "reconcile") without major story change. Setup, weak development, closure participation partial.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Occupying impossible spaces" appears twice: once describing the library's geometry ("shelves spiraled... bending around corners that did not exist until needed") and once in the final line as Elias's action. It characterizes the library's pressure (you must work in non-Euclidean logic) and the final acceptance. However, the method is not mechanically signaled—how does one "occupy" such spaces?—and it does not constrain a prior attempt. Setup implicit, development thin, closure present but abstract. Lyric reprise with moderate reweighting.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The underwater city library is introduced at beat 3, pressures choice via the ravaged chamber (beat 4), and provides the resources (shelves, logic of rest) that enable the ending. The library's impossible geometry ("shelves spiraled upward and downward... corners that did not exist until needed") directly mirrors the final action. Books as objects ("bound in materials he could not name... sea-salt, hair, fog, the moment before a person spoke") add texture and stakes. Setup delayed but within first half; development strong; closure essential. Specificity and irreplaceability high.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Timeframe anchors at "dusk" (package arrival) and "full dark" (rowing), then becomes indeterminate underwater. No ticking clock or time pressure after descent; the library exists in paused time ("pressed their thumb on time"). The package's arrival triggers action but does not create urgency. Setup present, development absent (no time constraints tighten choices), closure unaffected by time. Functional but replaceable; the story would work nearly unchanged if the package arrived at dawn.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elias's desire "to give rest a permanent address, one grave at a time" is seeded early, voiced internally, and tested at closure when the librarian reframes it ("you revitalize what the world thinks finished"). His protest ("I bury bodies, not cities") dramatizes friction between old scope and new demand. The final acceptance extends the motivation to the library's unfinished lives. Setup, development (reframe under pressure), and closure all met. Cost is expansion of duty with attendant weariness. Could score higher if the final shelving were shown rather than summarized.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Chased stillness" appears in paragraph 16 ("chasing what little stillness remained in him into some narrow corner") and returns in the final line ("as chased stillness finally paused"). The tone coheres through accumulative, meditative pacing and modulates at the descent (pressure increases, diction compresses). The reprise reweights the opening weariness as earned rest. However, the phrase is abstract and the final beat's tone shifts into lyric opacity ("stepped between breaths and spines") that tensions clarity. Lyric reprise with moderate charge; coherence strong, modulation acceptable, final image somewhat diffuse.</comment>
