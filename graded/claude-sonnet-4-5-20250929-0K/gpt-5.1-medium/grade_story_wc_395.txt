<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's interiority is distinctive and specific (the "stone in my shoe" metaphor for not-knowing, the patch as worry stone), and motivation intensifies across the piece from passive observation to active transgression. Internal conflict between professional duty and personal obsession drives micro-choices (spoofing the audit, treating silence as content). The final decision to close the interface after discovering the subnet feels earned but lacks visible on-page cost in the moment—the price is more implied than embodied, preventing high-band entry.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout: the recurring 713 pattern builds density, the archive's "echo" motif deepens, and the final query treating silence-as-content provides a meaningful conceptual turn. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration (the narrator "knowing at last" where deleted files go constitutes Charged Poise—options crystallize, the hunt ends). Cost is felt conceptually (complicity in a system that hides people) but could be more visceral on the page. Orientation anchors clearly within the first paragraph (corporate memory keeper, social network archive).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The archive setting ("humming cathedral," "chilled racks," Deep Cold vault) is vivid and the recurring 713 numbers constrain the narrator's investigative tactics. The patch object returns with reweighted meaning at the decision point, charging the final choice. Micro-setting qualifies: the interface, the query system, and the "sliver" gateway all shape on-page action. However, the "buried subnet" revelation lacks spatial grounding—we don't see or sense what that space feels like, only learn of its existence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding Ora/understanding 713) is clear early and tightens through pattern-tracing, account-orbiting discovery, and the spoofed audit. One meaningful escalation occurs when the narrator moves from passive observation to active boundary-crossing (the query "that should not exist"). The final discovery narrows options with conceptual cost (complicity, forbidden knowledge). However, the climactic beat—writing the impossible query—feels compressed; we don't inhabit the risk or see immediate consequence, only the result.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of erasure-versus-persistence emerges organically through the archive's structure, Ora's "humane design" obsession, and the spaceship-patch metaphor ("some crashes were really escapes"). The final image of profiles "stripped of ads and metrics" reweights prior material, offering a non-literal answer: deletion is sanctuary, not absence. The "RESOLVED is a lie" and "deleted does not mean gone" refrains risk becoming thesis statements but remain woven into scene pressure rather than standing apart as moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinctive perceptual signature throughout: the narrator notices data patterns, system behaviors, and absences with professional specificity ("checksum tails," "multi-signed warrants"). Diction remains controlled and voice-consistent under rising pressure. The lyric compression ("a sensed absence, like the brief pressure in a room") and patterned elision (we never see Ora, only echoes) are purposeful and taught early. No head-hopping; psychic distance stable. The phrase "fond of paradox" anthropomorphizes the archive in a way that feels character-specific rather than generic.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Information density is high and rhythm varies purposefully; most lines do multiple jobs. However, several paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "deletion is a clean erasure" / "deleted does not mean gone" / "deleted files go" recurs without added pressure; "the system only routes the data" / "moved to a place with fewer witnesses" restates the same idea. The "713, over and over, like the system had learned to stutter" is vivid, but "kept resurfacing" and "orbited certain accounts" cover similar ground. Template cadence in the archive-description opening (scroll/photo/comment) is minor. Apply −0.6 for paraphrase loops and stem repetition.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of corporate-archive setting, pattern-based investigation, and the "silence as content" paradox feels specific and non-obvious. The spaceship-patch metaphor ("crashes were really escapes") reframes the missing-persons premise freshly. Risk-taking in treating the archive as both antagonist and ally, and in withholding Ora entirely except as data-ghost, heightens stakes. However, the "disappeared employee in tech company" and "hidden subnet for deleted people" premises echo familiar genre templates (corporate conspiracy, digital afterlife). Transformation through the humane-design angle and the "choir forced to sing jingles" image lifts the piece but does not fully escape derivative territory.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The memory keeper role is signaled immediately, frames every observation (curating feeds, watching logs), and drives the key choice to spoof the audit and write the forbidden query. Two clear beats: tracing 713 patterns (middle) and executing the impossible query (closure). The character's professional access enables the investigation and the final transgression is tied to their unique position. Causal pressure is strong and closure participation direct.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The patch appears twice: on Ora's desk (backstory) and pinned to the lanyard at the decision point. The "crashes were really escapes" meaning reweights at closure when the narrator discovers the subnet sanctuary. However, the patch itself does not constrain a choice—the narrator could have spoofed the audit without it. It charges the thematic resonance (escape-as-deletion) but does not alter tactics on the page. Setup and payoff present; middle development absent.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The cold case concept shapes every beat: it motivates the narrator's obsessive watching, drives the 713 investigation, and generates the story's central question (where did Ora go?). The concept tightens stakes when other disappeared employees are discovered, and the closure directly answers the case (the buried subnet). The case is not ornamental—remove it and no story remains. Early signal, middle pressure, closure transformation all present.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Brightly attentive" is named once early ("my private reason to keep watching so brightly attentive") but does not demonstrably constrain or enable later choices. The narrator's attention is shown through pattern-tracing and query-building, but the "brightly" modifier does not add cost or specificity—any attentive investigator would do the same. The trait is asserted rather than dramatized with visible trade-offs. Present in setup but not developed or reprised.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lies appear in multiple beats: the system's "RESOLVED" stamp is "a lie we tell regulators," the spoofed audit is "another lie, one the logs would keep as faithfully as any truth," and the narrator's query itself is a deception. The lie-as-method shapes tactics (the narrator must deceive the system to breach Deep Cold) and carries moral weight at closure (complicity in the same erasure systems). Key turns trace to this action. Strong causal role and thematic charge.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The recurring 713 numbers are signaled early (morning after disappearance), appear across multiple beats (ad impressions, timestamps, checksums, auto-suggested songs), drive the investigation method (tracing instances on the dashboard), and point to the final coordinates. The numbers' mechanics matter: they orbit disappeared-employee accounts and encode time-stamps (7:01:03 silences). Remove 713 and the investigative spine collapses. Early signal, middle pressure, closure participation, and irreplaceable specificity all present.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The archive setting pressures every choice: access rules create risk (multi-signed warrants, spoofed audits), the system's "tendency to echo" enables the pattern-hunt, and Deep Cold's vault structure creates the final barrier. The "gateway" and "query" interface are micro-settings that alter tactics. The setting is not merely descriptive—it supplies both obstacles and investigative tools. However, the buried subnet at closure lacks spatial texture; we learn of it but don't inhabit it.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Across the echo of forgotten songs" appears once in the opening and once obliquely when the servers "keep humming," but it does not function as a timeframe that tightens decisions. The investigation spans "two years" but no clock pressure is felt—the narrator could trace 713 forever without consequence. Time does not shape tactics or narrow options. Ornamental phrase rather than functional constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The desire to find where deleted files go is dramatized through escalating choices: flagging the glitch, rebuilding timelines, tracing accounts, spoofing the audit, and finally querying silence-as-content. Friction between the want (truth) and the cost (professional transgression, complicity) is visible throughout. The motivation drives every beat and is answered directly at closure ("I closed the interface, knowing at last where deleted files go"). Early signal, middle development, closure satisfaction all strong.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The tone of "sensed absence" is coherent from the ghost-tending opening through the "brief pressure in a room after someone slips out" and the final silences tagged 7:01:03. The tone modulates with escalating pressure (passive archiving to active boundary-crossing) without breaking. However, the tonal charge at the final image is muted—the narrator's closing of the interface feels more resignation than revelation, and the cost is conceptual rather than viscerally felt, limiting the tone's emotional aftereffect.</comment>
