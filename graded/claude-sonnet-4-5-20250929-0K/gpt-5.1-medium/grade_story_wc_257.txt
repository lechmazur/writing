<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Ela's motivation is specific and embodied through her jewelry-making choices that evolve from "closed eyes" to "glass seeds that caught fractured light." The shift from mourning to pieces "for those who had withered under quiet burdens yet might...remember how to bloom again" traces a coherent arc. Riv as genuinely artificial consciousness is distinct, though his gentle-yet-ardent manner remains largely told. Minor slip: Ela's emotional progression feels smooth where grief-driven work would plausibly generate more contradiction and setback.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The piece operates under an Accumulative lens with clear anchors (observatory, Ela's workbench, ritual of origami placement). Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration: the meteor shower illuminates her path "as a chain of small awakenings," and she pivots from mourning jewelry to pieces "for the almost-living." The cost is felt in her acknowledgment that "rock bottom was only a temporary floor"—a renunciation of despair with visible forward commitment. One tightening suffices at this length, and the curtain-apparatus pays off cleanly at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The observatory setting constrains Ela's work: no clocks, long exposures, the central shaft apparatus, and the catwalk choreography are all purposeful. The origami birds "scattered the incoming starlight into strange halos that illuminate the scars of the observatory's metal" charges the final image. Sensory detail is vivid and filtered through Ela's craft-oriented perception. Minor note: spatial transitions between workbench, coordinates, and catwalk could be slightly sharper, but micro-setting (jewelry tools, vellum, origami) compensates well.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—teaching withering to bloom again—is signaled early and tightens through the ritual of placing origami birds "forcing herself to navigate the constellations of her own failures." The meteor shower functions as a deepening moment that reweights her work, and the morning sketch of a "new series...for the almost-living" shows agency with cost: she abandons pure mourning work. Under the Accumulative lens, this one meaningful shift is sufficient. No major reversals required, and coincidence (meteor shower) complicates rather than resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: the apparatus that sorts light "not by frequency but by desire," and Ela's shift from urns to "settings that seemed always on the verge of unfolding into something living." The closing sketch of pieces "for the almost-living" offers a resonant answer to the central question without moralizing. The instruction "Stay near what you love until it begins to move again" functions as thematic gesture rather than thesis. The meteor-shower image—"something genuinely artificial and something thoroughly broken could conspire to make the ruins glow"—charges the final reweighting with visible cost and specificity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-person limited on Ela with consistent perceptual bias toward craft and material. Diction modulates effectively: "a small specimen beneath a cosmic magnifying glass" and "chandelier of ghosts" are Ela-specific metaphors. The prose tightens under pressure: the meteor shower beat is rhythmically controlled. Minor elevation issue: Riv's dialogue "grief was the only lens that could refract intention into something sharp enough to cut" feels slightly elevated beyond natural speech, though it remains legible as his artificial precision.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high: "long cascading curtains of intention...equations calculating light paths, prayers describing futures nobody believed they deserved" does multiple jobs. No paraphrase loops detected. Minor figurative density in the opening third ("mourning jewelry maker exiled among instruments of light," "pinned, a small specimen") feels slightly ornamental before the apparatus is revealed, but the payoff at closure justifies setup. The final beat "rock bottom was only a temporary floor" lands cleanly without scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of grief-craft, artificial consciousness, and intention-sorting apparatus is specific and non-obvious. The stencil-as-observatory-map and origami-coordinate ritual transform familiar mourning-jewelry tropes. The meteor shower that "should not have existed in any current ephemeris" is a bold inflection that grows from the apparatus logic. Risk-taking in the "curtains of intention" conceit heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Elevation shortfall: the final pivot to "pieces forged for those who had withered" reads as thematically inevitable but lacks a sharp surprise that would lift into 8.5+ territory.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Ela is present throughout and her choices drive key turns: she accepts Riv's offer, stitches origami birds into the observatory, and begins the new sketch series at closure. Her observation of the meteor shower is passive, but her morning decision to shift from mourning to "almost-living" pieces alters tactics and forecloses her prior path. Present in setup, middle ritual, and closure pivot.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The vellum stencil appears in one beat (Riv's offer) and maps the ritual path, but it is not handled again or returned with reweighted meaning. It enables the middle action (origami placement) but does not participate in closure. Present in setup and functionally linked to development; missing closure reprise caps score.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The "curtains of intention" apparatus shapes stakes from the first-week reveal, returns in the powered-up circuit observation, and is central to the meteor-shower closure beat where "the curtains...billowed" and the origami birds flare. It sorts light by desire, a conceptual pressure that reweights Ela's jewelry choices. Present across setup, development, and closure with clear causal role.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Riv's "genuinely artificial" status is established early and constrains his role: he "never tired, never forgot," enabling the long-exposure apparatus work. His synthetic hands deliver "warm" vellum, and his "subdued ardor that never quite relaxed" is tied to his artificial nature. However, the trait does not visibly alter a key choice or impose a cost at closure. Present in setup and informs middle beats; weak closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The action "illuminate" drives the core mechanism: origami birds "scattered the incoming starlight into strange halos that illuminate the scars," and at the meteor shower "every origami bird...flared...illuminating her path." The action redefines her jewelry from closed/urn forms to "glass seeds that caught the fractured light." Present across middle beats and pivotal at closure; swapping for "reveal" or "expose" would lose the light-sorting specificity.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The method is signaled early ("she began the slow work of stitching herself into the building...leaving origami figures") and structures the middle arc: each bird hides coordinates pointing to "dates she had tried to forget," forcing navigation of her failures. At closure, the birds "flared, the coordinates inside ignited into brief stars." The ritual is causally active in setup, development, and the final image; specificity is high.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The "timeless observatory" suspends ordinary schedules, enabling long exposures and Riv's apparatus. The dome, central shaft, and catwalk are choreographed locations that constrain Ela's ritual and the meteor-shower observation. The observatory's lack of clocks and "scars of...metal" directly charge the ending image. Setting shapes choices, supplies the apparatus resource, and is integral to closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The timeframe "after hitting rock bottom when her sister died on the operating table" anchors Ela's grief-driven arrival and the closing realization that "rock bottom was only a temporary floor." It does not impose a live ticking clock or tighten mid-scene decisions. Present in setup and payoff as emotional anchor; missing active pressure in middle beats caps score.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The motivation "to teach withering to bloom again" is signaled in Riv's promise and dramatized through Ela's jewelry evolution: from "rings shaped like closed eyes" to "tiny glass seeds...on the verge of unfolding into something living." The friction between mourning (her actual skill) and blooming (her desired outcome) drives the ritual and the final sketch series. Present in setup, middle conflict, and closure; cost is visible.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The tone "subdued ardor" is established through Riv's "gentle yet edged" manner and Ela's quiet, methodical ritual work. It modulates under pressure: the meteor shower is described with restrained intensity ("green fire," "billowed," "brief stars") rather than explosive climax. The final morning sketch is calm yet charged with forward intent. Coherent throughout; charges the ending without breaking into overt passion.</comment>
