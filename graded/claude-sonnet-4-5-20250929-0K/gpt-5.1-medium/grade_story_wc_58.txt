<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lady Sera's interiority is richly embodied through her metaphor of "weft threads" holding brightness from below, and her micro-choices (refusing a handshake, choosing proximity) reveal contradictory impulses. The narrator's internal voice is consistent and particular ("collector of unfinished endings"), though the final acceptance of the commission feels slightly under-motivated—we don't see enough on-page struggle or cost in the narrator's decision to "help me walk it." Sera's character-specific perceptual filter (naming places by pain they contained) and embodied gestures anchor the piece, but the narrator's transformation from observer to participant lacks visible friction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchors cleanly within the opening sequence (harbor/cliffs → garden/palace). The accumulative/textural lens holds: the narrator's journey into the garden functions as a spatial deepening that reweights "explained absences" from abstract commission to shared pilgrimage. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the final line "I carried her presence like a lantern" crystallizes the narrator's shift from writing *about* absences to inhabiting them, with the conceptual cost of professional distance forfeited. One meaningful tightening occurs when Sera invites the narrator to walk the path, narrowing the task from external documentation to participatory witness.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The garden supplies recurring constraints: dry fountains, unpruned roses, moss-erased stones all pressure Sera's argument that "nothing disappears; it only moves beneath the pattern." The thread appears in three beats (parcel, Sera's fingers on it, implicit in the final metaphor of weft), charging the closure image. Sensory specificity is filtered through POV (smell of smoke and chrysanthemums, gravel silvered with birch leaves) and the setting's decay mirrors Sera's thesis. The garden's spatial choreography remains legible throughout the walk, and the dusk pooling "thick between the trees" calibrates the ending's emotional temperature.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—understanding Sera's absences to write her "obituary"—is signaled early and tightens when Sera reframes the task from documentation to shared excursion ("Help me walk it"). The narrator's agency crystallizes in that acceptance, which forecloses the stance of detached observer with visible cost (professional distance). One meaningful deepening occurs on the garden walk when Sera names each place by its pain, transforming abstract "explained absences" into tactile geography. Under the accumulative lens, pressure accumulates through sensory and thematic density rather than overt reversals, and the final image reweights the narrator's role from scribe to witness-participant.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—grief as unmapped territory requiring pilgrimage beneath surface patterns—emerges through the weft-thread metaphor, Sera's spatial practice, and the narrator's mirrored acknowledgment ("my own travels were nothing but cartography of wounds"). The final image offers a non-literal answer: carrying Sera's presence like a lantern implies the narrator has internalized the method of walking absences rather than merely documenting them, a conceptual repricing with felt cost (the forfeiture of observer stance). No overt moralizing; the garden walk embodies the theme through specifics (locked music room, servants' quarters, annual dusk circuit). The piece resists tidy binaries—absence is neither escape nor pathology but experimental geography.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinct narrative voice with controlled psychic distance: "I am their traveler, their collector of unfinished endings" anchors the narrator's professional identity early. Sera's dialogue carries subtext ("Your task is peculiar, but then, so is mine") and pursues goals (legitimizing her withdrawals). Free indirect style remains clean; figurative language (threads, cartography, lantern) is voice-motivated and threaded through perception rather than imposed. One brief register slip: "vividly descriptive" in the prompt requirement nudges the prose slightly purple in spots ("lonesome splendor," "intimate greeting by projecting presence alone"), but the effect mostly coheres with the narrator's lyric occupation. Diction remains within a literary-obituarist lexicon; no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>High information density and purposeful rhythm; opening line ("last ship sailed at dawn, leaving the harbor bare as a stripped altar") anchors voice and stakes efficiently. Sentence-level propulsion varies appropriately (longer contemplative units in the garden walk, tighter clauses in Sera's direct explanation). Minor overwriting in the middle third: "her silence brushed against my skin, an intimate greeting by projecting presence alone" stacks metaphors without clear vehicle coherence, and "vividly descriptive" as an attributed trait ("Her voice grew vividly descriptive") feels slightly label-only rather than demonstrated through syntax or lexical texture. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; closure image is clean and charged. Deduct −0.3 for figurative density in one beat that doesn't fully land.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The "obituaries for the living" premise and spatial-grief metaphor (weft threads, unmapped interior country) offer a fresh synthesis, and the choice to make the commission participatory rather than purely documentary elevates beyond template. However, the core frame—reclusive woman enlists external witness to validate her withdrawal—reads structurally familiar from gothic/literary-mystery templates. Transformation occurs through Sera's specific practice (naming places by pain, measuring how far she can go without fleeing herself) and the narrator's mirrored recognition. The final image (carrying presence as lantern) reweights the opening's "traveler" metaphor with earned particularity, but the emotional arc and thematic question do not fully surprise in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Narrator present throughout and drives the walk commission, but key choice (accepting Sera's invitation to walk together) occurs past midpoint and the narrator's agency is more receptive than decisive. Observation dominates until the final acceptance, which does alter tactics (from external scribe to participant-witness). Early signal via profession; closure linkage via "carried her presence like a lantern"; one distinct beat (acceptance of walk). Cost is conceptual (forfeiture of detachment) but felt. Swappability moderate—another empathetic professional could substitute with edits. Setup + payoff gates met; development gate partial (choice is made, but late).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Thread appears in three beats: parcel opener, Sera's fingers resting on it mid-scene, and implicit return in the weft metaphor threading the closure image. Early signal (first fifth); causal pressure (the thread's smell and color cue Sera's mother's unfinished carpet, anchoring the "beneath the pattern" thesis); closure linkage (weft logic charges the final "carried her presence" image). Specificity high (weft vs. warp matters to the mother's metaphor). Cost connection present (the thread encodes grief's structure). Caps: meets setup, development (mid-scene touch), and payoff gates. Not indispensable (could swap for another craft token), but deeply integrated.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>"Explained absences" frames the commission in the opening third, constrains the narrator's task throughout (must chart spaces around a life, not the life itself), and is decisively reweighted at closure when the narrator shifts from explaining to inhabiting absence. Early signal (note: "explain my absences"); beat involvement (commission framing, Sera's redefinition as pilgrimage, final internalization); causal pressure (the concept narrows what the narrator can write and how); closure linkage (the lantern image operationalizes the concept as lived method rather than documented phenomenon). Irreplaceability high; the entire plot hinges on this premise. Visible cost: narrator's professional detachment forfeited.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Vividly descriptive" attributed once on-page ("Her voice grew vividly descriptive, etching invisible topographies") but functions more as narrative summary than demonstrated constraint. No on-page action is enabled or foreclosed by this trait; it describes Sera's speech mode rather than shaping a tactical choice. Present in one beat (garden walk narration); no early signal as a distinct attribute; no closure linkage. The trait is consistent with Sera's practice but swappable (could replace with "precise" or "unflinching"). Caps: missing setup as distinct trait (appears only mid-scene as label); missing closure participation. Functional but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Intimate" as action/mode appears in two beats: Sera's silence "brushed against my skin, an intimate greeting by projecting presence alone" and the shared garden walk as intimate witness rather than detached observation. Early signal (first encounter); development (walk together reframes intimacy from spatial to participatory); closure linkage (carrying presence implies internalized intimacy). However, the mechanics remain abstract—"projecting presence" is asserted more than demonstrated through specific gesture or speech. The intimacy enables the narrator's final shift but could be achieved through other relational modes (trust, collaboration) with modest edits. Swappability moderate; cost present but oblique.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"By projecting presence" is attributed to Sera's silence once ("intimate greeting by projecting presence alone") but the method is not signaled early, its mechanics are not dramatized, and it does not shape subsequent attempts or constrain choices. No early setup; single mention mid-scene; no closure participation. The phrase reads more as narrative gloss than a demonstrated technique (we don't see *how* presence is projected beyond physical proximity). Easily swappable with "quiet charisma" or "silent intensity." Caps: missing setup; missing development; missing payoff. Ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Garden supplies spatial constraints (high walls, dry fountains, unpruned roses, moss-erased paths) and resources (the walk itself as experimental geography) that pressure Sera's thesis and the narrator's acceptance. Early signal (opening third); beat involvement (arrival, walk with named pain-sites, dusk closure); causal pressure (the garden's decay embodies "nothing disappears," its layout enables the pilgrimage structure); closure linkage (dusk pooling between trees calibrates final emotional temperature, and the walk's completion validates Sera's method). Specificity high (autumn, shadows, bronze nymphs); cost connection (walking the garden enacts the risk of "fleeing herself"). Irreplaceability strong—removing the garden would require restructuring the entire encounter.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"After the last ship sails" anchors the opening, recurs in Sera's annual ritual ("once each year, after the last ship sails, I walk this garden until dusk"), and brackets the closure ("the harbor was dark"). Early signal (first line); beat involvement (opening frame, Sera's ritual description, final departure); causal pressure moderate (the timeframe marks a threshold of absence but does not tighten on-page decisions—no countdown or urgency). Closure linkage present (dark harbor mirrors dawn departure, completing the cycle). The frame charges thematic resonance (sealed stories, departures) but functions more as atmospheric bracket than tactical constraint. Cost connection oblique (the ship's departure enables the narrator's arrival, but the timing itself imposes no visible price).</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Sera's desire "to understand the geography of healing" is stated explicitly mid-scene and dramatized through the garden walk where she names pain-sites and measures endurance ("how far I can go without fleeing myself"). Early signal (first third via "explain my absences," specified mid-scene); beat involvement (commission framing, walk as experimental geography, annual dusk ritual); causal pressure (the motive shapes Sera's withdrawals and constrains what she asks the narrator to document); closure linkage (the narrator's adoption of this motive—carrying presence as internalized method—reweights the ending). Friction present: Sera's need to understand conflicts with others' judgment (mad, cursed, cruel). Cost visible: seven years of self-imposed isolation. Irreplaceability high; removing this motive would gut the thematic core.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>"Lonesome splendor" is embodied consistently: dry fountains, bronze nymphs crusted with leaves, roses bowing beneath unpruned abundance, dusk pooling thick between trees. Early signal (opening: "harbor bare as a stripped altar," "shadowed garden"); modulates under pressure (Sera's cloak matching the thread's "somber red," her voice etching "invisible topographies"); charges the final image ("I carried her presence like a lantern" against the dark harbor). Tone coherent through turns (melancholy grandeur persists from opening to closure without flattening into single static mood). The ending's quiet intimacy intensifies rather than abandons the lonesome-splendor texture. No tonal ruptures; the piece teaches and sustains this register throughout.</comment>
