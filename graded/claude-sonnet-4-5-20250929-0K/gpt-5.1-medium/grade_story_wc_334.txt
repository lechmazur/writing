<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's interiority is concrete and character-particular—"curiosity cost me my own memories" creates a credible central wound. The choice to kneel and recover memories despite knowing "something else frayed" demonstrates contradictory impulses acting simultaneously with visible cost. The brother revelation lands with earned surprise, rooted in prior causality. Minor dip: the students' complaint about tangents feels like externalized self-awareness rather than organic pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural, holding through closure. The final image—"decades later seemed to have passed behind my eyes, yet for the first time my own story felt unswervingly mine"—delivers Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant) with felt cost: facts thinning, dates dissolving in exchange for completeness. Orientation anchors clearly by line 2 (drowned bay, decades later, former folklorist). The mushroom-constellation map at midpoint provides one meaningful deepening that narrows options and charges the closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The sunken greenhouse with its glass ribs and fairy ring constrains the detection action and charges the final moment when the protagonist stays "until the tide crept back in." Shipwreck masts as "half-drowned sundials" and the silted floor where "apple roots once drank rain" anchor spatial choreography. The rising tide functions as both atmospheric pressure and literal clock. Sensory hierarchy reflects professional bias: a folklorist reads mushroom patterns as maps, not decoration.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recover stolen memories—signals in line 5 and tightens when recovery costs other facts ("phone numbers dissolving"). The fairy ring moment is a meaningful deepening: kneeling to press fingers into the damp ring foregrounds agency through embodied choice. The bargain's ongoing terms ("offering me a choice between a tidy life and a complete one") create ethical calculus. One substantive turn with legible trade-off scaled to this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The final image—trading tidy columns for a complete, unswervingly owned story—offers a resonant answer to the cost-of-curiosity question without moralizing. The "broken constellations" motif evolves: first a clue, then a fungal-celestial map, finally the governing metaphor for fragmented wholeness. "Chronically curious refuse to file their lives into neat, forgettable columns" synthesizes theme through concrete stakes. Subtext operates in "the bargain had never truly ended; the old woman had only changed its terms"—power asymmetry without exposition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct and consistent: a folklorist reads fairy rings as maps, ropes as history, cider as story-fuel. Psychic distance modulates purposefully—close in the mushroom circle ("images rose, not as visions but as fully weighted sensations"), wider in framing reflection. "Nostalgia came then, not as warmth but as a crisp tightening in my chest" exemplifies voice-driven precision. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping. Minor: "decades later seemed to have passed behind my eyes" verges on abstract where embodied detail would sharpen.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Information density is high: "the path down still remembered the press of my boots" does setting, character history, and tone in one image. Rhythm varies—short declaratives ("I knelt") alternate with longer accumulative beats. No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. One friction: "the hollow shapes they left" and "gaps overhead" echo the same absence-as-presence idea across distant beats without adding pressure; the repetition feels more thematic than propulsive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The sunken-greenhouse-as-memory-site premise synthesizes folklore fieldwork, literal submersion, and cognitive loss into a non-obvious whole. The fairy-ring-as-constellation-map turn feels inevitable in hindsight, seeded by "burlap maps in my old field kits." Risk-taking: trading factual memory for emotional completeness subverts recovery-quest expectations without gimmickry. Minor: the "old woman with tide-colored eyes" bargain setup leans on familiar motifs; transformation comes through the ongoing-terms twist rather than the initial frame.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Setup: "hands-on folklorist" anchors identity in line 3. Development: kneeling to press fingers into the fairy ring (middle beat) enacts hands-on method under pressure. Payoff: "the hands-on folklorist again" at the ring directly enables memory recovery and shapes closure choice. Causal pressure across three beats; irreplaceable—removal would flatten the detection method to passive observation.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Setup: fairy ring appears at the greenhouse floor, glowing blue. Development: protagonist realizes the caps follow gaps overhead, creating the map. Payoff: kneeling to press fingers into the ring triggers memory return and ongoing trade-off; the ring is the mechanism, not decoration. Appears in three functional beats with escalating causal weight. Specificity: the fungal-celestial hybrid is irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Setup: "decades later than I had promised myself" frames temporal stakes in line 2. Development: implicit throughout—age breaks habits, enabling the return. Payoff: "decades later seemed to have passed behind my eyes" at closure reweights the concept as both elapsed time and recovered density. The concept shapes why now and charges the ending, though its pressure is more atmospheric than tactical.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Setup: "Being chronically curious had never felt like a fault until the day curiosity cost me my own memories" (line 4). Development: implicit constraint—curiosity drove the original bargain. Payoff: "when the chronically curious refuse to file their lives into neat, forgettable columns" reframes the trait as defiant stance at closure. One causal link (bargain origin) and thematic charge, but no middle beat where curiosity visibly alters a tactic.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Setup: "I could detect the missing pieces" (line 14) establishes the action goal. Development: studying the broken-constellation reflection and realizing mushrooms follow the gaps enacts detection at the greenhouse. Payoff: detection succeeds, enabling memory recovery and the closure trade-off. The action drives two key turns and is irreplaceable—without it, the memories remain inaccessible.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Setup: "by studying broken constellations reflected where no sky should be" (line 14) teaches the method early. Development: the protagonist waits for low tide so the water calms to a mirror, then reads star reflections completed by mushroom caps. Payoff: the map drawn by broken constellations enables recovery and charges "letting the broken constellations guide every vanished moment home." Mechanics matter and shape multiple beats.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Setup: "The sunken orchard greenhouse ringed by shipwrecks" introduced in line 6. Development: glass ribs, silted floor, and shipwreck shadows supply the detection arena; tide controls access. Payoff: staying "until the tide crept back in" makes the setting a live constraint at closure. The greenhouse is irreplaceable—its layered history (orchard, experiments, drowning) and physical state enable the mushroom-constellation hybrid.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Setup: "when habits break of their own accord with age" (line 11) signals the temporal trigger. Development: broken habits enable the return and reframe the bargain's ongoing cost. Payoff: implicit at closure—habit-breaking allows the choice between tidy and complete. The timeframe is more conceptual pressure than live clock, but it does shape why-now and deepens the trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Setup: "I had come back to the bay to recover stolen memories" (line 5). Development: desire drives the descent, mushroom study, and kneeling choice despite knowing recovery costs other facts. Payoff: recovery succeeds with visible friction—dates dissolve, facts thin. Motivation shapes three beats with clear costs and evolving understanding (bargain never ended). High causal pressure and irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Setup: "Nostalgia came then, not as warmth but as a crisp tightening in my chest, like cold air entering lungs unused to honest breathing" (line 22) teaches the tone early. Development: tone modulates—sharpens during the rope-burn/cider memory burst, softens in the reflection on students' complaints. Payoff: "for the first time my own story felt unswervingly mine" delivers crisp clarity that charges closure without sentimentality. Coherent through turns.</comment>
