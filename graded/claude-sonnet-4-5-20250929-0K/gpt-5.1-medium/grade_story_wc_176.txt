<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's internal arc—from guilt-bearer to sound-caster—is traced through concrete micro-choices (touching the rope, imagining absence as mold), and the final stance (staying to cast in sound) forecloses the metal-only path with visible cost. Interiority is specific ("the old, stiff apology lodged behind my tongue"), but some reflection edges toward abstraction ("my guilt is the wax") without full embodiment. The caretaker's "technically gentle eyes that still measured every flaw" is vivid, yet her function remains more symbolic than pressuring; she observes rather than forcing a choice that alters tactics.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchors—who (lost wax caster), where (icebound sanctum), when (after forgiving)—arrive within the opening lines. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure accrues through layered images (rope, bells, organ scrap) and a cadence shift at "the rope began to sing," culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (the protagonist stays, recasting vocation from bronze to sound) with conceptual cost legible in the final lines. One minor causality seam: the street organ scrap "throbbed" in the pocket earlier, yet its literal function in the rope-work remains implied rather than dramatized, creating slight ambiguity in the mechanics of the turn.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The icebound sanctum, aurora, and rope supply concrete sensory anchors (frost-bearded caretaker, warm fibers, ice-dust bells) and the rope constrains the protagonist's hands in the climactic beat, shaping the illumination action. Micro-setting details (street organ scrap tied to wrist, frozen bells whose tongues are chiseled faces) charge the final image with accumulated particularity. Spatial choreography is clean: the protagonist moves from beneath the rope to touching it, and the caretaker's kneeling posture tracks the rising sounds. The "snowmelt ardor" that rushes up the protagonist's arms anchors the thaw metaphor in tactile sensation, elevating atmospheric payoff.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving forgotten names—is signaled in the first third and tightens when the protagonist touches the rope, triggering a meaningful deepening (the rope "seized that guilt and softened it," allowing names to pour through). The escalation is Accumulative: density increases through layered sound-images (sibilant hiss, brittle laugh, organ-like braids) rather than a causal reversal. Cost is present but oblique: the protagonist stays in the sanctum, foreclosing the prior metal-casting life, yet the felt price (what is lost by abandoning bronze work) remains understated. No antagonist or external obstacle sharpens the peak choice; the protagonist's internal readiness supplies all agency.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—memory as casting, guilt as flexible mold—emerges organically from the rope-work and the protagonist's shift from bronze to sound. The final image ("casting not in bronze but in remembered sound") reweights the entire arc without a stated moral, offering a resonant answer to how guilt and craft intertwine. The street organ scrap, rope, and bells accumulate meaning across beats, and the caretaker's line "only hands that have learned precision from fire and mercy from error can loosen what grief has tightened" threads theme through action. Minor slip: "transcribed memory" appears as a label in the final line, risking thematic echo, though it is saved by the concrete shift in vocation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The first-person voice is consistent and richly textured ("I had cast for them in secret, trying to perfect a bell that could carry their names across water"), with perceptual signature evident in the protagonist's foundry-rooted metaphors (wax, sprues, crucibles, cooling ingot). Focalization is clean; no head-hopping. Psychic distance modulates purposefully: close during the rope-touching beat, slightly elevated in the reflective passages. One minor register drift: "technically gentle eyes" feels slightly exterior-analytic for a foundry worker's diction, though it remains voice-plausible. The caretaker's direct speech ("here we cast in time; the rope is our mold, and your guilt is the wax") is distinct and aphoristic, fitting her role, but the protagonist's internal voice occasionally edges toward poetic abstraction that could be tightened.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and figurative density is high ("rope seized that guilt and softened it, spinning my failure into a flexible mold"), yet several beats verge on overwriting: "a snowmelt ardor that stung my eyes and thawed the old, stiff apology lodged behind my tongue" stacks three metaphoric vehicles in one line, creating slight muddle. Template cadence appears in the middle third: "I imagined… With each strand… A sibilant hiss… Then came…" runs through similar stems without pattern-teaching. No paraphrase loops, but synonym churn is present ("preserve," "freezing," "casting," "pouring") without always adding new pressure. Information density is strong in peak beats (rope-touching, bell-shivering), but reflective passages could tighten. Proofreading is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of lost-wax casting and sound preservation through rope-work is specific and non-obvious, grounded in the protagonist's foundry expertise and the sanctum's ceremonial logic. The street organ scrap, braided rope, and frozen-bell setting combine in a way that feels inevitable in hindsight, avoiding template plots. The emotional arc (guilt to mercy to vocational shift) is particularized through the protagonist's failed village bell and years of secret casting, rather than generic redemption. Minor proximity risk: the "casting memory into sound" motif echoes broader literary treatments of preserved voices, but the rope-illumination mechanism and icebound frame provide fresh angles. The piece commits fully to its premise without retreat.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The lost wax caster's identity frames the opening, shapes the central choice (touching the rope with hands trained by fire and mercy), and anchors the final vocational shift from bronze to sound. The character's foundry expertise enables the rope-work and the ending redefines the casting practice with visible cost (staying in the sanctum). Present in all three gates (setup, middle choice, closure participation) and drives two distinct beats (reflecting on past castings, illuminating the rope).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The street organ punched card scrap is introduced early ("pressed into my palm"), tied to the protagonist's wrist during the rope-work, and its "holes spelling silence" metaphorically links to the rope's "invisible holes" punched through air. However, its mechanical role in the illumination remains symbolic rather than causally specific; it reappears but does not demonstrably alter tactics. Two-beat involvement (teacher's gift, wrist-tied talisman) and lyric reprise, but swappable with another keepsake without breaking story logic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Transcribed memory appears as a thematic claim in the final line ("patient shaping of transcribed memory into song") but does not constrain on-page choices. The concept is echoed in the bells' "transcribed memory beneath" the ice, yet the protagonist's actions are framed as "casting," "illuminating," and "reconfiguring" rather than transcribing. Label-only presence without causal pressure; the story would function unchanged if "preserved" or "recovered" replaced it.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Technically gentle" modifies the caretaker's eyes in one descriptive beat but does not constrain or enable any on-page action with cost. The phrase is vivid yet ornamental; the caretaker's role (explaining, watching, kneeling) proceeds identically regardless of this trait. No setup, no middle development, no closure participation—single ornamental mention.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Illuminating the rope is the story's central action: signaled early ("to hear them again, you must illuminate the rope"), executed in the climactic beat ("With each strand I eased apart and rewove, the bells… shivered"), and directly produces the ending's sound-casting vocation. The action is irreplaceable (no other method is proposed) and its mechanics (loosening grief-tightened knots) generate the pressure that thaws the protagonist's guilt. Present in all three gates, drives the peak turn, and shapes the closure image.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Reconfiguring the braids of the centuries-old ceremonial rope is introduced as the required method ("by reconfiguring the braids"), undertaken in the middle beat ("I eased apart and rewove"), and its completion triggers the ending's vocational shift. The rope's age and ceremonial status supply the constraint (only hands trained by fire and mercy can work it), and the braiding metaphor ties to the street organ's punched rhythm. Present in all three gates, shapes two beats (touching, reweaving), and its specificity matters to the closure image.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The icebound sanctum under aurora anchors orientation, supplies the rope and frozen bells that constrain the protagonist's work, and charges the final image with its sensory particulars (frost-shedding, warming fibers, ice-dust). The setting is irreplaceable: the ice-ceiling crack, aurora-trapped stone, and frost-bearded caretaker could not transfer to another locale without severing the story's logic. Present in all three gates, pressures the protagonist's hands (warm fibers in frozen space), and the "snowmelt ardor" ties the setting's thaw to the thematic turn.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The timeframe "after forgiving yourself" is named in the opening ("It was years after forgiving myself") and the teacher's prophecy ("After forgiving yourself, the work will change") seeds the ending's vocational shift. However, the phrase functions more as backstory setup than a live constraint; no on-page clock or tightening deadline alters the protagonist's rope-work tactics. The "years" of secret casting lend weight but do not create urgency. Setup and thematic payoff present, but no middle development or tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The motivation to preserve forgotten names is introduced early ("I worked only to preserve the sound of forgotten names"), drives the protagonist's years of bronze casting, and the rope-work extends this desire into a new medium (sound instead of metal). The motivation is dramatized through the protagonist's memory of the failed village bell and the peak choice to stay and cast in sound, with visible cost (abandoning bronze work). Present in all three gates, shapes two beats (reflecting on prior work, choosing to stay), and the ending reweights the preservation practice with conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Snowmelt ardor appears explicitly in the climactic beat ("Heat rushed up my arms, a snowmelt ardor that stung my eyes and thawed the old, stiff apology"), fusing the icebound setting with the protagonist's emotional thaw. The tone modulates from cold control in the opening to warm intensity at the peak, then settles into "gentler" resolution in the final line. The phrase is specific and charges the closure image with sensory and emotional coherence, though its single explicit mention limits its spread. Setup (cold sanctum), peak modulation (snowmelt), and closure tone (gentle casting) all align.</comment>
