<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lysa's interior is consistently methodical and embodied through archival work, with her hands moving "with their usual, calmly precise rhythm." Her motivation to translate confusion into clarity drives the rope-braiding choice, though the peak decision feels somewhat abstract—she "considers" rather than wrestling with contradictory impulses in real time. The final step back "carrying careful remembrance" registers as renunciation with cost, but the emotional stakes remain slightly distant. Minor: the parchment in her own handwriting could have sparked sharper internal conflict.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph. The piece operates in Accumulative/Textural mode: pressure builds through discovery (door → seal → rope → parchment) and the clock's thirteen chimes signal surplus time, prompting the braiding task. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Lysa steps back "carrying careful remembrance," the treaty's terms now legible, the door returned to nonexistence—options reweighted, cost felt. The causal chain is motivated by her archival instinct, and the final image charges prior material. One meaningful deepening (seal warming, words surfacing) tightens the stakes sufficiently for this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The mechanism room is vividly rendered—"cold metal and older dust, a high nest of shadow and tick and breath"—and the rope, seal, and gears function as micro-setting that constrains choice: Lysa must physically engage the braids to alter time. Spatial choreography is clear (central table, beam, escapement). The room's impossible existence (stone that doesn't match the hallway) feeds the stakes. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Lysa's archival attention, though the final image could lean harder on a recurring environmental anchor to charge the closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: the treaty's absence exerts force, and Lysa's task is to restore or release it. Pressure accumulates through the seal warming and the thirteen chimes, forcing her to act. The rope-braiding is protagonist-driven agency under Accumulative pressure, and the cost is legible: "every absence be named, every missing body and burned village recorded in a ledger that could never be sealed"—an unerasable burden. One meaningful tightening (seal's question, clock's correction) suffices. The escalation is quiet but unmistakable, fitting the inferred lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme—absence as force, the ethics of remembrance versus erasure—emerges from the seal, rope, and treaty without explicit moralizing. The story withholds easy answers: "Was clarity, in this case, an honest reconstruction, or the courage to admit that some absences were wounds, not miracles." The final image (treaty requiring perpetual recording) reweights the premise without stating a thesis. The conceptual cost is undeniable: remembrance is burden, not miracle. Subtext operates in Lysa's hesitation and the seal's warmth. A non-literal answer to the central question is delivered through the treaty's terms.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Voice is consistent, with a formal, reflective idiom suited to an archivist: "warmly methodical," "the odd, clear complexity of the moment." Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping. The prose modulates under pressure (clock chiming, hands moving) without register drift. However, some constructions lean abstract—"stories in which missing things exerted more force than anything written down"—where tighter sensory anchors would sharpen the perceptual signature. Dialogue is absent (correct choice for this solo scene). The final line's compressed simplicity ("carrying careful remembrance") effectively closes the POV frame.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies; sentence openings and lengths shift purposefully. Information density is high in the discovery sequence. However, several beats show scaffold and near-loops: "Standing among the gears, Lysa felt the odd, clear complexity…" followed by "Something in this room wanted her to do what she always did…" restates the same realization. "The rope from the seal's emblem was here as well" is mildly redundant after the seal description. Filter verbs ("felt," "thought," "considered") cluster in reflective passages without adding pressure. No figurative muddle, and clarity holds at closure, but tightening would eliminate the −0.6 drag from template cadence and paraphrase loops.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The premise—archival work as literal timeline repair—synthesizes SFF and historical ethics in a specific, non-obvious way. The wax seal in glass, the braided rope as temporal mechanism, and the treaty's perpetual ledger are fresh inflections. However, the "magical archivist discovers secret room" frame is template-adjacent, and the story does not fully transform it through lived detail or moral friction; Lysa's inner conflict remains cerebral rather than visceral. The final treaty terms (naming absences) are conceptually rich and elevate the piece above generic "fix the past" plots. Risk-taking is moderate: the accumulative structure and quiet ending are well-executed but not bold.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lysa is present throughout, her adaptability demonstrated in her methodical approach to the anomaly and her decision to reconfigure the rope. She drives the key turn (braiding) and the ending step (returning to the hallway). Her choices alter tactics: she takes the rope down, follows the parchment's instructions, and completes the reconfiguration. However, much of her presence is observational and reflective; the braiding itself is summarized in a few lines rather than dramatized beat-by-beat, reducing causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The seal appears in three beats: discovery on the table, warming under her fingertips, and words surfacing as the braids are reconfigured. It constrains choice by posing the question (restore or release) and participates in closure (terms appearing on glass). The emblem (rope knotted around blank circle) directly links to the rope element. Specificity is high (glass disc, diplomat's seal), and its evolving state (warming, words forming) charges the ending. It shapes two distinct beats and contributes to closure, earning solid integration.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Fables of absence" is introduced early as archival terminology and frames the treaty's logic: missing things exert force. It shapes Lysa's understanding and her final realization that absences are wounds requiring record. However, it functions more as thematic lens than on-page stake; the treaty's mechanics (rope, seal) drive action, while the concept remains an interpretive frame. It appears in one major reflective beat and resonates at closure, but does not directly constrain a choice or alter tactics.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Warmly methodical" is signaled early ("warmly methodical voice") and embodied in her actions: "Her hands moved with their usual, calmly precise rhythm." The trait enables the rope-braiding task (methodical precision required) and costs her immediacy—she reflects rather than reacts viscerally. It constrains one on-page action (following the parchment's arrows systematically) with visible effect. However, "warmly" is less active than "methodical"; the warmth is told more than shown. The trait is functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Merge" is Lysa's core archival method, stated early ("to read, to compare, to merge fragments until a pattern emerged") and enacted at the climax: she merges the braids' sequences, adjusting temporal order. The action drives the major turn (clock correcting, treaty terms appearing) and is specific to her skill set. Removing "merge" and substituting a generic "fix" would weaken causality. It shapes two beats (reflection, rope work) and is essential to closure, though the physical execution is compressed.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The rope is present in four beats: hanging above the escapement, described with ceremonial history, taken down and braided following the parchment, and causing the clock's correction. The method (reconfiguring braids) is signaled by the parchment note and executed on the page. Specificity is high (centuries-old, faded threads, dark and pale fibers), and its mechanics matter: "Each braid was a sequence… each knot fixed an order of before and after." The rope's reconfiguration directly causes closure (time adjusted, treaty terms revealed). Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The mechanism room is the sole setting, anchored early with vivid detail (gears, pendulums, cold metal, escapement). It supplies resources (the rope, the seal, the parchment) and constraints (the clock above, the impossible door). The room's spatial logic is coherent, and Lysa's navigation (central table, beam, hallway) is clear. The setting pressures choice: the clock chimes thirteen, forcing her to act; the gears respond to her braiding. The room participates in closure (door returns to nonexistence). Essential and irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"When the door shouldn't exist" is signaled in the opening line and the legend (appears "only when the door shouldn't exist"). Midnight frames the discovery, and the thirteen chimes mark surplus time, tightening urgency. However, elapsed time during the braiding is vague; the temporal constraint does not visibly narrow options mid-scene. The timeframe charges the premise and the climactic beat (clock correcting to twelve) but does not function as a live countdown that alters tactics. It shapes two beats and contributes to closure but is not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Lysa's motivation ("to translate confusion into clarity") is stated early and dramatized: she follows the rumor, steps through the door, interprets the seal and parchment, and reconfigures the rope to clarify the treaty's terms. The desire drives her key choice (braiding) and is tested by the question of whether clarity is reconstruction or wound-acknowledgment. Friction between wants (clear answers) and costs (perpetual record) is present but cerebral rather than visceral. The motivation is essential to two beats and closure but lacks sharp on-page conflict.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Clear complexity" is coherent throughout: the prose balances archival precision with layered ambiguity (the treaty erased or rearranged a war; clarity may be wound-acknowledgment). Tone modulates with pressure (calm observation → clock chiming → methodical action) without becoming opaque. The final image ("carrying careful remembrance") sustains the tone, reweighting simplicity with burden. The tone is consistent, supports turns, and charges the ending. It does not flatten under stress and reflects the protagonist's perceptual signature. Strong integration.</comment>
