<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The courier's jitteriness is embodied through boot rhythm and fidgeting hands rather than label-only; his attachment to the pendant and Ralen's memory provides clear internal contradiction. The final choice to "stay a little longer everywhere" emerges credibly from the sympathetic vibration experience, foreclosing the rushed occupational mode with visible cost to efficiency. Minor: the shift from occupational jitter to kneeling reverence could use one more micro-choice showing resistance before surrender.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure. The aurora encounter deepens understanding through layered reflection anchored to the pendant's vibration, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant: accepting slower time with cost to prior velocity). Orientation is clean by line 1; the pendant's behavior change provides the meaningful tightening. Cost is legible in the renunciation of "rushing" and the commitment to extend encounters despite occupational loss. One seam: "germinate stories in the people who touched them" arrives as authorial summary rather than dramatized realization.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The ridgeway, aurora colors, and snow provide vivid sensory grounding; the pendant's sympathetic vibration constrains the courier's perception and charges the final kneeling image. Micro-setting (body: knees soaking through trousers) anchors the closure physically. The aurora functions as more than backdrop—its "too bright" wrongness drives investigation and the pendant's response narrows options toward stillness.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: understanding Ralen's cryptic instruction and the pendant's purpose, signaled early via the mentor's absence and the dragonfly mystery. The aurora's unexpected brightness provides the complication; the pendant's vibration and the courier's choice to kneel and commit to extended encounters constitute the meaningful tightening with visible cost (occupational efficiency sacrificed). Agency is renunciation: the courier forecloses the jittery courier mode for wonder-cultivation. Pressure coheres under the accumulative lens as each reflection adds weight until the stance crystallizes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme—wonder as a doorway between temporal layers, the sacredness of routine objects—emerges through the pendant's mechanics and Ralen's sideways vanishing rather than statement. The final image of kneeling with the pendant as "trembling lantern" reweights the opening jitter and earlier relics into a unified vision of slowed time. The line "wonder was the only doorway that opened in both directions" skirts thematic echo but is rescued by immediate embodiment (kneeling, soaking trousers). Minor: "how the relics hummed when no one watched" in the penultimate beat risks abstraction but ties to prior concrete handling.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Single POV throughout; perceptual signature is consistent (professional courier noticing boot rhythm, satchel weight, velvet wrapping). Psychic distance modulates purposefully from jittery external observation to deep interiority as the pendant stills him. Diction remains character-bound with poetic elevation ("carbonated water," "fade from memory to myth") that feels voice-motivated rather than imposed. Free indirect style is clean; reflection anchors to present stimuli (aurora brightness, pendant glow). Minor: "germinated stories" and "slip sideways" verge on abstract idiom but stay within a courier-mystic register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "smoke-scented handkerchief" conveys absence and intimacy). Rhythm varies with emotional state: staccato urgency early, elongated syntax during the aurora revelation. Two deductions: paraphrase loop at "He understood, dimly, that this was what it meant..." immediately followed by "You did not just move objects..." restates the same realization. Template cadence: "He told himself... but his fingers kept... Yet when he drew it out... Then Ralen had walked..." runs identical stem patterns across four sentences without taught pattern. Net: −0.8 for loops and cadence in non-closure beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The relic-courier profession and sympathetic-vibration mechanics offer a specific angle on memory-work and absent mentors. The pendant as tuning device for temporal layers is fresh; the aurora-as-question-mark and "slower layer of time" synthesize familiar fantasy elements into a coherent vision. Risk: the piece commits to lyric accumulation and quiet closure without retreat. Deduction: the mentor-walking-into-storm and cryptic-instruction setup reads as a known trope package; transformation comes through the vibration mechanics and the courier's occupational lens rather than a wholly original premise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Courier present throughout; "jittery" embodied in boot clicks and fidgeting. His decision to kneel and commit to slower encounters is the key turn at closure. Beat involvement: opening (jittery arrival), middle (drawing out pendant), ending (kneeling, deciding to stay longer). Causal: his occupational mode creates the contrast that the pendant's stillness resolves. Cost: efficiency and occupational velocity sacrificed for wonder-cultivation.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Pendant handled/observed in three beats: pressed into palm (backstory anchor), drawn out and glowing (investigation), held in both hands at closure (kneeling). Its sympathetic vibration is the mechanism that narrows options and charges the final image. Reweighted meaning: from Ralen's cryptic gift to tuning device for temporal layers. Causal pressure: its glow and vibration force the courier to stop and reconsider his rushing mode. Irreplaceable: no other object could perform this tuning function.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Ralen's absence frames the dominant stake from line 7 and drives the courier's need to understand the pendant's purpose. The mentor's cryptic instruction ("when the aurora sings, this will help you hear what I never could") shapes the courier's interpretation of the vibration. Closure realization—Ralen stepped sideways into slower time—answers the seven-year mystery and validates the courier's new commitment. Stakes and tactics: the search for Ralen's meaning drives the entire ridgeway pause.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Extends brief encounters" introduced as the courier's interpretation of Ralen's rule (line 8) and operationalized at closure when he decides to "stay a little longer everywhere." Mid-scene: "extending brief encounters until wonder had time to take root" and "the pendant was extending this brief encounter with the sky." Cost: occupational efficiency versus wonder-cultivation. Functional but the attribute itself (versus the courier's general wonder-mission) could be more visibly tested in a middle beat.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Germinate" appears twice: mid-story as thematic summary ("you germinated stories in the people who touched them") and at closure ("an answer germinate in the dark behind his ribs"). The second use drives the realization that Ralen's temporal layer exists and that wonder is the doorway. Major turn: understanding germination (slow growth) as the alternative to jittery rushing. Irreplaceable: the verb encodes both organic patience and the story's time-layer logic. Minor: first use reads slightly authorial; second use is fully integrated.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Sympathetic vibration seeded early ("humming faintly against his ribs"), demonstrated when pendant vibrates with aurora, and explained as the tuning mechanism for temporal layers. Mechanics matter: vibration slows the courier's internal fidgeting and extends the moment "so it would not snap and vanish." Shapes attempts: the vibration forces him to pause and reconsider. Causal: without vibration, no stillness, no realization, no final commitment. Present in closure image as the trembling lantern effect.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Ridgeway present in opening, middle (kneeling in snow), and closure (sinking to knees, trousers soaking). Aurora provides the wrong-brightness complication that triggers investigation. The ridgeway is the exact location where Ralen vanished, making it a charged return site. Micro-setting: snow soaking through trousers embodies the cost of kneeling. The setting constrains: isolated enough for wonder, high enough for aurora proximity. Postcard risk avoided via the courier's professional filter and the soaking-trousers physicality.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Across the fade from memory to myth" operates as thematic frame and occupational territory rather than a live clock. Seven-year absence sets temporal scale; the ridgeway encounter occurs "just as the last town lights died," anchoring night timing. The timeframe doesn't tighten tactics on the page—no urgency about dawn or pursuit. Functions more as metaphysical span (memory→myth) than pressure device. Lyric reprise: opening to ending reweights the courier's relationship to time (jittery→slowed), but vague.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Coax wonder from the routine" introduced via Ralen's rule (line 8), demonstrated in the courier's occupational choice of lonely routes, tested when the aurora provides non-routine intensity, and resolved when he commits to extending encounters everywhere. Friction: wonder-mission versus occupational efficiency (jittery rushing). The pendant experience dramatizes wonder; the final choice to stay longer everywhere shows the motivation winning with cost. Visible tradeoff: slower pace sacrifices courier velocity.</comment>
