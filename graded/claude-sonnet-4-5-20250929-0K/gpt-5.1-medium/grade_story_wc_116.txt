<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The chronicle keeper's interiority is established through concrete images—"gripped reality loosely, as if it were another brittle page"—and his duty provides consistent motivation. The protagonist's passivity dominates: he witnesses, reads by touch, and steps forward only when the path appears beneath him, with most agency residing in the environment rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final choice to remain at the refuge reads as acceptance rather than a renunciation forged through internal conflict. Embodied emotion is present but the peak decision lacks visible cost that forecloses a prior path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a lyric pattern early (dripping stone, roots turning pages) and maintains it through transformation sequences; the closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant) when the keeper remains at the refuge while the library surfaces, reweighting the witnessing duty. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. One meaningful deepening occurs when the swan summons him and he steps onto blank pages that draft futures. Cost is legible in the final image: he abandons the vantage of neutrality and remains separate from the surfacing knowledge, a visible forfeiture of reunion.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The overgrown library, obsidian refuge, and river are vividly particularized through selective sensory detail: "walls shone with captured dusk," "water moved without sound, a slow ribbon of mirrored stone." Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from catacombs through transformation to refuge. The swan functions as micro-setting, constraining the keeper's choice to follow or refuse, and the blank-page path charges the final image by sketching futures beneath his footprints. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency: detailed observation during contemplation, compression during transformation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether to step inside change or remain apart—is signaled early and tightens when the swan offers the path. One meaningful pressure point occurs when blank pages unfurl and "ink began to seep from his footprints, sketching scenes he had never seen," forcing the choice between neutrality and engagement. Agency resides primarily in stepping forward rather than a trade-off with visible alternatives; the protagonist is more carrier than decider. The resolution earns its stance through prior causality, but the escalation remains a single deepening rather than compounding turns.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme—the cost of witnessing versus participating—emerges organically from the keeper's duty, the swan's summons, and the surfacing library without thesis statements. "Perhaps witnessing change without judgment did not mean standing apart; perhaps it meant entering every fracture and listening there" risks articulating the theme but is embedded in the keeper's interiority as lived realization. The final image of the library erupting while he remains at the river offers a resonant, non-literal answer: memory and future meet through his hinge role, and his chosen separation carries conceptual cost. Subtext operates through the regenerative silence and crumbling peace.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Single POV, stable third-limited; perceptual signature is consistent—selective, image-dense, attuned to books and stone. Diction remains controlled: "valleys and ridges," "tattooed beneath skin," "hanging bridges swung into existence." Some lines approach overwriting without pattern-teaching payoff: "a slow ribbon of mirrored stone carrying reflections of cities that no longer existed" stacks modifiers in a high-texture beat. Psychic distance modulates purposefully from close interiority to wider observation. No head-hopping; filter verbs ("understood," "sensed," "felt") appear frequently but fit the contemplative register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Information density is high; most sentences advance atmosphere or stakes. Template cadence appears in the middle third: "He understood… / He sensed… / He had sworn…" across consecutive paragraphs, creating a repetitive stem pattern (−0.5). Figurative language is dense throughout without clear pattern-teaching: "regenerative silence," "crumbling peace," "grip reality loosely" all charge moments but cluster heavily in expository beats rather than peak action. No paraphrase loops or major scaffolding. Propulsion slows mid-piece during the transformation sequence but recovers at closure. Pronoun references remain clear; syntax varies adequately.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of archive-keeper, origami summoning device, and surfacing library offers a non-obvious premise executed with specificity. The "drift of untold seasons" and regenerative silence feel fresh rather than stock. Risk-taking in the patterned, lyric accumulation and the open yet charged ending elevates originality. Transformation test: the plot's emotional arc would lose coherence with different particulars (the swan's folds, the blank-page path). One friction: the "witness without judgment" framing echoes familiar contemplative-fantasy templates; the story transforms it through the hinge role and visible separation cost, but the opening duty statement reads slightly derivative.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Chronicle keeper present throughout; his choice to step onto the blank pages is a single key turn that shifts him from observer to participant and shapes the ending (he remains at the refuge). Two beats: reading the swan by touch (middle), stepping onto pages (middle-to-end). Causal pressure: his stepping causes futures to bloom and the library to surface. Closure linkage: his final stance at the river directly follows from the earlier choice. Friction: much of the transformation happens to him rather than through repeated decisions (−0.4 swappability). Setup early, development present, payoff strong.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Obsidian refuge appears after the transformation (~45% mark, late setup −0.3) and serves as the terminal location where the keeper sits at closure. Two functional beats: arrival/description and final sitting. It provides spatial grounding and charges the final image ("walls shone with captured dusk" returns as the keeper listens there). Causal role is limited—it receives him rather than constraining choice. Specificity is high (obsidian, captured dusk, river meeting stone). Setup late, development weak (does not alter middle tactics), payoff present in closure image. Missing strong middle development caps eligibility; late arrival and passive role cap ~6.9.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Regenerative silence introduced early (first third), described as "one that did not merely hush sound but seemed to heal after every breath." Returns at the invitation moment: "pressed against his ears, not as command but as invitation, promising that whatever broke might also mend." Two beats (early/middle). Shapes stakes by framing the choice as potentially restorative rather than destructive. Closure participation: implied in the final "crumbling peace" that rises with the library, but the exact phrase "regenerative silence" does not return. Causal work is atmospheric rather than mechanically constraining (−0.5). Setup strong, development thematic, payoff oblique.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Grips reality loosely" introduced early as character attribute ("gripped reality loosely, as if it were another brittle page") and returns three times: frayed acceptance of the swan, allowing scenes to bloom, and final self-instruction. Three beats. Enables his acceptance of transformation and his non-interference with blooming futures—visible on-page tactics. Cost: his looseness allows change but also prevents him from choosing among futures or asserting control. Closure linkage: the final self-instruction "so that nothing is broken by his holding, only noticed as it turns" ties directly to his stance at the river. Setup early, development across middle choices, payoff in final image. High integration.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Burrow" appears four times with escalating function: light from the swan "burrowed from its tip into the obsidian floor" (creates the path); "ladders elongated and burrowed into the floor like roots seeking water" (transformation); roots "yearned to burrow upward, breaking through cracked streets" (library surfacing); implicit in the final surfacing ("stone cracking as roots and staircases emerged"). Three to four distinct beats. Drives the major turn: the burrowing light creates the path of blank pages that the keeper follows. Closure shaped by the library's upward burrowing. Specificity and cost: the action is irreplaceable—no synonym (dig, tunnel) carries the root/growth connotation. Setup at swan moment, development in transformation, payoff at closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Origami swan introduced early (first third, "folded into the shape of a small origami swan"). "Via cryptic folds" specified in the prompt is rendered as "words twisting via cryptic folds." The folds are read by touch: "he read it by touch, following its valleys and ridges until they rearranged the room around him." Two beats: appearance and tactile reading that triggers transformation. Mechanics matter: the reading-by-touch method directly causes the spatial shift. Closure: the swan "rested in his palm" at the river but is not re-engaged. Setup early, development (reading) enables the major turn, payoff present but passive. Slight swappability (another cipher object could serve similarly, −0.3).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Overgrown library introduced in the second paragraph and pressures the keeper's isolation: "vines bookmarked centuries," "dust inhaled memories." Returns throughout: layered within obsidian walls, trembling as roots test the ceiling, and finally surfacing at closure ("library slowly surfaced, stone cracking as roots and staircases emerged into daylight"). Three beats. Supplies the keeper's duty (resource) and its eruption redefines the stakes at closure—the buried knowledge meets the future. The library's transformation is causally linked to the keeper's journey ("With every step the chronicle keeper took, another shelf loosened"). Setup early, development continuous, payoff central to ending. High specificity and irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Across the drift of untold seasons" appears twice: in the fourth paragraph establishing duration ("He had done this across the drift of untold seasons") and in the final line ("listening as histories rewrote themselves across the drift of untold seasons"). Lyric reprise structure. Does not tighten decisions or create urgency—time remains vague and expansive throughout, no live clock. The phrase reweights the ending by emphasizing continuity and scale, adding conceptual heft. Setup early, no middle development (time does not constrain tactics), payoff as thematic echo. Lyric allowance applies; score in the 5.5–6.3 range for purposeful seed-and-return that reweights the stake without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"To witness change without judgment" introduced as the keeper's duty (early setup) and returns at the choice moment: "He had sworn to witness change without judgment, but now change was asking him to step inside its current." Final reprise: "Perhaps witnessing change without judgment did not mean standing apart; perhaps it meant entering every fracture and listening there." Three beats. Motivation creates friction: his duty to remain apart conflicts with the summons to engage, forcing the choice to step onto the path. Cost is conceptual—he abandons neutrality. Closure linked: his final seated stance operationalizes the revised understanding. Setup early, development at peak choice, payoff in final posture. Slight tell-heaviness (the motivation is articulated more than embodied in micro-choices under pressure, −0.4).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Crumbling peace" introduced mid-piece: "The air hummed with crumbling peace, as though countless conflicts had ended here but never quite learned how to rest." Returns at closure: "gentled by the crumbling peace that rose with it." Two beats. Tone is coherent and modulates with the transformation—contemplative throughout, with surreal intensification during the spatial shifts. The phrase charges the final image by framing the library's emergence as unresolved reconciliation rather than triumph. Setup in second third (slightly late, −0.2), development atmospheric, payoff clear in ending image. Specificity high; the oxymoron is irreplaceable and thematically loaded.</comment>
