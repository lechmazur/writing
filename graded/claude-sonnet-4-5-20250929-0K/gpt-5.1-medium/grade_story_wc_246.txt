<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's interiority is consistently layered—"confidently uncertain" shapes micro-choices (unbending curves, willing the pen to revise) and the final acceptance of death. Embodied emotion appears in the hot pen against ribs and the anomaly's cradle-like pull. Internal conflict is subtly present: the desire to erase versus the pen's refusal to delete. Minor slip: the progression from exile guilt to peaceful acceptance reads slightly too smooth without a complicating reversal in the final third.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with causal accents. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis)—the narrator accepts death while gently unbending curves, crystallizing that meaning arises from contingent relationships, not erasure. Cost is visible: exile persists, the child cannot return, and the pen "barely wrote." Orientation anchors early (observatory, anomaly, exile). One meaningful deepening occurs when the pen activates and the narrator begins revising history's geometry, narrowing from passive listening to active micro-revisions with felt consequences.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The gravitational anomaly functions as micro-setting: "falling and floating negotiated an uneasy truce" constrains movement and later deepens when "the floor buckled" and objects lean toward the void, cueing the pen's activation. The dried pen and observation deck dust become tactile anchors. Spatial choreography is clean. Sensory hierarchy reflects the narrator's professional lens (mapping transmissions, holographic charts). Does not quite reach 8.0 because the anomaly's physicality could press harder on a closure choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: redeem past mistakes by decoding patterns. One meaningful tightening: the pen's activation forces the narrator to revise history along kinder geometries, narrowing the path from passive exile to active micro-editor. Agency is renunciation with visible cost—"I could not bring back the child" but redirects despair toward safer protocols. The final acceptance of death forecloses the erasure path. Pressure accumulates steadily under the Accumulative lens; a second on-page reversal (e.g., a curve that resists unbending) would lift this into the 8.5+ band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme—meaning emerges from contingent relationships, not isolated erasure—is earned through the pen's mechanics and the narrator's shift from seeking absolution to accepting revision. The final image ("another curve I might someday, gently, unbend") offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in "For editing history, not documents" and the pen that "barely wrote." Minor deduction: "threshing meaning from experience" is stated slightly too directly in the opening third, though it is later dramatized through the unbending action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: the narrator notices alignments, echoes, and trajectories ("signals from one pulsar only made sense against the echo of another"). Purposeful compression ("dawnless cycle") and lyric cadence ("strange comfort") are taught early and sustained. POV remains stable; reflection anchors concretely (pen's heat, charts shivering). Diction stays character-consistent ("verdant, impatient Earth," "sullen, trapped light"). Slight register elevation in peak beats ("credible endurance/renunciation") but remains legible and voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>High information density; most lines do double work (e.g., "the anomaly hummed like a patient throat clearing" advances atmosphere and foreshadows speech). Rhythm varies purposefully. Minor template-cadence slip: "Here was… there the…" and "I still remembered… I also remembered…" cycle slightly in the revision sequence. One paraphrase loop: "threshing meaning from experience" rephrased as "listening not only outward but inward" without added pressure. No scaffold or filter-verb stacks. Figurative language is mostly coherent; "kinder geometries" and "grain of possibility" work well.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The premise—editing history with a pen that revises rather than erases—offers a fresh angle on redemption narratives. "Unbending curves in dust" and "contingent relationships" are specific and non-obvious. Emotional truth (accepting death without terror, revising despair rather than deleting it) avoids generic templates. Risk-taking in the gravitational anomaly setting and the lyric pacing heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Does not quite reach 8.5 because the "editing history" conceit, while well-executed, echoes familiar speculative tropes; transformation is solid but not radical.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Setup: "celestial signal interpreter" appears in line 2; Development: narrator's observational work frames the stakes and the pen's arrival; Closure: narrator becomes "a celestial signal interpreter at last, listening not only outward but inward." The role constrains choices (exile, isolation, mapping faint transmissions) and charges the final self-definition. Two-beat involvement (setup, closure reprise). Not indispensable—could swap "interpreter" for "translator" or "listener" with minor edits—but the term gains weight through the ending's callback.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Setup: pen arrives early ("a dried-up fountain pen with an exotic nib"); Development: pen turns hot, glows, and is used to unbend curves across multiple beats (night after night); Closure: "a pen that barely wrote" appears in the final paragraph, charging the ending with acceptance of limitation. Three or more beats; causal pressure (enables the unbending action); closure linkage strong. Specific properties (dried reservoir, exotic nib, light) matter. Does not quite reach 8.5 because the pen's mechanics ("touched the nib… lines of light") read slightly convenient—introduced capability rather than earned constraint.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Setup: "For editing history, not documents" signals the concept in the first third; Development: the concept drives the middle action (unbending curves, rewriting the brother argument, redirecting colleagues); Closure: "the thought… another curve I might someday, gently, unbend" crystallizes the concept as the story's engine. Three beats; high causal pressure (narrator's entire agency turns on this mechanic); irreplaceable (remove "editing history," the stakes collapse). Visible cost: exile persists, the child cannot return, only softer paths emerge.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Setup: "confidently uncertain" appears early and is labeled as "my closest thing to faith"; Development: the trait is restated ("still confidently uncertain") but does not visibly enable or constrain a middle choice—narrator proceeds with unbending regardless; Closure: the trait reappears in the final paragraph. Lyric reprise (first third → ending) reweights the stance, lifting it into the 5.5–6.3 range. Not strongly causal; swappable with "ambivalent" or "hesitant." Label-only in middle beats lowers the score.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Setup: implicit in "unbend" hints early (softer possibilities, curves); Development: "I pressed the nib… willing it to unbend" drives the first revision; the action repeats ("I walked the deck, tracing… nudging them a hair's breadth wider"); Closure: "another curve I might someday, gently, unbend." Three beats; causal pressure high (each unbending alters star positions, colleague protocols, timelines); closure linkage strong. Irreplaceable—remove "unbend," the revision mechanic breaks. Cost visible: despair redirected, not deleted.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Setup: "contingent relationships" appears in the first third ("teasing meaning through contingent relationships rather than direct translations"); Development: the method is dramatized when "every change rippled outward through contingent relationships, altering which grants were funded"; Closure: "meaning was never stored in isolated events, but in the ways they leaned toward one another." Three beats; the method shapes how the unbending works (altering one curve shifts star positions and colleague choices). Causal involvement solid; specificity medium (could phrase as "interdependencies" with minor impact). Not fully indispensable but essential to the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Setup: "gravitational anomaly" anchors the setting in line 3; Development: anomaly hums, floor buckles, objects lean toward the void, cueing the pen's activation; Closure: "the anomaly's pull felt less like a threat and more like a cradle." Three beats; causal pressure medium (the anomaly enables the pen's mechanics but does not force a tactical choice). Closure linkage present (cradle image reweights the threat). Swappability moderate—could use "temporal distortion" or "reality thin-spot" with modest rewrites. Cost connection weak; the anomaly facilitates but does not impose visible price.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Setup: "after planting the wrong seeds" appears in line 5; Development: timeframe constrains the narrator's exile and guilt, framing why redemption is sought; Closure: "After planting the wrong seeds, I had believed redemption demanded erasure" reweights the premise. Two beats (setup, closure reprise); causal linkage medium (the timeframe motivates but does not tighten tactics on the page). Lyric reprise reweights the stake, qualifying for ~6.0+. Not tracked as a live clock; more a backstory anchor than an escalating constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Setup: "to thresh meaning from experience" stated explicitly in the first third; Development: the desire drives the unbending action ("threshing… to separate grain from cosmic chaff"); Closure: "threshing meaning from experience with a pen that barely wrote." Three beats; causal pressure solid (narrator's entire project turns on extracting meaning from revision). Friction: want (absolution through erasure) conflicts with reality (pen revises, does not delete). Cost visible: child cannot return, only despair redirected. Slightly label-heavy in the opening, lowering from 8.0+.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Setup: "strange comfort" labeled late but the tone is taught early ("uneasy truce," "appropriate exile," "I laughed"); Development: tone modulates with each unbending (anomaly as threat → cradle, terror → no longer terrifying); Closure: "creeping, strange comfort" and "the thought no longer terrified me" charge the final acceptance. Coherent through turns; modulates with pressure. Specificity high (elegiac acceptance, not generic peace). Does not quite reach 7.8 because the label "strange comfort" arrives late (~line 19) rather than being dramatized from the start, weakening early signal.</comment>
