<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The narrator's interiority is vivid and poetic, with the "molting personalities" conceit providing genuine internal friction. The relationship with Lio functions as a crucible—his worry about the narrator walking away shows stakes—but the narrator's many selves feel more like metaphorical decoration than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The moment of choosing "the weary archivist" personality when the patrol arrives demonstrates a micro-choice under pressure, though the cost remains more atmospheric than felt. Embodied emotion appears sporadically ("fingers shaking like the flame still burns"), but much interiority leans toward lyric assertion rather than dramatized contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who (vagrant penny poet narrator), where (rusted library), and when (tonight, as moon clears skyline) within the opening lines. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through density of image and the recurrence of molting/resistance/the coffee tin, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration when "we reopen the fracture toward light" after the patrol retreats—a Charged Poise moment where the cost of continuing is felt even if not yet paid. The closure lands on the page with the tin's retrieval and the narrator shedding the archivist persona, reweighting the opening's "borrowed names" and "false bottom" motifs. One meaningful deepening occurs when the boots arrive and force a tactical choice, then the final image reconfigures the opening's fracture metaphor with undeniable pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The rusted library setting is purposefully rendered—"skeleton of shelves and wind," "rain through the open roof"—and constrains choice when the loose floorboard hides the tin and when "the old prison corridor rise[s] around us" triggers the narrator's survival persona. The coffee tin functions as micro-setting, a recurring physical object that charges the final image. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly: tin on cracked floor, floorboard concealment, patrol boots above it, retrieval. Sensory detail is filtered through the narrator's poetic bias without slipping into postcard mode, and the setting's history (prison library → post-riot ruin) informs present tactics organically.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—continuing the underground press under threat of discovery—is signaled early and sustained. The patrol's arrival provides one meaningful tightening that narrows options: hide the tin, adopt a safer persona. Agency is present when the narrator "pick[s] a personality quickly" and when they jointly decide to reopen after the boots retreat, though these feel more like endurance than a choice that forecloses a competing path with visible cost. The resolution is earned by protagonist stance crystallization (Charged Poise) rather than a decisive physical act, fitting the Accumulative lens. Cost is implied—continuing means ongoing risk—but remains more atmospheric than a specific forfeiture on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the molting/rebuilding/false-bottom motifs without overt moralizing. The final image—"together we reopen the fracture toward light"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the question of whether resistance can survive commodification and threat. The piece invites reflection on authenticity versus performance ("molt is itself a kind of blooming resistance") and resists tidy resolution; the city "thinks the riots are over" while the characters persist. Subtext operates in the gap between the narrator's declared fluidity and Lio's ledger-keeping, and in the coffee tin's literalized "hidden worth." No thematic echo in the final paragraph; the wisdom arises from the particular image of the breathing floorboard and the choice to lift the tin again.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>First-person voice is consistent and carries a distinct lyric texture: "luminous fracture walking," "contraband birds," "rusts under stars." Psychic distance remains stable; the narrator's perceptual signature—poetic, metaphor-dense, acutely attuned to marginality—shapes every observation. No dialogue appears on the page, so dialogue bullets do not apply. The prose modulates appropriately when the patrol arrives, tightening syntax without losing the narrator's idiom. However, the elevated register occasionally strains against the immediacy of high-pressure moments; phrases like "a slow contagion of sentences, edged in rust and starlight" during the backstory section risk slowing momentum. No head-hopping or POV leakage; focalization is clean throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout—most sentences carry metaphor or elevated diction—which creates a lush texture but risks overwriting in peak beats. The patrol scene tightens syntax effectively ("Lio snaps the candle out"), yet even there metaphorical language persists ("weary archivist," "fracture toward light"). Paraphrase appears in adjacent lines: "counting my borrowed names" / "Tonight I am a vagrant penny poet" / "molts personalities monthly" all restate the same fluidity concept within the opening. Template cadence is present in the "we [verb], [object]" pattern near the end. Information density is strong—most lines advance image, character, or atmosphere—but the piece would benefit from pruning decorative metaphors in the middle third. No grammar errors; pronoun references are clear.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of underground press, personality-shifting narrator, and post-riot setting feels specific and non-derivative. The coffee tin's false bottom literalizes the "hidden worth" metaphor in a way that constrains action (must be hidden, retrieved) rather than remaining purely symbolic. The molting conceit is fresh in execution—"peeling off the bravado of the agitator" feels particular to this voice—though the metaphor is applied more often than it generates narrative friction. The piece commits fully to its lyric-accumulative mode without hedging into conventional plot, a bold choice that pays off in the final image. One small proximity concern: "beauty did not have to be gentle to be holy; it could snarl" echoes familiar resistance-literature rhetoric without sufficient transformation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Present throughout; frames the molting premise and makes the key choice to adopt the archivist persona when the patrol arrives, then sheds it at closure. Appears in the final image ("I shed the archivist"). The persona-shifting trait drives the tactical response to threat, showing causal pressure in one beat. Cost is implied—molting as survival strategy—but the decisiveness feels more like endurance than a choice that forecloses a competing path. Swappable with "resistance writer" or similar archetype with moderate edits; the "penny" and "vagrant" specifics are atmospheric rather than mechanically essential.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Introduced early (middle of first half), used in three distinct beats: sitting between them, hidden under the floorboard when the patrol arrives, and retrieved at closure. The false bottom constrains action—must be concealed, shapes the hiding tactic—and charges the final image when Lio lifts it and they reopen. The tin's physical properties (metal, clinks when shaken, thin panel) matter to the concealment and discovery risk. Removing this exact object would require restructuring the hiding beat and the closure metaphor. Closure participation is strong; the retrieval reweights the opening's "false bottom" as promise motif.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Signaled early ("forge beauty from anarchy before it hardened") and returned at closure ("a blooming resistance grows between the stacks," "reopen the fracture"). Shapes the dominant stake—continuing the press is enacting blooming resistance—and the narrator's self-conception ("molt is itself a kind of blooming resistance"). However, the concept functions more as theme than as a mechanical force that alters tactics or narrows options on the page. The underground press activity enacts the concept, but "resistance" itself is broad; the story would hold with "underground press" alone. Present in the final third but not causally decisive there.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Introduced in the opening ("molts personalities monthly like a snake"), used to frame the narrator's interiority throughout, and directly enacted when the narrator "pick[s] a personality quickly" under pressure. The trait enables the tactical response to the patrol—adopting a safer persona—and Lio's worry that the narrator will "molt into someone who believes the lullabies" stakes the friendship. The closure returns to it: "I shed the archivist." Causal pressure in one key beat; visible tradeoff (fluidity as both survival tool and risk). Swappable with "adopts personas" or similar trait, but the monthly cycle and snake metaphor are specific enough to matter.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Present early ("came here to rebuild, to forge beauty") and throughout: writing by candle, pressing pages, the runners trading for their work. The action drives two beats—the ongoing press work that stakes the scene, and the decision to continue after the patrol retreats ("together we reopen the fracture toward light"). The ending hinges on choosing to rebuild again, making this action essential to closure. Removing "rebuild" would require a different verb but the press activity itself is irreplaceable. Cost is tied to the risk of discovery. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Appears in backstory ("Our friendship sparked sorting books at that prison library") and is recalled when the narrator remembers Lio sliding the banned anthology. The origin story primes the present collaboration and Lio's ledger-keeping of the narrator's selves, but the sorting itself does not constrain present choices or return at closure. The method is past-tense context rather than an active mechanic. If swapped for "met at a protest" or similar, the present dynamic would hold. Functional setup for the relationship but replaceable; no closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Signaled in the opening line ("rusted library under stars"), used throughout for spatial grounding and atmosphere, and crucial in two beats: the loose floorboard that hides the tin, and the open roof that lets moonlight pour through at closure. The setting's physical properties—rust, missing roof, prison history—constrain and enable action. The library's liminality (public/hidden, ruin/refuge) mirrors the resistance's status. Removing this exact setting would break the floorboard tactic and the starlight imagery that charges the final line. The micro-setting (cracked floor, stacks) is handled on the page and alters tactics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Framing device present at opening ("As the moon clears the skyline") and closure ("As the moon finally clears the skyline"). Signals the scene's duration and creates a cyclical bracket, but does not tighten decisions or impose a deadline. The patrol's arrival is not tied to the moon's position; the timeframe is atmospheric rather than tactical. The reprise at closure reweights the opening mood but does not function as a live clock that alters moves. Swappable with "dusk falls" or similar without structural loss. Lyric resonance present but no causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Stated early ("came here to rebuild, to forge beauty from anarchy") and dramatized through the press work and the decision to continue after the patrol. Friction appears when the narrator worries about molting into someone who "believes the lullabies" and when Lio's fear that the narrator will "smooth our pages into the trash and walk away humming" tests commitment. The final choice to reopen the tin enacts the motivation with visible cost (ongoing risk). Desire is enacted in at least two beats and shapes the ending. Could be more sharply conflicted—external threat is clearer than internal friction—but the pull between fluidity and persistence creates tension.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Coherent throughout: lyric, fragmented, hovering between hope and precarity. Metaphors of light and breaking ("luminous fracture walking," "fracture toward light," "moon clears," "starlight") sustain the tone across turns. The tone modulates appropriately—tightening when the patrol arrives, reopening at closure—without losing its core texture. The final image ("reopen the fracture toward light") charges the tone by fusing hope and risk in one gesture, fulfilling the "luminous fracture" promise. Not static; the tone's interplay of beauty and threat supports the accumulative lens and the Charged Poise closure. Strong coherence and purposeful modulation.</comment>
