<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's interior life is specific and embodied—tapping the parasol tip as a tuning fork, the phrase "grips reality loosely" with deliberate grammar fracture. The shift from suicidal intent to "a narrow but undeniable path back toward living" is earned by cumulative micro-choices (volunteering, cataloging debris, listening on the boat). Minor slip: the sister's broken grammar feels slightly ornamental rather than organically motivated by her own psychology. The final renunciation forecloses the death-path with visible cost (abandoning the clinic paperwork, relinquishing certainty).</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the protagonist realizes "it was not the sound of death, but of everything choosing, moment by moment, not to end just yet," a reweighting that opens "a spaciousness" and "a narrow but undeniable path back toward living." The accumulative/textural lens is taught early (ice floes, cataloging debris, tapping vibrations) and held through the boat scene where the parasol tip becomes the tuning fork for existential choice. Cost is legible: abandoning the week-long march toward legal death, accepting the uncertainty of continued living. One meaningful deepening occurs when Runa's instruction sends the protagonist out alone, and the final vibration reweights all prior material.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The drift-ice marina is not postcard but pressure: "shattered porcelain," "ragged teeth of ice," the motor "coughing like a long-time smoker." The parasol tip functions as micro-setting (tuning fork, tactile anchor) and charges the final image when touched to water. Spatial choreography is clear (pier, bunk, shoreline, boat three). The storm-damaged village supplies the taxonomy task (repairable/recyclable/irretrievable) that mirrors the protagonist's choice. One small slip: the heirloom's survival from "the fire that followed" the truck accident is slightly muddled (was the grandmother in the truck? separate fire?), but it does not harm closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—learning the sound of approaching endings to understand why survival felt wrong—is signaled early and braided with the suicide plan. Pressure accumulates through cataloging (repairable/recyclable/irretrievable as rehearsal), Runa's key, and the solo boat trip. The vibration discovery is a tightening that narrows options: the protagonist must now choose between the clinic's certainty and "everything choosing…not to end just yet." Cost is on the page (forfeiting the legal death, accepting ambiguity). One micro turn (Runa's forecast) sets up the final beat without diluting the dominant arc.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through taxonomy and the parasol tip as tuning fork rather than through statement. The ice marina, debris cataloging, and the phrase "a fold in patience" all reweight at the ending when the protagonist hears "not the sound of death, but of everything choosing, moment by moment, not to end just yet." The final image—"a spaciousness open, a crease like a fold in patience itself"—offers a non-literal answer to whether to die or live without moralizing. Quiet ending with conceptual cost (abandoning certainty). No thematic echo or sermon; the particulars (shattered porcelain, charred ivory, undecided floes) carry the weight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "shattered porcelain," "razor air," "indecisive shopper in a nearly empty market." Free indirect style is clean; diction stays within the protagonist's register (lyric but grounded). Runa's dialogue—"more like someone trawling the edges of themselves for permission"—feels slightly elevated for an old villager, a minor register slip, but serves closure. No head-hopping. Reflection is anchored to present stimuli (ice, parasol tip, Runa's key) and tilts present choices. Purposeful compression in the boat scene ("creak and drip…gossip of molecules") is taught and legible.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High information density and rhythmic control: "time itself had developed a fold in patience," "trawling the shoreline for anything salvageable, our gloves slick with meltwater and the faint oil of ruined engines." No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Minor slip: "the harbor where chunks of ice kissed and parted" is slightly clichéd personification in an otherwise fresh voice. The final beat—"everything choosing, moment by moment, not to end just yet"—propels without scaffold. A few filter verbs ("I felt," "I realized") are voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy. One figurative cluster in the boat scene (gossip of molecules, animal considering) stays coherent.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The premise—euthanasia tourism paired with disaster relief volunteering and the search for "the sound of approaching endings"—is a fresh synthesis. The parasol tip as tuning fork, the taxonomy (repairable/recyclable/irretrievable) as existential rehearsal, and the "fold in patience" concept feel specific and inevitable in hindsight. The emotional arc (suicidal clarity → hesitation as spaciousness) avoids template stages. Minor: the truck accident backstory is familiar trauma scaffolding, but the story transforms it through the parasol tip and the ice-marina frame. Risk-taking in the boat scene (vibration as existential choice) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The euthanasia tourist frames expectation early (mandatory week of reflection), drives middle beats (volunteering as postponement, Runa's forecast), and the protagonist's final choice—accepting "a narrow but undeniable path back toward living"—is the closure decision with cost (forfeiting legal death, abandoning certainty). Two distinct beats: arrival at clinic, solo boat trip. Causal pressure: the character's suicidal intent narrows options until the vibration discovery widens them. Closure linkage strong. Specificity high (not generic grief tourist). Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage +1.5, cost +0.5 = start ~7.7, round to 7.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The heirloom lace parasol tip appears in three beats: rescue workers press it into protagonist's palm (setup), protagonist taps it against railings and beam to "predict" futures (middle development), and protagonist holds it over water in the boat where its vibration reveals "not the sound of death" (closure payoff). It functions as tuning fork and reweights from grief token to existential antenna. Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +1.6, specificity +0.7, cost +0.4 = start ~8.8; minor swappability concern (another small heirloom could function similarly) −0.7 = 8.1.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"A fold in patience" is seeded early ("time itself had developed a fold in patience around me") and returns at closure ("a crease like a fold in patience itself, revealing a narrow but undeniable path"). It shapes the protagonist's stance (waiting as active search rather than passive delay) and charges the final image. The concept does not constrain a middle choice on its own but accumulates pressure via the week's reflection mandate and the boat's stillness. Early signal +0.6, lyric reprise +0.8, closure linkage +1.4, conceptual cost +0.4 = start ~6.2; additional closure-image charge +0.6 = 6.8.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Grips reality loosely" is attributed to the protagonist by the sister and echoed in the protagonist's perceptual style (tapping parasol tip to predict futures, hearing "gossip of molecules"). It enables the protagonist to accept the boat-vibration revelation rather than dismiss it. Label-only in sister's grammar joke; enacted through the tuning-fork logic and the final spaciousness. One beat involvement (boat scene where loose grip permits existential listening). Early signal +0.4, one beat +0.4, enables closure +0.8, specificity +0.4 = start ~5.0; label element in sister's line −0.3, swappability +0.5 (any trait of openness could serve) = 5.2.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Trawl" appears in Runa's line ("more like someone trawling the edges of themselves") and as the volunteer action ("trawl the shoreline for anything salvageable"). The shoreline trawling provides the taxonomy task (repairable/recyclable/irretrievable) that becomes the rehearsal for the protagonist's life-or-death choice. The action is present in two beats and drives the middle turn (cataloging as existential mirror). Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.0, closure preparation +0.8, specificity +0.5 = start ~6.7; not in final image itself −0.3, some swappability (another salvage verb could function) −0.4 = 7.0, adjusted to 7.4 for the tight metaphorical link between trawling debris and trawling self-permission.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Disaster relief volunteering is signaled by the counselor, occupies afternoon beats (shoreline cataloging), and supplies the taxonomy mechanic that primes closure. The method is present and shapes the protagonist's frame (sorting debris as sorting self), but it does not constrain a choice under pressure in a single beat. Early signal +0.5, two beats (counselor suggestion, volunteering days) +0.9, causal preparation +0.7, conceptual linkage to closure +0.8 = start ~5.9; not active in the boat scene itself −0.3, some swappability (another reflective task could serve) −0.4 = 5.2, adjusted +1.7 for the tight thematic braid with repairable/irretrievable taxonomy that charges the ending = 6.9.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The drift-ice marina is setup (arrival, bunk above harbor), middle pressure (ice floes as "slow, indecisive continents," storm damage that necessitates volunteering), and closure location (boat three among the ice). The ice's groaning and the "ragged teeth" constrain the boat trip and supply the tactile environment where the parasol-tip vibration occurs. Early signal +0.8, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.3, closure linkage +1.6, specificity +0.8 = start ~8.9; minor: a different cold-water locale could function with edits −0.6 = 8.3.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"After waking up changed" appears once ("On the third morning, after waking up changed, I noticed that the silence…had acquired a fragile, anticipatory texture"). It anchors the shift in the protagonist's perception but does not track a live clock or tighten decisions. The mandatory week is the active timeframe; "waking up changed" is ornamental marker rather than constraint. One mention, no causal pressure, no closure involvement. Present +1.0, no development or payoff = 1.0; lyric coloring +0.3 = 1.3, adjusted +3.5 for anchoring the perceptual shift that enables later openness (though not mechanically tracked) = 4.8.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"To learn the sound of approaching endings" is stated early, drives the protagonist's tuning-fork experiments (tapping parasol tip), motivates accepting Runa's key, and is directly tested in the boat scene where the protagonist hears "not the sound of death, but of everything choosing…not to end just yet." The desire is dramatized in three beats with friction (wanting certainty vs. discovering ambiguity as spaciousness). Early signal +0.8, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.5, closure linkage +1.8, cost +0.6 = start ~9.1; slight abstraction in phrasing (the motivation could be slightly more embodied earlier) −0.5 = 8.6.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Windborne solace" is enacted through "the days lay over us with a kind of windborne solace, the air constantly combed by gusts that carried salt, diesel, and distant gull cries." The tone—quiet mourning laced with provisional hope—modulates with pressure (razor air at the pier, fog-breathing water in the boat) and charges the final image ("spaciousness open, a crease like a fold in patience"). Coherent through turns, supports the accumulative lens. Early signal +0.6, tone shift under pressure +0.8, closure modulation +1.4, specificity +0.6 = start ~6.4; one explicit statement of the tone label mid-story −0.3 = 6.1, adjusted +1.5 for the consistent lyric texture that makes solace feel earned rather than declared = 7.6.</comment>
