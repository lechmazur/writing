<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's interiority is vivid and body-anchored ("impatience gnawed at my ribs"), with clear micro-choices under pressure. Internal contradiction appears effectively in the conflict between urgency and enforced patience. However, the transformation at the viaduct basin feels somewhat asserted rather than fully earned through prior micro-decisions; the leap from frustration to understanding could use one more intermediate choice. Orren remains functional but flat, never applying pressure that forces a trade-off.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) at closure. Orientation anchors are clear early; the piece accumulates pattern and density through the three days of tasks, building to the viaduct basin scene where the protagonist feels "slow lightning" and sees "patient revolution" crystallized. The closure reweights impatience as a material to sculpt, with felt cost in the protagonist's recognition of prior fear-driven haste. One meaningful deepening is present, but the causality between the pointless-seeming tasks and the basin revelation could be tighter—"listening" is declared effective without showing why crow-tracking prepared this moment.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful: the basalt sanctuary, frozen lake, and magnetic viaduct constrain choices and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered ("basalt and cold smoke," "dark water below, slowly twisting"). The viaduct basin's frost-etched maps and the current through the protagonist's hands become micro-setting that enables the closure revelation. Spatial choreography remains clean across all moves, and the restrained wildness of wind acts as atmospheric pressure throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: learning to sculpt patience to address cities "cracking under their own hurry." Pressure accumulates through the three days of seemingly pointless tasks, tightening the protagonist's impatience until the viaduct scene reweights the frame. The basin revelation narrows options by offering a specific tactic (calm delay as resistance), and the protagonist's final walk embodies the shift. However, the escalation is textural rather than event-driven; one moment of genuine trade-off or refusal before the viaduct would strengthen the arc. Cost is legible but largely conceptual—the protagonist must relinquish speed as courage.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the particulars: impatience as a material, speed mistaken for courage, quiet refusal as revolution. The viaduct basin images (frost maps, slow lightning, "invisible hinges") resonate without stating a moral. The final image—"mapping slowly, learning that direction could change without haste"—reweights prior material and invites reflection. Subtext operates effectively in Orren's elliptical teaching and the protagonist's recognition of family patterns ("my younger brother throwing a hammer," "my mother biting back her words"). No overt thematic echo; the ending avoids sermonizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature: the narrator notices "feelings as much as lines," interprets water as "caged but not defeated," and filters landscape through a mapper's sensibility. Diction is consistent and purposeful, with elevated register that fits the contemplative voice. Dialogue is minimal but natural and goal-driven; Orren's lines carry subtext and advance the teaching without exposition. One brief line-level slip: "if they were being filled" uses passive phrasing that slightly dulls immediacy in a peak beat. Psychic distance modulates effectively from close embodiment to wider reflection.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear and rhythmic with strong imagery ("wind scraped at the stone walls with a restrained wildness"). Information density is high in the viaduct scene. However, several paraphrase loops appear: the opening two sentences both establish the sanctuary arrival; "impatience gnawed" is followed by "bright and restless, asking" in adjacent beats, restating the same affect. Template cadence in the task sequence ("follow the first crow... count the breaths... stand still") flattens momentum. Figurative language is vivid but occasionally dense without payoff ("moon rose split and haloed" adds texture but does not constrain choice). These artifacts do not obscure closure but lower line-level tightness. Apply −0.6 for paraphrase loops and template runs per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of impatience-as-material and patient revolution through a magnetic viaduct offers a fresh angle. The specific details—basalt sanctuary, magnetic viaduct storing storm charge, frost-etched maps in a basin—avoid generic placeholders. The teaching method (tracking moon paths via refusal to choose quickly) is non-obvious. However, the mentor-teaches-patience frame is familiar, and the piece does not fully transform it; one bold structural or perspectival risk would elevate originality. The ending image feels earned in hindsight, and emotional specificity (brother's hammer, mother's trembling jaw) anchors the universal stakes in lived detail.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The "vigilant horizon mapper" character is present throughout and makes the key choice to slow down, altering tactics in the final walk. However, the role as mapper shapes perception (feeling-based charts, interpreting reflections) more than on-page decisions; the protagonist is largely passive in the first two-thirds, receiving instruction rather than navigating trade-offs. The closure choice to "map slowly" is enabled by the viaduct revelation but not driven by a mapper-specific constraint. Two beats (river unyoking, final mapping walk) tie to the role; missing stronger middle development where mapping skills constrain a choice under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The "magnetic viaduct after rain" appears in three distinct beats: the opening exposition (snowmelt feeds it, storing storm charge), the fourth-night journey to its heart (ring of stones, basin with frost maps), and implicitly in the closure as the source of the current that reveals patient revolution. It enables the climactic revelation with specific properties (remembers storms, carries charge) that could not be swapped. However, "after rain" is mentioned in the opening but not causally active in the viaduct scene itself—the piece substitutes winter snowmelt, slightly weakening the exact prompt phrasing. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage present; one more beat where the viaduct's rain-memory constrains an earlier choice would push this higher.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The "patient revolution" concept is signaled early ("the cities were cracking under their own hurry") and shapes the dominant stake. It becomes explicit and causal in the viaduct basin scene, where the protagonist hears "a patient revolution turning on invisible hinges" and sees tactics (levers lowered gently, letters rewritten, doors left open longer). This revelation alters the protagonist's understanding and final approach to mapping. However, the concept is largely held offstage until the viaduct; one earlier beat where a small patient act on the protagonist's part tests or complicates the concept would strengthen integration. Present in setup, revelation, and closure; missing middle development as lived tactic rather than distant vision.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The "softly purposeful" attribute describes Orren's posture in the opening ("like a bow neither drawn nor slack") and implicitly characterizes his teaching method (elliptical tasks, minimal explanation, allowing the protagonist to arrive at understanding). It constrains Orren's approach—he does not lecture or rush—shaping the learning arc. However, it is largely label-only after the opening line; no on-page moment where Orren's soft purposefulness forces a visible trade-off or enables a tactic the protagonist could not otherwise access. The attribute fits tone and thematic resonance but lacks mechanical cost. Early signal and thematic coherence present; missing a beat where the attribute's presence or absence would alter an outcome.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The action "unyoke" appears twice with escalating significance: first, the protagonist tells Orren "I had to wait for the river to unyoke itself from the thaw," establishing the concept of separation and readiness; second, Orren teaches "not to end haste, but to unyoke change from frenzy." This reprise reweights the earlier line, charging the closure. The concept of unyoking directly shapes the final stance—separating transformation from urgency. The action is irreplaceable; swapping it for "free" or "release" would lose the specific tactile image of a yoke and the agricultural weight. Three beats (river, Orren's lesson, implied in final walk) with clear causal pressure and closure linkage. Strong integration across setup, middle teaching, and ending.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The method "by tracking moon paths" is mentioned once by Orren in the third paragraph ("You will map those movements by tracking moon paths, not with ink, but with the choices you refuse to make too quickly") but never enacted or shown on the page. The protagonist's actual tasks involve following a crow, counting breaths, and standing still—none clearly moon-path tracking. The method frames the teaching metaphorically but does not shape attempts or constrain tactics in a visible way. Late first appearance (after setup), no middle beat where moon-path tracking enables or complicates a choice, and absent from the closure. Present as metaphor only; mechanically inert. Cap at 4.6 for missing setup (introduced after opening anchor).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The "basalt sanctuary by a frozen lake" is established in the opening line and pressures choices throughout: the protagonist sleeps in a "narrow cell that smelled of basalt and cold smoke," is summoned to the lake's edge for tasks, observes ice clarity that shows "dark water below, slowly twisting," and returns nightly. The frozen lake provides both literal constraint (world "held still long enough to listen") and thematic anchor (stillness as precondition for work). The setting's final presence—"walked the frozen shore, mapping slowly"—charges the closure. Early signal, multiple beats (arrival, cell, lake tasks, final walk), causal pressure (lake's stillness enables the teaching), and closure linkage all present. Irreplaceable; a generic monastery would not carry the ice/stillness/patience synthesis.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the lake freezes over" is signaled in the opening ("true work could begin only after the lake freezes over") and implicitly tracked through "three days" of tasks and the "fourth night" viaduct scene. The frozen state pressures the protagonist's learning by creating stillness and visual clarity (ice showing dark water). However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions in real-time; the protagonist waits but is not racing a thaw or external clock. The closure does not hinge on the lake remaining frozen. Early signal and middle presence (tasks across days); missing a beat where the freeze's limit or approaching thaw would narrow options or force urgency. Functional but not mechanically essential to closure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The motivation "to sculpt patience from impatience" is dramatized early ("I had crossed the provinces to learn how to sculpt patience from impatience, because the cities were cracking under their own hurry") and drives all choices. The protagonist's impatience creates internal friction ("Impatience gnawed at my ribs, bright and restless"), complicating obedience to Orren's slow tasks. The viaduct revelation offers a tactic, and the final walk embodies the shift. Desire and resistance are both on the page, creating visible cost—the protagonist must endure frustration and relinquish speed-as-courage. Three beats (arrival, impatience during tasks, viaduct shift, final walk) with clear setup, middle friction, and closure payoff. Strong causal pressure; the cost is felt and conceptual.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The tone "restrained wildness" is taught in the opening ("Wind scraped at the stone walls with a restrained wildness, as if rehearsing the storms it was not yet allowed to be") and recurs coherently: the ice is "caged but not defeated," the protagonist's impatience is "bright and restless," and by closure "the wind had calmed, but the night still held a restrained wildness, as though it too were practicing patience." Tone modulates purposefully with pressure—wild impatience restrained by discipline—and charges the final image by mirroring the protagonist's internal state and the patient revolution concept. Early signal, present across multiple beats, and closure reprise with reweighted meaning. Coherent and thematically integral; the tone is indispensable to the piece's emotional and conceptual logic.</comment>
