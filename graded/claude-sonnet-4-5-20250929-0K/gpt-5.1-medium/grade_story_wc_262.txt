<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's quest is consistently motivated and her interiority carries concrete particulars ("the question had incubated in her since childhood, growing slowly like a secret egg under the ribs"). The spatial imagination trait appears as label-only without constraining an on-page choice with cost. The relationship with the projectionist lacks dynamic pressure; he functions as exposition rather than crucible. Final choice ("let new scenes grow in its light") feels declared rather than dramatized with visible forfeiture.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land cleanly within the opening third. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through layered imagery (unsent letters, deleted scenes, hushed thunder) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Mara's goodbye letters shift from "failures" to "unfinished reels awaiting her choice of ending." Cost reads as felt opportunity rather than decisive forfeiture—Charged Poise qualifies, though the final image stops short of closing a specific door on the page. One meaningful deepening present; causality remains coherent under the accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The projection booth supplies concrete sensory anchors (dust, hot metal, flaking gilt, torn velvet) filtered through Mara's spatial imagination. The film strip functions as micro-setting: she touches it, it delivers visions, and its cooling in her hand marks the turn. Setting constrains the psychometry action and charges the final image when "the projector flickered on" autonomously, projecting fragments onto the booth wall rather than the main screen—this choice matters and elevates the ending.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("to find where unused love is stored") is signaled early and pursued throughout. One meaningful deepening occurs when Mara realizes unused love persists "in the margins of remembered stories." The projectionist's answer ("you can project it here, see it, and let new scenes grow in its light") offers a path but lacks an on-page trade-off or forfeiture that narrows Mara's options with visible cost. Escalation under the Accumulative lens is present but the price remains implied rather than dramatized in a decisive micro-choice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme (unsent love as deleted scenes) emerges organically from concrete particulars: film strips, spliced-out frames, dark cans. The final image reweights prior material without moralizing: "her goodbye letters did not feel like failures, only unfinished reels awaiting her choice of ending" offers a resonant reconfiguration tied to craft metaphor. Subtext operates cleanly in the projector's unprompted flicker and the booth-versus-screen projection detail. No thematic echo or label-speak mars the closure beat.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with distinct perceptual signature: Mara experiences buildings as organs and the palace as "a heart that had forgotten its beat." Diction occasionally drifts elevated ("spatially imaginative by nature," "articulate the question") but remains mostly anchored. Dialogue is sparse; when present, it carries subtext ("You are the seer" frames function, not greeting). Filter verbs ("felt," "seemed") cluster in reflective passages but the voice stays coherent. Rhythmic control under pressure is adequate; no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout without clear pattern-teaching: "hushed thunder" recurs three times, similes stack ("like a rosary," "like a reel clicking into place," "with the force of a held-back storm"), and metaphors occasionally contradict (a building "hums" yet is silent, "hushed thunder" mixes registers). Template cadence appears in paired modifiers ("dust, hot metal, and slept-through matinees"). Paraphrase loop: "unused love" and "unsent love" alternate without added pressure. Information density is strong and propulsion steady, but overwriting patterns accumulate across beats. Deduction: −0.8 for density and coherence issues in non-closure beats; −0.3 for paraphrase loops.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of film projection with emotional archival is specific and non-obvious; "deleted scenes" as metaphor for unsent love feels earned rather than ornamental. The premise transforms a familiar question (where does unexpressed feeling go?) through craft particulars: emulsion frames, spliced reels, booth-versus-screen projection. Risk is present in the lyric density and unconventional psychometry frame. Transformation test passes: swapping projection booth for another archive would require material rewrite. No close echoes of famous lines detected.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mara (crystal gazer) is present throughout and drives the inciting action (climbs to booth, asks the question, performs psychometry). She makes one key choice at closure: to "let new scenes grow" rather than treat goodbye letters as failures. Early signal strong; middle development includes the touch-and-vision beat; closure participation present but the decision is declared rather than dramatically enacted with visible cost. Two-beat involvement and closure linkage elevate; swappability is low (role is specific). Late lack of dramatized trade-off and ornamental crystal sphere (set aside, never used) limit the score.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The film strip is handled in three distinct beats: projectionist gives it to Mara, she touches it and receives visions, it cools in her hand at closure. Its emulsion frames are the medium for psychometry; removing it breaks the logic of the reading. Early signal, causal pressure (enables the vision), and closure linkage all present. Specific properties (tiny frames, coiled, cooling) matter. Scores ≥7.0 with strong beat involvement and closure contribution; irreplaceability is high but cost tied directly to the strip itself is oblique.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Goodbye letters (core concept) are signaled early as Mara's incubating question and recur in the vision montage ("a woman folding a goodbye letter she never sent") and the final realization ("her goodbye letters did not feel like failures"). The concept shapes the dominant stake and reweights at closure. Early signal and closure participation solid; middle development is thematic rather than tactical (letters do not alter a mid-scene choice). Lyric reprise reweights meaning with undeniable pressure. Cost is felt opportunity rather than visible forfeiture.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Spatially imaginative" is declared early ("Mara was spatially imaginative by nature") and colors one perceptual filter ("she felt buildings as organs, rooms as thoughts"). It does not constrain or enable a choice with cost; the trait remains label-only. The psychometry reading could proceed identically without this attribute. Present but ornamental; no causal pressure or closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Incubate" appears three times: the question "incubated in her since childhood," she lets visions "incubate without forcing them," and "forgotten lyrics search for tune" (timeframe metaphor). The action colors Mara's approach (patient waiting) and provides thematic texture. It does not drive a major turn; the psychometry and realization would unfold with minimal edits if "incubate" were replaced by "wait" or "simmer." Functional early signal and closure participation via metaphor, but swappability is high and causal pressure low.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Psychometry reading is signaled by the projectionist ("you touch, it tells") and executed on the page: Mara touches the film strip, her awareness slips into it, visions arrive. The method enables the central revelation beat. Early signal, middle causal action, and the closure insight depends on it. Mechanics are legible; removing psychometry breaks the vision sequence. Two-beat involvement and causal pressure present; closure linkage strong. Cost tied to method itself is implicit rather than foregrounded.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The vintage movie palace projection booth is introduced in the opening line and supplies the film strips, projectors, and the booth-versus-screen projection detail that charges the closure. Setting enables the psychometry action and provides the metaphor infrastructure (deleted scenes, reels, cans). Early signal, middle development (film strip originates here), and closure participation (projector flickers on, images appear on booth wall). Specific environmental features (gilt, velvet, hot metal, projector as lighthouse) constrain the narrative's logic. Cost connection is oblique but setting integration is high.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The timeframe "while forgotten lyrics search for tune" appears once mid-story as a metaphor for perceptual rearrangement during the vision sequence. It colors tone but does not tighten decisions or create a live clock that alters tactics. Present as lyric texture; no setup, middle development, or closure participation. Ornamental use without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara's motivation "to find where unused love is stored" is established early ("She had come for one reason"), drives the climb to the booth and the conversation with the projectionist, and is answered at closure ("into the stories we pretend never happened"). The desire is dramatized through action (climbing, touching film, asking questions) and the answer reweights her goodbye letters. Early signal, middle pursuit, and closure payoff all present. Friction between want (to recover unsent love) and cost (accepting it as unfinished reels) is felt but not enacted in a decisive forfeiture on the page.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Hushed thunder" recurs three times: city hums "like hushed thunder," the booth air carries it, and the projected sound is "the low persistent rumble of everything people almost said, a language of hushed thunder." Tone is coherent and modulates from quiet dust to projected intensity. The phrase charges the final image by naming the sound of unsent feelings. Early signal, closure participation, and tonal consistency present. Swappability is moderate (another oxymoron could serve); causal pressure is atmospheric rather than tactical.</comment>
