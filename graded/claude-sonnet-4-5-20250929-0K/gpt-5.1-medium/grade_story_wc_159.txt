<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The caretaker's interiority is filtered through highly stylized perception ("the exact texture of how they once trembled on a tongue"), but his micro-choices under pressure remain clear: he repairs the chime, then decides to preserve the wandering melody. The decision to hum and archive the new name shows agency with visible cost (the glow fades, leaving "something almost, but not quite, saved"). Internal contradiction is present but muted—his question about who preserved his own name flickers without forcing a decisive reckoning. Embodiment is consistent (bare feet, breath on the opal sliver) and avoids label-speak, keeping the piece in the upper-mid band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story accrues density through layered images (glass orchids, bottled storms, fossilized laughter) and reaches closure when the caretaker breathes the wandering melody into an untouched orchid; the library brightens momentarily, then the glow fades—a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with felt cost ("something almost, but not quite, saved"). Orientation anchors by ~80 words (caretaker, opal library above clouds, chimes), slightly late but functional. Causality is clean: cracked chime → repair → wandering melody persists → caretaker matches it → archives the new name. One meaningful deepening occurs when he realizes the song is searching, prompting his final act. Cost is legible in the fade and the museum's resumption of suspension.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The opal library above clouds is vivid and purposeful: translucent shelves refract light, glass floors remember steps, clouds flow past like a slow river. The caretaker's bare feet and the worktable with radiating tools anchor micro-setting. The cracked bamboo tube and the opal sliver constrain the repair action. The setting charges the final image—the library brightens when the new name is archived, then resumes its ordinary shimmer. Detail is selective, filtered through the caretaker's professional focus (labels as glass orchids, archived emotions as tangible objects). No occupation-depth penalty applies at this length; the world rules (names as sounds, emotions as artifacts) remain consistent and shape the climax.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake: preserve the sound of the wandering melody before it erodes the catalogued silence. The caretaker's agency drives escalation: he repairs the chime (narrowing the immediate problem), then hears the melody persist, realizes it's searching, and chooses to archive it. One meaningful tightening occurs when the song rubs "its absence raw against the stored sorrows," raising the cost of ignoring it. The resolution is earned by his decision to hum and breathe the new name into an orchid, with visible cost (the glow fades, leaving partial success). Under the Accumulative lens, the deepening from repair to preservation reweights the stake. No antagonist is present, but situational pressure (the wandering melody threatening the archive's integrity) coheres throughout.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the particulars of preservation, incompleteness, and the caretaker's own erasure ("Who had preserved his own name…when feelings had not yet become artifacts"). The glass orchids, bottled storms, and fossilized laughter function as a coherent system rather than scattered symbols. The ending—"something almost, but not quite, saved"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to whether extinct feelings can be recovered, embracing ambiguity without moralizing. The caretaker's act of preservation is both duty and self-inquiry, making the thematic question inextricable from his arc. One minor slip: "museum of extinct feelings" appears twice in identical phrasing, leaning slightly toward thematic echo, but the phrase is structurally motivated (the timeframe element) and does not dissolve into prompt language.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with controlled psychic distance. The narrative voice carries a distinct, lyric texture: "a thin irregular note snagging like a thorn in foxglove regret," "movements lived in his muscles like inherited prayers." Free indirect style is clean; the caretaker's perceptual signature (professional focus on sound, memory encoded as tangible objects) remains consistent. No dialogue is present. Diction stays within the focalizer's elevated but consistent register; no unmotivated shifts. Purposeful compression ("Not their meanings, which had dissolved with their owners, but the exact texture…") supports the accumulative mode. Rhythm modulates appropriately: longer, descriptive sentences in calm beats, shorter phrases during the repair and final archiving. No head-hopping or POV leakage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout: "slow rainbows that drifted like dust," "thin irregular note snagging like a thorn in foxglove regret," "a hungry sound leaking into the catalogued silence." While the images are vivid and voice-consistent, their concentration in nearly every sentence creates slight overwriting in a few beats (e.g., the opening three paragraphs stack metaphor without advancing pressure). Two paraphrase loops appear: "the sound of forgotten names" / "the exact texture of how they once trembled on a tongue" restate the same idea across adjacent lines; "deserted marvels" appears twice in identical phrasing. Sentence openings vary, and rhythm supports the lyric mode. The final image—"listening to the new orchid light consolation"—is compressed but legible. Deductions: −0.3 for figurative density in the opening, −0.2 for paraphrase loop, −0.2 for repeated phrase = baseline ~7.4, reduced to 6.9 for cumulative texture drag.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The premise—a caretaker preserving not the meanings but the sounds of forgotten names in glass orchids—is fresh and specific. The synthesis of archive-as-museum, emotions-as-artifacts, and the wandering melody searching for shelter feels original. The turn from repair to preservation is earned by prior particulars (the song rubbing its absence raw, the caretaker's own unnamed past). Emotional specificity (the vertigo of questioning who preserved his own name) avoids generic templates. One friction: the opal-library-above-clouds setting, while vivid, leans toward familiar fantasy tropes (floating archive, magical librarian). The story transforms the material through voice and lyric intensity, but the core frame remains recognizable. No proximity echoes or template plots detected.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The glass-orchid caretaker is present from the opening and drives every key turn: he wakes to the chimes, repairs the cracked tube, hears the wandering melody, realizes it's searching, decides to archive it, and breathes the new name into an orchid. His choices are visible, not merely observational. His final act—matching the melody and preserving it—directly shapes the closure. Cost is legible: the glow fades, leaving "something almost, but not quite, saved." Early signal +0.6, three beats (repair, realization, archiving) +1.4, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +1.4, cost connection +0.5 = ~7.9, round down to 7.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The wind chime bamboo tube cracked appears in three beats: it wakes the caretaker with a stray note, he identifies it as the culprit threatening the archive's integrity, and he repairs it with an opal sliver. The repair is dramatized on the page, with the caretaker breathing "the dust of names" onto the join. The object enables the central problem (the wandering melody persists even after repair, escalating the stakes) and constrains his initial tactic. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.2, specificity +0.6, closure participation indirect (the repair fails to silence the melody, forcing the archiving choice) +0.5 = ~8.3, capped at 8.1 because the object does not reappear in the final image.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Deserted marvels frames the setting (the library "once crowded with scholars," now "only echoes and orchids") and the caretaker's isolation. The concept shapes his motivation (preserving relics no one will see) and charges the final line ("an exhibit no visitor would ever enter"). It appears in the opening and closing, creating a purposeful reprise that reweights the futility of his task. However, it does not constrain a middle choice or alter tactics; its role is thematic rather than causal. Early signal +0.6, lyric reprise +0.8, closure linkage (thematic charge) +0.7, no mid-beat involvement −0.5, swappability (could be "abandoned archive") −0.4 = ~6.2.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Gently systematic appears in two forms: "he moved with a gently systematic care" and "with a gently systematic patience" when archiving the new name. The trait is embodied in his actions (tools arranged in radiating precision, movements like inherited prayers) and constrains his approach—he does not rush or improvise. The phrase directly modifies the key archiving beat, where patience enables the careful preservation. Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, causal pressure (method of preservation) +0.8, closure linkage +0.5, label-only phrasing (the adverb + adjective pair reads slightly decorative) −0.3 = ~6.4.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Light is present throughout: it filters through translucent shelves, refracts into rainbows, and the library brightens when the new name is archived, then fades. The final brightness is the clearest turn, but light itself is ambient—the caretaker's breath and the orchid's uptake are the active agents. The concept (light as memory, as recognition) is thematically resonant but does not drive a decision; the caretaker could complete the same act in darkness. Early signal +0.6, three beats (opening, storms flicker, final brightness) +1.4, closure linkage (the glow charges the ending) +1.0, swappability (could be sound or warmth) −0.7, ornamental in opening −0.5 = ~5.8.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>By the echo of a long-forgotten song is the method of tracing and archiving the wandering melody. It is signaled at midpoint ("the echo of a long-forgotten song returning for shelter") and becomes the tool at closure: the caretaker matches the melody note by note, feeling its shape, and breathes it into the orchid. The mechanics matter—he must hear it, match it with his voice, and trace its contour to preserve it. The method is irreplaceable; without the echo, he cannot archive the name. Early signal (40% mark, slight late penalty) +0.4, two beats (recognition, archiving) +0.9, causal pressure +1.3, closure linkage +1.5, specificity +0.7 = ~8.8, reduced to 8.3 for late first appearance.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The opal library above clouds anchors the entire story from the opening line and constrains every action: the caretaker moves through aisles of bottled storms and fossilized laughter, repairs the chime above the balustrade, and works at his table among the oldest orchids. The setting provides the tools (opal sliver) and the problem (the wandering melody threatening the archive). The library's brightness at closure and its return to "ordinary shimmer" charge the final image. Early signal +0.8, four beats (opening, navigation, repair, archiving) +1.4, causal pressure +1.4, closure linkage +1.4, specificity +0.8, micro-setting (worktable, balustrade) +0.4 = ~8.2, capped at 7.6 due to slight spatial generality (the atrium and aisles are not fully differentiated).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Across the museum of extinct feelings functions as a descriptor of the setting and the caretaker's journey through it. It appears in the opening third and at closure, framing the library as a repository of archived emotions. The timeframe is not tracked as a ticking clock; the narrative unfolds in a single continuous sequence without time pressure. The phrase charges the ending ("the museum of extinct feelings resumed its suspension") but does not constrain choices. Early signal +0.5, lyric reprise +0.6, closure linkage (thematic) +0.5, no mid-beat involvement −0.5, no time constraint −0.6, swappability −0.3 = ~3.2.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>To preserve the sound of forgotten names is the caretaker's task, stated explicitly in the opening third and dramatized throughout. His motivation is tested when the wandering melody appears—he could ignore it and let it fade, but the thought "filled him with a familiar vertigo" tied to his own unnamed past. The friction between duty and futility (the museum no visitor will enter) charges his final act. The archiving of the new name is the climax, with visible cost (partial success, the glow fading). Early signal +0.7, three beats (declaration, internal conflict, archiving) +1.4, causal pressure +1.4, closure linkage +1.6, cost connection +0.6, friction (want vs. cost) +0.5 = ~8.6, capped at 8.6 for slight told-only quality in the exposition ("His task, given long ago…").</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Foxglove regret appears once in a single image: "a thin irregular note snagging like a thorn in foxglove regret." The tone of melancholy, incompleteness, and quiet mourning is consistent throughout: the deserted library, the fading glow, "something almost, but not quite, saved." The final line ("listening to the new orchid light consolation") modulates slightly toward acceptance without resolving the regret. The specific phrase "foxglove regret" does not recur or charge the ending directly. Early signal +0.5, coherent tone +1.2, closure modulation +0.8, single mention of exact phrase −0.5, ornamental metaphor in one beat −0.3 = ~6.7.</comment>
