<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Eren's motivation is clear and embodied through his counting absences and carrying the storm-bottle despite risk. His "respectfully rebellious" stance is shown through concrete gestures (bowing at checkpoints, accepting without questions) though the sister's grave feels like a late explanatory patch rather than earned causality. Mara's agency is thinner—she observes and explains but does not force a choice that costs her. The final exchange crystallizes options but stops short of a decision that forecloses a path with visible price on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece weaves absence-mapping, the storm-bottle delivery, and thematic imagery toward a Charged Poise closure where Mara holds the bottle and articulates the storm's promise while Eren voices the risk—options are crystallized and meaning reweighted without a decisive act. Orientation anchors (disputed territory, arcade, twilight mail drop) land early. The tightening is modest: Eren walks, delivers, they discuss; pressure accumulates through description and dialogue rather than a causal narrowing of options, which keeps this in the strong-but-not-exceptional band.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The cobalt arcade at twilight is vividly rendered (fluorescent hum, cracked glass roof, shuttered stalls) and the "brittle hush" permeates sensory choices. The bottle itself—cloudy glass, violet swirls, rattling cork—recurs with tactile specificity and charges the final image when Mara lifts it beside the dusty letters. Spatial choreography is clean (narrow corridor, counter, wall of envelopes). The smuggling-drone border and checkpoints shape access without becoming expo-dumps, and the arcade's failing lights create the trade window that makes the scene possible.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether to uncork the storm and let broken promises fall—is signaled early and unified across beats. Pressure accumulates through layered imagery (linked absences, the bottle's charge, Mara's wall of unclaimed letters) rather than a causal reversal that narrows options. Eren's agency is delivery and assent; Mara voices the thematic calculus but does not act, leaving the ending poised rather than paid. One meaningful deepening occurs when Mara explains the storm's mechanics and names the risk, but the cost remains prospective and the choice unmade on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme—healing through remembered absence and the risk of storms—emerges organically from the bottle, the letter-wall, and Eren's mapping practice without overt thesis statements. The final exchange between Eren and Mara offers a resonant, non-literal answer: "maybe that is what we need" reweights prior material (broken promises, bullet-holed ceiling) with felt moral stakes. The line "storms remember... made by linked absences" performs thematic work through concrete image rather than abstraction. No late moralizing; the ending withholds resolution but charges the question with undeniable pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited focalization through Eren is stable; perceptual signature is consistent (counting absences, gauging checkpoints, metaphoric linking). Diction is elevated and lyric throughout, which suits the accumulative mode but occasionally edges toward over-poetry ("weather of suspicion," "ink washing from a wound"). Dialogue between Eren and Mara carries subtext and distinct idiom—Mara's phrasing is more incantatory, Eren's more grounded—though both speak at a similar register of careful metaphor. No head-hopping; voice modulates appropriately under pressure in the final exchange.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout: "bruised cobalt," "weather of suspicion," "ink washing from a wound," "lightning licked the inside curve." Several metaphors are vivid but some ("smuggling drone border" as metaphor vs. literal tech, "thunderstorm in a bottle" as both object and symbol) blur vehicle-tenor boundaries without clear pattern-teaching. Minor loops: "missing" appears thrice in close succession; "silence" and "absence" echo frequently. The storm-bottle's mechanics are shown (tilted, clouds swirl, cork rattles) but late exposition ("storms remember... linked absences") partially re-narrates what the image already suggested. Information density is strong; no major template artifacts, but the prose could tighten in the middle third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The premise—mailman smuggling a bottled storm across a divided city to heal via "linked absences"—is specific and non-obvious, blending magical realism with conflict-zone particulars (drones, checkpoints, unmarked graves). The "linking absences" method and "respectfully rebellious" trait transform familiarMailCarrier-in-WarZone tropes through concrete detail (empty chairs in letters, dust on packages, the arcade trade window). Risk-taking is evident in the lyric mode and unresolved ending, though the storm-bottle mechanism feels slightly ornamental—its properties are described more than tested. The emotional truth of families split by "paint on maps" anchors universals in sharp specifics.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Eren (disputed territory mailman) appears throughout, drives the delivery plot, and makes the choice to accept and carry the storm-bottle despite risk. His counting of absences and careful checkpoint manner are shown in multiple beats. At closure he voices the storm's danger, participating in the thematic calculus. However, his agency is mostly assent and observation; the key choice (uncork or not) is posed to Mara and left unmade, limiting his closure-driving role.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The thunderstorm in a bottle is introduced early (bottom of bag, wrapped in homework), handled in the handoff beat (cork rattles, Mara touches glass and pulls back), and returns at closure where Mara lifts it beside the letter-wall and articulates its promise. Its cloudy glass, violet swirls, and tiny lightning are shown concretely. The bottle's mechanics (captured storm, linked absences) shape the thematic question and charge the final image. Scores high for beat involvement, closure linkage, and irreplaceability—removing it would collapse the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Smuggling drone border is named early and shapes the world (drones trace loops, software-guarded crossings) and tactics (Eren takes the long route, arcade trade happens under failing lights the cameras ignore). It constrains the mail-drop window and makes hand-to-hand necessary. Present in setup and development but does not return at closure; the final beat focuses on the bottle and letters, not the border. Functional but replaceable with another surveillance constraint.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Respectfully rebellious" is named once and shown through Eren's bowing at checkpoints, nodding at rifles, and careful gaze—traits that enable his passage. The attribute shapes his method (polite defiance) but does not constrain a peak choice with visible cost. It colors his character throughout but remains more descriptor than dramatic pivot. Present in setup, developed in manner, absent from closure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Foster" appears in Eren's goal ("foster a fragile sense of shared time") and his search ("to find where broken promises heal"). The action of fostering—delivering letters, mapping absences—shapes his method and motive across beats. At closure Mara's proposal to uncork the storm is a fostering act (letting promises fall and heal). The action threads through but is somewhat abstract; more concrete fostering beats (a specific reconnection, a visible continuity) would raise the score.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"By linking absences" is named explicitly ("What Eren really delivered was not envelopes but continuities... by linking absences") and demonstrated through his counting missing people, his memory-map of gaps, and the storm's mechanics ("made by linked absences... every drop of water missing"). The method appears in setup, shapes his motive, and returns at closure when Mara explains the storm's logic. Present across beats; its mechanics matter to the thematic question. Could score higher if the linking produced a visible on-page reconnection rather than remaining conceptual.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Cobalt arcade at twilight is anchored early (bruised cobalt sky, fluorescent tubes, reflections on floor, shuttered stalls) and sustained through sensory detail (brittle hush, cracked glass roof, failing lights). The arcade's function as neutral trade space under the drones' inattention creates the delivery window and constrains the scene. At closure the "bullet hole in this ceiling" becomes a tactical concern (storm might slip through). The micro-setting charges the final image and shapes the characters' tactical calculus.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Day's lone mail drop" is established early as the single agreed-upon window when letters pass without gunfire, creating temporal pressure. Eren's lateness and Mara's comment ("You are late") signal the narrowing window. The timeframe tightens decisions (had to take the long way, drones anxious) but does not live as a visible countdown at closure. Present in setup and development; functional but not foregrounded in the ending.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Motivation "to find where broken promises heal" is stated explicitly and tied to Eren's sister's unmarked grave, shaping his reason for walking the route each evening. It drives his acceptance of the bottle and his choice to deliver despite risk. At closure the motivation is tested when Mara proposes uncorking the storm to let broken promises fall—the thematic question crystallizes around whether healing is possible. Desire is shown through action (delivery, memory-mapping) but the final choice is left unmade, limiting closure impact.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Brittle hush" is named early and sustained through sensory choices (sound decided to stay neutral, failing lights, thin voice "like smoke"). Tone modulates appropriately: the middle passage is measured and lyric, the final exchange tightens with quiet urgency ("every word sounding like it was stepping lightly over broken glass"). At closure the tone charges the image (Mara's eyes fixed on the trembling cork, the unspoken risk). Coherent through turns; the hush reweights the storm's latent violence without breaking into noise.</comment>
