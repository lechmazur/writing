<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Eli's interiority is distinctive and embodied through concrete ritual (nautilus alignment, glass-writing), avoiding stock phrasing. His chronological homesickness drives choices—writing fortunes to "conduct" coincidences—but the final act (raising an invisible baton) lacks visible cost or consequence that forecloses a path. Internal contradiction is present (ache sharpening into longing) yet the ending gesture reads as wish fulfillment without dramatized trade-off. Micro-choices throughout (aligning shell, labeling time) are purposeful but don't compound into a peaked decision with felt price on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece anchors who/where/when early and sustains one continuous scene in the glass spire. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density builds through layered imagery (nautilus, mirrored horizon, timeline mapping) and the final baton-lift attempts a cadence shift. However, closure as Charged Poise is undercut—the "waiting for the unheard symphony to rise" lacks legible cost or foreclosed option; it's an aspirational tableau rather than a reconfiguration with pressure. The Cost Proof Test fails: no exact sentence shows what Eli sacrifices or risks in that final beat, only hopeful posture.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The glass spire, frozen lake, and mirrored horizon are vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (nautilus pressed to glass, ice absorbing whisper of color). The nautilus shell segment functions as micro-setting—handled in multiple beats, used to align thought and horizon—and constrains Eli's method. The mirrored horizon charges the final image, though its impact on choice is indirect. Spatial choreography is clean; the setting's reflection-doubling motif threads through perception and stakes, meeting the 9+ gate by constraining ritual and charging closure even if the choice itself is soft.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>One dominant stake is clear: Eli seeks to "conduct unheard symphonies" by writing the right fortune at the right hour. Pressure is steady rather than escalating; the "deadlines stacked high" constraint is declared but never tested with visible friction or narrowing options. The tightening from "soft slippage between times" to "cleaner, narrower longing" is a textural deepening under the Accumulative lens, but the final baton-raise doesn't dramatize agency or cost—it's anticipation without consequence. The piece needed one moment where writing or not-writing forecloses a live path; instead, the ending is poise without price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme—time, control, and the desire to impose order through language—emerges from concrete particulars (nautilus chambers, timeline mapping, fortune-cookie craft) without overt moralizing. The final image of the raised baton offers a resonant, non-literal answer to Eli's quest, reweighting his isolation and the city's indifference into potential symphony. Subtext operates in the mother's voice ("horizons were not lines but questions"), and the "DO NOT WASTE" label self-addresses without spelling out the existential ache. Minor slip: "upturned hush" recurs as both tone marker and thematic echo, occasionally bordering on self-conscious refrain rather than organic pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization is stable; Eli's perceptual signature—mapping time spatially, using objects as rulers for thought—is distinct and voice-motivated. Diction is controlled and poetic ("chronologically homesick," "upturned hush") yet consistently within the reflective register. Minor register drift: phrases like "mapping childhood memories, he could fold yesterday against tomorrow until they clicked like teeth in a zipper" edge toward explanatory clarity at the expense of Eli's lived syntax under pressure. No dialogue present. Psychic distance is close-third, with metaphor density high but legible; the piece teaches its lyric compression early and sustains it, meeting experimental tolerance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings and lengths modulate with Eli's focus. Information density is high—most lines do two jobs (image + interiority, motif + stakes). However, figurative language appears in nearly every sentence of the final third without clear pattern-payoff, risking overwriting (Density Check: −0.4). "Upturned hush" recurs four times, once as thematic anchor but thrice as filler that could be cut without loss (paraphrase-loop: −0.2). No template cadence or filter-verb stacks. Clarity holds; the nautilus and mirrored-horizon images are coherent. Propulsion is steady but the closure beat ("waited for the unheard symphony…to rise") loops the opening's passivity rather than advancing to visible act.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of fortune-cookie writer, temporal mapping, and symphonic conductor ambition is specific and non-obvious, avoiding template plots. The glass-spire-by-frozen-lake setting and chronological homesickness are memorable particulars. Risk-taking in lyric compression and metaphor density (nautilus as thought-ruler, mirrored horizon as climb-able sky) heightens atmosphere without obscuring core stakes. Minor derivative note: the artist-in-isolation-seeking-cosmic-connection frame echoes a familiar literary template, though Eli's occupation and the nautilus-shell method add transformative specificity. The ending's baton-raise feels inevitable in hindsight yet stops short of bold closure, settling for poetic anticipation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Eli (cryptic fortune cookie writer) is on-page throughout, his occupation directly shaping stakes (writing the right fortune to conduct coincidences). He makes on-page choices: pressing the nautilus to glass, drawing the vertical line, labeling "DO NOT WASTE," writing the shortest fortune yet. These micro-choices steer his ritual and compress time tactically. However, the final baton-raise is aspiration without consequence—no decision alters tactics or forecloses a path with visible cost. Two gates clear (setup, development); closure participation is gestural. Causal pressure is present but mild; the ending waits rather than acts. Mid-band: essential across beats but stops short of indispensable turn.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The nautilus shell segment appears in four distinct beats: on his desk as a "ruler for thoughts," aligned with the mirrored horizon to tunnel reflection, used to align finished fortune edges, and recalled in the chambers-as-climb metaphor. It enables Eli's spatial-temporal method (sliding fingers along curves when sentences refuse to open) and constrains his ritual (alignment with horizon tutors his final image). Present by paragraph five, it shapes middle tactics and charges the closure by embodying incremental patience. Specificity high: the "pale chambers stepping outward in precise, impossible patience" cannot swap for a generic tool. Cost connection indirect but legible. Strong development + closure linkage elevate into 7–8 band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The mirrored horizon (core concept) is signaled early (paragraph seven) and recurs across beats: Eli aligns the nautilus with it, draws a vertical line from its reflection to the real sky, and waits as it "began to pale" at dawn. It shapes his perception (slippage between times, dissolution of far shore) and primes the final image where "morning" rises. However, it does not narrow on-page options or force a choice with cost—it remains a thematic and atmospheric anchor rather than a tactical constraint. Lyric-resonance allowance applies: early seed → final reprise reweights temporal stakes. Two gates (setup, closure participation); middle development is observational. Mid-band: purposeful but not indispensable to plot logic.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Chronologically homesick" is introduced paragraph nine, labeled and elaborated (restless for moments gone/never arrived, aching for futures remembered). It motivates his fortune-writing ("the only place he could arrange time into something obedient") but does not constrain an on-page action with visible cost. The attribute is told rather than enacted in a micro-choice; it colors interiority without altering tactics. Late first mention (second third) triggers −0.3; label-only use without dramatized trade-off adds −0.5. One gate clear (development as motive-context); no setup signal, no closure action tied to it. Functional context-provider, swappable with "temporal nostalgia" or similar near-synonym.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dawn (action/timeframe anchor) is seeded in the title line ("The night before dawn") and paragraph two, explicitly named in paragraph twenty-five ("where morning would first show"), and arrives on-page in the final beats ("mirrored horizon began to pale… sun still hidden"). It defines the story's temporal boundary and tightens the urgency ("promised himself he would finish before exhaustion hits"). The final vertical line "ending at the point… where morning would first show" and the closure image "waited for the unheard symphony of morning to rise" tie the action directly to closure. Dawn is not swappable—it embodies the threshold Eli races toward. Three gates clear; causal pressure moderate (time constraint shapes ritual pacing); closure linkage strong.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"By mapping childhood memories" (method) is introduced paragraph twelve: "by mapping childhood memories, he could fold yesterday against tomorrow until they clicked like teeth in a zipper." He draws timelines on glass starting from "the small house where he grew up" toward future towers. The method is signaled and its mechanics matter—timeline intersections yield fortunes—but it does not constrain a choice or evolve under pressure. One distinct beat (paragraph twelve exposition); the final fortune-writing does not revisit or test this method on the page. Setup clear; middle and closure absent. Present by second third but remains expository rather than enacted. Functional but replaceable: he could map anything temporal. Mid-band capped by lack of development and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The glass spire by a frozen lake is anchored in the opening line and sustained throughout: glass walls allow drawing with erasable ink (timelines), the frozen lake holds the mirrored horizon Eli aligns with his nautilus, and the setting's transparency and reflection enable his spatial-temporal method. It provides concrete resources (glass as canvas, lake as mirror) that affect ritual and perception. The spire's isolation charges his solitary conductor ambition. Micro-setting (the desk, the glass walls) constrains multiple choices (where he writes, what he sees). Three gates clear; specificity high (glass + frozen lake cannot swap for generic office). Causal and atmospheric pressure both strong; essential across beats and ending.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Before exhaustion hits" (timeframe) is declared in paragraph eighteen ("promised himself he would finish before exhaustion hits") and echoed in the final line ("Before exhaustion hits, he opened them again…"). It names the deadline but does not visibly tighten decisions or alter tactics on the page—Eli's ritual proceeds at reflective pace without urgency spikes or trade-offs driven by fatigue. The phrase brackets the scene temporally yet remains abstract; we never see exhaustion encroaching or forcing a choice. Setup present; development and closure are label-only. Late signal (second third) and summary-only use trigger −0.5 cumulative. Functional frame but swappable with any vague time constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"To become the conductor of unheard symphonies" (motivation) is introduced paragraph fifteen and elaborated: not sound-symphonies but coincidences, strangers glancing up, shared rhythms. It drives his fortune-writing (paragraph seventeen: "If he wrote the right sentence at the right hour… the city would play its silent music through him") and is embodied in the final baton-raise. The desire is dramatized through his ritual and the fortune he writes ("listen"). However, friction between want and cost is light—no visible sacrifice or renunciation tests the ambition. Three gates clear (setup, development, closure); causal linkage moderate. The motivation shapes stakes but the ending gesture is anticipation without price, capping the score below 7.0 per cost-connection guidance.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Upturned hush" (tone) is named four times: paragraph four ("wrote in an upturned hush"), paragraph twenty-nine ("the upturned hush of recognition"), paragraph thirty-one ("ache… sharpened into… longing, like the point of a conductor's baton"), and the final line ("waited for the unheard symphony… to rise in a long, slow, upturned hush"). The tone is coherent—quiet, anticipatory, reverent—and modulates slightly (from writing ritual to imagined reader recognition to final waiting). It charges the closure image by naming the quality of the ending silence. However, recurrence edges toward self-conscious refrain; at peak beats the phrase is inserted rather than enacted through rhythm alone. Three gates clear; atmospheric rather than causal. Purposeful and consistent but not indispensable—remove the phrase and tone still reads hushed.</comment>
