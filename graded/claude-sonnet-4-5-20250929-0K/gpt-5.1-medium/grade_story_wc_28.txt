<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Laleh's motivation—empathy without choosing sides—is clear and distinctive, her steel arms a concrete embodiment of that stance. The final choice to open her arms to the city is earned by the naming ritual and tessera sequence. However, interiority relies heavily on abstract philosophical framing ("retrocognitively trapped," "aberrant mercy") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The piece asserts her radical gentleness more than it dramatizes internal conflict between competing impulses in real time.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—layered time-vision fragments build toward the naming ritual and final opening gesture. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly within the first paragraph. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Laleh's arms-opening gesture reweights the plaza's meaning from "grave" to "cradle" with conceptual cost (renaming under collective witness). One notable weakness: the tessera's sudden "blazing" and the city's atmospheric shift feel coincidental rather than causally linked to Laleh's precise words, slightly weakening closure necessity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The shattered sky, charred pillar, and mosaic stepping stone all constrain Laleh's ritual choices with concrete spatial logic. The tessera's heat and the stepping stone's alignment guide her actions, charging the final image. Sensory detail is vivid and selective (iron-and-rain smell, fractured sunlight, "warm coldness" of steel). Minor slip: the "colorless light" in the penultimate beat abstracts the climactic sensory moment when specificity would heighten pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—freeing the city from retrocognitive trauma—signals early and tightens through the tessera insertion and naming sequence. One clear escalation: pressing the tessera into the pillar floods Laleh with causally linked visions that inform her renaming act. The final gesture (opening her arms) crystallizes her stance with felt cost (public vulnerability, risk of rejection). Weakness: the city's collective "stepping into" her hold feels slightly soft as a closure price; we see others emerge but not a concrete trade-off Laleh must endure on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—empathy as renaming trauma rather than rationing mercy—emerges through particulars: the tessera, the pillar's soot scars, the mosaic stepping stone. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: the city "stepped carefully into their gentler hold" reweights prior material without moralizing. Minor overreach: "aberrant mercy" and "gentle radical" are label-heavy in early paragraphs, occasionally replacing scene pressure with thematic assertion. The final image rescues this by grounding the concept in gesture and collective response.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and voice-distinct: syntax mirrors Laleh's deliberate, layered perception ("Each chip echoed a lost word, each crack a pause in a song"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully when tessera visions flood backward. Weakness: elevated diction in peak beats ("retrocognitively," "tessera," "syllable in a language of light") drifts outside a character-internal lexicon, reading slightly authorial. No dialogue present; perceptual signature is consistent but occasionally more poetic than embodied under stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose is rhythmically controlled and often does double duty (e.g., "steel arms…catching fractured sunlight" ties setting to theme). However, line-level artifacts cluster in mid-story: paraphrase loops ("the fire had been a teacher, not a tyrant" / "she named the sky fractured, not shattered") and template cadence ("She saw…She saw…She saw") across three consecutive beats in the tessera vision sequence. Stock metaphor "mosaics burning blue and gold" and the phrase "warm coldness" (repeated twice) slightly dull specificity. Final image is clean, but mid-story scaffold reduces density and momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of post-trauma setting, retrocognitive time fracture, and empathy-as-renaming feels specific and non-obvious. The tessera-as-anchor and mosaic stepping stone mechanics transform familiar "naming has power" tropes through concrete ritual choreography. Risk-taking in the warm/cold paradox and arms-of-steel empathy registers as purposeful. Minor limitation: the "gentle radical" frame and the city's collective emergence at the end echo familiar redemptive-outsider templates without a sharp counter-pressure or complication that would make the resolution feel inevitable in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Laleh is present throughout and her choices (pressing the tessera, aligning on the stone, naming, opening her arms) create all major turns. Her "gentle radical" stance shapes tactics (refusing to choose sides, offering indiscriminate mercy). Setup early, causal pressure across multiple beats, closure participation strong. Slight swappability: another compassionate figure with different scars could execute similar moves without breaking story logic.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The tessera appears in paragraph four (pocket mention), pressed into the pillar at the ritual's start (enabling the vision flood), and "blazed" at closure. Three distinct beats; causal pressure high (it hooks Laleh into the past and frames her renaming). Closure linkage strong (the light it emits signals the transformation). Irreplaceability solid: its mosaic origin and prayer-memory are specific to the minaret and the city's lost language.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Aberrant mercy" is named explicitly (paragraph fourteen) and the concept underpins Laleh's refusal to ration kindness or choose sides. It reappears in the penultimate paragraph as the city "felt her aberrant mercy washing over them." However, the concept functions more as thematic labeling than as a constraint that alters on-page tactics; Laleh's actions would read coherently if the phrase were removed. Mid-band: present and thematically consistent, but not mechanically indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Retrocognitively trapped" is introduced (paragraph seven) and immediately operationalized: every step splits Laleh's vision into layered times. The tessera insertion triggers the backward flood (causal pressure). The trait enables the entire naming ritual and closure. Setup early, beat involvement across vision sequence and ritual, closure participation clear. Slight label-heaviness: the term itself reads more conceptual than viscerally embodied, but the mechanics (stepping stone, tessera vision) ground it enough to drive action with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Renaming drives the climax: Laleh renames the fire, sky, plaza, and herself in a sustained beat that crystallizes her stance and triggers the city's atmospheric shift. Early signal (paragraph eighteen: "Before the fire, the pillar had been used to rename the conquered"). Causal pressure high (the act directly follows tessera vision and stepping-stone alignment). Closure linkage strong (the light fades after her words, the city emerges). Removing "rename" would require fundamental rewrite of ritual and stakes.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The mosaic stepping stone is introduced (paragraph nine) as the tool Laleh uses to "read overlapping times" and reappears (paragraph twenty-six) when she aligns her heels with its "chipped constellations" to guide her renaming intention. Two distinct beats; causal mechanics clear (each chip/crack corresponds to a word/pause). Closure participation solid (she backs onto it to weave the naming). Setup slightly delayed (paragraph nine, ~30% mark) but the method's specificity and irreplaceability elevate integration.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The plaza is present from the opening line and anchors all action: its cracked stones, charred pillar, and mosaic stepping stone supply the physical infrastructure for the ritual. The setting constrains Laleh's moves (she must approach the pillar, align on the stone) and its transformation (air loses metallic tension) signals closure success. Three beats minimum (opening walk, pillar interaction, final emergence). The shattered sky adds atmospheric pressure. Essential across beats and ending.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"After the great fire" is established in the opening paragraphs and frames the entire scenario: the city's ruined state, Laleh's steel arms (guild replacement post-fire), the retrocognitive trap. The timeframe is static rather than ticking; no live clock alters tactics. However, the temporal distance from the fire shapes the city's emotional paralysis and Laleh's corrective ritual. Present in setup, implied throughout, closure participation indirect (the naming attempts to release the city from that frozen moment). Functional but not mechanically tightening.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Laleh's desire to "cradle empathy in arms of steel that would never again burn" is stated explicitly (paragraph twelve) and dramatized in her final gesture (opening her arms to the broken city). The motivation is coherent and shapes her stance throughout. Weakness: the want is asserted more than conflicted on the page; we do not see competing impulses or a cost she must pay to enact it beyond public vulnerability. Setup clear, closure participation strong, but friction between want and obstacle is soft (the city's distrust is mentioned but not tested in a scene beat).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Warm coldness" is named twice (paragraphs thirteen and thirty-three, framing and closure) to describe Laleh's steel arms and is enacted throughout: her gentle stance in a hard medium, empathy delivered through metal, the paradox of mercy that feels both distant and intimate. Tone modulates subtly (philosophical gravity early, sensory intensity during vision flood, quiet release at closure) and charges the final image ("steel arms glinting with that warm coldness"). Coherent through turns, purposeful reprise, strong closure linkage.</comment>
