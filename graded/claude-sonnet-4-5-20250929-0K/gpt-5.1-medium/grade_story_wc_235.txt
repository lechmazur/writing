<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's interiority is distinctive—"jealous of past selves" and "fog with teeth" fear create embodied contradictions. The closing renunciation ("the only honest tone left") emerges from prior pressure: repeated encounters with graves, each showing different causes. Minor slip: the "feral nostalgia" beat where the double appears feels slightly under-dramatized; the reaction ("ran, naturally") sidesteps the full weight of meeting one's future self. The choice to "walk straight into" timelines at the end is motivated but the cost (what is foreclosed by accepting "jaded wonder") could be sharper on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors early (ranger cabin, top bunk, mountain setting, therapist reference). The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): the narrator accepts "jaded wonder" as the only honest stance, foreclosing belief in cleaner narratives. Cost is conceptual and felt: he remains "alone in a thin-aired present, tasked to distill chaos." One tightening occurs when he realizes "my future selves were stalking my memories," narrowing his options to active engagement. The hovering-above-graves beat reweights all prior scroll work. Slight deduction: the infirmary concussion is told rather than shown, creating a minor causal gap between the ridge encounter and waking with scrolls.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The cabin's "frozen lightning" beams, thin air "like an accusation," and cemetery as "scatter of pale teeth" anchor setting in the narrator's perceptual signature. The mountain altitude functions as micro-setting, constraining perception ("so thin it feels like an accusation") and enabling the lucid-dream soar. The scrolls' "sharp green smell of sap" and "resin on my fingers" ground tactile detail. The graveyard's glowing crosses function as a spatial constraint at closure, positioning the narrator "between graves and roofline" to crystallize his stance. Economy is strong: every setting detail either primes the soar or charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: distilling chaos into coherent narrative while haunted by multiple death-timelines. One meaningful tightening: the realization that future selves are "stalking my memories" forces the walk into timelines. The soar-above-graves beat narrows options—he cannot avoid the crosses, only hover between them. Cost is legible: accepting "jaded wonder" forecloses belief in "cleaner stories." Minor deduction: the initial grave-ridge encounter ends with a run and concussion; that beat could pressure the choice more directly rather than resetting via infirmary summary. The escalation under Accumulative lens is sufficient but not exceptional.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme—fragmented identity across timelines and the cost of chronicling chaos—emerges from the scrolls ("written in my handwriting, but by someone I used to be"), the jealousy of past selves, and the final acceptance of "jaded wonder." The closing image ("hover between graves and roofline... the weary awe of a narrator who has spoiled every ending") offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. "Feral nostalgia" charges the double's gaze. Slight deduction: "to distill chaos into narrative" is articulated on the page in near-prompt language ("my job... the unofficial archivist"), risking thematic echo; the phrase appears again at the end, but the "jaded wonder" framing rescues it from sermon.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is vivid and consistent: "ceiling beams looked like frozen lightning," "resin on my fingers," "fog with teeth," "pack of stray dogs." The narrator's self-aware but not diagnostic voice ("Chronologically confused is what the therapist... calls it") threads irony without therapy-speak. Psychic distance modulates purposefully: close during the grave encounter, pulling back to cosmic overview during the soar. No head-hopping; focalization is controlled. Rhythm tightens under pressure ("I ran, naturally, tripped on a root") and expands in reflection. Free indirect style is clean. Minor slip: "the method that keeps me awake" is slightly opaque—does "method" mean the jealousy itself or the act of rereading scrolls? Context clarifies but the line hesitates.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Information density is high: "the sharp green smell of sap in my throat, and the scrolls waiting" does triple work (sensory anchor, object presence, ritual implication). Figurative language is controlled and voice-specific: "frozen lightning," "fog with teeth," "pack of stray dogs," "dark comb on the mountain's scalp." No paraphrase loops. Rhythm varies: short during action ("I ran, naturally"), expansive during reflection. Minor deduction: "Getting jealous of past selves is not listed in the clinical literature, yet it is the method that keeps me awake at night" uses "yet it is" as filler; trimming to "yet keeps me awake" would tighten. One template stem: "I call it..." / "Out here they call it..." / "Chronologically confused is what the therapist... calls it"—three call-it constructions cluster early, creating mild cadence artifact (−0.3).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of lucid dreaming, timeline fragmentation, and archival duty through birch-bark scrolls is specific and non-obvious. "Feral nostalgia" as the double's affect is a fresh inflection. The narrator's jealousy of past selves who "believed time moved like a river" personalizes the time-confusion premise. The ending's "jaded wonder" stance—"the weary awe of a narrator who has spoiled every ending and still cannot look away"—feels inevitable in hindsight and avoids the explain-everything trap. Risk-taking in the rapid tense shifts (present cabin, past ridge, lucid soar) and metaphoric density heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The piece commits fully to its premise and follows implications to a resonant close.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Setup: present throughout. Development: the chronicler role shapes the scrolls, the jealousy, and the decision to "walk straight into" timelines. Payoff: the final stance ("jaded wonder... the only honest tone left") crystallizes the job's cost. The role constrains choices (he cannot stop chronicling; he must engage timelines) and enables tactics (rereading scrolls, soaring). Two beats: jealousy of past selves, walk into timelines. Closure linkage strong. Causal pressure evident. Cost visible: he remains alone, tasked to stitch chaos. Slightly swappable with "timeline archivist" but the lucid-dream mechanic tightens fit.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Setup: scrolls introduced early ("narrow curls of birch bark... peeled from trees that never grew"). Development: he wakes with them, rereads old ones to envy past selves. Payoff: tonight's scroll is blank, cueing the walk. Two beats: waking with scrolls, rereading old ones. Mild causal pressure: the blank scroll signals the need to act. Closure participation is oblique—scrolls frame the problem but the soar and hovering over graves carry the closure image. Cost tied to scrolls is conceptual (they document his fragmentation) but not directly enacted in the ending. Specificity high (birch, resin, sap). Swappable with "parchment" or "journal" at mid-strength; the birch-bark and impossible-tree origin lift it.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Setup: introduced via the double ("an expression of feral nostalgia"). Development: the concept colors the narrator's jealousy of past selves and the graves' pull. Payoff: implicit in the closing stance—jaded wonder is the evolved form of feral nostalgia, nostalgia turned weary. One beat where it directly shapes action: the double's appearance. Causal pressure weak; the phrase labels an affect but does not constrain choices. Closure linkage is thematic rather than tactical. Lyric resonance: the concept seeds early and reweights the ending, but the middle does not develop it through dramatized choice. Mid-band: functional across the arc but not indispensable to plot logic.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Setup: "Chronologically confused is what the therapist in town calls it" anchors early. Development: the attribute enables the scrolls, the multiple-grave timelines, and the jealousy of past selves who "believed time moved like a river." Payoff: the narrator's acceptance of jaded wonder is a response to chronic confusion—he cannot fix it, only endure it. Two beats: the therapist line and the realization that future selves stalk memories. Causal pressure: the confusion drives the need to chronicle and walk into timelines. Cost: he remains trapped in fragmented time. Slightly label-heavy but the trait visibly alters tactics (rereading scrolls, soaring to see all graves at once).</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Setup: the lucid-dream "trick" is signaled early (job description, altitude). Development: "I stretch my hand up in the practiced way... gravity loosens its fingers, and I begin to soar." Payoff: soaring positions him "between graves and roofline," the exact spatial and emotional stance for the closure image. Two beats: the practiced trick, the hover. Causal pressure strong: soaring is the only way to see all graves at once and crystallize the final stance. Cost visible: the soar exposes the multiplicity of deaths and forecloses simpler narratives. Irreplaceable: the story's logic (lucid chronicler, altitude, graves) requires this action. Essential to ending.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Setup: "Getting jealous of past selves is not listed in the clinical literature, yet it is the method that keeps me awake at night." Development: "I reread old scrolls and envy the version of me who once believed time moved like a river." Payoff: the jealousy fuels the walk into timelines and the final acceptance that past selves had "cleaner stories." Two beats: the rereading jealousy, the graves-envy ("aimed not at the deaths but at the cleaner stories"). Causal pressure moderate: jealousy motivates engagement but does not constrain options mechanically. Closure linkage thematic. Cost felt: the jealousy isolates him. Swappable with "resenting" or "mourning" at moderate edit cost; the exact word "jealous" sharpens the self-competition but is not structurally indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Setup: "mountain ranger cabin... top bunk... kerosene lamp" anchor early. Development: the cabin's silence and wind pressure the memory; "the only way to stop the timelines from breeding is to walk straight into them" uses the cabin as departure point. Payoff: the soar moves outside, but the cabin frames the before-state. One beat where setting constrains: the thin air and altitude enable the lucid soar. Closure participation indirect—the cemetery, not the cabin, charges the final image. Micro-setting (thin air, altitude) does constrain the soar. Swappable with "isolated outpost" at moderate cost; "mountain" and "altitude" are essential, "ranger cabin" less so.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Setup: "The first time I woke up after seeing my own grave" anchors the timeframe immediately. Development: the grave memory recurs "in full color," driving the walk into timelines. Payoff: hovering above graves, he sees "Each grave shows a different age, a different cause," all post-grave-sighting iterations. Two beats: initial grave sighting, tonight's recurrence. Causal pressure strong: seeing the grave triggers the scroll work, the jealousy, and the final stance. Cost visible: the sighting fragments his sense of linear time and forecloses belief in sequence. The timeframe is not a ticking clock but a causal anchor that shapes all subsequent choices. Essential to the premise.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Setup: "I am the lucid dream chronicler... the unofficial archivist... to distill chaos into narrative." Development: the desire to "stitch all their unfinished sentences into something like a plot" drives the scroll work and the jealousy. Payoff: "I am here alone... tasked to distill chaos into narrative" resurfaces at the ending, where the narrator accepts jaded wonder as the only honest result. Two beats: job description, final task acknowledgment. Causal pressure moderate: the desire motivates rereading and engagement but does not mechanically constrain the soar. Closure linkage strong: the motivation frames the final stance. Cost visible: the task isolates him and forecloses cleaner stories. Slight prompt-echo in phrasing but contextualized by "jaded wonder."</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setup: "jaded wonder" named explicitly in the final paragraph but seeded throughout via "fog with teeth," "feral nostalgia," "the sharp green smell," and "the only way to stop the timelines from breeding is to walk straight into them." Development: tone modulates from crisp description ("frozen lightning") to weary reflection ("I reread old scrolls and envy") to cosmic irony ("the weary awe of a narrator who has spoiled every ending"). Payoff: "jaded wonder is the only honest tone left to me" crystallizes the stance and charges the final image. Tone is coherent through turns and tightens under pressure. The ending's "weary awe" is the exact synthesis of jaded and wonder. Indispensable: the story's emotional arc and closure depend on this tonal stance.</comment>
