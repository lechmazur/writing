<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Iren's interiority is concrete and embodied throughout ("serene anger settle in his pale chest, heavy as cooled glass"), with his motivation—understanding the Crisis Slow—rooted in trauma (mother under falling rock) that drives present action. The tension between his empirical tracker's stance and the elders' divine mercy framework creates genuine internal conflict. Minor weakness: the final choice to "let his sense of self loosen" arrives quickly after the ink demonstration without a fully dramatized internal struggle at that pivot, though prior causality supports it.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors cleanly (who/where/when by opening lines). The piece follows a causal through-line: eclipse ends → Iren observes Kesh's disturbance → elders summon him → ink demonstration reveals skipped frames → Iren commits to learning disappearance. The closure is Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: Iren places fingertips on ink and loosens self, crystallizing his commitment with the cost of stepping into an unknown vanishing. Lens reads Causal with situational pressure. One meaningful tightening occurs when the ink's behavior reframes time as edited deletion rather than slow motion, narrowing Iren's tactical options to "step between cuts."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Desert setting is vivid and purposeful: wind-carved encampment, bone-holes in tents, sand grains suspended mid-stampede. The Painted Table functions as micro-setting that constrains the demonstration and charges the final touch. Sensory detail is filtered through Iren's tracker perception (tracks, patterns, causes). The ink spill on the table supplies the physical substrate for his epiphany and final action, satisfying the constraint-on-choice gate for 9+ eligibility, though the encampment itself does not directly alter tactics beyond atmosphere.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—understanding the Crisis Slow—is signaled in the opening reflection and drives every beat. Pressure tightens when the ink demonstration reframes time as deletion, forcing Iren to choose between observation and participation. Agency is clear: his decision to place fingertips on ink and loosen self forecloses the passive tracker role with visible emotional cost ("fury and acceptance"). The escalation is driven by protagonist realization under a causal lens, and the cost is legible on the page in his breath and bodily surrender.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme—perception as selective editing, crisis as compression rather than expansion—emerges organically from the ink's behavior and Iren's tracker methodology. The final image of loosening self offers a resonant answer to "why time slows" without moralizing: the world rations awareness, and learning the cuts allows one to slip through them. The recurring ink motif and Kesh's frantic loops accumulate pressure. Subtext operates in the elder's calm acceptance versus Iren's "serene anger," and the piece avoids diagnostic language even when exploring trauma.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and voice-textured: "serene anger," "limbs slogged through invisible resin," "older Iren screamed at frozen seconds." Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close at trauma memory, wider at world-building). Dialogue is sparse but functional, carrying goal pursuit and subtext without exposition. Minor slip: "consciously wild loops" in reference to Kesh edges toward filter-heavy phrasing, though it remains within the tracker's observational idiom. Diction stays consistent with a desert tracker's perceptual signature throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with strong imagery: "dense as obsidian," "wind keened," "anger flare, steady and bright." Sentence rhythm varies purposefully. Two minor frictions: "Again, time had stretched" opens a reflective block that paraphrases the demonstration to come, creating slight redundancy; "the oldest said" / "the elder murmured" / "the elder answered" in quick succession leans on similar tag stems. Figurative density is high but controlled, and no loops or scaffolding obscure the closure beat. Information density is strong across beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of tracker methodology, disappearing ink as time-editing metaphor, and the albino-as-marginal-walker premise feels specific and non-obvious. The piece transforms the "time slows in crisis" trope by reframing it as frame deletion rather than dilation—fresh and earned through on-page demonstration. Risk-taking in the lyric density and the quiet, sensory-rich closure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The combination of scavenged drone, spilled ink ritual, and desert wind choreography reads as a singular vision rather than template assembly.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Iren (albino tracker) is present throughout, his choices drive key beats: he built Kesh to watch time, enters the tent to learn, pours and observes ink, decides to loosen self. His albinism is noted ("half-vanished from the sun") as linked to his suitability for disappearing, constraining the elders' choice of student. Early signal, beat involvement across demonstration and closure, causal pressure. Swappability is low; another character type would require different thematic scaffolding.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Kesh (artificial hummingbird drone) appears in three beats: hovering post-eclipse with dilated lenses, circling in "consciously wild loops," and dipping low to map ink patterns. It records but does not alter Iren's tactics or the closure decision. The drone's frantic behavior after eclipse signals disturbance, priming Iren's investigation, and its mapping function supports his empirical method. Functional reprise but not causally indispensable; a different observation tool could serve similar narrative work with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Disappearing ink is introduced at the tent demonstration, drives the central revelation (time edits itself, ink shows the cuts), and provides the substrate for Iren's final tactile commitment. The ink's behavior—reflecting eclipse, birthing ephemeral patterns, cooling—shapes his epiphany and the elders' teaching method. Early enough (setup within first half), beat involvement in demonstration and closure, high causal pressure. Specificity is strong: ink that "remembers the shape of what it has touched and slips elsewhere" is irreplaceable metaphor and mechanism.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Consciously wild" describes Kesh's loops post-eclipse, labeling the drone's behavior as deliberate rather than random. It does not constrain an on-page action with visible cost or enable a choice Iren makes. The phrase adds texture to Kesh's disturbance but remains ornamental; removing it would not alter any beat's outcome. Present in one descriptive line without beat involvement or closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Disappear" is the elders' offered teaching: "We will teach you to disappear and return through the ephemeral patterns." It frames the closure action (Iren loosening self to step between cuts) and provides the story's conceptual payoff. Setup and closure linkage are strong. However, the disappearance itself occurs as intent and beginning gesture, not a completed on-page turn with visible consequence; the story ends at the threshold. Causal pressure is high, but full dramatic execution is deferred, limiting indispensability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Through ephemeral patterns in spilled ink" is the method specified by the elders, demonstrated in the Painted Table scene, and enacted in Iren's final touch. The ink spill generates the patterns that reveal time's cuts, teaching Iren the mechanism he will use. Setup (elder's explanation), development (ink demonstration), payoff (fingertips on cooling ink). Specificity is high; another medium would require different metaphysics. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Wind-carved encampment is established in the opening, providing atmosphere (bone-holes in tents, wind keening) and housing the Painted Table tent. Setting supplies spatial staging for the demonstration but does not constrain Iren's choice or alter tactics; the decision could occur in another desert location. The encampment's post-eclipse unease (murmured prayers, clatter of shields) contextualizes urgency but does not pressure the protagonist's options. Functional mood-setting with one-beat causal presence (elders wait in center tent), swappable at structural level.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Timeframe "after the eclipse ends" anchors the opening and explains Kesh's disturbance and the encampment's unease. The eclipse's end is setup only; no ticking clock constrains Iren's choices in the tent demonstration or at closure. Time does not tighten decisions beyond general post-crisis context. The element provides initial orientation and thematic resonance (time itself is the story's subject) but does not escalate pressure or shape tactics across beats.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Iren's motivation—to discover why time slows in crisis—is seeded in the opening reflection, embodied in his building of Kesh ("watch the way time moved when fear spiked"), voiced in dialogue ("Did time slow for you again?"), and drives his participation in the ink demonstration. Friction appears in his "serene anger" and the trauma memory of his mother, adding cost. The motivation is dramatized across three beats and directly enables the closure choice. Strong setup, development, and payoff with visible emotional stakes.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Serene anger" is established in the opening ("heavy as cooled glass"), recurs in the trauma reflection ("younger Iren screamed"), and modulates at closure ("fury and acceptance"). The tone is coherent and specific to Iren's character: controlled rage that fuels empirical investigation. It charges the final image by framing his surrender as paradoxically powered by anger. The tone does not shift under pressure as much as deepen, and it directly supports the emotional texture of the ending. Purposeful and consistent, though static in register.</comment>
