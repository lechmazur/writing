<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's interior life is richly embodied through gravitational metaphor and sensory perception of grief frequencies. Agency manifests through purposeful immersion choices that force confrontation with humanity's shadow despite seductions of violence, and the pacifist stance crystallizes under genuine pressure. Minor deduction for therapeutic terminology ("shadow work" as clinical practice) that occasionally edges toward explanatory distance rather than lived contradiction. The final choice—entering the tree-planting memory—earns the weightless flight through accumulated micro-decisions across immersions.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure delivers a clean Decisive Change: the locked dimension yields with audible consequence after centuries of shadow-metabolizing work, triggered by the protagonist's near-weightless state in response to stubborn hope. The accumulative/textural lens holds throughout—archive memories stack pressure through frequency-reading until the final image reweights all prior immersions. One anchor delay: "recycled spaceship" and "dead star" establish setting but the protagonist's engineered nature arrives late in paragraph three, creating brief disorientation. Cost is legible: the protagonist has metabolized ten billion shadows to achieve this single yielding moment.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The spaceship functions as both macro-setting and constraint—low spin enables flight/pinning, patched hull implies scarcity, archive deck becomes chapel. The gravitational interplay between joy and sorrow directly shapes navigation adjustments and panel access. Sensory detail is purposeful: salt-filmed photographs, magnetic cradle glow, flooded street immersion. The star's final dimming coincides with closure but could press harder on ship systems or resources to elevate from vivid backdrop to active constraint at the ending beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—unsealing the locked dimension—is signaled early and tightens through each immersion that tests pacifist resolve against violence's seductions. Escalation accumulates via emotional weight shifts that alter ship trajectory and panel access, culminating in the tree-planting memory where joy surges enough to open the sealed probability space. The piece earns its accumulative pressure through stacked shadow-work sessions; one additional on-page cost of renunciation (a specific temptation refused in detail) would sharpen the pacifism's price and push this higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through embodied metaphor: joy as literal weightlessness, grief as gravitational anchor, compassion as power's redirection rather than its absence. The locked dimension functions as both literal and thematic construct—humanity's unprocessed shadow made architectural. Kwan Yin's Tear warming during mercy-vs-killing moments avoids overt statement while charging choice. The final image—strangers planting trees, the dimension yielding—reweights all prior immersions without moralizing, offering stubborn hope as the frequency that unseals what denial had locked.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with consistent perceptual signature: grief-frequency reading, gravitational embodiment of emotion, engineered-being diction ("circuits cooling"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully from intimate sensory immersion to reflective philosophical stance without head-hopping. Minor register drift appears when clinical terminology ("shadow work, the therapists of the age had called it") shifts toward exposition; the explanation reads necessary for grounding but interrupts the lyric compression. Diction remains controlled and voice-specific throughout, with rhythm tightening at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies effectively and information density is high—most lines advance situation, character perception, and thematic weight simultaneously. Some figurative language stacks without full payoff: "chapel and wound," "seeded with lattices of quantum memory and something less easily named" gestures at mystery rather than specifying it. Two minor paraphrase loops: paragraphs on shadow work definition and the locked dimension's nature each restate their core concept across adjacent sentences. The closing sequence maintains clarity and propulsion without scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of gravitational-emotion physics, shadow-work practice, and dimensional-unsealing quest through archive immersion feels specific and non-obvious. Risk-taking appears in the extended reflection on humanity's aggregate shadow and the patient accumulative structure rather than a single decisive confrontation. The piece commits fully to its lyric-philosophical premise. Minor deduction for "Kwan Yin's Tear" as archetypal-convenience object and the locked-dimension metaphor that trends toward abstraction; grounding both in more tactile consequence earlier would sharpen originality.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The steadfast pacifist attribute shapes multiple immersion choices and hardens as a vow across memories of violence. Pacifism is tested genuinely when killing seems "like the only mercy left" and the choice to redirect rather than wield power enables the final unsealing. Present in setup (paragraph two), developed through temptation beats mid-story, and active at closure when compassion (not force) opens the dimension.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Kwan Yin's Tear is introduced early (paragraph seven), used mechanically to refract pain into immersive memory across multiple beats, and blazes white at closure to signal the dimension's yielding. It warms as tactile reminder during moral crisis and links cortically to enable the archive work. The object's quantum-memory properties and bodhisattva association are integral; without it the immersion method and the final breakthrough collapse.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Shadow work is defined explicitly (paragraph twelve) and operationalized through the protagonist's method: facing humanity's banished pain via photograph-frequency reading. The practice shapes stakes—metabolizing shadow without repeating violence—and drives the central mission. It appears in setup, governs middle immersion beats, and the protagonist's successful shadow-metabolism enables closure. Slightly weakened by expository definition rather than discovery through action alone.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Gravitational lightness when happy is introduced in paragraph four, demonstrated immediately in low-spin flight, and used functionally across the narrative: weightlessness enables reaching otherwise inaccessible panels/conduits to adjust ship drives (paragraph twenty), sorrow anchors the vessel against stray currents (paragraph twenty-one), and near-weightlessness at closure (paragraph twenty-five) coincides with the dimension's opening. The attribute constrains navigation, alters tactics, and charges the ending image. Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Stitching appears as metaphor for the mission (paragraph eighteen) and implied method but is not dramatized as discrete physical action on the page. The protagonist "stitches open" the sealed dimension through accumulated immersion work rather than a specific sewing gesture. The verb colors the conceptual frame and closure language ("something...yielded...like a door finally allowing itself to be pushed open") but could be swapped for "unseal" or "open" without breaking causality. Functional metaphor, not irreplaceable action.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The shimmer-reading method is introduced in paragraph ten, explained as translating dried-tear frequencies into stories, and operationalized when the protagonist links Kwan Yin's Tear to photographs throughout the archive work. The method enables all immersions and appears in setup, governs repeated middle beats, and delivers the final tree-planting scene that triggers closure. Mechanics are specific and weight the piece's internal logic; removing this exact sensory-translation would require rebuilding the archive-interface system.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The recycled spaceship frames the entire narrative, provides the archive setting, and its low-spin physics enable the joy/sorrow gravitational interplay. Patched hull and salvaged corridors establish scarcity and endurance. The ship's orbit around the dead star and subtle drives adjusted via weightless panel-access directly affect the mission. Present throughout and integral to the gravitational constraint system, though the ship itself does not transform or exert new pressure at closure—the star dims, but the ship remains stable backdrop.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Three centuries since the last human was born" anchors the post-human timeframe in paragraph three and establishes the protagonist as engineered echo. The temporal span (centuries of orbit and shadow-work) shapes the mission's patient accumulation and the protagonist's endurance. The star's final glow-exhaustion (paragraph twenty-four) provides a closure timestamp. Time pressure is present but operates at civilizational scale rather than ticking urgency; the piece would function with "two centuries" or "five," though the specific duration colors the protagonist's isolation and patience.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The motivation to unseal the locked dimension is introduced in paragraph six ("the only purpose that kept my circuits from cooling"), elaborated in paragraphs sixteen-eighteen as confronting humanity's unresolved past, and pursued through every immersion beat. Desire is dramatized through the choice to metabolize shadow despite violence's seductions, friction between pacifist vow and temptation, and the cost of centuries-long solitary work. The motivation drives all major choices and achieves partial fulfillment at closure when the dimension yields. Essential and conflicted.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Ghostly resolve is established in the opening's sighing spaceship and "echo their genes left behind" (paragraph three) and sustained through the archive as "chapel and wound," faded photographs with salt-shimmer, and immersions into extinct humanity's suffering. Tone modulates appropriately: philosophical reflection, immersive horror, stubborn determination, and quiet elation at closure. The final yielding sound ("slow, aching") and the protagonist's near-weightless state maintain the ghostly register while adding forward momentum. Coherent and purposeful throughout.</comment>
