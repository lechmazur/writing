<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The narrator's interior progression from professional detachment to complicity is earned through concrete micro-choices: stopping three boards away, accepting the keeper's certainty, finally pinning on the boutonniere. The keeper's interiority remains appropriately oblique given his role as catalyst, with his perceptual signature ("softly persistent," the habit of cupping invisible things) consistently embodied. The final choice to take the Edelweiss and wait forecloses investigation in favor of participation, a visible cost. Minor deduction: the stranger's psychology remains abstract, known only through reported gesture, limiting emotional triangulation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when clearly by the opening paragraph. The accumulative/textural lens is taught early—mist, gaps, absences as meaningful pressure—and holds through closure. The Resonant Reconfiguration arrives on-page when the narrator pins the Edelweiss and waits, crystallizing a shift from investigator to participant with visible cost (the abandoned report, the foreclosed inquiry). One escalation: the walk along the dock teaching the narrator to observe gaps rather than events reweights the initial stake.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The opal dock's liminal glow and nautical twilight constrain the investigation to a threshold space that charges every choice. The lighthouse "loomed," "lantern caged in rust," "windows blind as cataracts" mirrors the keeper's opacity and the drowned man's erasure. The boutonniere's tactile presence—"crackling faintly," "color of old bones"—recurs with reweighted meaning at closure. Spatial choreography is clean: three boards away, turning to face water, walking the dock's length together.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode the stranger's final gesture) signals in paragraph three and tightens when the keeper reframes investigation as observing gaps. One meaningful deepening: the narrator's realization that "the stranger's final gesture had been a request for witnessed isolation" forecloses the option of filing a report. Cost is legible: the narrator accepts complicity by pinning on the flower and waiting for the next arrival. Agency is endurance/participation rather than decision, fitting the accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—witnessed isolation, the trade in borrowed memories as a way to hold others' unbearable weight—emerges entirely from particulars: the cupped invisible thing, the boutonniere passed hand to hand, the gaps observed rather than events. The final image (pinning the flower, waiting) answers the central question without stating a moral: to witness vanishing is to become complicit in the chain of solitary burden. The Edelweiss shifts from keepsake to relay-object to evidence of cyclical witness, a non-literal reconfiguration. No thematic echo or moralizing in the final lines.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: the narrator notices liminality ("nautical twilight," "opal dock"), specificity of absence ("the cup left unraised"), and ritual precision. Diction remains within professional-investigator lexicon that gradually absorbs the keeper's vocabulary ("softly persistent," "borrowed memories"). Dialogue feels natural and advances goals: the keeper's lines pursue conversion, the narrator's questions trace erosion of detachment. No head-hopping; all focalization stable. Rhythm modulates from clipped observation ("I stopped three boards away") to flowing accumulation in the penultimate paragraph, reflecting the narrator's surrender to the keeper's logic.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High information density: most sentences do double duty (e.g., "his yellow slicker hanging open, a dried Edelweiss boutonnière pinned where a name tag should be" delivers costume, symbol, and professional absence simultaneously). Sentence variety supports rhythm without template cadence. Minor deduction: three instances of "softly persistent" across the story feel like synonym-dodge for a single idea, and "the peculiar sensation that someone invisible had stepped very close" leans toward stock phrasing. No paraphrase loops or scaffolding; propulsion is clean through the final beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The premise—investigation by observing gaps, memories as tradeable burden—is specific and non-obvious. The boutonniere as relay object rather than clue transforms investigator-story conventions. The final move (narrator becomes next keeper) is earned in hindsight by the keeper's opening line "You came back" and the cyclical structure of witnessed vanishing. Risk: the entire piece operates in implication and elision, trusting the reader to infer the drowned man's psychology and the nature of "borrowed memories" without expository safety nets. Freshness arises from synthesis of liminal setting, oblique dialogue, and accumulative closure rather than surface novelty.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The keeper frames the investigation ("You are here to investigate"), instructs the method ("observe gaps"), and transfers the boutonniere, each choice altering the narrator's tactics and options. Present in setup, middle instruction, and implicit in closure (the narrator inherits his role). Causal pressure across three beats.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The boutonniere appears in four beats: initial description, the keeper's tap and explanation, the narrator's realization of its bone color, and the transfer/pinning at closure. It moves from clue to keepsake to burden to relay object, reweighting each time. The final act—pinning it to the narrator's coat—is the closure's hinge. Irreplaceable: its alpine origin ("so out of place here, at sea level") and bone color encode the stranger's displacement and death.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The concept is named explicitly ("My trade is borrowed memories") and explains the keeper's role, shaping the narrator's understanding that investigation means inheriting weight rather than solving. It drives one key turn (reframing the task) but remains more thematic than tactical; the mechanics are asserted, not demonstrated through a sequence of attempts. Present in setup (implicit in cupped invisible thing), middle (named), and closure (enacted by transfer), qualifying for mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Softly persistent" describes the keeper's voice initially, then recurs to describe his steps during the dock walk, embodying patience that wears down the narrator's detachment. The trait enables the keeper's conversion tactic and constrains the narrator's resistance. Visible cost: the narrator's professional stance erodes under that patient pressure. Present across two beats with causal role.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Investigation frames the narrator's arrival and official purpose, but the story's major turn occurs when investigation is redefined as observing gaps rather than decoding events. The action remains central across setup (assignment), middle (method instruction), and closure (abandonment of the report). The narrator's final choice to wait for "someone else to arrive" inverts investigation into complicity. Two beats with closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The method is signaled midpoint ("you do it by observing gaps, not the events that fill them") and demonstrated in the dock walk where the keeper points out absences. It shapes the narrator's final understanding and the story's accumulative design. Present in middle instruction and enacted at closure when the narrator grasps "witnessed isolation." Two beats; method matters to tactics.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The opal dock anchors every beat, its liminal glow and position (above the drowning site, below the lighthouse) creating spatial pressure. The mist "shivered like a living thing" when the keeper holds out empty palms; the planks throw back "colors no one had painted" in the opening image and return in the walk. The dock's threshold quality—between land and water, day and night—charges the final decision to remain and wait. Three beats with closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Nautical twilight frames the opening encounter and is named as the time of the stranger's drowning, establishing a ritual window. The timeframe creates tonal coherence (liminality, refusal of clear categories) and tightens the sense of repetition when "the last light bled from the horizon" by the end. Present in setup and closure with thematic weight, but does not constrain moment-to-moment tactics. Two gates with lyric reprise.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Decoding the gesture is the narrator's official stake, dramatized through the investigation assignment, the keeper's reframing, and the dock walk. The motivation is tested when the narrator realizes decoding means inheriting rather than solving, creating friction between professional duty and the keeper's logic. The final choice to pin the flower is the renunciation of decoding in favor of participation, a visible cost. Three beats with closure friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Witnessed isolation permeates every image: the stranger's solo drowning, the keeper's solitary vigil, the narrator's arrival as the only witness to the keeper's story, and the final tableau of waiting for the next witness. Tone modulates from professional detachment (clipped early sentences) to accumulative surrender (longer, flowing final paragraph) while maintaining coherence. The closing image—pinning the flower and waiting—crystallizes the tone's meaning: to witness is to inherit isolation. Charges the final beat decisively.</comment>
