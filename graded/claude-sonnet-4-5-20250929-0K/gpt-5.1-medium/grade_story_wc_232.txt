<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's interiority is strongly embodied through the tactile handling of the chip and the sensory journey upstream. His eight-year paralysis and final choice to follow the faint path are earned through concrete micro-decisions (following ants, crawling through petals, setting the chip against stone). The "empirically intuitive" trait functions as both perception filter and decision method. Minor weakness: the sister Mara remains abstract, reducing relational pressure, though her absence is thematically intentional.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural with Situational elements (protagonist follows taught pattern—ants, water, chip coordinates—to a crystallized choice). Closure achieves Charged Poise: Elias sets the chip against undecided stone and follows through, foreclosing the safe path with felt cost ("not knowing which life... only that at last he was choosing"). Orientation anchors quickly (shop, then upstream journey). One meaningful tightening occurs when rising water forces the choice. Cost is legible in the relinquishment of certainty and the shop.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The blooming cavern functions as micro-setting that constrains movement (ceiling drops, forcing crawl; rising water pressures timing) and charges the final image (undecided stone, petal-filled air). Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered: iron-and-blossoms, damp fragrant mouths, warming chip. Spatial choreography remains clear across the climb and crawl. The matrix chip as object-setting warrants credit: it warms, projects paths, and becomes the tool that softens the wall.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—find the doorway of decisions—is signaled early and pursued on-page. Escalation tightens through environmental pressure (rising creek) and internal choice (the latticed paths). The final beat narrows options to retreat, tunnel, or blank ascent; Elias chooses the faint path, agency clear. Visible cost: abandoning the shop, risking never finding Mara, accepting uncertainty. One tightening is sufficient at this length and escalation is driven by protagonist choice under the accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme—choice versus paralysis, maps as rehearsal for lived decision—emerges through concrete action (eight years turning the chip, following ants as proxy compass, setting chip to stone). The final image offers a non-literal answer: "not knowing which life... only that at last he was choosing" reweights the lingering promise without moralizing. The "doorway of decisions" motif recurs with shifting meaning and the ending resists tidy resolution. Minor: Mara's phrase "When the water decides, you must decide too" borders on thematic echo but is contextualized as her notebook voice.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: "empirically intuitive," cataloging paths, following ants as safe lines. Diction is controlled and voice-specific ("the unsold maps," "ant-black punctuation marks," "petals brushed his neck with damp, fragrant mouths"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully—tighter during the crawl, reflective during the chip-projection. No head-hopping; free indirect style is clean. Rhythm accelerates as water rises, supporting pressure without template cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>句rhythm varies naturally; paragraph lengths create visual cadence. Information density is high: most lines advance character (tactile memory of the chip), setting (petal ceiling, stone ledge), or pressure (warming water, brightening chip). No paraphrase loops detected. Minor friction: a few sentences lean slightly elevated ("exhaling pale pollen," "spinning constellations of color") in a passage otherwise grounded, though the register remains within the established lyric-realist voice. Filter verbs ("he heard," "he realized") appear but are sparse and voice-motivated. Propulsion is strong through the cavern sequence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The map-dealer premise is familiar but transformed through specific integration: ants as navigation proxy, the matrix chip etched with coordinates instead of letters, the "doorway of decisions" as literal undecided stone. The blooming cavern and rising creek create a fresh synthesis of place and pressure. Risk-taking in the lyric-accumulative design and the abstract-made-literal doorway elevate the piece. Minor: the "sister vanished leaving clues" frame is well-worn; the story earns freshness through execution and the protagonist's interior paralysis rather than the premise itself.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias is present throughout; his loneliness and cataloging habit shape perception. His decision to close the shop, follow the dream upstream, and finally set the chip against stone are key turns. The "lonely antique map dealer" trait informs voice and stakes but does not constrain a specific tactic with visible cost—his profession colors his worldview but the journey's choices (following ants, setting the chip) could plausibly occur for a character of different background. Present in closure (he chooses). Swappability: moderate; a different solitary scholar archetype could perform similar moves.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The matrix chip appears early (receipt, eight years handling), returns in multiple beats (packed at dawn, gripped as talisman, warms in the cavern, projects lattice of paths, set against stone to open doorway), and is indispensable at closure—it is the key that softens the wall. Removal would break story logic. Specific properties (etched coordinates, warming, projecting paths) matter causally. Cost: trusting the chip's map over retreat. Touches setup, middle, and closure; causal across beats.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Lingering promise" is named early ("the lingering promise he lived by," Mara's oath "We will find the doorway of decisions together") and returns at closure (thought of the promise as he sets the chip). It shapes tactics: eight years of paralysis, the decision to follow upstream, the choice of the faint path. The phrase "lingering promise and a threat" explicitly frames the stake. Visible cost: accepting that Mara may not be found, that the promise's terms are uncertain. Present across beats and charges the final choice.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Empirically intuitive" is labeled early and demonstrated once on-page: distrusting compasses near ore, he follows ants instead, trusting pattern over tool. This choice enables the journey and reflects character voice. The trait colors perception throughout but is invoked as a decision method in only one beat. Cost: modest—he must move slowly, rely on insects. Swappability: moderate; a cautious naturalist or tracker could make a similar choice. Present in setup and middle but does not return at closure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Glimmer" recurs in two beats: ants converge on a glimmering point on stone, and the matrix chip glimmers/brightens, projecting paths. The convergence signals the doorway location; the chip's glimmer is the mechanism that softens the wall. Removal would obscure how the doorway is found and opened. Specific sensory cue. Present in middle and closure; causal. Minor: the word also appears in "pollen that glimmered," diluting specificity slightly, but the two action beats (ant-point, chip) are distinct and essential.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Following ants home" is introduced early as method ("he started following ants home instead" of using compass) and sustained across the journey: ants trace lines along roots, pour along the ledge, slip through petals, climb the vertical stone to the glimmering point. The method enables navigation and discovery of the doorway. Mechanics matter: ants find safe lines, converge on the threshold. Present in setup, middle, and closure approach; removal would eliminate the path. Specificity and causal necessity are high.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The blooming cavern is the locus of closure and pressures choices: ceiling drops (forces crawl), rising water (tightens time), petals and stone ledge (constrain movement), undecided stone (the doorway itself). Introduced at midpoint but dominates the final third. Midsummer timing is mentioned once (opening: "first midsummer after he finally locked the shop") but does not recur or pressure the cavern sequence. The cavern supplies resources (ledge, glimmer-point) and obstacles (water, narrow passage) that alter tactics. Essential to closure; removal breaks the ending.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"As the creek rises" is named in the title phrase Mara's voice ("as the creek rises"), recurs as dream motif, and becomes literal pressure in the cavern: water licks knees, pools around ribs, tugs with urgency, forcing the choice before drowning. The timeframe tightens decisions across the final sequence. Clock is tracked on-page (water progression from knees to ribs). Present in setup (dream/phrase), middle (creek beside trail thickens), and closure (rising water forces choice). Cost: staying still means drowning. Causal and essential.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"To find the doorway of decisions" is established early (Mara's oath, Elias's lived-by promise, notebook sketch) and dramatized on-page: he climbs to the ravine, follows ants to the threshold, weighs retreat versus entry, and chooses the faint path. Friction between want (find doorway, possibly Mara) and cost (never returning, uncertainty) is legible. The doorway is reached and entered; the choice is made with visible stakes. Present across setup, middle, and closure; drives every beat. Essential to story logic.</comment>
