<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The immortal's interiority is concrete and voice-particular ("I am tired of pages that never turn"), with embodied perception through dimensional awareness. The fragment functions as externalized internal conflict, and the final choice to "loosen anchors" demonstrates agency with visible cost. Minor slip: the philosophical dialogue with the artifact risks abstraction, though it's recovered by sensory grounding and the protagonist's contemptuous silence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural, with the solar storm intensifying density and the fragment's revelation serving as a pattern-break that reweights the goodbye-stake. Closure lands as Charged Poise—the protagonist begins redrawing boundaries, crystallizing intent with felt cost (untying from immortality). Orientation is clean by the first paragraph. The because/therefore chain (storm → magnetic alignment → fragment activation → spatial revelation) holds across the piece, and the final image makes the protagonist's shift in stance legible with undeniable pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The prismatic escondite constrains choice throughout: its dimensional anchors enable secrecy but also trap the protagonist in "inaction." The fragment on the worktable, magnetic fields as "glassy threads," and the room's mutiny all pressure the protagonist's stance. The body ("two fingers") and recurring light motifs ("patient rainbows" → "question") charge the final image. Economy is excellent—details serve pressure rather than tourism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (learning what happens after goodbye) signals early and drives all pressure. The storm and fragment create one major tightening that narrows options: the protagonist must permit "a final distance" to follow those who left. Agency is clear in the decision to redraw boundaries, and the cost—untying from immortality—is legible on the page. No forced reversals; escalation coheres under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from spatial metaphor and the fragment's lesson: "goodbye was never an annihilation but a rearrangement of nearness." The final image—loosening anchors to "mean not an ending, but a direction"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The fragment's "disagreement with reality" infects the protagonist, making theme inseparable from character arc. Subtext operates in "hushed thunder" and the protagonist's twelve-thousand-year refusal.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and controlled: "dimensionally aware, walls are at best polite suggestions" and "silence long enough to feel like contempt" establish perceptual signature. POV distance is stable; the protagonist's dimensional awareness shapes all perception without leaking into omniscience. Register and diction ("lawful mischief of distance," "neighborhoods of space") remain consistent under pressure. Free indirect handling of the fragment's "voice" is clean—pressure without sound.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Rhythm modulates effectively ("The first crack in space sounded like hushed thunder" opens with controlled cadence; closure slows to match contemplation). Information density is high: most lines advance concept, character, and atmosphere simultaneously. Minor density slip: "Its charged particles slammed into the upper air, shaking every magnetic field my escondite depended on for secrecy" could compress. No loops, filters are voice-motivated, and figurative language ("crown of bent nails," "intrigue on a geometric scale") clarifies rather than obscures.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The premise (spatial metaphor for emotional refusal) is executed with specificity: dimensional awareness as literal ability, "rearrangement of nearness" as concrete concept. The fragment as externalized disagreement and magnetic fields as the medium transform familiar immortal-ennui material. Risk-taking in voice ("museum of unopened exits," "lawful mischief") heightens stakes without gimmickry. The goodbye-as-direction synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The bored immortal drives all turns: chooses to engage the fragment (setup), interprets its pressure (middle), and decides to loosen anchors (closure). Twelve thousand years of refusal shapes stakes. Present in all three gates with causal agency.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fragment appears early (worktable), vibrates and aligns with storm (middle beats), speaks and shares spatial knowledge (climax), and is placed "at the center of the room" in closure. Drives at least three beats and charges the ending; irreplaceable as the voice of spatial mutiny.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Spatial mutiny is seeded early ("spatial mutiny, forged when a dying sorcerer tried to resign from reality"), manifests in the escondite's rebellion ("rooms and vectors plotting behind my back"), and shapes the closure decision to let space "mutiny not just around me, but with me." Constrains tactics and redefines the goodbye-stake.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dimensional awareness enables the protagonist to perceive overlapping geometries, magnetic fields as "glassy threads," and distances as "rearrangements." It shapes how information arrives (not images/words but orientations) and makes the fragment's lesson legible. Present in setup, development, and closure with clear on-page utility.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Intrigue operates as "geometric scale" conspiracy (rooms plotting) and the protagonist's recognition of having "locked doors" behind loved ones. It's thematically present but less causally central than other elements—spatial rebellion and the fragment drive the major turns. Middle-band: functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Magnetic fields are seeded early ("every magnetic field my escondite depended on for secrecy"), become the mechanism for the storm-fragment circuit, and their "feral alignment" delivers the revelation. The protagonist can "almost taste" them. Shapes two beats and the closure understanding; specific and irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The prismatic escondite supplies secrecy via magnetic anchors, betrays the protagonist during the storm ("conspired with the storm and the amulet"), and is actively redrawn in closure ("began to redraw the boundaries"). It is both resource and antagonist. Essential across beats and ending; removal would collapse the premise.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Solar storm appears in the opening paragraph, intensifies pressure throughout, wanes at the two-thirds mark, and prompts the protagonist to wait for "another storm, another chance." It tightens the decision window and enables the magnetic alignment. Present in all three gates with clear causal role.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The motivation to discover what happens after goodbye is stated early, dramatized through the fragment's lesson (goodbye as "rearrangement of nearness"), and drives the closure choice to permit "a final distance." Conflict between safety (endlessness) and discovery is embodied throughout. Indispensable to the arc.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Hushed thunder appears in the opening line, recurs ("still that same hushed thunder, as if respect bound the noise"), and modulates with pressure—roaring outside, hushed inside. Tone charges the final quiet resolve ("I might finally learn how to say goodbye"). Coherent and purposeful throughout.</comment>
