<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's interiority is concrete and voice-specific ("some old etiquette manual had opened in my spine"), with embodied emotion that avoids label-speak. Internal contradiction emerges clearly: the protagonist insists on sugar while both parties recognize "the first of many agreed upon lies." The final choice to "carry their denials as gently as their truths" represents earned endurance with visible cost, though the choice feels more intellectual than viscerally tested. Motivation to learn the building's language is sustained and shapes weekly sessions, but the stakes remain somewhat abstract rather than urgently personal.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The piece anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraph and establishes a coherent Accumulative/Textural lens that holds through closure. The escalation builds through weekly sessions to the meteor-shower night when the building "speaks plainly," delivering a Resonant Reconfiguration (the narrator realizes learning means "carry[ing] their denials as gently as their truths"). Cost is legible: the protagonist must accept complicity in the building's "agreed upon lies" to continue living there. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length, though the progression from sugar-borrowing to rooftop listening could compress slightly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Setting details are purposeful and filtered through the narrator's attention: "Yellow lamps should not flicker sea-green" signals wrongness immediately, and the rooftop garden constrains the climax by providing the wooden decking for the seal impression. The meteor shower functions as both atmosphere and catalyst—"the sky was busy writing drafts"—and the antique desk seal becomes a key that unlocks the building's voice. Spatial choreography (neighbor's door → fire escape → rooftop) tracks cleanly across moves. The recurring use of the seal to press against decking and produce "a circle of air that rang like a bell" charges the final image with both sensory specificity and functional consequence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—to learn the building's language before demolition—is signaled early and drives the weekly ritual. The meteor-shower night provides one meaningful tightening: the seal's symbols rearrange, the building speaks, and the narrator must reconcile its truths with its denials. Agency is present but cerebral: the narrator chooses to close fingers around the seal and "listen for the next story," an act of endurance with conceptual cost. The pressure is more philosophical than urgent; no live countdown to demolition or competing choice forces a sharper trade-off on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the building's voice and the seal's function: "agreed upon lies" braids through denials about cracks, pipes, and roof safety, grounding the abstract concept in structural particulars. The final image—"learning to carry their denials as gently as their truths"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the opening question without moralizing. Subtext operates in the tutor's shrug ("a small apology for the fact of his own translucence") and the building's whispered "terms of our tenancy." The piece resists tidy binaries, accepting complicity as the cost of residence. No thematic echo or label-speak mars the ending.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Voice is distinctive and controlled: "Death is mostly a scheduling issue" and "the universe was busy writing drafts" carry consistent tonal wit without breaching POV modesty. Perceptual signature is selective and metaphor-rich ("etiquette manual had opened in my spine," "meteors scratched quick silver questions"), though density occasionally tips toward overwriting in non-peak beats. Psychic distance modulates purposefully: close during the seal's revelation, slightly elevated during exposition about building grammar. Dialogue is minimal but functional, with subtext ("You want something from the building") advancing the relationship. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks; tense and stance remain stable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies well ("It spoke of a family…of a fire…of stairwell arguments") and information density is high. Minor overwriting appears in the first half: "fingers turning pages without tearing them" and "thin page between floors" stack metaphors without pressure. A paraphrase loop near the opening ("asked why I had really come. For sugar, I insisted") restates the lie-dynamic twice in adjacent beats. The closing image ("closed my fingers around the seal and listened") delivers clean propulsion. No grammar errors, but figurative density in expository stretches ("curtain" of tea-smell, "conspirators in the next room") slightly exceeds voice-motivated need.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of ghost tutor, translucent interiority, and building-as-language feels specific and non-obvious, avoiding stock haunting tropes. The antique desk seal as key transforms a familiar object into a functional plot device. Risk-taking in tone—balancing whimsy ("scheduling issue") with philosophical weight—heightens stakes without gimmickry. The ending's quiet acceptance of complicity is a bold moral stance that resists safety-hedging. Some phrases ("thin haze," "faraway machine") drift generic, and the meteor-shower catalyst is well-worn, but the overall vision coheres as singular.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The dead language tutor appears in the first paragraph, teaches the narrator across weekly sessions (multiple beats), and explicitly enables the climax by carrying the seal upstairs and pressing it to the decking. His shrug and patience shape the narrator's willingness to sit and listen. His voice ("You cannot translate a building on an empty tongue") reframes the sugar-borrowing as ritual. The tutor's choices—pouring tea, pruning ghostly leaves, waiting on the roof—create key turns. Removing him would collapse the instruction arc and the seal's function. Strong causal pressure, early setup, closure linkage, and irreplaceability push this into the 7.0–8.4 band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The antique desk seal appears first when the tutor rests his hands on it, returns when he carries it to the rooftop, and is pressed to the decking to unlock the building's voice—three distinct beats. The seal's worn symbols rearrange under meteor light and produce "a circle of air that rang like a bell," a unique property that narrows options (only the seal can summon the building's speech). The narrator closes fingers around it in the final line, charging the ending image. High causal pressure, closure linkage, and irreplaceability support 8.3.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Agreed upon lies" is named explicitly ("the first of many agreed upon lies between us") in the early dialogue, reappears when the building whispers "the terms of our tenancy," and is repriced in the final realization ("learning to carry their denials as gently as their truths"). The concept shapes the narrator's stance at closure: accepting complicity as the cost of listening. It does not constrain a middle choice directly but reweights the dominant stake with conceptual cost. Setup + closure participation + thematic payoff place it in the 6.0–7.0 range; strong closure linkage lifts it toward 6.8.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Patiently nimble" is applied once to the tutor's voice ("like fingers turning pages without tearing them") in the opening encounter. It does not constrain or enable an on-page action with cost; it remains a descriptive label. No middle development or closure participation. Early setup + ornamental use cap it below 6.0; the vivid vehicle prevents it from dropping into the 3.0–4.9 "replaceable" band. Score: 5.2.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Interrogate" is introduced when the tutor explains the narrator's task ("interrogate the silences between sounds, the pauses where bricks hesitated"). The climax enacts this: the building's voice "floods through" and the narrator listens for layered stories, interrogating what the building whispers. The verb redefines the learning goal from passive hearing to active questioning, shaping the final choice to "listen for the next story." Setup + closure participation + causal pressure place it solidly in 7.0–8.4; the action is not easily swappable. Score: 7.1.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Sugar-borrowing opens the story and is immediately reframed by the tutor ("Then you do need sugar…You cannot translate a building on an empty tongue"), establishing the method as ritual rather than theft. "The borrowing became a ritual, and the ritual became weekly tea sessions" explicitly names the progression. The weekly sessions provide the middle development (the tutor teaches rooftop listening), and the final meteor-shower session delivers closure. Setup + middle + closure participation; the method is functional but could be replaced with another recurring interaction (e.g., weekly lessons). Moderate causal pressure and early signal support 6.4.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The rooftop garden is introduced midway ("he always waited there now…pruning ghostly leaves from real tomato vines") and becomes the sole location for the climax. The wooden decking supplies the surface where the seal is pressed, producing the "circle of air" that summons the building's voice—a direct tactical constraint. The meteor shower provides the temporal catalyst ("Tonight it will speak plainly") and the light that awakens the seal's symbols. Setup + middle use + closure participation + constraint on final action support 8.1.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>N/A</grade>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The motivation ("I want to learn their language before they are demolished") is voiced early and drives the weekly sessions. It is tested when the building finally speaks, revealing that learning means accepting "the terms of our tenancy" and carrying "their denials as gently as their truths"—a cost that complicates the desire. The narrator's final choice to "listen for the next story" enacts the motivation despite its revealed price. Setup + middle pressure + closure friction + visible cost place it in 7.0–8.4; strong thematic integration lifts it to 7.6.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Mysterious familiarity" coheres through the entire piece: the neighbor's apartment feels wrong yet the tutor sits "as if he had always belonged," the ritual feels "rude not to" follow, and the building's voice is both alien (layered murmur) and intimate (whispered terms). Tone modulates under pressure: whimsical in early dialogue, solemn during the meteor-shower climax, quietly resigned at closure. The final image—fingers closing around the seal—charges familiarity with mystery (the narrator accepts complicity without full understanding). Coherence + modulation + closure participation support 7.9.</comment>
