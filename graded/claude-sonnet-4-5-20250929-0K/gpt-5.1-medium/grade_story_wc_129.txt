<comment>Elian's motivation to graft onto community is embodied through concrete choices—settling beside Mira, committing to the collaborative sculpture—and his "permanently greened" hands and sympathetic gaze ground physicality. Internal contradiction appears when he imagines the lattice installation: "not as an intruder but as a thread" shows both yearning and self-doubt acting simultaneously. Mira's arc from "failed cartographer" to laughing recognition under the arbor reads earned, though her emotional pivot at "Stay and scatter" could land with more friction. Minor slip: "boldly sympathetic" feels label-heavy without a scene where that sympathy costs him something tangible on the page.</comment>

<comment>Orientation anchors (Elian, orchard, post-impact timeframe) arrive within the first three paragraphs; no penalty. Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure accrues through the shared search, discovery of Siltghost's tag, and Mira's directive, culminating in Elian's sculpture decision as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise: crystallized commitment with felt cost in the final image). The two-day structure with clear transitions holds coherence. Cost is visible: Elian moves from "solitary ditches" to communal making, foreclosing his former isolation. Small deduction: the obsidian arbor's appearance feels slightly convenience-timed rather than set up earlier, nudging causality but not breaking it.</comment>

<comment>The crystalline orchard and obsidian arbor anchor place with vivid specificity: "cooled night, its facets swallowing and returning starlight" filters setting through POV wonder. Spatial choreography (rows, spirals, arbor at center) remains clear. Micro-setting bonus: the obsidian arbor constrains the climactic choice—Elian touches it, feels the heartbeat, sees futures—charging the closure image. Sensory detail is purposeful (chalk lines, glittering dust, glass leaves trembling) without catalog excess. Minor gap: the quartz hostel and crater's steaming origin are ornamental backdrops that don't constrain tactics, but the arbor itself meets the 9+ gate for setting involvement.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—Elian's desire to graft onto community—is signaled early and tightens through the shared search. One meaningful turn: discovering "Stay and scatter" reweights his sculpture from place-dedication to kinship-web. Mira's directive narrows options, pushing Elian toward collaborative making with visible cost (forsaking solitary work). Escalation under Accumulative lens is present but gentle; no second reversal or complication raises the cost further. The sculpture decision crystallizes commitment (Charged Poise), yet the pressure feels more conversational than stressed—missed opportunity for a micro-friction (e.g., doubt about whether strangers will participate) that would test resolve on the page.</comment>

<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: marsh reeds, Siltghost's elusive mark, the obsidian arbor's grooves—all converging on belonging as both root and rumor. "Stay and scatter" reprices the opening restlessness without moralizing. The lattice sculpture idea, inviting strangers to weave fragments, answers the thematic question non-literally and with specificity. Subtext operates in Mira's laughter and covered mouth, Elian's "not quite pain, not quite hope" ache. Minor deduction: "webs of kinship overhead" in the rumor paragraph risks stating theme too directly, though later dramatization (sculpture plan, final dialogue) rescues it. No Thematic Echo penalty; the final lines avoid sermon.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Single POV (Elian) with stable third-limited distance; no head-hopping. Diction carries a consistent lyric elevation—"luminescent ache," "tender graffiti"—that matches the orchard's uncanny beauty without jarring. Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven: Mira's "part-time orchard guide when tips are good enough" establishes voice and motive economically. Perceptual signature: Elian notices fractures, sap-stained hands, "slow heartbeat resonate up his arm like distant drumlines"—all character-specific. Small deduction: "as though something fragile might escape" reads slightly generic under peak emotion; more idiosyncratic imaging would tighten. Filter verbs ("felt," "saw") appear but remain voice-motivated and don't dull immediacy.</comment>

<grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Information density is high; most lines do double duty (e.g., "marsh-reed sculptor who shaped brittle stalks into figures that remembered rain" conveys occupation, medium, aesthetic). Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths create visual rhythm. Minor scaffold: "They say the trees sprouted from echoes" and "Rumor said that if you stayed through three nightfalls" are near-synonyms for hearsay framing within eight paragraphs—paraphrase loop, −0.2. Template cadence in the Mira introduction ("Im Mira, muralist, failed cartographer, and part-time orchard guide") reads list-like but brief. Figurative density ("glass leaves trembling," "tender graffiti," "luminescent ache") risks saturation in peak beats; one or two could be pruned for propulsion without loss.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Core synthesis—street-artist mystique + crystalline orchard + communal sculpture—feels fresh and organic, not checklist-driven. The "Stay and scatter" tag transforms the cliché artist-seeking-belonging into a double mandate with conceptual edge. Siltghost's mark as distortion rather than pigment is a small but specific inflection. Risk: the lyric register and post-apocalyptic (or speculative) orchard setting commit fully without hedging into realism. Deduction: the marsh-reed sculptor and crystal orchard combination, while vivid, leans into familiar "artisan seeks magic place" territory; transformation arises more from execution than premise novelty. No close echoes of famous lines detected.</comment>

<question>9 A</question>
<grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Elian (marsh-reed sculptor) is present from paragraph four, constrains choices (settles beside Mira, imagines lattice sculpture), and drives the ending decision to dedicate the work to kinship webs. Setup, development, and payoff gates all met. Causal pressure: his sculptor identity enables the collaborative installation idea, a direct turn. Specificity: "marsh reeds and crystal shards suspended" ties his medium to the orchard. Cost: forsaking solitary work for communal making. Slight swappability: another artisan type (weaver, potter) could perform similar narrative work with edits, but "brittle stalks that remembered rain" charges the metaphor. Solid integration, not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question>
<grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The obsidian arbor appears midpoint, anchors the climax (Siltghost's tag discovery), and Elian touches it to feel "the orchard's slow heartbeat"—two distinct beats. Setup delayed but development and payoff gates met. Causal pressure: the arbor's grooves hold the tag that reweights Elian's plan. Closure linkage: the lattice sculpture will hang beneath it. Specificity: "cooled night, facets swallowing and returning starlight" is irreplaceable imagery. Cost connection: the tag's message triggers Mira's laughter and Elian's pivot. Minor deduction for late introduction (~60% mark) and slightly convenience-timed placement, but strong closure participation and specificity elevate the score.</comment>

<question>9 C</question>
<grade>5.9</grade>
<comment>Webs of kinship are signaled early (rumor in paragraph seven), reappear in Mira's directive ("dedicate it to the webs of kinship growing here"), and shape the sculpture's design (lattice braiding voices). Payoff gate met; development partial (concept informs Elian's goal shift). Causal pressure moderate: the concept channels his action but doesn't constrain a middle choice with friction. Lyric reprise: "webs" echo in the final paragraph ("tangled futures") reweights the stake. Cost: implicit in communal commitment. Swappability: "community" or "belonging" could substitute with minor edits, reducing irreplaceability. Solid thematic integration but not mechanically indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question>
<grade>4.2</grade>
<comment>"Boldly sympathetic" appears once as narrator summary ("his gaze was boldly sympathetic, catching other peoples fractures without pity") but never constrains an on-page action or incurs a visible cost. Setup gate met (early paragraph). Development and payoff gates missing: no middle beat where sympathy complicates a choice or shapes the ending turn. Ornamental label without dramatization. Could be cut with zero structural impact. Late mention that it informs why he came trends low; the trait itself doesn't alter tactics or the final image.</comment>

<question>9 E</question>
<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>"Dedicate" drives the story's latter half: Elian considers dedicating his sculpture to the place, Mira redirects him to dedicate it to kinship webs, and he commits to the collaborative lattice. Setup gate met (middle third). Development and payoff gates met: the redirect is the key turn, and the ending anchors in that dedication choice. Causal pressure: the action redefines his goal and tactics. Cost: shifts from solo to communal making. Swappability: "create," "offer," or "build" could replace with edits, reducing irreplaceability slightly. Strong beat involvement and closure linkage, but not mechanically unique.</comment>

<question>9 F</question>
<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>The shared search for Siltghost's tag structures the middle: walking spirals, reading bark and shadow, Mira's theory ("where belonging is thinnest"), and the obsidian arbor discovery. Setup gate met (paragraph eighteen). Development (spiral search, theories) and payoff (tag found, reweights goal) gates met. Causal pressure: the search mechanics (widening spirals, light distortion) shape attempts and discovery. Closure linkage: finding the tag triggers the sculpture pivot. Specificity: "distortion in how light clung to matter" is irreplaceable method detail. Cost: the search consumes time and builds their bond. Strong integration across beats.</comment>

<question>9 G</question>
<grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>The crystalline orchard perched at crater's edge is established early, provides spatial structure (rows, arbor at center), and the arbor itself constrains the climax choice. Setup, development, and payoff gates met. Causal pressure moderate: the setting enables the search and discovery but doesn't materially alter tactics (they walk and look; no environmental obstacle). Closure linkage: the lattice will hang in the orchard, and the final image ("trees listened, glass leaves trembling") charges the ending. Specificity high ("luminous trunks," "glittering dust"). Cost: pilgrimage and three-night stay implicit. Good integration, but the orchard functions more as vivid backdrop than active constraint on middle choices.</comment>

<question>9 H</question>
<grade>3.8</grade>
<comment>"Beyond the murmur of lost languages" appears once in paragraph two as backstory flavor ("rooted in an era beyond...") but never tightens decisions or tracks a clock. Setup gate weak (vague temporal anchor). Development and payoff gates missing: no middle or ending beat where timeframe pressures a choice. Ornamental world-building. Could be removed without structural loss. The three-nightfall rumor hints at time but isn't causally active; Elian's "third day" and "second day" mentions track duration without urgency.</comment>

<question>9 I</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Elian's motivation "to graft himself onto community" is signaled early (paragraph six: "no longer content with solitary ditches"), drives his settlement beside Mira, the shared search, and the sculpture pivot. Setup, development, and payoff gates all met. Causal pressure: the desire narrows his goal from place-dedication to kinship-web making. Closure linkage: the lattice plan and final dialogue ("not as an intruder but as a thread") crystallize the graft metaphor. Cost: forsaking solitude and exposing vulnerability. Friction: his self-doubt ("intruder") complicates the want. Strong dramatization with visible trade-off and closure charge.</comment>

<question>9 J</question>
<grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>"Luminescent ache" is named once (paragraph thirty-four: "a yearning that was not quite pain, not quite hope") and echoes in imagery ("tender graffiti on the cold air," "glass leaves trembling"). Tone coherence across turns: lyric elevation holds through discovery and dialogue without deflating. Modulation: the ache sharpens at the tag discovery (Mira's laughter, covered mouth) and diffuses into the quiet ending. Closure linkage: the final "tender graffiti" and trembling leaves charge the image with that ache. Cost: the ache itself is the felt price of vulnerability. Minor deduction: single explicit label risks telling; embodied tone in imagery rescues it. Strong tonal control but not mechanically indispensable.</comment>
