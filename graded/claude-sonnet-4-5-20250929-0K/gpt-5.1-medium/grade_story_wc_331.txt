<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mariel's interiority is specific and voice-consistent ("sanely eccentric, which meant her strangeness had methods, catalog numbers, and circulation policies"), and her motivation to find "the place where stories live" drives the nocturnal mapping project. The poet's hesitation at the junction provides embodied tension, but his interior remains opaque—he functions more as observed catalyst than co-protagonist. The final realization ("stories lived wherever someone stood like that") feels partially earned by the scaffolding of star-marked pauses, yet the leap from geometric diagrams to "posture of attention" compresses causality; the insight arrives more by authorial assertion than inevitable discovery. Minor: "fondness" and observational distance flatten potential friction when a choice-point (whether to follow, whether to speak) could have sharpened agency.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—density increases through layered mapping, star-marked pauses, and the poet's arrival; closure is a Conceptual Repricing that reweights the premise (stories live in "posture of attention" rather than physical location). Orientation anchors (who: Mariel; where: library; when: dusk→midnight) land cleanly by the second paragraph. The poet's walk to the "unremarkable junction" provides one meaningful tightening when "the air fold[s] inward," and the final image redefines Mariel's elaborate project with felt cost (all her diagrams collapse into "this simple observation"). The causal chain from mapping→following→realization holds under the accumulative lens, though the conceptual cost—years of late shifts, secret work, tattered scarf as emblem—remains somewhat oblique rather than viscerally paid on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The scientific poetry library is specific and purposeful: "Equations courted metaphors on the spines; volumes of tensor calculus leaned against slim collections of neutron haiku." Spatial choreography is clean (reference desk, stacks, junction of "fiction met fluid dynamics"), and the setting supplies the analog-memories premise. The tattered silk scarf functions as micro-setting/object, present in opening and closure beats, though its constraint on choice is light. The library's "fluorescent quiet" and "floral carpet" filter through Mariel's sensory priorities. Minor: the junction where the poet stops is labeled "unremarkable" yet serves as the conceptual center; a single concrete anchor (shelf label, lighting fixture, carpet seam) would have charged the final image more vividly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake: to find "the place where stories live" is signaled early and pursued through star-marked pauses and hyperbolic diagrams. The poet's arrival and walk provide one meaningful tightening—Mariel follows, the air folds inward, and the junction becomes the answer. Agency is split: Mariel observes and records but does not act decisively; the poet unknowingly catalyzes the revelation. The cost is conceptual—her elaborate methods "had all been elaborate approaches to this simple observation"—and the forfeiture of complexity is felt, yet the price remains more reflective than visceral. Under the Accumulative lens, one pressure point suffices at this length, but higher bands require a visible trade-off or embodied sacrifice; here the cost lives in retrospect rather than on-page consequence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme (the origin of narrative impulse) emerges cleanly from concrete particulars: star-marked pauses, hesitations before speech, the poet's receptive stance. The final image—"stories lived wherever someone stood like that, hesitating on the brink of speech, and the library merely amplified the moment"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in silence and gesture (the poet's blank page, his walk without reaching for a book). The scarf and diagrams recur with shifted meaning. Minor: the phrase "the place before ink, before language, where a story first became aware of wanting to be told" leans toward abstract philosophizing; the story would strengthen if this exposition were cut and the poet's embodied pause trusted to carry the idea.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Mariel's focalization blends librarian precision ("catalog numbers, circulation policies") with poetic compression ("dusk bled into violet," "words rising like steam from the gutters"). Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping. The poet remains externally observed, his interiority inferred rather than accessed—appropriate for the single-POV design. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and diction stays within Mariel's educated, slightly elevated register. Minor: a handful of filter verbs ("she noticed," "she realized," "she felt") in the final third dull immediacy slightly, and the phrase "her diagrams, her scarf, the late hours and the watching, had all been elaborate approaches" reads as summary rather than embodied perception under peak pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "Its threads were frayed from years of late shifts and from brushing the corners of untidy shelves" conveys wear, routine, and tactile world). Sentence openings vary, and figurative language ("air grew cool and grainy, like the texture of old film") is specific. The "observed solitude" tone is sustained through modulated rhythm. Minor artifacts: paraphrase loop between "Most people assumed the library simply stored stories; Mariel suspected it also contained the coordinates of their beginnings" and the next two sentences restating the same idea without added pressure (−0.2). Template-cadence runs of "She + [past verb]" across the middle third (five consecutive openings) create rhythmic monotony (−0.4). "By nine o clock" (missing apostrophe) is a minor copy slip. These do not touch closure but accumulate to −0.6 total.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of hyperbolic geometry, library science, and narrative origin is fresh and voice-specific. The "scientific poetry library" as hybrid space and the metaphor of geodesics bending toward "some unseen center" feel particular to this narrator. The ending's insight—stories live in hesitation rather than archive—is non-obvious and earned in hindsight by the star-marked pauses. Risk: the piece commits to a conceptual premise and follows it without retreat. However, the core frame (liminal librarian seeking hidden truth through arcane method) echoes genre templates (archive-keeper as mystic); the transformation here is strong but not radical. The hyperbolic geometry remains ornamental description rather than a tool with stakes or cost; swapping it for another arcane lens (fractal recursion, quantum states) would leave the emotional arc intact.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mariel frames expectation early (setup), her star-marking and following constrain middle choices (development), and her final realization participates in closure (payoff). She drives two beats: mapping pauses and following the poet. Causal pressure: her method enables the discovery, though the poet catalyzes it. Closure linkage is strong. Swappability moderate: "odd-hour librarian" could become "night archivist" without structural loss. Cost connection: her elaborate work collapses into simplicity, a conceptual price. Late involvement and observer-heavy stance lower the score slightly.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The scarf appears in the opening ("hung her tattered silk scarf on the back of the reference desk chair like a flag") and returns in the penultimate paragraph ("her tattered silk scarf trailing like a comet tail behind her sensible shoes"). Setup and closure-reprise present. However, it is not handled or used between these mentions; no middle beat involves it. It does not constrain choice or alter tactics. The reprise reweights slightly (frayed threads from "late shifts" echo closure's simplicity), but the effect is decorative rather than causal. Swappability high: any marker of dedication (worn notebook, mismatched shoes) would serve equally.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Analog memories appear early ("archive of analog memories, bound in paper and ink"), frame the reawakening project (development: "by tracing these pauses, she could reawaken the analog memories embedded in the building"), and shape closure logic (the library amplifies the moment of story-birth). The concept enables Mariel's theory and guides her method. Causal pressure moderate: it motivates the mapping but does not impose trade-offs. Specificity: "residue of breath, the lingering pressure of unsaid sentences" is vivid. Swappability moderate: "psychic imprints" or "narrative echoes" would function similarly. Cost connection weak: no visible price paid for the reawakening itself.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"Sanely eccentric" is labeled early ("Mariel considered herself sanely eccentric, which meant her strangeness had methods, catalog numbers, and circulation policies") but functions as character color rather than constraint. It does not enable or foreclose an on-page action with cost. The trait is told, not shown through a choice where eccentricity creates friction or advantage. Swappability high: removing the label would not alter any beat. No middle development or closure participation beyond thematic echo. Score reflects presence and voice consistency but minimal causal work.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Reawaken is signaled early ("trying to find the place where stories live" and "reawaken the analog memories"), motivates Mariel's mapping and star-marking (development), and frames the closure realization (the library "merely amplified the moment" of story-birth, a form of reawakening). The action drives two beats: the mapping project and the poet's catalytic walk. Causal pressure moderate: it shapes attempts but does not impose visible cost or narrow options dramatically. Closure linkage strong: the final image redefines what reawakening means. Swappability moderate: "rediscover" or "locate" would function similarly without major edits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Hyperbolic geometry is mentioned early ("reshaping the library itself through hyperbolic geometry," "geodesics," "impossible triangles") and appears in the closure paragraph ("this intersection lay at the heart of several impossible triangles"). However, the mechanics never matter; it remains metaphorical description without on-page demonstration or constraint. No middle beat shows Mariel using the geometry to alter tactics or encounter a cost. Swappability very high: any arcane spatial metaphor (fractal mapping, quantum superposition) would serve identically. The method is ornamental rather than functional.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The scientific poetry library is established immediately (setup), supplies the analog-memories premise and physical resources (shelves, aisles, junction), and the "unremarkable junction" where the poet stops becomes the closure site (payoff). The setting drives multiple beats: Mariel's mapping, the patrons' islands, the poet's walk through "fiction met fluid dynamics" and "planetary sonnets." Spatial choreography is clean and the hybrid collection (tensor calculus, neutron haiku) constrains Mariel's theory. Causal pressure strong: the setting enables discovery. Irreplaceability moderate: a different archive type would shift tone but not structure. Cost connection: the library's amplification is central to the final realization.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"While patrons browse" appears in the opening third and the poet's arrival anchors "by nine o clock" with progression toward "midnight." However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions or create urgency; patrons browse passively, and Mariel's observation proceeds at her own pace. No deadline or clock-driven trade-off alters tactics. The time progression (dusk→nine→midnight) provides structure but not pressure. Swappability moderate: "during evening hours" or "across one shift" would function similarly. The timeframe is present and consistent but does not constrain choice or charge closure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The motivation ("trying to find the place where stories live") is signaled early, dramatized through Mariel's mapping and following, and resolved at closure when she realizes stories live in "posture of attention." It drives two beats (star-marking pauses, following the poet) and shapes the final image decisively. Friction moderate: the desire compels observation but not difficult trade-offs or visible sacrifice; the cost is conceptual (her elaborate methods collapse) rather than embodied. Specificity strong: "the place before ink, before language" anchors the want. Closure linkage excellent. Swappability low: this exact phrasing and conceptual frame are essential to the ending's charge.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Observed solitude" is established in the opening ("a kind of observed solitude that suited her exactly"), sustained through Mariel's watching stance ("she watched them with the fond distance of a keeper observing shy animals"), and modulates subtly when she follows the poet ("at a respectful distance"). The tone coheres through turns and charges the final image (solitude becomes receptive attention). It appears in three beats and reflects Mariel's perceptual filter. Specificity strong: the oxymoron of "observed solitude" is purposeful. However, the tone does not impose constraint or trade-off; it colors rather than pressures. Cost connection weak: no visible price paid for maintaining this stance. Closure linkage good but not indispensable.</comment>
