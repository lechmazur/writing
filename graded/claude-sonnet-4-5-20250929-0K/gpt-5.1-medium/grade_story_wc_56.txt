<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority is strongly embodied and character-particular—"cowardly honesty," the sundial as second heartbeat, the choice to withhold the satchel all feel earned. Internal contradiction appears on-page when the protagonist acknowledges fear yet proceeds, and the final stance (exposing rather than handing over) reflects a hierarchy of values. Minor slip: the backstory about towers and broadcasts remains abstract; a concrete anchor would have tightened motivation. The renunciation at closure forecloses cooperation with visible cost, satisfying the 600–800 word gate.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands on the page as Charged Poise: the protagonist's refusal crystallizes options and reconfigures the relationship with the two men, with cost felt in the dangerous honesty that follows. The inferred lens is Causal with Accumulative texture; each beat (rumor → dive → discovery → confrontation) tightens options through protagonist choice. Orientation is clean by ~100 words (towpath, Lock Eleven, narrator's quest). One meaningful deepening occurs when documents confirm a geometry of deceit, narrowing the narrator's capacity for disbelief and forcing the final stance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Setting constrains choice throughout: the canal's narrowing at Lock Eleven, the torn hull as entry point, and the cold water as tactile barrier all pressure the dive. The sundial and rope function as micro-setting that charges the final image when the gnomon catches lantern light, insisting direction still matters. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered—wet iron, algae-slick paper, barnacled metal. Spatial choreography remains coherent across the dive and surface confrontation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—understanding the architecture of lies versus maintaining comfortable disbelief—is signaled in the opening third and escalates through the protagonist's agency. The dive is a voluntary risk; discovering the blueprints forces a trade-off (salvage capacity for disbelief vs. expose the truth), and the final refusal to hand over the satchel narrows options with visible cost: "dangerous honesty" and the men's narrowed eyes mark the price. One meaningful tightening (documents prove deceit) drives the closure choice, and the rope tug creates mid-scene pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—how we salvage or surrender belief in the face of systematic deceit—emerges from concrete particulars: the barge as literal and symbolic wreck, the sundial insisting on alternate measures, the final act of exposure rather than transaction. The closing image ("dangerous honesty") offers a resonant answer without stating a moral, and the line "I bring them up so they can no longer pretend to be hidden" reweights prior material. Subtext operates in the men's stillness, the narrator's "thoughtfully clear" voice, and the canal swallowing reflections.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct and consistent: metaphors of architecture, geometry, and reading (canal "forgot how to echo," hulls as "teeth from a broken jaw," touch reading braille) anchor the narrator's analytic lens. Psychic distance tightens under water and at confrontation without head-hopping. Voice modulates with pressure—calm surface narration compresses into tactile urgency during the dive—and the recurring "thoughtfully clear" functions as both trait and ironic distance marker. No dialogue issues; the brief exchanges pursue goals and carry subtext.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "Every step was guided by a quiet hunger to understand the architecture of lies" establishes motive, tone, and the metaphor governing perception). Rhythm varies purposefully, and the figurative language—while dense—remains coherent and voice-motivated. Minor deductions: a few filter verbs ("felt hindsight clarity strike") slightly dull immediacy, and the phrase "serene upheaval" in the final sentence risks thematic echo. One near-loop: "thoughtfully clear" and "thoughtful stillness" within close proximity. Still, no major artifacts touch the closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of post-collapse setting, literal salvage metaphor, and epistemological stakes (blueprints of rewritten history) feels specific and non-obvious. The sundial as alternate time-measurement device and the canal as site of rumor-cargo both transform familiar post-apocalyptic tropes. The protagonist's final stance—exposing rather than transacting—grows inevitably from the established character logic. Risk-taking in the dense, metaphor-laden voice heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, though the premise flirts with familiar "truth in the ruins" templates; the specificity of the documents and the narrator's profession elevate it.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The errant legend seeker frames expectation in line three, drives the decision to dive alone (distrust of official salvage), and makes the closure choice to expose rather than hand over. Appears in all three beats and the final confrontation; cost is visible when the narrator accepts "dangerous honesty."</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The sundial appears in beat one (pocket, useless in dark, training instincts reminder), resurfaces at closure when lifted from pocket to signal "direction still mattered." Two touches; lyric reprise reweights stakes at the end, but no mid-scene use or constraint. Charged presence elevates past ornament but lacks causal pressure in the dive itself.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Hindsight clarity shapes stakes throughout: the opening "hunger to understand the architecture of lies" primes it, the dive moment ("hindsight clarity strike, not as comfort but as scalpel") dramatizes it, and the final image ("dangerous honesty") enacts its cost. Drives at least two beats and the closure; removes it and the story's logic collapses.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Thoughtfully clear appears twice: once when hailing the men (voice as confession, marking honesty as vulnerability), again when answering them post-dive. Constrains social tactics—clarity signals exposure risk and makes the men's eyes narrow. Visible cost in the ending beat when that clarity becomes "dangerous."</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Salvage is the narrative spine: the rumored wreck prompts the journey, the dive enacts it, and the final choice redefines salvage as exposure rather than transaction ("I bring them up so they can no longer pretend to be hidden"). Appears in setup, middle dive, and closure confrontation. Swapping it for retrieval or investigation would break the thematic and causal architecture.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Training instincts signaled early ("remind myself that time could be read differently, by training instincts instead of trusting clocks") and enacted underwater when the narrator reads hull contours by touch. Shapes one major beat (the dive) and primes the sundial's symbolic weight. Appears in setup and middle; less visible at closure, preventing higher band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Twilight barge canal pressures all choices: the narrow Lock Eleven forces proximity, the cold water and torn hull constrain entry, the lantern-light finale stages the confrontation, and the canal "swallowing reflections" charges the final image. Present in all beats; removing it breaks spatial logic and symbolic resonance. Specificity (wet iron smell, barnacled metal, opposite bank staging) anchors every turn.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Silence of morning radio mentioned once as a time-measurement frame post-collapse but does not tighten on-page decisions or tactics. The dive and confrontation unfold in twilight-to-ink progression; no live clock alters moves. Functional world-building detail, but swappable with any post-collapse marker.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Understanding the architecture of lies is dramatized in the opening quest, tested in the dive choice ("salvage my own capacity for disbelief"), and enacted in the closure refusal. Appears in all three gates; the friction between wanting truth and fearing its cost creates the final trade-off. Visible price paid on-page.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Serene upheaval established early ("city had entered a phase of serene upheaval"), modulates through the dive (quiet hunger, tactile urgency), and charges the final image ("fragile quiet" yielding to "dangerous honesty"). Coherent through turns; tone shift at closure reflects stakes crystallization. Final phrase risks thematic echo but does not break coherence.</comment>
