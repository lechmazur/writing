<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's interiority is concretely anchored through sensory detail ("water lapped at my calves as if reading Braille from my skin") and the relationship with Dr. Ara Quinn drives meaningful pressure. However, the final choice to "liberate her work into the world above" arrives without visible cost on the page—we see the protagonist adding notes and teaching servers a new rhythm, but no dramatized price paid or path foreclosed. The motivation is clear and the emotional register specific, but the stakes crystallization at closure lacks the felt consequence required for higher bands.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece anchors orientation early (sunken lab, protagonist's role) and builds pressure through the hangman's dice sequence, journal discovery, and final server manipulation. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): "the sunken laboratory no longer felt like a tomb, but like a heart choosing, in calm defiance, to keep beating unseen." The cost is conceptual—the lab transformed from tomb to hidden heart—but the exact on-page sentence making that cost undeniable is the protagonist's coded addition that teaches surveillance routines "into open channels." One meaningful deepening occurs when the protagonist realizes "the true project had never been the lab" but teaching the building to listen. Slight lens ambiguity in the middle (causal detective work vs. accumulative atmosphere) resolves by the end under accumulative logic.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The sunken laboratory setting drives choices throughout: "pipes creaked like old throats," water lapping at calves, the hangman's dice in their rusted box, journals drifting in a wire cage. The environment supplies concrete resources (the dice as map, the servers, the journals) and pressures the protagonist's movement and discovery. The final image of the lab as "a heart choosing, in calm defiance, to keep beating unseen" charges the closure. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency (graphite and salt smell "slammed me back into her orbit") and the body is present in boots stirring silt, reading aloud to dice rhythm.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early: retrieve the journals to understand Dr. Ara Quinn's encryption and liberate her work. The tightening occurs when the protagonist realizes "the true project had never been the lab" but teaching it to listen—this reweights options from data retrieval to active liberation. The final move (adding coded notes to teach servers a new rhythm) is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens. However, the visible price paid is muted: we see the action ("I added my own notes") but not a dramatized cost that forecloses a path—no handler confrontation, no stamina drain, no tactical trade-off made legible on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: encrypting vulnerability as strength, teaching structures to resist quietly, and transforming surveillance into invitation. The concept integrates through Dr. Ara Quinn's dance-as-encryption, the hangman's dice as desperate last conversation, and the lab itself learning to listen. The final image—"a heart choosing, in calm defiance, to keep beating unseen"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in the dice rolls, the dual-layer cipher in journals, and the quiet inversion of surveillance routines. No thematic statement intrudes; the work remains particular to this voice and these objects.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>POV distance is stable first-person; the perceptual signature is distinct (lyrical code breaker filters experience through cryptographic and acoustic patterns: "every shadow moved with mysterious familiarity," "even my own thoughts sounded like distant sonar pings"). Diction remains consistent and voice-motivated, though occasional elevated register ("seahorse graphs," "fractal shorelines") risks drifting from interiority under peak stress. The dice and journal reading sequences show purposeful compression and patterned elision that serve accumulative logic. No head-hopping; psychic distance modulates appropriately with emotional beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes. Information density is high ("To encrypt vulnerability as strength, she said, was to survive without becoming smaller"). However, the piece exhibits template-cadence runs in the middle third: "She had taught me...," "She had been teaching...," "She refused...," "She had been teaching..." clustered in rapid succession. Two paraphrase loops appear: the "explains through dance" motif is restated three times without added pressure (paragraph 20, 21, 32). The metaphor "as a spider spins its web" in paragraph 26 is structurally isolated and adds no causal or imagistic weight. These artifacts do not obscure closure but lower Q7 by −0.6 cumulative.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of sunken-lab setting, cryptographic protagonist, and dance-as-encryption teaching offers a specific, non-obvious angle. The hangman's dice as probability-driven map and the dual-layer journal cipher feel particular to this voice and world. The transformation of the lab from tomb to "heart choosing...to keep beating unseen" is earned in hindsight through the established pattern of Ara's teaching. Risk-taking in structure (accumulative/lyric design with elliptical middle moves) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The piece resists template plot and offers durable insight into encoding resistance as survival.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character "lyrical code breaker" present early (paragraph 4: "They once called me the lyrical code breaker") and shapes the protagonist's approach: reading rhythm in the dice, decoding dual-layer journals, and teaching servers a new cipher. The character's skills enable the middle discovery beat (recognizing the dice pattern matches journal margins) and drive the closure action (adding coded notes to liberate the work). However, the character is established primarily through label and skill application rather than a on-page choice that forecloses a path. Two gates met (setup, closure); middle development is skill-use rather than a choice with cost. Score elevated by causal pressure and closure linkage but capped by absence of a visible trade-off tied specifically to being lyrical vs. purely technical.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Object "hangman's dice" introduced early (paragraph 16: "two cloudy cubes sealed in a rusted windowed box") and used in multiple beats: paragraph 17 (pips shift when protagonist speaks Ara's name), paragraph 22 (pattern matches journal margins), paragraph 25 ("I followed the dice through submerged hallways"). The dice function as map and encryption key, narrowing tactical options and enabling discovery. They appear implicitly in the closure section (the protagonist reads journals "to the rhythm of the hangman's dice"). Three gates met; causal pressure present; closure linkage indirect but legible. Score elevated by beat involvement and specificity but capped below 8.5 because the dice do not charge the final image directly—they enable discovery but do not appear in the lab-as-heart transformation.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Core concept "a calm defiance" seeds early (paragraph 3: "I walked the flooded corridor in a calm defiance") and returns at closure (paragraph 38: "like a heart choosing, in calm defiance, to keep beating unseen"). The concept frames the protagonist's stance throughout: refusing handler expectations, following the improbable dice, liberating rather than weaponizing. It shapes tactics (moving through the lab without panic, reading aloud to dice rhythm) and charges the final image. Three gates met; causal pressure present; closure linkage strong. Score approaches 7.0 band but held at 6.7 because the concept functions more as thematic frame than a constraint that forecloses a specific on-page path—it colors all choices but does not dramatize a visible trade-off tied uniquely to calm vs. frantic action.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Attribute "explains through dance" introduced in paragraph 19 (Ara taught probability through dance), restated in paragraph 20 (watching dice "I saw her again, explaining something desperate through chance"), and paragraph 32 ("In every remembered lecture, she still explains through dance"). The trait characterizes Dr. Ara Quinn's teaching method and provides the conceptual foundation for the lab's final transformation (teaching the building to "dance internally with stress and pressure"). However, no on-page action by the protagonist is constrained or enabled by this trait—it remains a memory and thematic motif rather than a tactical tool with cost. Two gates met (setup, closure thematic presence); middle development is reflective rather than enacted. Score capped at mid-5s by lack of visible protagonist tradeoff tied to the attribute.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Action "liberate" signaled early (paragraph 8: "I had come to liberate what the ocean had taken") and drives the protagonist's goal throughout, contrasting with handlers' data-retrieval mission. The action shapes middle beats (choosing journals over official logs, following dice to central chamber) and defines the closure (paragraph 33: "my task was not to retrieve data, but to liberate her work into the world above"; paragraph 36: teaching servers to translate "surveillance routines into open channels"). Three gates met; causal pressure present; closure participation strong. Score elevated by beat involvement and irreplaceability but capped below 8.5 because the liberation is recounted in summary ("By the time I left...") rather than dramatized with a visible on-page cost—we see the protagonist adding notes but not the stamina, time, or tactical price paid.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Method "via coded journal entries" introduced in paragraph 27 (journals "written twice, once in ordinary language and once in a cipher") and paragraph 29 ("Between them lay another layer...when I read aloud to the rhythm of the hangman's dice"). The method shapes the middle discovery beat (understanding Ara's fear and refusal encrypted in dual layers) and the closure action (paragraph 34: "I added my own notes in the dry margins, working via coded journal entries"). Three gates met; causal pressure present. However, the mechanics of how the protagonist's coded additions teach the servers is summarized rather than shown—we learn the effect ("translated surveillance routines into open channels") but not the specific cipher process or constraint it imposed. Score reaches 6.1 on closure participation but capped by summary execution and swappability (another encryption method could substitute with minor edits).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Setting "sunken laboratory" anchors early (paragraph 1: "the bones of the sunken laboratory") and pressures choices throughout: water at calves limits movement, rusted box holds dice, wire cage drifts journals, central observation dome frames discovery, drowned servers become the liberation target. The setting supplies resources (dice, journals, servers) and constrains tactics (moving through flooded corridors, timing breath). It charges the closure image directly (paragraph 38: "the sunken laboratory no longer felt like a tomb, but like a heart choosing...to keep beating unseen"). Three gates met; high causal pressure; strong closure linkage. Score elevated by irreplaceability and specificity—the story's logic depends on this exact setting's transformation from tomb to hidden heartbeat.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Timeframe "as a spider spins its web" appears once in paragraph 26 ("Metallic groans echoed above me as the structure settled another patient inch into the trench, as a spider spins its web") and does not recur. The simile suggests slow, patient progression but does not function as a tracked time constraint that alters tactics—the protagonist's moves are paced by discovery (dice, journals, servers) rather than a live clock. One gate met (middle mention); no setup or closure participation. The element is ornamental: it characterizes the lab's settling but could be replaced with any slow-process simile without structural impact. Score capped at 3.2 by swappability and lack of causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Motivation "to encrypt vulnerability as strength" introduced in paragraph 12 (Ara's teaching: "To encrypt vulnerability as strength, she said, was to survive without becoming smaller") and drives the protagonist's goal: liberating Ara's encrypted fear and refusal rather than weaponizable data. The motivation shapes middle choices (seeking journals over official logs, understanding Ara's cipher) and the closure action (adding coded notes that transform surveillance into invitation). Three gates met; causal pressure present. However, the friction between the protagonist's want (honor Ara's work) and cost (handler expectations, physical danger) is told more than dramatized—we learn the handlers "sent me for data" but see no on-page confrontation, stamina drain, or tactical sacrifice tied to choosing liberation over retrieval. Score reaches 6.8 on closure participation but capped by lack of visible on-page trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Tone "mysterious familiarity" established early (paragraph 2: "every shadow moved with mysterious familiarity") and sustained through the piece: water tasting for passwords, dice answering in codes never written, Ara's voice in remembered lectures, the lab as both tomb and living heart. The tone modulates with pressure—calm in opening movement, tightening during dice-following and journal discovery, resonant at closure ("a heart choosing, in calm defiance, to keep beating unseen"). The tone charges the final image by making the lab's transformation from death to life feel inevitable yet strange. Three gates met; strong closure linkage. Score elevated by coherent modulation and closure charge but held below 8.5 because the tone is atmospheric rather than a constraint that forecloses a specific tactical path.</comment>
