<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maris's interiority is vivid and embodied ("breath a torn cloth"), and her commitment to archival truth under pressure is consistent. However, her agency peaks early in the descent; the lagoon encounter offers mystical communion more than genuine choice under competing pressures. The final whispered promise feels declared rather than dramatically earned through a visible tradeoff that forecloses an alternative path with cost on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story accumulates symbolic density (diary, debris messages, lagoon) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration—Maris kneels and pledges expanded cataloging, a stance crystallization. Orientation anchors quickly (zeppelin library, archivist, dusk coastline). One meaningful deepening occurs when the diary's code connects to the shore semaphore, reweighting the archive's purpose. Cost is felt in her acceptance of contradiction and the diary's increased weight, though the physical kneel reads more as ritual than a choice that forecloses a live alternative.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The zeppelin library is tactile and purposeful: books sway, shelves bolted to ribs, dangling microfilm ladders ground the descent. The obsidian lagoon—light-drinking, layered with "shipwrecked time"—charges the final image and supplies the debris alphabet that enables the parley. The rope ladder descent functions as both transit and temporal metaphor ("each rung another year"), micro-setting that constrains and enriches the closure moment.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—cataloging silenced protest—is clear early. The diary's encryption and shore semaphore provide one meaningful pressure point that narrows Maris's archival method. However, the lagoon encounter lacks a competing cost or forced tradeoff; Maris's kneel and whispered terms feel more invitational than a choice under duress. The final image reconfigures scope (record wounds and contradictions) with felt weight, but the escalation curve is modest for the length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—voice, erasure, the archivist's ethical stance—emerges through concrete particulars: the woman's boot rearranging flotsam, "KNEEL" and "WITNESS" as choreography misread. The diary's bleeding ink and debris semaphore avoid overt statement. The ending reweights archival duty (letting "the dead argue with the living") without moralizing, and the closing line's increased weight offers resonance tied to prior images. One line—"let the past scorch her, she thought; at least then the record would not lie about the heat"—edges toward thesis articulation but stays rooted in Maris's occupational voice.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: "books swaying like lanterns," "sky poured in like ink." Distance tightens under pressure ("searing reverie welding stranger memories"). Diction is elevated and lyric throughout, matching the conceptual register without rupture. However, the prose maintains high figurative density even in action beats (descent, kneeling), risking slight decorative drag. No dialogue appears; internal voice is consistent and charged, though a few lines ("the past inside felt slightly less alone") approach sentiment without full grounding in image.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm is controlled and syntax varied, with strong images ("dunes stretched…pale as exposed bone"). Information density is high in the opening third. However, figurative language saturates most sentences—metaphor in nearly every line—without clear pattern-teaching or payoff tied to closure pressure. A few phrases loop conceptually: "retrocognitively trapped" is named but not mechanically demonstrated, and "the diary lightened…pages fluttering without wind" echoes prior mystical cues without advancing cause. The closing line is resonant, but mid-section beats occasionally prioritize texture over propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The floating zeppelin archive and debris semaphore offer a fresh synthesis; the encrypted diary as material trace of erased protest is specific and non-obvious. However, the mystical communion with the past—visions, bleeding ink, ghostly woman—follows familiar magical-realism templates. The ending's expanded archival mission is emotionally earned but conceptually predictable. Risk-taking in the lyric register and dual-timeline structure elevates the piece, though the core arc (archivist discovers suppressed history, vows fuller witness) does not fully transform its premise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Maris's decision to descend, kneel, and expand her cataloging vow appears in setup (framing her role), middle (descent choice), and closure (whispered terms). Her choice to "let the past scorch her" drives the descent beat. However, much of her arc is observational—receiving visions, reading debris—rather than deciding under competing pressures. The final whisper alters archival scope but lacks a visible tradeoff or foreclosed path with felt cost on the page.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The obsidian lagoon is introduced early ("glimmered…beneath the dunes"), reappears as Maris gazes down, and the shore around it supplies the debris alphabet for the parley. It charges the final image (Maris kneeling at its edge) and its light-drinking quality reinforces the theme of erasure. However, the lagoon itself does not constrain a choice or evolve across beats; it functions more as atmospheric anchor than active plot element. Strong presence in closure elevates the score.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The encrypted diary is present in setup (wax seal, "Lagoon"), drives the middle beat (symbols bleeding, connection to shore), and pulses hot during the kneeling closure. Its discovery frames the inciting action ("Tonight began after the letters are found"), and decoding it narrows Maris's understanding. However, encryption mechanics are vague—whorls and spirals yield to mystical correspondence—so the concept shapes stakes more thematically than tactically. The diary's increased weight at closure ties cost to the element.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Retrocognitively trapped" is named early as a feared state, and visions slam into Maris twice (buses, water cannons; protesters at the lagoon). The attribute enables her perception of the past but does not visibly constrain a present choice or impose a felt tradeoff. It reads more as a mystical gift than a limiting condition. Cost is hinted ("the tugging behind her eyes") but not dramatized as a price that alters her tactics or forecloses an alternative.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The parley is named early ("invitation to parley"), structures the descent and shore encounter, and the kneeling/whispered terms at closure constitute the parley's resolution. It shapes the story's central action: Maris accepts the past's semaphore invitation and negotiates terms of witness. However, the parley lacks overt conflict or counteroffer; it feels more like acceptance than negotiation. Removing "parley" would require reframing the encounter, so integration is solid but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Arranging beach debris as messages appears in setup (Maris recognizes the pattern from the zeppelin), middle (glass, kelp, shells form "KNEEL" and "WITNESS"), and closure (the woman's boot choreography in vision). The method is specific and causally necessary: without it, Maris cannot read the past's plea. The diary mirrors the debris alphabet, linking the two. The method constrains the parley's form and charges the closure image, making it essential to the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The floating zeppelin library is vividly rendered in the opening third (trembling stacks, dangling ladders, observation deck) and supplies the rope ladder for descent. It frames Maris's role and the story's conceptual space (archive as sky-bound). However, after the descent, the zeppelin becomes backdrop; it does not constrain the shore encounter or return with reweighted meaning at closure beyond the brief ascent mention. Strong setup and atmospheric presence, but limited middle or closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"After the letters are found" is stated early as the inciting moment and frames the diary discovery as the pivot. However, the timeframe functions as backstory anchor rather than live pressure; no clock or deadline shapes Maris's choices on the page. The phrase does not return or tighten tactics. It sets context but does not constrain the present action, so integration is functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The desire to uncover truth in tension is dramatized throughout: Maris's grip on the satchel, her refusal of "sterile distance," her willingness to be scorched by the past. The motivation drives her descent and kneeling vow. Friction appears in the tension between archival objectivity and subjective witness. However, the conflict between wants and costs is more thematic than on-page choice: she never seriously considers refusing the parley or protecting herself from retrocognitive intrusion, so the motivation is consistent but not tested under competing pressures.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Tone is consistently elevated, lyric, and mystical: "sky poured in like ink," "breath a torn cloth," "metallic smell of rain on old pavement." Diction and rhythm remain coherent through turns, modulating slightly under stress (shorter clauses during vision beats). The final image ("the past inside felt slightly less alone") sustains the reverie and charges the closure. However, the tone's uniformity—high figurative density without cadence breaks—risks slight static quality. One phrase ("the diary was heavier, yet the past inside felt slightly less alone") edges toward sentiment but stays within the established register.</comment>
