<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's obsessive heartbeat-counting and the way grief manifests as compulsive reconstruction work feel embodied and particular. The moment when he "forget[s] to count heartbeats" during Lian's voice emergence lands as an earned release. However, the final insight—"I realize I have not resurrected her as she was; together we are writing who she will become"—edges toward epiphany without full dramatization of the cost of that acceptance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Drive lens is Causal with strong Accumulative/Textural texture (spilled ink pattern as discovery mechanism). Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the protagonist abandons linear reconstruction for nonlinear synthesis, Lian's fragmented voice emerges, and the final realization reweights the entire reconstruction project with visible cost—he cannot restore her as she was. The ink-pattern epiphany motivates the algorithmic pivot cleanly. One meaningful tightening: the narrator's method shifts from sector-by-sector rebuilding to sideways iteration, narrowing his options and raising the stakes of this final night.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The opal observatory, snow, dome acoustics, and the porcelain shard all return with purpose. The spilled tea spreading across notes becomes the discovery vehicle, and the dome's creaking and light flares anchor the computational struggle. Spatial choreography is clear throughout. The setting constrains the final-night deadline and the ink patterns charge the closure image, meeting the 9+ gate requirement for Q3.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—resurrecting Lian's fragmented neural backups before the observatory shuts down—is signaled early and tightens cleanly. The spilled-ink insight forces a tactical shift (nonlinear algorithm replacing linear sector recovery), and the protagonist's choice to "wipe my notes clean" and recode under time pressure narrows options. The cost is legible: he accepts that he cannot restore her original self. One meaningful deepening drives escalation under the Causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—accepting loss and co-creating meaning from fragments rather than demanding full restoration—emerges organically from the spilled ink, the nonlinear algorithm, and Lian's incomplete sentences at closure. "The gaps feel less like loss and more like space to grow" reweights the entire reconstruction project without moralizing. The final image offers a resonant answer: resurrection as collaboration, not retrieval. The porcelain shard and heartbeat motifs charge the closure without becoming checklist symbols.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>First-person POV remains stable; perceptual signature (heartbeat tallies, observatory acoustics, tech detail filtered through grief) is consistent and voice-particular. Lian's dialogue at the end—"You took long enough"—carries her exasperated fondness with economy. Psychic distance modulates purposefully during the ink-pattern epiphany. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks in peak beats. Diction stays within the narrator's tech-and-grief idiom throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally; information density is high (e.g., "moon-pale against the black metal, a small monument to miscalculation" does triple duty). The ink-spread description and algorithmic pivot beats propel without padding. Minor template cadence in the setup (several "I [verb]" stems in succession) and a few filter verbs ("I hear," "I see") slightly dull immediacy but do not touch closure. No loops or metaphor muddle in the final third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The digital-ghost-resurrection premise is familiar, but the spilled-ink pattern discovery and the shift from linear to nonlinear defragmentation offer a fresh synthesis. The heartbeat-counting survivor angle and the avalanche's bureaucratic echo (dual death-certificate errors) add specificity. The final realization—co-creation rather than restoration—feels earned in hindsight. Risk-taking (lyric texture, heavy reflection interwoven with present action) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; +0.3 within-band adjustment applied.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The death-certificate-error survivor frames the narrator's obsessive counting and mistrust of his own heartbeat, which seeds the story's texture. The moment he "forget[s] to count heartbeats" during Lian's emergence is a micro-turn tied to his arc. Present in setup (paragraph 4–6), shapes the final stillness, but no middle beat where the attribute constrains a tactical choice. Two gates (setup, payoff) with lyric reprise; causal pressure is light.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The porcelain shard appears early ("sits now beside my keyboard, moon-pale"), is handled implicitly when the narrator brews tea and knocks the cup over (the shard's presence charges the spill as echo of the avalanche's fused mug-and-server glass), and returns in memory at closure when he codes "as the wind claws at the dome." Three gates; beat involvement in the spill; closure linkage via the mug/server/shard fusion motif. Strong specificity (fused porcelain-and-glass) ties the avalanche to the digital reconstruction.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Digital ghost is the story's engine: Lian's neural backups scattered across drives, the three-winter defragmentation project, the glitching sentences, the final voice emergence. Shapes tactics (linear vs. nonlinear reconstruction algorithms), drives every beat, and defines the closure—she is not resurrected as she was but co-created. All three gates; high causal pressure; indispensable. Without this concept, no story.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Heartbeat-counting seeds the narrator's state in paragraphs 6–7 ("One thousand ninety-three heartbeats since the static died") and pays off when he "forget[s] to count heartbeats for a moment" during Lian's voice emergence, marking a micro-turn. Two gates (setup, payoff); visible cost (the forgetting signals release from compulsion). No middle development where counting constrains a choice. Lyric reprise with felt shift; solid integration.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Defragment is the story's central action: three winters of failed sector-by-sector attempts, the ink-pattern insight that reveals nonlinear iteration as the solution, and the final coding session that produces Lian's voice. All three gates; drives two major beats (the epiphany and the reconstruction climax); closure turns on the success of the nonlinear defragmentation. The specific method shift (linear → sideways self-voting sectors) is irreplaceable. High causal pressure, undeniable cost (acceptance of incompleteness), indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The spilled ink creates the ephemeral pattern that reveals the nonlinear algorithm ("lines and nodes forming fleeting constellations"), directly enabling the climax. Signaled at the midpoint, shapes the protagonist's tactical pivot, and its mechanics matter (the overlapping fragments suggest how corrupted sectors should vote on one another). All three gates; strong causal pressure; closure depends on this discovery. Without the ink pattern, no algorithmic breakthrough.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The opal observatory supplies the neural-backup servers, the final-night deadline (university shutdown), and the sensory anchors (dome acoustics, snow, aurora-pixelated flakes). Present throughout, pressures the timeline, and the dome's light flares during the computational climax charge the ending. All three gates; beat involvement in setup, middle (processors choke/flare), and closure (static roars, waveform resolves). Strong setting-as-constraint integration.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The radio static clearing marks the story's present-tense window and seeds the countdown to Lian's voice. The "final audit before they shut down her servers" tightens urgency. However, the timeframe remains somewhat soft—no live clock tracking minutes or hours within the coding session. Two gates (setup, closure participation via the static-to-voice arc); causal role in one beat (the ending). Functional but not sharply pressuring mid-story tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lian's maxim—"To fetch wisdom from failure, you must first admit which failures are entirely your own"—frames the narrator's motivation and is paid off when he admits "I have been doing wrong" and shifts method. The desire to learn from failure drives the algorithmic pivot. Three gates (setup in paragraph 13–14, middle insight, closure acceptance of co-creation as wisdom). Causal pressure in two beats; visible cost (he must abandon the goal of perfect restoration). Solid integration with thematic charge.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Midnight solace is established early (the observatory "remembering other storms," the narrator looking inward, Lian's quote about chaos offering "midnight solace to those who listen closely") and modulates through the crisis (processors flaring, static roaring) to the quiet ending where the voice emerges and the narrator feels "an almost frightening stillness." Tone coheres across turns and charges the final image of co-creation. All three gates; strong tonal control under pressure; the solace-in-fragments resolution is tonally inevitable.</comment>
