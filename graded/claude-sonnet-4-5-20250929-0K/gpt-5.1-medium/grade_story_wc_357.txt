<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lio's interiority is strongly embodied through sensory particulars ("steered by fingertips on bark, by wind on eyelids") and the micro-choices under pressure during the inversion hour show commitment. However, the protagonist's agency is largely observational until the final beat; the discovery moment at the arrow lacks a visible cost or foreclosed path—he reaches out, learns the answer, and the piece ends without showing what he gives up or how this knowledge alters his stance. The memory-vibration sequence ("his first flight, his sister laughing…the moment his home moon cracked") layers emotion concretely, but the closure does not dramatize a meaningful change or endurance with felt consequence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors smoothly by the opening lines (orchard planet, gravity inversion, Lio the pilot). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through escalating sensory density (dust lifts, apples sail, water erupts moss, droplets carry memories) and culminates in the arrow's conceptual reveal. Closure achieves Conceptual Repricing—the arrow as "seed of intention" reweights the planet's resilience as defiant will encoded in water and stone—but the cost remains oblique; no on-page action or forfeiture makes the price unmistakable. The lens holds, yet the final image lacks the sharp sting of consequence that would elevate it into the 8+ band.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Setting detail is vivid, selective, and purposeful: the inverted hour constrains Lio's flight window, the floating arches supply spatial landmarks, and the water's path guides navigation. The moss eruption ("fractal greens… force that accelerates plant growth") and the crown of pierced stones both constrain choices and charge the final image. Sensory hierarchy reflects piloting priorities (wind, sap channels, touch on bark). The orchard terraces, skiff mechanics, and droplet-planets all anchor reader comprehension and drive micro-choices, satisfying the 9+ quick test for environment/object constraint and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding the source of resilience—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens: Lio crosses terraces, passes the forbidden grove threshold, and the water's transformative properties deepen mystery until the arrow reveals defiant intention. One meaningful tightening occurs when he crosses into the hollow and sound vanishes, raising cost through disorientation. However, the arrow's discovery is observational; Lio's agency does not narrow options or force a trade-off on the page. The ending reweights understanding but lacks a visible price paid in the closure beat, capping high-band eligibility.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—resilience as encoded defiance—emerges organically from the arrow, water-memory, and erupting moss without overt statement. The final image ("defiance had sunk into the planet, teaching rivers to climb and roots to drink sky, turning every cycle of loss into fuel") offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior material. Subtext operates through image (droplets as planets, "force that accelerates plant growth") and the protagonist's layered memories. However, the closure leans slightly declarative ("Their defiance had sunk…") where a concrete sensory beat would carry more charge. Strong thematic coherence with minor tonal slip at the end.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>POV distance is stable third-limited; perceptual signature is strong ("steered by fingertips on bark, by wind on eyelids," "air smelled of sap and rain and something older"). Diction remains consistent and voice-motivated, with purposeful elevated register matching the lyric-accumulative mode. Free indirect style is clean. The final paragraph edges toward summary ("he realized… Their defiance had sunk into the planet") rather than staying in embodied perception, and the phrasing "discover what he had come seeking, though not as he had imagined" reads slightly externalized. No dialogue present. Rhythmic control under pressure is excellent until the closure beat's declarative turn.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; openings are diverse, and information density is high without padding. Figurative language is controlled and apt ("sleeping serpents," "constellations drawn in roots"). Minor loop: "water was not just water" and "something older, like stone remembering forests" approach paraphrase without adding pressure. The phrase "discover what he had come seeking, though not as he had imagined" is a scaffolding phrase that could be cut. No major artifact clusters, but the closure paragraph tilts slightly toward tell ("he realized") where dramatized image would sharpen propulsion. Line-level clarity and concision are strong throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The orchard planet with gravity inversion and water-memory is a fresh synthesis, and the arrow as "seed of intention" offers a non-obvious angle on resilience-through-defiance. Tropes (lone pilot, mysterious grove, ancient artifact) are transformed through specific sensory grounding and the water's dual role as guide and archive. The ending feels earned in hindsight, though the arrow's appearance late in the piece (final third) and its relatively static function (pedestal object that pulses and teaches) limit irreplaceability. Risk-taking in structure (accumulative lens, lyric density) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, meriting modest within-band lift.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Lio frames setup (first paragraph), pursues water threads in the middle (navigation choice), and reaches the arrow at closure. He makes two on-page decisions: following the water uphill and entering the hollow. The arrow discovery is observational; his choice to touch it does not alter tactics or foreclose a path with cost. Two beats plus closure presence place the character in mid-band; lack of a choice-driven closure consequence caps below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Arrow appears only in the final third (late penalty −0.5), is handled once (touch at closure), and pulses as a pedestal object without evolving use. It shapes the ending by revealing defiant intention (closure linkage +1.0), and its unique property (etched will teaching rivers/roots) is irreplaceable (+0.5). Missing early signal and middle development; two-of-three gates met (middle weak, closure strong). Causal pressure is moderate—revelation, not tactical constraint. Lands in mid-to-high 6s.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Gathering of echoes" appears explicitly in the hollow ("gathering of echoes that did not touch his ears but his bones") and is implied by water-droplets carrying stored struggles. It shapes one beat (memory vibration) and charges the closure by making defiance legible. Setup absent; middle beat present; closure participation present via conceptual payoff. Two gates met, but the concept does not constrain choice or alter tactics—its role is thematic accumulation. Eligible for mid-5s; closure linkage lifts slightly.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plant-growth acceleration is signaled early ("moss erupted in a heartbeat… shoots thickened into branches"), demonstrated in the mid-section mosaic beat, and contextualizes the arrow's function at closure ("defiance… teaching rivers to climb and roots to drink sky"). Three gates met. It enables one on-page action (Lio observes and infers the force's wildness, altering his caution) and carries conceptual cost (unguarded power frightens him). Specificity and closure linkage are strong; causal pressure is moderate. Solid 7-band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Discover" is the stated goal from paragraph 8 onward and the closure action (touch arrow, learn the answer). It drives the final beat decisively. However, setup is mid-story rather than first third (−0.3), and the discovery itself is passive receipt of knowledge without narrowing options or visible cost. Two-plus gates (middle pursuit, closure enactment) with strong closure linkage (+1.2) but low agency cost. Eligible for mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Navigation by water flow is signaled in paragraph 6 ("navigating by water flow instead of starlight"), actively used in the middle as Lio follows silver threads and sap channels, and culminates at the crown where water surges through arches to reveal the arrow. Three gates met. The method constrains two beats (route choice, threshold crossing) and is causally essential to reaching closure. High specificity and beat involvement. Strong 7-band, approaching 8.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Orchard planet and floating arches anchor the opening, supply spatial pressure throughout (terraces, grove threshold, crown hollow), and frame the final image. The inverted hour tightens the flight window, the arches cast "slow shadows like sleeping serpents," and the crown structure is the pedestal for the arrow. Three gates met with strong causal and closure linkage. Environment constrains tactics (timing, route) and charges the ending. High irreplaceability and beat involvement. Eligible for low 8s.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Gravity inversion is signaled in paragraph 2, triggers the flight in paragraph 14 ("bells of the gravity clocks chimed… world shuddered and turned inside out"), and remains active through the closure sequence. Three gates met. The one-hour window tightens Lio's flight timing (causal pressure +1.0) and supplies the enabling condition for navigation. The clock is not live-tracked beat by beat, lowering urgency slightly. Solid 7-band with strong setup and closure presence.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Motivation to find resilience's source is stated in paragraph 8 and sustained through the pursuit. It shapes middle choices (following water, entering the hollow) and is answered at closure. Two-plus gates (middle, closure). However, the motivation is not visibly conflicted—Lio faces curiosity and caution but no competing want or cost that he must trade off on the page. Desire is clear and goal-directed; lack of friction and felt sacrifice caps below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Whirling silence" appears in paragraph 4 and returns when Lio crosses the threshold ("sound vanished entirely… replaced by a gathering of echoes"). Tone is coherent through lyric accumulation, modulates under pressure (silence deepens in the hollow), and charges the final image with awe and conceptual weight. Three gates met. The tone does not constrain a choice but reweights the ending's resonance. Strong closure linkage and specificity. Mid-7s.</comment>
