<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The negotiator's interiority is concrete and contradiction-rich: the drawer pull functions as both guilt and compass, and the final choice enacts the central tension between selfishness and wisdom with visible cost. The brother's blackened eyes and the spy's nameless status provide embodied stakes. Minor slip: "uncommonly thoughtful" reads as label-only in paragraph 5; the habit is demonstrated through the tallying and angle-turning but the phrase itself is told. The climactic choice forecloses a path (saving the brother) with undeniable emotional price visible in "my brother's gaze broke."</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening lines (parapet, negotiator, moon-phase witness). The causal lens holds: the father's death from a misjudged negotiation → carrying the drawer pull → the present exchange → the uneven bargain → the choice of spy over brother, each turn narrowing options. Closure lands as Decisive Change with felt cost: untethering the lantern becomes the physical enactment of the refusal, and the brother's gaze breaking supplies the emotional price on the page. One micro-ambiguity: the phrase "recycle mistakes into wisdom" hovers between causal motive and thematic assertion, but the choice itself dramatizes it.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The parapet is storm-worn, mist-crawling, with wet granite and broken merlons; sensory detail (sea sound, torch smoke, salt-clotted hair) is woven through pressure beats. The signaling lantern on a frayed cord becomes a micro-object that the protagonist untethers, altering the spatial mood and symbolically cutting the safety line. Spatial choreography (east/west captains, walkway crossings) remains clear. Minor limitation: the Black Coast armor "lacquered like beetle shells" is vivid but ornamental; it does not constrain a choice. The lantern's untethering charges the closure, meeting the 9+ gate test.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—prisoner exchange under uneven terms—is signaled early and tightens when the hooded brother appears, creating a live moral calculus. The protagonist's agency is clear: choosing the spy forecloses saving the brother, with cost visible in "my brother's gaze broke." One meaningful escalation occurs when the Riverhold captain offers the unlisted brother, forcing a choice between repetition (selfishness) and transformation (wisdom). The moon-phase timing and the neutral-ground invocation apply situational pressure but do not themselves narrow options; the core turn is character-driven.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme—recycling mistakes into wisdom versus repeating selfishness—emerges from the father's death, the drawer pull as compass, and the climactic refusal. The interval "between apology and forgiveness" recurs with purposeful ambiguity, reweighted in the final line when the brother's gaze moves to the moon "as if asking it to hurry the distance." The untethered lantern offers a resonant, non-literal answer: the protagonist cuts loose certainty to honor the harder choice. One slip: "an opening begins as a refusal to stay closed" (paragraph 8) edges toward overt statement, though it remains metaphor-adjacent. No moralizing in the final paragraph; closure image does the work.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>POV distance is stable, anchored in the negotiator's perceptual signature: counting steps, tallying hidden costs, the drawer pull's warmth "reminded by my pulse." Diction is elevated but voice-consistent ("furrowed hush," "hunted all of us here"). Dialogue is minimal and functional: "This stone listens but does not repeat" and "I chose the spy" both pursue goals and carry subtext. One small register drift: "recycling mistakes into wisdom" (twice) feels slightly abstract for the narrator's otherwise concrete idiom, though it functions as a thematic anchor. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies; sentence openings shift; figurative language is controlled ("mist crawled," "beetle shells," "grief-stricken mother did not notice missing"). Information density is high in the exchange sequence. Two penalties: (1) "between apology and forgiveness" appears three times across paragraphs 6, 13, and the ending—acceptable as motif but edges toward loop when not functionally reweighted in the middle instance (−0.2). (2) Paragraph 5's "uncommonly thoughtful...a blessing and not a slow form of drowning" stacks metaphor without full coherence (−0.3). The closure beat—untethering the lantern, the brother's gaze—is clean and propulsive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis—negotiation ritual meets personal guilt, neutral ground becomes moral altar—is specific and non-obvious. The moon-phase timing, drawer pull, and untethered lantern combine into a coherent symbolic architecture. The moral calculus (spy over brother) avoids the safety middle and commits fully to its premise. One limitation: the premise of "negotiator whose past mistake killed a family member now faces uneven exchange involving brother" is template-adjacent (classic moral-dilemma frame); transformation comes through the concrete particulars (drawer pull, moon witness, untethered lantern) rather than structural surprise. Risk-taking in the quiet, object-driven closure elevates within band (+0.3).</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The negotiator's role shapes setup (neutral ground, wounded exchange), middle development (invoking the ritual, counting steps), and climax (choosing the spy). The profession enables the moral calculus and the father's death backstory. The choice alters tactics (untethering the lantern as signal) and forecloses the brother's rescue with visible cost. Early signal, three beats, causal pressure, closure linkage, and cost connection all present. Swappability is low: another role would not carry the same ritual authority or access to both sides.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The drawer pull appears in three beats: theft after father's death (paragraph 7), pressed during the opening invocation (paragraph 9), and gripped until it bites skin during the brother's revelation (paragraph 18). It is handled on the page and its warmth/weight anchor interiority. The closure beat does not directly reprise it; the protagonist untethers the lantern instead, so the pull does not charge the final image. Setup, development (two uses under pressure), but no closure participation caps the score. Causal pressure (reminds of guilt/compass) and specificity (tarnished brass oval) add value, but the absence from the ending limits integration.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Neutral territory frames the entire exchange: declared early (paragraph 4), invoked ritually mid-scene ("This stone listens but does not repeat"), and violated emotionally when the brother appears ("supposed neutral territory that suddenly felt like someone's private altar"). The concept constrains options—neither side can act overtly—and sharpens the moral calculus. The untethering of the lantern in darkness enacts the protagonist's break from neutral safety. Setup, development (ritual invocation, spatial staging), closure linkage (altar metaphor and the lantern move), causal pressure, and irreplaceability all strong. The story would collapse without this exact frame.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Uncommonly thoughtful" is named in paragraph 5 and demonstrated through counting steps, turning every angle twice, and tallying hidden costs. It enables the moral calculus (protagonist can foresee repeating the father's mistake) and constrains the choice (the habit becomes "a slow form of drowning"). Setup present, middle development (counting/tallying beats), but the trait does not directly shape the closure action. Cost is visible (the drowning metaphor, the inability to stop tallying), but the final choice hinges more on moral stance than on this specific cognitive style. Swappable with "overly cautious" or "analytical" without major edits (−0.6).</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Untethering the lantern (paragraph 19) is the physical climax: it signals the decision, cuts the safety line, and plunges both sides into darkness, making the refusal irreversible. The action is prepared by the signaling lantern's earlier mention (paragraph 15) and the frayed cord detail. It redefines options—no reversal is possible once the light is gone—and charges the final image ("both captains shifted uneasily, as if I had cut loose more than a lamp"). Setup (lantern on frayed cord), development (decision moment), closure (untether as enactment), causal pressure, and cost connection all present. Removing this exact action would require rewriting the entire closure beat.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Moon-phase synchronization is explained in paragraph 11 ("both kingdoms had agreed that our exchanges would be timed...so the sky, not the clocks, would witness every promise") and reprised in the final line when the brother's gaze moves to the moon. Setup present, thematic closure reprise present, but no middle development: the moon does not constrain a tactic or enable a move during the exchange itself. It functions as atmospheric witness rather than active mechanic. The final image reweights it slightly (brother asking the moon to "hurry the distance"), lifting it above ornamental (lyric reprise), but swappable with any cosmic witness (stars, tide) with minor edits (−0.6). Late first mention (40% mark) also lowers score (−0.3).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The parapet is storm-worn, windblown, mist-crawling, with wet granite and broken merlons. It supplies the neutral ground, the slick walkway for crossings, and the edge where the lantern hangs. Setup early (paragraphs 1–4), development (walkway crossings, torch smoke, edge access), and closure participation (the protagonist walks to the edge to untether the lantern). The setting constrains movement (slick stone, proximity of captains) and supplies the prop (lantern on frayed cord) that enables the climactic action. Spatial choreography remains clear across beats. Causal pressure and closure linkage both strong.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Between apology and forgiveness" is named in paragraph 6 as the interval where history hardens or softens, repeated in paragraph 13 during the pauses between crossings, and reprised in the final line when the brother's gaze asks the moon to "hurry the distance." Setup present, thematic development (the pauses embody the interval), and closure reprise with reweighted meaning (the brother now inhabits the interval). The timeframe does not tighten decisions with a live clock; it is conceptual rather than urgent. Lyric reprise lifts it above ornamental, but swappable with "between grief and acceptance" or similar abstraction (−0.5). No middle beat where the interval constrains a tactical choice.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The motivation to recycle mistakes into wisdom is stated in paragraph 8 and dramatized through the choice: the protagonist sees the brother's offer as repeating the father's doomed treaty (selfishness) and chooses the spy instead, accepting the cost. Setup present (father's death, drawer pull as guilt/compass), development (recognizing the parallel in paragraph 17), and closure (the choice enacts transformation with visible cost in the brother's broken gaze). Friction with wants and costs is clear. One limitation: the phrase "recycle mistakes into wisdom" is told twice (paragraphs 8, 17) rather than purely shown, and the motivation could be rephrased as "avoid repeating the past" without major structural change (−0.4). Cost connection strong.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Furrowed hush" is named in paragraph 7 ("the mood on the parapet was a furrowed hush, a field of brows plowed by sleeplessness and worry") and sustained through the ritual invocation, the crossings, and the pauses. It modulates under pressure when the brother appears (the hush deepens into private altar) and at closure when the captains shift uneasily in darkness after the untether. The tone coheres through turns without flattening. Setup early, middle development (the pauses, "no one laughed"), and closure participation (the uneasy shift). The final image charges the tone: the brother's silent gaze and the hurried moon request extend the furrowed quiet into the ending. Coherence and modulation both strong; specificity ("furrowed," "plowed") is distinct.</comment>
