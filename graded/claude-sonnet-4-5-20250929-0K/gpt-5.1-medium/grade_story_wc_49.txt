<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The tinkerer's motivation is clear and his method of listening and singing coheres with the whimsical trait. However, his interiority remains thin; we see him think "alignment was less about stars and more about people" but few micro-choices under pressure reveal hierarchy of values. The villagers arrive and participate, yet their individual motives and internal contradictions are summarized rather than embodied. The shift from broken village to blossoms opening reads more as external restoration than earned character change with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors arrive cleanly (village gate, arbor at dawn, tinkerer unpacking tools). The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the tinkerer coaxes notes, villagers join, phrases spill into roots, tree straightens, fruit swells. One meaningful deepening occurs when the bowl captures sounds and the pouring completes the cycle. However, the cost remains abstract—no visible sacrifice or foreclosed path for the tinkerer or villagers. The ending delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration (restored practices), but the price paid (what was risked or lost?) is not legible on the page, only the positive outcome.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The arbor is vividly rendered: leaves beaded with silver fog, paths furred with moss, vine tendril curling like a curious finger. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through the tinkerer's attentive stance. The copper bowl, reed flutes, and book of layered leaves function as micro-setting tools that constrain his method. The arbor's spatial choreography remains clear across beats, and the environment (tree, roots, soil) directly enables the closure action when phrases are poured into the soil and the tree responds.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—restore sacred practices without returning to cruelties—is signaled early. Pressure accumulates through the tinkerer's listening, humming, then singing, villagers arriving, and phrases captured in the bowl. One tightening: the copper bowl glows and he pours the phrases into roots, causing immediate transformation. Yet the escalation is more additive than knife-edged; no reversal or trade-off narrows options. The resolution arrives through the tinkerer's action, but what did he or the villagers risk or lose? Generic scene consequence (tree blooms, wells clear) without a visible price that alters later tactics.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: restoration through collective breath and forgotten songs rather than imposed ritual. The copper bowl's spirals, the shared rhythm, and the pouring of captured phrases build a non-literal answer to "how do we repair what is broken without repeating harm?" The final image—blossoms opening like waking eyes, someone laughing through tears—resonates without stating a moral. Subtext operates in the questionsong and the alignment metaphor ("a shared rhythm no one quite controls"). No overt thematic echo or summary mars the ending.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Single-POV close third; no head-hopping. Voice is distinct and controlled: "the whimsical tinkerer," "gathering hush," "watered milk" sky, vine "like a curious finger." Perceptual signature is consistent—he listens, feels grain, coaxes notes. Diction remains within his artisan-mystic register; no corporate or therapy-speak intrudes. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during humming, wider when villagers arrive). Minimal dialogue (implicit in "questionsong" and villagers' hums), so dialogue bullets largely N/A. One minor slip: "someone began to laugh through their tears" loses the tinkerer's direct perception at the peak beat, pulling back when intimacy would serve better.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings shift; figurative language (brass feathers, glass seeds, iron-tasting shadows, branches aching wider) is vivid and mostly coherent. Information density is high in the opening third. However, several beats loop conceptually: "gathering hush" appears three times, "alignment" is explained twice in adjacent paragraphs, and "sacred practices" recurs without added pressure. Template cadence in the middle: "He had learned… He pressed… He smiled, then began… From the path, children arrived… Behind them shuffled…" runs identical construction for four consecutive beats. Filter-verb stack: "he believed," "he suspected," "he thought" cluster without voice-motivated need. Apply −0.6 for template runs and loops; no closure-beat harm.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The premise—tinkerer repairs village through music and collective memory—offers a fresh angle on restoration narratives. The copper bowl that "holds what no parchment would dare" and phrases "spilled back into soil" are specific, non-obvious images. However, the arc (broken place → artisan arrives → gathers community → transformation) follows a familiar template without sharp transformation. The moral calculus (restore without cruelty) is stated but not tested on the page; no character must choose between competing goods. Emotional specificity in the ending (laugh through tears) lifts the final image above generic. Risk is modest; the piece commits to its lyric mode but does not surprise within it.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Whimsical tinkerer appears early, sets down tools, listens, hums, sings, captures phrases in bowl, pours them into roots. His choices (when to hum, how to braid melody, when to tip the bowl) drive three beats and the ending action. However, his decisions feel more procedural than conflicted; no moment where he must choose between competing tactics under pressure. Present across setup, development, closure; causal role in two beats; some specificity (he listens to grain, shifts melody to braid breaths). Swappable with "healer" or "wise woman" with minor edits. No visible cost tied to his choice at closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Vine tendril appears once: curls down, brushes his hair, and his note steadies. Single beat involvement; no reprise or reweighted meaning at closure. It enables one micro-moment (steadying the note) but does not constrain later choices or charge the final image. Setup present, no development pressure, absent from closure. Ornamental use; could be replaced with "branch sway" or "leaf flutter" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>Harvest moon mentioned once in backstory: "under each harvest moon, the people had gathered." No on-page pressure; does not shape tactics or alter options. The story occurs at dawn, not under the moon. Thematic echo only (cyclical ritual), no causal participation. Setup absent (appears in exposition, not present action), no development, no closure linkage. Generic temporal marker; swappable with "full moon" or "winter solstice."</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Spins golden stories from broken things" mentioned once as reputation: "the old folk said he spins golden stories." Label-only; does not constrain or enable an on-page action. His actual method (singing, capturing phrases, pouring into roots) does not dramatize story-spinning with cost. Setup present as rumor, no development, absent from closure. Swappable with "weaves miracles from silence" or "mends the unmendable" without altering plot.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Remedy is the stated task and the tinkerer's action delivers it: he coaxes music, captures phrases, pours them into roots, and the tree/wells respond. Present across setup (unpacks tools), development (sings, villagers join), closure (pouring completes the cycle). Drives two beats and the ending. However, "remedy" itself is generic; the specific method (song + bowl + pouring) is what matters, and "remedy" could be replaced with "healing" or "restoration" without loss. Causal role clear, but the word itself is ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Forgotten songs signaled early ("remedy comes… through forgotten songs") and the tinkerer hums, then sings, villagers answer in old phrases their grandparents muttered. Songs constrain his method (he is "a tinkerer of tools" and "songs were tools"), enable the middle beat (questionsong draws villagers' hums), and shape the closure (phrases captured in bowl, poured into soil). Present in setup, development, and closure; drives three beats. Specific mechanics (tuning, braiding melody, capturing sound) distinguish it from generic "magic" or "prayer." Irreplaceable; removing songs breaks the logic.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Verdant arbor at dawn anchors spatial and temporal orientation immediately. The arbor's leaves, moss, boughs, vines, oldest tree, and roots supply resources across beats: tinkerer presses ear to tree, vine tendril responds, tree's roots receive poured phrases, tree straightens and blossoms. Setting enables the closure action (pouring into roots causes transformation) and charges the final image (blossoms opening, wells beyond the hedge exhaling). Present in setup, development, closure; drives three beats; high specificity (arbor's physical structure matters). Removing the arbor and substituting "clearing" or "hall" would break the nature-ritual logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>When everything aligns is stated as the elders' condition and the tinkerer's realization: "alignment… was less about stars and more about people remembering how to stand beside one another." The moment arrives when "they were all breathing in time" and "this is what the elders meant." Shapes one key turn (the synchronization that enables pouring). Present in setup (elders' instruction), development (he waits, then recognizes alignment), closure (shared breath triggers the act). However, alignment is more conceptual realization than ticking clock; it does not tighten decisions via time pressure. Lyric reprise (early caution → final recognition) reweights the stake. Swappable with "when the moment is ripe" without major loss.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Restore sacred practices stated early as his task and the village's need. The tinkerer's actions (listening, singing, capturing, pouring) dramatize restoration; villagers' arrival and participation show friction between fear (wary parents, cautious elders) and desire. Motivation shapes two beats (unpacking tools, coaxing melody) and the closure (pouring restores fertility). Present in setup, development, closure. However, the phrase "restore sacred practices" itself is summary; the specific want (make trees bear, wells sweeten) and the method (song without cruelty) carry the weight. The motivation is told in exposition and shown in action; no moment where the tinkerer must choose between competing sacred practices. Cost (what is given up?) not legible.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Gathering hush appears in opening ("night thinned toward a gathering hush before dawn"), recurs ("letting the hush gather like cloth"), structures beats (villagers answer "in the gathering hush"), and charges the final note ("the note hung there… breathing in time"). Tone modulates with pressure: quiet waiting → tentative note → thrumming arbor → shared rhythm. Coherent through turns; the hush is not static mood but accumulating presence that enables synchronization. Present in setup, development, closure; shapes three beats. Specificity: "hush" is not silence but anticipatory listening that the story enacts. Removing "gathering hush" and substituting "morning calm" would flatten the participatory logic.</comment>
