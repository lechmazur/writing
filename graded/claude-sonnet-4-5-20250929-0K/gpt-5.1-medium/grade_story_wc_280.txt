<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Marcel's motivation is concrete (encore-seeking, applause as oxygen) and his fractured timeline manifestation is distinctive. Lina's synesthesia provides specific interiority ("old posters fading, all sun-bleached brass and torn velvet blue"), though her micro-choices under pressure remain largely interior assent rather than embodied conflict. The final collaboration choice arrives without visible internal resistance or cost—both characters move toward the same goal without meaningful contradiction between impulse and commitment. The shift from solitary haunting to partnership lacks the friction that would make the choice feel earned rather than offered.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: scattered performance timelines compress toward "one true encore," charged by recurring images (coin, fountain, orchard light). Orientation anchors arrive early (maze, orchard, Marcel's identity by paragraph four). The closure moment—Marcel's "let us try again" and the collaborative Wheel-turning—lands on the page as Charged Poise: options crystallize (intertwine timelines vs. continued fragmentation) with conceptual cost implicit in the phrase "try again" after prior failure. One friction: the cost remains atmospheric rather than specified; we see no foreclosed alternative or visible price in the final image, only the promise of renewed attempt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The orchard setting is vivid and selective: silver pears, dusk-colored plums, cracked fountain, trees in spirals. The hedge maze gate and Marcel's shifting costumes function as micro-setting that charges the final image. Synesthetic sensory hierarchy is consistent and POV-filtered ("citrus-green tang of possibility," "brown-violet musk of old fear"). The spatial choreography is clear across the maze approach and fountain convergence. Lina's tarot coin and the fountain lip provide concrete anchors that pressure the collaboration choice, meeting the 9+ gate test for environment constraining choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: save the theater's stories before demolition, requiring timeline intertwining. One meaningful deepening occurs when Lina reveals the gutting plan, raising urgency and narrowing Marcel's eternal rehearsal into a single collaborative gambit. The Wheel mechanism and Lina's painted coin provide concrete tactics. However, no live option is visibly foreclosed; Marcel's "almost remembered breathing" hints at cost but the trade-off (endless encores vs. one true encore) remains abstract. Agency is present but the price—what each sacrifices by committing—is felt rather than shown in a specific forfeiture.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of fragmentation vs. coherence emerges through Marcel's stacked eras, the theater's approaching erasure, and the Wheel of Fortune mechanics. The tarot coin shifts meaning across beats: time-passing artifact → key → collaborative instrument. Lina's synesthetic perception and Marcel's applause-hunger avoid diagnostic labels and arise from concrete sensory detail. The ending image—hands raised to conduct, "let us try again"—offers a resonant answer to the central question (can scattered time be rewoven?) without stating a moral. One slip: "lure possibility back from the brink of despair" in mid-story reads slightly thesis-forward, though it's filtered through Lina's interior planning.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited through Lina until the orchard encounter, where perceptual signature is strong (synesthetic color-sound blending). Marcel's dialogue arrives as "ghost light rippling across the pears," maintaining voice consistency with his nature. However, diction elevates notably in the exchange: "besides an autograph in ectoplasm," "intertwine your nights properly," "from the brink of despair hovering by the boarded-up ticket booth"—register drifts toward writerly construction under pressure rather than urgent thought. Lina's interior monologue and her spoken/unspoken words are cleanly tracked, but the syntactic uniformity across reflective beats (repeated "she had" openers in the backstory cluster) flattens rhythm.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout: "figure made of footlights and dust motes," "echoes from palms that shattered light like cymbals," "taste burnt sugar and hear it as violet shards clicking together." In the orchard encounter, metaphor stacks without pause (violet shards, pale blue gust, bronze and dark orange chord, green-gold ascending scale), risking coherence under peak pressure. Template cadence appears in the backstory cluster: "She had painted... she had made... she thought... now she knew" across adjacent lines. The coin's mechanics (wheel with gears, amber hope flashing through branches) blend concrete and abstract without always clarifying which is literal. Information density is strong, but the figurative load in the final third approaches ornament.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of stage ghost + synesthetic projectionist + timeline fragmentation + tarot mechanics is specific and non-obvious. The orchard-as-magic-space and the theater-demolition frame are familiar urban-fantasy elements, but the execution through sensory crosswiring and "encore as ontological need" feels fresh. Marcel's costume-flicker visualization (fractured timeline in human shape) is distinctive. One friction: the resolution mechanism—intertwining timelines via collaborative encore—is gestured toward rather than dramatized with unique world logic; the Wheel's function remains abstract. The piece commits fully to its lyric register and accumulative design without retreat, elevating risk within the 7–8 band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Marcel (encore-seeking stage ghost) is present early, drives the orchard scene, and his fractured-timeline state shapes Lina's proposed solution. His final choice—"let us try again"—enables closure. He appears in setup, development (the fountain confrontation), and payoff (conducting gesture). Causal pressure is moderate: his hunger for applause motivates collaboration, but the decision arrives without visible internal conflict or cost specific to him. Two beats (drifting/rehearsing, final assent) and closure linkage place him in mid-range; the swappability test (could another ghost-type work?) leans slightly negative, but his applause-as-oxygen need is specific enough to resist full replacement.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The tarot coin is painted during backstory, handled in Lina's pocket (warming against palm), set on the fountain lip, and lifted/clinked in the final negotiation—four distinct touches across setup, middle, and payoff. Its dual imagery (Wheel of Fortune with spotlight spokes / ruined Pier Star sprouting branches) charges the intertwining concept. Causal role: Lina uses it as the concrete instrument ("a key") to propose the collaboration; its wheel mechanics (gears behind metal, turning under fingertip) enable the timeline solution. Cost connection is present but mild: we see Lina risk the coin's use, not what she forfeits by deploying it. Specificity and irreplaceability are strong; another object would require different mechanics and symbolism.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Fractured timeline (core concept) is embodied in Marcel's simultaneous costume shifts, "every night he had ever performed stacked out of order and playing all at once." It shapes the problem (fragmentation prevents true encore) and the proposed solution (intertwining scattered performances). Present in setup (Marcel's manifestation), development (Lina diagnoses "timelines are fraying"), and payoff (the intertwining attempt). The concept constrains tactics: Lina must address the fracture mechanism, not just summon an audience. Cost is conceptual but legible: scattered time vs. coherent encore involves ontological stakes for Marcel. Irreplaceability high; removing timeline fracture collapses the narrative engine.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Synesthesia (attribute) is signaled early (hearing color in ocean wind), shapes Lina's perceptual signature throughout (burnt sugar as violet shards, bronze-orange chords), and enables communication with Marcel (her words translate to color-sound he hears). Three beats: ocean wind at gate, orchard scent-tracking, dialogue exchange. Development role: her ability allows the negotiation to proceed; ordinary speech wouldn't reach him. Closure linkage is indirect—her trait enables the scene but doesn't appear in the final image. Cost/constraint is minimal; synesthesia is purely advantageous, never a burden or tradeoff. Moderate causal pressure and specificity lift it to mid-range, but lack of visible cost and the ease of its use cap higher scoring.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Intertwine" (action) is the proposed solution: "intertwine your nights properly, make one true encore out of all these scattered performances." Present in development (Lina's pitch) and payoff (the attempt begins). It drives the final turn—Marcel's assent shifts from refusal to collaboration. Causal role is strong: the action defines the narrative goal and shapes the closure image (conducting hands, collaborative Wheel-turn). However, the intertwining itself is not yet executed on the page; we see setup and commitment, not the act's mechanics or immediate result. Swappability test: "weave," "fuse," "merge" could substitute with minor edits, slightly reducing irreplaceability. Two-gate coverage (development + payoff) and causal centrality place it solidly, but lack of on-page execution and moderate specificity prevent higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"By producing echoes" (method) appears in Marcel's backstory: "he chased it through the maze by producing echoes from palms that shattered light like cymbals." Lina hears "faint claps stitched into the leaf-rustle" (echoes remembered by shrubs). Present in setup only; the method does not constrain a middle choice or shape the ending. It characterizes Marcel's solitary attempts but is replaced in the closure by collaborative conducting and Wheel-turning. Functional but ornamental: it colors his haunting without affecting the final tactics or cost. Late absence and lack of payoff application cap scoring despite early signal.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Mystic orchard garden within hedge maze (setting) is present early and houses the entire encounter. The cracked fountain provides a concrete stage for the coin-placing and final negotiation; the apple trees in spirals frame Marcel's manifestation. The maze's gate (padlocked, twisted open) and scent-guided paths constrain Lina's approach. The orchard's brightening in response to action ("the orchard brightened to hear it move") charges the atmosphere and suggests responsive environment. Three beats: gate entry, scent navigation, fountain confrontation. Causal role moderate: setting enables the meeting and provides symbolic resonance (silver pears, dusk plums = magic space) but doesn't directly narrow options at closure. Strong setup, development, and payoff presence with atmospheric contribution place it in 7–8 range; lack of hard constraint on final choice prevents higher scoring.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"After the business closes" (timeframe) is established in the opening and governs when the garden becomes magic and when Marcel can manifest. The constraint is present but passive: nighttime is the enabling condition, not a tightening pressure. No live clock or deadline shapes tactics; the demolition threat (future) provides urgency, not the nightly window itself. Setup strong, but development and payoff do not invoke time pressure. Functional and atmospherically consistent, but easily replaceable with "after dark" or similar framing. Mid-band for presence and coherence, capped by lack of tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Lure possibility back from the brink of despair" (motivation) is stated explicitly in Lina's pitch and drives her proposal to Marcel. Present in development (the pitch) and implicit in payoff (the collaborative attempt). Her desire is dramatized through the coin-painting backstory and the maze journey; Marcel's need (applause-as-oxygen) provides friction. However, "possibility" and "despair" remain somewhat abstract; the concrete stake is "save the theater's stories," and the motivational phrasing leans slightly thesis-forward. Two beats (backstory context, orchard negotiation) and closure linkage via the attempt give it solid coverage. Cost is felt (risk of failure, Marcel's "try again" history) but not sharply specified. Causal role and dramatization lift it to upper-mid; abstraction and slight tell-vs-show imbalance prevent 7+.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rising nostalgia (tone) is coherent throughout: fading posters, old seaside theater, Marcel's eternal curtain call, Lina's memory of slow Tuesday nights. Tone modulates with pressure—wistful in backstory, urgent when demolition is revealed, charged at the collaborative turn. The final image (Marcel raising hands "as if to conduct the orchard") carries both loss (the theater's end) and fragile hope (one more try), layering past and potential future. Tone charges the closure effect by making the stakes emotionally legible: not just timeline mechanics but the weight of forgotten performances and last chances. Strong coherence, pressure-responsive modulation, and closure integration meet 9+ quick-test criteria (tone charges final image). Subtle execution across all beats with no static mood or tonal breaks.</comment>
