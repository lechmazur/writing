<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Liora's interiority is consistently grounded in embodied grief—the broken shell, the act of listening, the choice to accept rather than force the canyon's answer. Her motivation is concrete and her final realization (the canyon keeps what remains, she must teach the living) is earned by the progressive revelations. Minor deduction: some emotional processing reads slightly over-articulated ("grief sharpened within her, clean as the night air, yet some part of her loosened") and at the climax the shift feels slightly summarized rather than acted.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens: Liora's song elicits layered echoes that deepen from obvious to error to the fragile second line, culminating in a flood of voices that reweights her understanding. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (shift from blame to acceptance, from forcing answers to bearing witness) with felt emotional cost. Orientation is swift (canyon rim, night, Liora, her task) and the causal chain of song → echo → flood → insight is clean. The cost is legible: she releases the demand for her sister's full return and accepts fragmentation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The canyon is vividly rendered through sound and pressure ("the canyon became a throat and she stood upon its tongue"), and the shell functions as micro-setting that anchors memory and charges the final beat. Spatial choreography is clear (rim, depths, distant campfires). Minus: the "serpentine nexus" and caravan detail in the opening feel ornamental—merchants and spies are named but never constrain Liora's choice or reappear, and the nexus itself does not materially shape her actions at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—why her sister's voice stopped—is signaled early and drives Liora's choice to sing where no law applies. Pressure accumulates through the progressive disclosure of echoes, and the climactic flood of voices forces her to relinquish blame, a meaningful tightening with felt cost. Agency is clear: she chooses to listen rather than demand, and the final act of singing "as witness rather than judge" forecloses the path of forcing the stone to answer. One small deduction: the resolution leans slightly toward realization over enacted choice in the final beat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the canyon's mechanics (echoes as debts the stone carries, not rewards) and culminates in a non-literal answer: fragility of voice, witnessing over judging. The broken shell returns with reweighted meaning, and the final image (steadier notes, accepting witness) avoids stated morals. The piece resists tidy binaries—some voices are too heavy, others break mid-phrase—without false equivalence. Minor: "the almost she had heard was not a choice, but an absence the stone could not mend" edges toward overt articulation of the theme in a reflective beat rather than allowing the image to carry it alone.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>POV is stable third limited with a distinct lyric texture ("reed-blown melancholy," "knife of grief sharpened within her"). Diction suits the focalizer and modulates with pressure. Deductions: some filter verbs stack in reflective passages ("she realized," "she had heard"), and a few phrases lean into elevated register that risks distancing ("progressive disclosure" feels slightly meta for the POV's lexicon, though it may be intentional stylization). Perceptual signature is strong (sound-focused, attuned to fracture and pattern).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies well and information density is high; the piece compresses backstory efficiently and integrates setting through action. Deductions: several paraphrase loops and stock metaphors ("the universe hums its secret song," "webs of intrigue hanging in the air") appear without strong payoff, and "reed-blown melancholy" recurs as a label rather than emerging through image. One template cadence run in the backstory section ("Voices confided… Every tale… Through them all…"). No loops touch the closure beat, so the Non-closure Accumulation Cap applies (−0.8 for distinct issues).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The canyon-as-witness frame and the mechanics of echoes (debts the stone carries, incomplete patterns) offer a fresh angle on grief and memory. The synthesis of sound, fragmentation, and moral calculus feels specific and earned. Deductions: the caravan/intrigue setup reads template-like and does not transform into the story's core; "webs of intrigue" is stated but never dramatized. The emotional truth and sensory particularity (flute of bone, broken shell, pressure at the edge of hearing) elevate the piece above derivative grief narratives.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Liora's choices drive all key turns: she chooses to sing at the dangerous hour, to speak directly to the canyon, and finally to sing as witness rather than judge. Her perceptual skill (echo singer) enables the progressive revelations and her final stance (ensure the living recognize fragility) grows from the canyon's answer. Present early, active in middle beats, and decisive at closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The shell appears in three beats: Liora carries it, presses it to the ground during the song, and holds it to her ear at the end where it transmutes the canyon's chorus into surf. It is tied to her sister and to the central question. Deduction: its use in the middle beat (pressing to ground) does not visibly alter the canyon's response or Liora's tactics; the final reprise reweights meaning but the causal pressure is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Webs of intrigue" is introduced in the opening via the caravan (merchants, smugglers, spies) but never shapes Liora's choices or the canyon encounter. It functions as ornamental setting detail and does not participate in escalation or closure. The actual core concept in execution is progressive revelation of echoes, which works well but is not the stated element.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Richly perceptive" is attributed to Liora early ("her ears were richly perceptive… sharpened by grief") and enables her to hear the second line and interpret the canyon's flood of voices. It does not impose a visible cost or tradeoff—she never misses a detail or is overwhelmed in a way that alters tactics. Functional but swappable with "sensitive" or "attuned."</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Ensure" appears only in the final realization: "Her task was not to force the stone to answer, but to ensure that the living recognized how fragile their own voices were." It reframes her goal and charges the ending, but it is not tested or enacted on the page—Liora does not take a concrete step to ensure anything. Moderate closure linkage; late arrival and summary-only use lower the score.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Progressive disclosure is the story's engine: first obvious echoes, then errors, then the fragile second line, finally the flood. Each layer arrives because Liora waits and listens, and the method shapes her understanding and final stance. Signaled early ("the canyon never gave her everything at once") and mechanically integral to escalation and closure. Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The "serpentine nexus under starlight" is named in the opening but functions mainly as atmospheric backdrop. The canyon rim and depths are more causally active (Liora sings at the rim, echoes rise from depths). The nexus does not constrain her choice or supply a resource that alters outcome. Present, logically consistent, but replaceable with "canyon edge" or similar.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"While the universe hums its secret song" appears once as the framing for Liora's vigil ("the hour while the universe hums its secret song"). It sets tone and urgency but does not function as a ticking clock—no on-page pressure shows time running out or the hour ending. The choice to wait until this hour is noted, but the timeframe itself does not tighten tactics. Lyric presence with modest causal weight.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The motivation "to learn why some people echo, and others vanish into silence" is stated early and drives Liora to the canyon, to sing, and to demand an answer. The canyon's revelations directly address it, and her final shift (from demanding to witnessing) shows friction between her want (full answer, sister's return) and the cost (accepting absence). Strong setup and closure linkage; causally active across beats.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Reed-blown melancholy" is named twice and permeates diction and rhythm throughout: the opening voice, the flute circling melody, the grief that sharpens and loosens, the steadier yet still melancholy notes at the end. Tone modulates (from demand to acceptance) without breaking, and it charges the final image. Coherent, purposeful, and integral to closure effect.</comment>
