<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's interior is specific and embodied: grief that "narrowed everything to a single note," foam spirals triggering memory of Leo laughing. The turn from seeking forgiveness to inviting Leo's absent judgment into each decision is earned, and the final prototype passing stress tests delivers visible relief rather than triumph. Minor slip: the chrysalis moment ("something in the husk mirrored her new polymers") edges toward convenient symbolic alignment without enough dramatized friction beforehand.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece builds pressure through foam-pattern study, resin redesign, and evening walks until the prototype's success delivers Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant: guilt loosening into "something more spacious"). Orientation is clear by paragraph four. Cost is legible: she carries the chrysalis to the ravine, holding grief's transformation rather than erasing it. One micro slip: the station director's congratulation beat feels like a planted contrast rather than organic pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The braided ravine constrains her insight (foam lines thin at splits, tighten at merges) and charges the final image when she returns the chrysalis there. The research station, Leo's old bench, and the spectrometer anchor space. Spatial choreography is clean throughout. Does not quite reach 8.5: the ravine's physical properties could press harder on her resin-design choices mid-story; here it mostly frames reflection.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—atoning for Leo's death by reimagining the resin—is signaled early and tightens through foam study to prototype testing. The turn from asking forgiveness to inviting Leo's judgment is a meaningful deepening. The prototype passing violent stress tests delivers visible cost (relief, not triumph) and forecloses the path of self-punishment. Minor gap: the middle weeks compress ("she designed polymer strands...") without on-page friction or setback to test commitment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme—separation as distance shaped by flow, not absence—emerges from river observation, polymer redesign, and the chrysalis as form once filled. The final image (holding the husk to fading light, hearing a "rough, forgiving chord") reweights guilt into spacious possibility without stating a moral. The sentence "to translate separation into connection" risks direct statement but is framed as "both an equation and a prayer," maintaining subtext. No false equivalence; Leo's death remains a loss, not tidily redeemed.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization is stable and distinct: "symphonically minded," hearing harmonies in molecular weight and river foam. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (tight at the chrysalis discovery, wider during prototype testing). Minor register drift: "architecture of a divergent path chosen differently" and "the woven murmurs of water and wind" edge toward elevated diction that slightly exceeds the established voice under peak pressure, but remain legible and voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies well; sentence openings shift. Information density is high in foam-pattern beats. Two modest slips lower the score: "She realized her project was not merely technical; it was the architecture of a divergent path chosen differently" is a paraphrase loop (the prior paragraph already stated this insight), and "loosened grief" / "grief loosened" / "her guilt loosen" recurs without pattern-teaching. No filter-verb stacks or template cadence in peak beats. Clarity remains intact at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The polymer-chemist-as-grieving-sibling premise is fresh, and the foam-study method is specific. The turn from structural plastic to bridging medium that can "unzip and rejoin" is a non-obvious synthesis. Risk: the lyric "rough, forgiving chord" ending could feel too neat, but the prior particulars (chrysalis, prototype, ravine) earn it. Slight derivative tilt: grief-plus-science-epiphany follows a recognizable template, though execution is strong and lived-in enough to transform it.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Polymer chemist present throughout; drives the resin redesign, signs approvals (setup), abandons conference supervision (causal), requests sabbatical, reimagines the resin mid-story, watches prototype pass stress tests (closure). Occupation shapes every key turn and the final relief. High irreplaceability and causal pressure across three beats.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Empty chrysalis discovered mid-story, carried back to station, placed on Leo's bench, then carried to ravine at closure. Two distinct beats (discovery, final return) with charged reprise that reweights transformation theme. Does not constrain a mid-scene choice or alter tactics; functions as lyric accent rather than causal lever, preventing higher score.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Divergent path is the story's spine: Mara chose conference over supervision (past divergence), now "turning existing fractures into channels for safer flow" (present reframing). The phrase "architecture of a divergent path chosen differently" articulates stakes. Shapes resin design (bonds that unzip/rejoin) and final stance. Present in setup, development, and closure with high causal pressure and specificity.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Symphonically minded introduced early ("hearing harmonies where others heard only data"), enables foam-pattern insight (mid-development), but does not visibly constrain a choice or create friction. The trait colors perception throughout but remains descriptive rather than cost-bearing. Present in two beats with closure linkage (hearing the "rough, forgiving chord"), but swappable with "pattern-seeking" or similar without breaking logic.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Atone drives the entire arc: Mara returns to the station "to atone for the fracture," traces foam as penance, stops asking forgiveness, redesigns resin to prevent future disaster. Every major turn traces to this motive. Present in setup, mid-development (shift from forgiveness to inviting judgment), and closure (guilt loosening, not erasing). High causal pressure, irreplaceability, and cost connection.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Insight gained tracing foam patterns signaled early (paragraph beginning "At first it felt like penance"), mechanics shown on-page ("foam lines thinned and wavered...swirls tightened"), and the insight ("separation was not absence, only distance") directly enables the resin redesign. Present across setup, development, and closure participation. Does not score higher because the foam study itself feels slightly expedited; we see result more than struggle.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Braided ravine is the story's spatial and thematic anchor: Mara stands at the lip (setup), traces foam patterns there every morning (development), walks it evenings to speak to Leo, and carries the chrysalis back to its edge at closure. The ravine's physical behavior (channels split/merge) directly informs the resin insight. High beat involvement, closure linkage, and causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Timeframe phrase "as the pieces fall into place" appears once, late, as a narrative marker during the resin-design insight. Does not tighten decisions or track progress on the page. The story spans "years after the accident" to "months later" when the prototype succeeds, but the phrase itself is ornamental and swappable. Late introduction, no causal pressure, no closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Motivation "to translate separation into connection" is dramatized as the core insight mid-story, shapes the resin redesign (bonds that remember former partners), and charges the final image (guilt into spacious possibility). Friction is present: she stops seeking forgiveness, invites Leo's judgment instead. Visible cost in the shift from asking to describing work. Present across setup (implied), development (articulated), and closure (enacted).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Loosened grief is the story's tonal spine: opens with "It was loosened grief that finally drove her back," modulates through foam study and evening walks, and resolves in "her guilt loosen into something more spacious" at closure. Tone shifts under pressure (from penance to inviting judgment to relief) without breaking coherence. The final "rough, forgiving chord" charges the image. Strong closure linkage and modulation across the arc.</comment>
