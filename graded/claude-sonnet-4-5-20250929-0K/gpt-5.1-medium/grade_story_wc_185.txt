<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The mapkeeper's interiority is richly embodied through tactile and sensory choices (pressing the stone to his tongue, reading walls like Braille), and his goal remains consistent under pressure. Micro-choices—pausing to let resonance strike, following fracture-patterns—reveal a hierarchy of values tied to his craft. The ending choice to conjure hush is earned by prior sensory mapping and the teacher's remembered wisdom, with visible cost in the stillness forged against chaos. Minor deduction: the energy beings remain abstract antagonists without on-page friction that would test internal contradiction more sharply.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly within the opening paragraph. The piece accumulates density through layered sensory beats—thunder, ice fractures, luminous spores—culminating in the mapkeeper conjuring the bloom of hush, a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant) where stillness is "forged" against the storm's invasion with the cost made visible in the final image: "a great soft-edged emptiness that cupped the storm-sound and held it like a hammer finally laid down." One meaningful deepening occurs when the stone's fractures mirror the mapkeeper's heart, tightening the stakes before the conjuring act. No causality breaks; the inferred lens holds.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The harmonic caves constrain movement and choice throughout: the veined ice curtain forces the mapkeeper to read crack patterns as a navigational grammar, the throat chamber's spiral dictates stone placement, and the luminous spores provide the invisible music that powers the conjuring. Sensory detail is purposeful and POV-filtered (iron, wet basalt, ozone, terror on the tongue). The cave's resonance charges the final image by providing the anvil against which quiet is hammered. Micro-setting (the echo chamber stone, the ice sheet) functions as both tool and constraint, meeting the 9+ gate requirement.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—finding quiet in a storm wired with intention—is signaled early and remains coherent under the Accumulative lens. One meaningful tightening occurs when the energy beings' voices pour inward and ricochet, forcing the mapkeeper to forge stillness with greater urgency ("breathing in time with the dimming and brightening of the stone"). The bloom of hush is a renunciation of volume and a stance crystallization with visible cost: the protagonist must hold stillness against chaos, a price legible in the final image. Agency is enacted through attention, craft, and endurance rather than decisive confrontation, fitting the lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—the weight and necessity of quiet against invasive noise—emerges entirely through image and action: the echo chamber stone, the ice fractures as grammar, the bloom of hush as a forged thing. The teacher's aphorism ("Quiet is heavier than noise...must be forged") is earned and integrated rather than moralizing. The final image reweights the premise non-literally: stillness becomes an active, cupped emptiness, a craft response to beings who "mistook volume for presence." No thematic echo or sermonizing mars the ending. Subtext operates in the mapkeeper's silence, the stone's hum, and the irony that energy beings cannot understand hush.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: the mapkeeper reads walls like Braille, tastes the cave on his tongue, and judges resonance "the way a smith judges metal by the sound of its outrage." Diction is consistently elevated yet grounded in craft idiom (ribs, marrow, anvil, forged). Psychic distance tightens under pressure without head-hopping. Purposeful compression in phrases like "the underthought of the world" and "hammered repose" charges the prose without obscuring clarity. No filter-verb stacks or register drift mar the high-pressure beats. The voice remains singular and coherent throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Information density is high; nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character craft, or stakes. Rhythm varies purposefully (short clauses at peak pressure, longer breath during sensory mapping). Minor deductions: a few decorative flourishes approach overwriting ("ghost movements of glaciers," "reversed snowfall") and one near-paraphrase loop in the opening (storm as verdict/weather/intention). The closure beat is clean and propulsive. No template cadence, no major loops, no clarity loss. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent; the final metaphor (hammer laid down) recharges the anvil motif without muddle.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The "energy beings" premise risks familiarity, but the story transforms it through the mapkeeper's craft lens: quiet as a forged thing, sound as navigable grammar, stillness as active conjuring. The echo chamber stone's sensory use (pressed to tongue, humming, fracturing) and the ice-reading method feel specific and non-derivative. The final image—hush as a "spreading petal of absence"—offers a fresh synthesis. Risk-taking in the accumulative structure and dense sensory layering heightens stakes without gimmickry. Minor: the energy beings themselves remain abstracted, limiting the story's challenge to genre templates.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The ripple-mark mapkeeper drives every beat: entering the caves, tasting the stone, reading ice fractures, placing the stone at the spiral's heart, and conjuring the bloom. His choices narrow options and alter tactics throughout. Present in all three gates (setup, development, payoff) and causally essential to closure. High irreplaceability; no near-synonym character could replace him.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The echo chamber stone appears in at least four beats: awakening behind the ear, pressed to tongue (taste/knowledge), pulsing confirmation at the ice curtain, and placed at the spiral's heart where it drinks spore-music and fractures. It enables the conjuring and charges the final image. Present in all gates, with evolving use and high causal pressure. Near-indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The bloom of hush is the dominant stake from the opening ("to conjure something they could not understand") and is enacted in the final paragraph where it opens inward as "a spreading petal of absence" that cups the storm. It redefines the story's central question and alters the mapkeeper's stance under pressure. Present in setup (signaled early), development (implicit in his sensory gathering), and payoff (explicitly conjured). Strong causal role and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Gently luminous" describes both the echo chamber stone and the spore spiral. The stone's glow enables navigation and signals its awakening; the spores' luminosity marks the conjuring site and provides invisible music. The trait constrains choices (the mapkeeper follows the glow, places the stone where spores sing) and appears in the closure beat. Causal role is moderate; the luminosity matters but is not fully irreplaceable (sound alone might serve). Two gates plus closure participation; decent specificity.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Conjure" is the climactic action, signaled early ("to conjure something they could not understand") and enacted in the final paragraph ("began to conjure the bloom of hush"). It redefines the mapkeeper's stance and forecloses passivity with visible cost. The verb's magic-craft connotation fits the cave's sensory logic. Present in setup (stated goal), middle (implicit in preparation), and payoff (explicit act). High causal pressure and closure linkage; difficult to swap without breaking the story's idiom.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Examining crack patterns in ice occupies a full beat: the mapkeeper scrapes the ice curtain, reads fracture grammar, maps patterns against his own heart's fault-lines, and uses the result to navigate. This method shapes his route and primes his understanding before the conjuring. Present in setup (method introduced) and development (enables passage), with oblique payoff (the conjuring itself mirrors this reading). One strong causal beat; decent specificity. Cap slightly for lack of direct closure participation beyond metaphor.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The harmonic caves are indispensable: they dictate movement (ice curtain forces reading, gap requires sidewise slip), provide resources (spores, resonance), and supply the acoustic logic for conjuring hush. Every major beat occurs within or because of cave features. The throat chamber's spiral determines stone placement; the cave's resonance opposes the storm's invasion. Present in all gates with high causal pressure and closure linkage. Removing the caves breaks the story entirely.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the energy beings arrive" is established early and provides the story's premise: storms now carry intention, and the mapkeeper must counteract them. It shapes the dominant stake and the urgency of finding quiet. Present in setup (opening exposition) and implicit throughout (the storm's invasion drives the final conjuring). However, it does not tighten tactics or create a live clock; it functions more as backdrop than active pressure. Two gates (setup, payoff via thematic presence) but limited beat involvement and no visible cost tied directly to the timeframe itself.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The motivation "to find the quiet in the storm" is stated early ("someone had to remember where stillness used to live") and dramatized in every choice: entering the caves, reading resonance, following fractures, conjuring hush. It drives the protagonist's stance and forecloses alternatives (he does not flee or confront the beings). Present in all gates with strong causal pressure. Cost is legible in the final image (forging stillness against chaos). High integration; the motivation is irreplaceable and charges closure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Hammered repose" as tone appears explicitly in one phrase ("settled against the ribs like hammered repose") and implicitly throughout: the prose balances weight (anvil, forged, smith) with stillness (hush, bloom, petal). The tone modulates under pressure—denser, shorter clauses when the storm invades—and charges the final image where the bloom is "forged" like metal. Coherent across beats and purposeful at closure. Strong but not fully indispensable; the story could sustain a different tonal metaphor with minor edits. Present in setup, development (via craft diction), and payoff (the forging metaphor culminates).</comment>
