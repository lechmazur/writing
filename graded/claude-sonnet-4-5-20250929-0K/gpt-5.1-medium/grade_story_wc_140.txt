<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's interior world is rendered through specific, embodied perception—salt smell, rope roughness, metallic taste—that accumulates sensory memory in lieu of conventional psychological arc. The central choice to write a new certificate "in pencil" with a blank name line carries weight, though the journey there leans heavily on reflection rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The renunciation of his "old story" is earned by the accumulation of overheard fragments, but the final gesture feels more like acceptance than a choice that forecloses a live option with visible cost. Interiority avoids therapy-speak and remains concrete, anchored in port textures.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches its pattern early—layering sound over sight, rumor over rust—and maintains coherence through accretion of sensory fragments. Orientation anchors (port city, narrow room above customs office, container maze) appear within the first third. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): writing a new certificate with "pending" death date and blank name line, accepting unfinishedness as a deliberate stance. Cost is felt—he lets go of retrieval and commits to dispersal—but the final image could charge harder; the poison label reprise and pencil detail provide texture without a sharp reweighting of prior stakes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The port's towering container labyrinth is rendered with specificity—crooked aisles of steel, frozen waves, sound folding and echoing—and directly shapes the protagonist's walks and listening practice. The poison label under cracked glass, the customs office room, and tide rhythms all recur and constrain his routine. The final beat returns to the room beneath the label, grounding the closure in a micro-setting that has accumulated meaning. Sensory detail (salt, diesel, gull cries) is filtered through the protagonist's archival lens, and the setting's textures charge the ending image without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—how to exist as an officially erased person—is signaled early and sustained through accumulative pressure: collecting fragments, layering memories, timing walks to tides. The piece operates under an Accumulative lens, so escalation reads as density increase and pattern break. The voice calling his "paper name" from a swinging container is the clearest tightening, a moment when external reality intrudes on his self-constructed archive. The final act of writing a new certificate is an endurance choice with felt cost (he leaves the name blank, accepts incompleteness), though the escalation could drive harder agency; much of the arc is observational accretion rather than narrowing options under direct opposition.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme—identity as provisional, bureaucracy's power to erase, memory dispersed across strangers—emerges organically from the protagonist's sensory layering and the poison label's emblem status. The final image (blank name line, "pending" death date, "erased histories accumulating") offers a resonant answer to the central question without moralizing: he claims unfinishedness as a stance rather than solving erasure. Subtext operates in silence, gesture, and the recurring motif of sound folding through container walls. The piece resists tidy resolution and invites reflection on archived versus lived experience, with the protagonist's refusal to "pin stories into lies" embodying the theme through action and restraint.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with a distinct perceptual signature: "he filters reality differently, through misfiled forms and overheard breaths." Diction remains consistent—nameless, textural, accretive—and modulates appropriately under pressure (the swinging container beat tightens syntax: "The syllables struck him like hail"). No head-hopping. The prose carries a lyric, archival texture that fits the protagonist's stance, and filter verbs ("he thought," "he wondered") are used purposefully to anchor reflection without dulling immediacy. Distance control is clean, and the final lines ("In the nameless dark, layered with other peoples memories, he let the next story begin") hold voice and rhythm through closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally, with shorter beats during the container-voice moment and longer reflective blocks that anchor in present stimuli (walking, staring at the label). No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs. Information density is high—most lines do multiple jobs—though some mid-passage reflection ("He decided that to discover the texture of memories, he had to forget chronology") leans slightly toward tell without immediate micro-choice payoff. Figurative language (frozen waves, manufactured cliff, sound traveling strangely) is coherent and voice-motivated, not overwrought. Grammar and tense are clean; no pronoun ambiguity. The final image is concrete and purposeful, recharging the poison label and blank-line motif without over-explanation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The premise—a death certificate error survivor who becomes an archivist of erased histories in a port labyrinth—is specific and non-obvious, synthesizing bureaucratic horror, sensory memory, and dockworker folklore into a singular vision. The poison label as emblem of disappeared facts and the protagonist's method of layering sensation over chronology transform familiar identity-erasure tropes through concrete, lived detail. The final act of writing a new certificate in pencil, with a blank name line and pending death date, is an earned inflection that grows from prior material. Risk-taking in structure (accumulative, reflection-heavy) heightens thematic resonance without obscuring clarity, though the concept's execution leans more on atmosphere than bold causal surprise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Setup: protagonist introduced as "death certificate error survivor" in opening lines. Development: his status as erased drives his move to the port and his listening practice (mid-passage beats). Payoff: the voice calling his "paper name" and his final choice to write a new certificate both tie directly to his error-survivor identity. Causal pressure: his erasure enables his nameless archival work and his final renunciation. Cost: accepting unfinishedness is legible. The character drives the key turn (writing the new certificate) and shapes the closure image. Two-beat involvement, strong closure linkage, and causal necessity lift this above functional.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Setup: label introduced in market scene (mid-first-third). Development: pinned above bed, "an emblem of disappeared facts"; he stares at it one evening until letters blur. Payoff: he writes the new certificate "on the back of the poison label, in pencil" and lies beneath it in the final lines. Two distinct beats (purchase/pinning, writing on reverse) and strong closure linkage. The label's specific history (vanished ship, missing manifest line) charges its symbolic weight. Swappability is low—no generic object could carry the same disappeared-fact resonance—but the label does not constrain a middle choice with cost, only recurs as emblem and writing surface. Causal pressure is moderate; closure reprise is purposeful.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Setup: "archivist of erased histories" established early. Development: the concept shapes his method (collecting fragments, layering stories, refusing ink) and his understanding of bureaucracy's power to erase. Payoff: "erased histories accumulating beyond the reach of any archive" appears as cause-of-death on the new certificate, directly charging the closure image. The concept drives his stake (how to be unfinished on purpose) and his final choice. Causal pressure is strong—his erasure and his archival practice are inseparable—and the cost (accepting dispersal, leaving name blank) is legible. Three-beat involvement and high closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Setup: "he filters reality differently, through misfiled forms and overheard breaths" in first third. Development: the trait enables his perception of "layers of abandoned stories" and his method of layering sensation (roughness of rope, metallic taste). Payoff: implicit in the final image—his nameless, accumulative stance is the filtering trait made concrete. The attribute is character-particular and shapes his archival practice, but it does not constrain a choice with a visible tradeoff on the page; it functions more as perceptual signature than actionable ability. Two-beat involvement, moderate causal pressure, closure participation is oblique.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Setup: "he layered each overheard fragment with a physical sensation" introduced in first half. Development: the layering method is dramatized across multiple beats (salt smell, diesel hum, rope roughness, metallic taste) and defines his archival practice. Payoff: the final lines describe him "layered with other peoples memories" as he lets the next story begin, directly invoking the layering action. The action drives his transformation from passive receiver to active curator and shapes the closure's texture. Three-beat involvement, strong causal pressure (layering is his method of becoming unfinished), and high irreplaceability—no other verb captures the accretive, textural logic as precisely.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Setup: "by collecting fragments of overheard stories from dockworkers and passersby" in first third. Development: the method is shown across beats (voices through container walls, market seller's story, Spanish laughter, whispered threat). Payoff: the final paragraph references "other peoples memories" layered into him, the cumulative result of his collecting practice. The method shapes his daily walks and his decision to avoid ink (not wanting to pin stories into lies). Two distinct beats, strong causal pressure (the collecting enables his archival identity), and moderate closure linkage (implicit rather than directly invoked in the final image). Specificity is high—overheard fragments are his unique material.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Setup: "towering labyrinth of shipping containers" introduced early with vivid detail (crooked aisles, frozen waves, manufactured cliff). Development: the setting shapes his walks, his listening practice, and the voice-from-container beat. Payoff: "the port shuffled and sighed around him" in the final lines anchors closure in the setting's breathing rhythm. The labyrinth's acoustics (sound folding and echoing) enable his archival work and constrain his movements (timing walks to tides). Three-beat involvement, strong causal pressure (the maze is integral to his method), and high closure linkage. The setting is irreplaceable—no generic city could offer the same contained, echoing soundscape.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Setup: "He timed his walks through the maze across the rhythm of tides" in first third. Development: tides recur as metaphor (harbor at low tide, tide inhaling and exhaling) and frame his routine. Payoff: the new certificate lists death date as "pending, revised daily by tides and passing voices." The timeframe provides rhythm and recurs in the closure image, but it does not tighten decisions or create a clock that alters tactics. The tides function more as atmospheric pattern than as active constraint. Two touches (walks, final certificate line), moderate thematic weight, but low causal pressure. Swappability is moderate—another cyclical timeframe could substitute with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Setup: "to discover the texture of memories" stated mid-passage. Development: the desire drives his decision to forget chronology, layer sensation, and avoid ink. Payoff: the final act of writing a new certificate and accepting unfinishedness is the desire's resolution—he discovers texture by becoming texture. The motivation shapes his method and his final choice, with visible cost (he renounces retrieval of his own past). Two-beat involvement, strong causal pressure, and clear closure linkage. The desire is told rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses in scene, which keeps it from reaching the high band, but it is character-particular and drives the arc.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Setup: "nameless identity" established early (name as provisional, placeholder, erased). Development: the tone of namelessness pervades his archival stance, his refusal to write things down, and his final choice to leave the name line blank. Payoff: "In the nameless dark, layered with other peoples memories, he let the next story begin" directly invokes the tone and closes the arc. The tone is coherent through all turns, modulates with pressure (tightens during the container-voice beat), and charges the final image with undeniable resonance. Three-beat involvement, strong causal pressure (namelessness is both condition and chosen stance), and high closure participation. The tone is indispensable—the story's logic hinges on identity as erasure and incompletion.</comment>
