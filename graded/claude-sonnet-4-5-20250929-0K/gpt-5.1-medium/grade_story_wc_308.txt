<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's interiority is specific and concrete—"weathered resolve settled over him like dust"—and embodied choices accumulate throughout (stone selection, skimming angles, spinal alignment). Internal contradiction appears in the tension between the ferryman's historical reverence and his need to adapt ("rivers had dried, and only sound still flowed"), driving micro-choices. The final stance crystallization (understanding his location through stillness) is earned by the accumulated sensory and conceptual work, though the closure moment lacks overt struggle or visible renunciation that would elevate cost legibility.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The piece establishes a clear Accumulative/Textural lens: density increases through layered echoes, the flock's shifting pattern, and the arrowhead's "remembered direction." Orientation anchors (canyon, dusk, bone towers) arrive early. The closure—Resonant Reconfiguration via Charged Poise—lands on the page: "he finally knew where he was" reconfigures the wandering pulse into a coordinate system with conceptual cost (the surrender of physical journey). One meaningful deepening occurs when the skimmer realizes the pulse is "not his alone but the residue of countless choices never completed," which reweights his task and narrows his tactical options to stillness.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The bone towers function as micro-setting that constrains choice: their hum guides the protagonist's spinal alignment, and the echoes map spatial coordinates without movement. Sensory detail is selective and urgent—"each gust drew out a low chord," "flat slab," "layered dust"—and filtered through the skimmer's professional attention. The final image directly charges closure: "every echo a coordinate, every silence a path" converts setting into navigational tool. The canyon's physicality (vertebrae, ribs, hollow cages) is specific and irreplaceable, shaping both the skimming method and the protagonist's realization.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake—learning to navigate without moving—is signaled early and tightens through one meaningful deepening: the realization that the pulse he carries belongs to "countless choices never completed" raises the cost from personal quest to historical resolution. Agency is clear in the decision to skim stones at specific angles and the final choice to "let them map themselves around him." The tightening forecloses the path of physical travel with felt cost (renunciation of the horizon "he would never need to reach"), and the flock's shifting formation externalizes the pressure to reorient his method.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the stone-skimming practice and the arrowhead's "unspent intention": the question of how to complete abandoned trajectories without physical pursuit. The final image—"he finally knew where he was"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights stillness as active navigation. Subtext operates throughout: "waiting was his first discipline" and "a tool...was a sentence the past tried to finish in the future" avoid stating the theme directly while charging the ending. The motif of the wandering pulse recurs purposefully, constraining choices and accumulating pressure rather than serving as decorative repetition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: the skimmer reads currents in sound, interprets bird formations as text, and appraises objects for "remembered direction" rather than monetary worth. Diction is controlled and voice-motivated—"weathered resolve," "nibbled yet unbroken," "ringing layers"—with rhythmic modulation at pressure points (short clauses during stone-skimming, longer syntactic expansion during the spinal alignment). Psychic distance tightens appropriately at closure. No dialogue is present; focalization remains clean with no filter-verb stacks or head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Information density is high: most sentences advance character, atmosphere, and the mapping conceit simultaneously ("He chose seven stones, each a different tone when struck, and laid them in a small crescent before the arrowhead"). Rhythm varies purposefully, accelerating during the stone-skimming sequence and breathing during reflection. Minor template cadence appears in the middle third with repeated "He [verb]" openings across four consecutive sentences, costing −0.4. No paraphrase loops or metaphor muddles touch the closure beat, and the final image ("every echo a coordinate, every silence a path") delivers high specificity without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of stone-skimming navigation, sonic cartography, and the "pulse left wandering" feels specific and non-obvious; the arrowhead's dual role as historical talisman and directional anchor personalizes a quest-for-orientation premise. The risk—building a story almost entirely on sensory accumulation and internal realization—heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The turn ("to navigate without moving was to let the world rearrange itself around a still point") grows inevitably from the skimming practice and bone-tower acoustics. Transformation is evident: plot and arc would collapse with generic placeholders.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The harmonic stone skimmer is present throughout and makes key choices: stone selection (seven tones), skimming angles, and the final decision to align with the bone rib and "let them map themselves around him." The closure turn—understanding location through stillness—is his realization. Setup clear, development drives two beats (stone selection, skimming execution), closure participation direct. Cost: renunciation of physical journey. High causal pressure and irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The stone arrowhead appears in setup (drawn from satchel, "trying to appraise...its remembered direction") and payoff (hand placed over it to let "the air between skin and stone hum with gathered echoes," triggering the realization of unspent intentions). It is handled in two distinct beats and its conceptual function (historical trajectory made tangible) matters, but it does not constrain a middle choice or alter tactics during the skimming sequence. Lyric reprise reweights meaning but mid-development beat is absent.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The pulse left wandering is signaled early ("a pulse left wandering all his life"), shapes tactics (following it "from city to salt-flat to ruin"), drives the middle realization ("not his alone but the residue of countless choices never completed"), and is resolved at closure ("guided by a pulse no longer left wandering, he finally knew where he was"). It constrains the protagonist's method (seeking bearings, not destination) and supplies the dominant stake. Three-beat involvement, high causal pressure, closure linkage direct, cost clear.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Historically reverent appears in setup ("historically reverent, and carried the tools of his forgotten predecessors as careful talismans") and motivates the arrowhead's presence and the skimmer's waiting discipline. It constrains his method (honoring past techniques) but does not visibly enable or foreclose a choice with on-page cost. The trait colors his perception but remains largely label-level without a dramatized tradeoff in the middle or ending.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Appraise appears early ("trying to appraise not its worth but its remembered direction") and recurs when the skimmer places his hand over the arrowhead to let echoes gather, triggering the key realization about unspent intentions. The action is specific (seeking directional memory, not value) and irreplaceable to the closure turn. Two-beat involvement, clear causal link to the final understanding. Cost is conceptual (relinquishing commercial or practical valuation).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The method is introduced early ("his teachers had shown him how to think through the patterns in a flock of birds in flight"), applied in the middle beat ("He watched their changing formation and understood...the canyon was teaching him to move his attention, not his feet"), and shapes the closure realization (the flock's "long river of wings" mirrors the flowing coordinate system). Mechanics matter: the birds' spiral and tilt externalize invisible currents. Three-beat involvement, causal pressure high, closure linkage strong.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The bone towers provide the acoustic structure that makes navigation-by-echo possible: they return differentiated notes ("each call answered by a different hollow"), hum against the skimmer's spine at closure, and supply the "ringing layers" that become coordinates. Setup immediate, development beat (stone-skimming angles chosen to query specific towers), payoff direct (spinal alignment and final map). Removing the towers collapses the story's logic. High specificity, indispensable causal role, cost tied to their constraint.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Centuries of layered dust appears as atmospheric detail ("through centuries of layered dust the old beds still whispered their shapes") and metaphorically at closure ("weathered resolve settled over him like dust"), but does not tighten a decision or alter tactics on the page. Time depth is thematic (historical accumulation) rather than an active pressure. Setup present, closure echo weak, no middle constraint. Swappable with "ages" or "eons" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The motivation to navigate without moving is stated early ("waiting was his first discipline, the foundation of learning to navigate without moving"), tested in the middle realization ("to navigate without moving was to let the world rearrange itself around a still point"), and achieved at closure ("he finally knew where he was" without traveling). It drives stone selection, skimming method, and the renunciation of the horizon. Friction between desire (to know location) and cost (surrender of journey) is clear. Three-beat involvement, high causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Weathered resolve is signaled midway ("weathered resolve settled over him like dust") and coheres with the tone of patient accumulation throughout (waiting, layered echoes, slow gyre of birds). The tone modulates subtly under pressure—short clauses during skimming, expansive syntax at closure—and charges the final image of stillness as achievement. Stable mood without static flatness. Present in closure beat, supports thematic weight, but does not undergo a decisive shift that reweights prior material.</comment>
