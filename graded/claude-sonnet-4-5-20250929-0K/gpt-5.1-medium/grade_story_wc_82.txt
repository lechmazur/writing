<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Liora's motivation is clear—grief over her lost daughter—and the ritual of capturing dreams is established early. However, the actual interior contradiction remains largely abstract; she "tells herself she folds grief to keep it from rotting," but we don't see competing impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final choice to polish the daughter's memory and fold cranes feels inevitable from setup rather than emerging from dramatized struggle. Embodied emotion appears intermittently ("her heart feels flayed") but is often displaced by metaphor.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a pattern of grief-work through dream recording, shadow detachment, and gem polishing that converges at closure when Liora transforms her daughter's memory into paper cranes. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): she finally engages the memory she has "refused to distill," and the cost is legible—"her heart feels flayed" and the cranes "carry a sliver of grief, sharpened but bearable." Orientation anchors (Liora, floating island, twilight, post-shadow-detachment) land early. One meaningful deepening occurs when she presses the memory to the copper wheel and the scene clarifies. The textural accumulation holds, though the causality between steps (shadow detachment → basilica waiting → gem polishing → crane folding) relies more on ritual logic than because/therefore linkage.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The floating island tea garden, glass basilica, and moss-soft table are vividly rendered with sensory specificity ("steam twisting like uncut paper," "transparent stone"). The setting constrains choice: Liora must wait until twilight, the basilica "waits for her," and the spiral bridge is climbed with ritualized purpose. The copper wheel and molten glass function as micro-setting tools that enable the gem-polishing transformation. Spatial choreography is clear across locations (garden, basilica, bridge).</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: confronting the memory of her daughter's death that she has "refused to polish." One meaningful tightening occurs when the basilica "hums above her, a throat clearing before confession, and she knows delay is another cruelty." Agency is renunciation of avoidance—she carries the memory to the workbench, polishes it despite the pain, and transforms it into cranes. The cost is visible: "her heart feels flayed, luminous torment pouring through each newly sharpened facet." No antagonist is required; pressure is internal and situational. The escalation reads as accumulative intensification (shadow detaches → locket opens → memory clarifies → transformation) rather than a causal narrowing of options, which fits the textural lens but limits the felt urgency.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—grief as labor, transformation of pain into something bearable and transmissible—emerges organically from Liora's actions (dream recording, gem polishing, crane folding) without overt statement. The final image of cranes "crowded with fragile, radiant birds" and "the kingdoms sleep unknowingly beneath a sky of folded sorrow" offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of how to carry unbearable loss. The locket, the copper wheel, and the rice paper recur with reweighted meaning. Minor slip: "she tells herself she folds grief to keep it from rotting, to turn ache into architecture" edges toward thematic echo, though it's early enough not to flatten the ending.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV with a consistent psychic distance and a lyric, elevated register ("only the possibility of them, thinned by years of hesitation"). Perceptual signature is clear—Liora notices ritual objects, memory mechanics, and emotional weight. No head-hopping. However, diction occasionally drifts into poetic abstraction that feels more authorial than character-specific ("darker the higher it climbs," "a throat clearing before confession"). The voice modulates appropriately under pressure (shorter syntax when she opens the locket, longer when reflecting). Free indirect style is clean.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and figurative language is dense but mostly controlled. However, overwriting appears in clusters: "steam twisting like uncut paper," "a blade polished on thunder," "a second, burning moon," "petals unfolding into sheets of glowing rice paper." In the climax paragraph, three metaphors compete without physical coherence (glass opens like a flower into rice paper—how?). Paraphrase loop: "grief...to keep it from rotting, to turn ache into architecture" restates the same idea. Template cadence: multiple "she [verb]" stems in the final third. Information density is high, but clarity occasionally yields to ornament. Apply −0.6 for density and coherence slips in peak beats, and −0.2 for the paraphrase loop.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of dream recording, gem polishing, and origami crane folding as grief-work metaphors is specific and non-obvious. The floating-island setting and shadow-detachment ritual avoid stock fantasy tropes. However, the "grieving artisan transforms pain into beauty" arc is a recognizable template, and the piece does not fully transform it through an unexpected moral calculus or lived constraint that reshapes the premise. The ending—cranes migrating to kingdoms below—feels earned but anticipated. The boldest choice is the tactile mechanics of memory-polishing, which grounds the metaphor in sensory detail.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Present throughout. Liora makes key decisions: waiting until twilight, opening the locket, carrying the memory to the workbench, polishing it, folding cranes. Her choices create the closure turn. However, much of the action is ritualized rather than emergent from in-scene conflict, so agency reads as enacting a known pattern rather than improvising under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Setup: introduced early ("rises a glass basilica"). Development: "waits for her" signals expectation; she climbs it and hangs the lantern inside. Payoff: the crane-folding occurs in the basilica rafters. The object enables the closure ritual but does not constrain earlier tactics or undergo visible transformation itself—it is a setting for the action rather than an actor in it.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Setup: established in first third as Liora's livelihood ("captures their nightmares in molten glass"). Development: shapes her ritual knowledge and the mechanics she applies to her own memory. Payoff: the daughter's memory is treated as a dream to be distilled. The concept drives the central action (polishing and sealing memory in glass) and the stakes (confronting what she has refused to record). Causal pressure is strong.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Present in one sentence: "Like everything here, it descends while ascending, darker the higher it climbs." This describes the shadow's motion but does not constrain a choice or recur with reweighted meaning. Ornamental world-building detail.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Setup: implied early via her craft (capturing dreams, making lanterns). Development: she transforms the memory-stone into glass, then "commands it to transform" and it "opens like a flower...into sheets of glowing rice paper." Payoff: the transformation produces the cranes that constitute closure. The action is the mechanism of the ending and could not be swapped. However, the physics of glass-to-paper is unexplained, relying on fantasy logic introduced late.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Setup: "Gem polishing, the old masters called it" signals the method. Development: "she presses the memory against the wheel, and sparks of seawater leap...the scene clarifies." Payoff: the polished memory becomes the material for the cranes. The method shapes the central beat and closure. However, it is metaphor rather than tactile procedure—no resistance, failed attempts, or cost in the polishing itself.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Setup: anchored early (floating island, tea garden, moss-soft table, tea bushes). Development: she works at the tea-bush workbench. However, the garden does not constrain choices or supply resources that alter outcome—it is backdrop. The spiral bridge and basilica do more work than the garden proper. Mid-band for presence without pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Setup: title phrase used in opening and again: "It is the first evening after the shadow detaches from her own feet." Development: twilight triggers her ability to work ("Only then does the sky feel hollow enough"). Payoff: the ritual completes "tonight." Time frames expectation and marks the occasion as singular, but does not tighten decisions or create a countdown that alters tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Setup: "she tells herself she folds grief to keep it from rotting, to turn ache into architecture." Development: the desire to transform pain drives her decision to finally polish the daughter's memory. Payoff: she folds the cranes. The motivation is consistent and dramatized through action (opening locket, pressing memory to wheel). However, internal conflict between wanting to preserve and wanting to release is told more than shown in contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Tone is coherent throughout: elevated, elegiac, suffused with beauty and pain ("luminous torment," "flayed," "radiant birds"). It modulates subtly—more abstract in setup, sharper when the locket opens, softer at closure. The final image ("glowing softly, transformed at last") charges the ending with both light and sorrow. However, the tone is maintained rather than reconfigured by pressure, trending toward a single sustained mood.</comment>
