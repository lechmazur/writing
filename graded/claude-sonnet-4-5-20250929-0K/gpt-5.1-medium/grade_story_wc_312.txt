<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Tamsin's interior contradictions operate in scene: brittle devotion paired with earnest naivete drives her to promise repair despite clear incompetence. The micro-choices (taking the bell, kneeling at the viaduct, speaking to it) embody her flaw—naivete with teeth—and the final act of "letting it ring" forecloses her faith's fragility with visible cost. Embodied emotion is strong ("brittle devotion...baked thin and hard by small humiliations"), though the closing image leaves agency slightly abstract. Minor slips: the transition from sensing drip rates to "letting it ring" compresses cause slightly, and the final stance shift could be more viscerally earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story builds through lyric density—drip rates, cosmic imbalance, brittle faith—toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Tamsin perceives the ocean's tilt and lets the bell ring, crystallizing her devotion's cost without full resolution on the page. Orientation anchors cleanly by ~100 words (Tamsin, viaduct, dawn, broken bell). The escalation is a deepening rather than causal reversal: her peculiar gift (drip sensing) aligns drops and reveals systemic delay, then she acts. Cost is felt ("whatever you were meant to tell the sea, you also tell me") but the final image's consequences remain oblique—pressure is undeniable, yet the "letting it ring" lacks a concrete sensory payoff that would anchor full closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The viaduct functions as micro-setting: arches as "ribs holding up the sky," the plinth's iron bracket as "empty throat," and the sea filling the bell constrain Tamsin's ritual. Sensory hierarchy reflects her magical focus (drip rates, barnacle dents) rather than tourist catalog. The bell's physical handling across beats (cradled, leaned toward the drop, water overflow) charges the final image. Spatial choreography is coherent throughout, and the setting's folkloric claim ("bridge listened to tides...world's balance counted drop by drop") directly scaffolds the closure choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: restore cosmic balance via the broken bell, signaled early and pursued throughout. One meaningful deepening occurs when Tamsin closes her eyes and aligns drip rates, narrowing her approach from generic repair to her peculiar gift. The tightening forecloses brute fixing (she cannot weld or conjure bronze) and forces her to count drops—a renunciation of conventional power with visible trade-off. Agency is clear (her choice to kneel, lean the bell, speak to it), and the final act reweights the imbalance. However, the stakes remain somewhat abstract; the cost of "letting it ring" lacks concrete on-page consequence beyond perceptual shift, keeping escalation solid but not viscerally charged.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme—devotion meeting cosmic indifference, competence via limitations—emerges through particulars: lukewarm spells, a useless gift (drip sensing), and a promise to a bell. The ending offers a non-literal answer: understanding failure rates can restore balance, and small devotions matter even when brittle. Subtext operates in "I cannot make you whole...but I can help you finish" and the bell's silence-as-sound. No moralizing; the final image (ocean tilting, storms leaning wrong) reweights prior humiliations without sermon. Minor slip: "brittle devotion...baked thin and hard" edges toward on-the-nose metaphor but stays grounded in her instructors' sighs and tepid fire.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: Tamsin notices drip rates, barnacles, and dents as causal factors, not decoration. Diction ("lukewarm mage," "brittle devotion...baked thin," "naivete had teeth") is voice-consistent and purposeful, modulating from wry self-awareness to lyric intensity at closure. Free indirect style is clean ("She had laughed at that story as a child. Today she hoped the story had not laughed back"). Psychic distance tightens under pressure (closing eyes, listening to drops) without filter clutter. Rhythmic control sharpens in the final paragraph without obscuring clarity. No head-hopping, no register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies sentence by sentence; openings shift naturally. Information density is high: most lines advance character, atmosphere, or stake. Figurative language is controlled ("arches...a rib of stone," "bracket jutted like an empty throat") and purposeful, though "brittle devotion...baked thin" and "naivete had teeth" cluster in one paragraph, edging toward density. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; propulsion is smooth. Minor artifact: "the peculiar gift that every examiner had politely called useless" is slightly expository mid-passage, and "Steam rose from her cuffs, not from power, but from last nights rain" (missing apostrophe) is a copy slip. Overall clarity and concision are strong, with no line-level drag touching closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The synthesis—minor magic (drip sensing) restores cosmic balance—feels non-obvious and earned. Tamsin's "useless" gift becomes essential, and the premise (folkloric viaduct + broken ship's bell) is fresh within fantasy conventions. Voice particularity ("lukewarm mage," "naivete had teeth") avoids generic templates. However, the "mage with small/wrong magic discovers it matters" arc is recognizable; the transformation lies in specificity (drip rates, barnacle dents, tides arriving late) rather than structural boldness. No proximity echoes or false complexity. Risk-taking is moderate: lyric accumulation and quiet closure are well-executed but not structurally audacious.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Tamsin frames the inciting decision (taking the bell, promising repair), pursues the goal across the viaduct, and makes the final choice to align drip rates and let the bell ring. Her agency drives all three beats and the closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The bell appears in beats: washed ashore (setup), cradled across the viaduct (development), leaned toward the drop and filled with sea water (climax), and "let...ring" (closure). Its drowned silence and missing tongue constrain Tamsin's approach and charge the final image. Irreplaceable and causally active throughout.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Brittle devotion" shapes Tamsin's interiority ("baked thin and hard by small humiliations") and her promise to the bell, framing her motive. It constrains her willingness to act despite obvious incompetence. Present in setup and closure reflection but not tested as a tactical trade-off in the middle beats; more thematic accent than on-page friction.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Earnestly naive" drives Tamsin to promise cosmic repair and to trust folkloric claims, enabling the plot. It costs her credibility ("reprimanded by her instructors") and is embodied in action (taking the bell, speaking to it). However, the naivete does not create a distinct middle complication; it enables rather than constrains, and the cost is mostly backstory.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Rebuild" is mentioned as impossible ("could not weld it, could not conjure missing bronze") and redirects Tamsin to her drip-sensing method. The action frames the problem but the story pivots to *finishing* the bell's note rather than literal rebuilding. The verb's mechanics are present but the execution redefines it into metaphor, weakening causal necessity.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"Understanding dripping rates" is seeded early (bucket-of-sand test), becomes the method in the climax (listening to each drop's pace, aligning them), and enables the closure ("drops slowed, aligning themselves"). Mechanics matter: barnacles and dents alter rates, and Tamsin's counting lets her "finish" the bell's note. Indispensable and causally active.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The viaduct supplies the plinth, iron bracket, and folkloric rule (balance counted drop by drop) that scaffold Tamsin's ritual. Its arches and sea proximity constrain her method (leaning the bell to fill it). Closure depends on this location. However, "at dawn" is atmospheric; time pressure is absent and dawn's light does not alter tactics, so the full phrase scores lower than the viaduct itself.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"After the last fish is caught" appears once in the opening as mood-setting ("the sea beneath yawned in slow tides after the last fish is caught"). It does not tighten decisions, create urgency, or return with reweighted meaning. Ornamental and swappable.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"To right a cosmic imbalance" drives Tamsin's promise, her journey to the viaduct, and her final act. The motive is dramatized through the bell's "silent gasp" and her perception of misaligned tides. Friction appears when her limited power forces renunciation of direct repair. Cost is felt in her brittle faith ("once cracked it might never hold again"). Present in setup, middle choice, and closure with visible trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Plausible impossibility" coheres throughout: lukewarm magic, folkloric viaducts, drip-counting as cosmic repair, and the ocean tilting. Tone modulates from wry self-awareness ("disappointing sorcerer") to lyric intensity at closure ("weight of the oceans tilt toward her") without breaking credibility. The final image charges the premise with felt pressure, and the tone supports rather than undermines the accumulative closure.</comment>
