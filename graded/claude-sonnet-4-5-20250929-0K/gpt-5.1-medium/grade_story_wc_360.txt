<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's desire to learn "the mathematics of emotion" drives choices across the piece, and interiority is embodied through concrete sensation ("chest tightened," "taste the iron"). Mara's trait of borrowing personalities is vivid and consistently enacted through speech and posture. The final stance shift—"the sudden triviality of my old, tidy grief"—is earned by the transposed empathy sequence, forecloses the old framework with visible cost, and feels character-rooted. Minor: Mara remains slightly opaque in motivation; we see her actions but not the contradictory impulse beneath them.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure arrives on the page as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the narrator stands inside the printed geometry, experiences transposed empathy, and returns with reweighted grief—"its variables stolen and returned in unfamiliar order." Cost is visible: the old grief becomes trivial, a conceptual price that forecloses the tidy narrative. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: density increases through layered imagery (topaz type, halo fragment, geometry), and the final cadence shift reweights the dominant stake. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land within the first ~100 words. One meaningful deepening occurs when the narrator presses the lever and the geometry manifests, narrowing the emotional equation from abstract to embodied.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The topaz workshop, halo fragment, and press constrain the central action: the narrator cannot access transposed empathy without them. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—"amber sheen, drinking in what little starlight remained"—and filtered through the narrator's urgency. The halo fragment's "pale fire" and "faint chorus" recur and charge the closure image when the narrator touches it and enters the geometry. Spatial choreography is clean: Mara at center, tables with type, the press, the fragment's position all track. The vanishing stars provide a live environmental constraint (timeframe) that tightens the window for this work.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—understanding the mathematics of emotion—is signaled early and tightens when Mara instructs the narrator to "choose a feeling you cannot solve." Agency is clear: the narrator selects the unsolvable moment, pulls the lever, and touches the halo fragment, each step narrowing options and raising cost. The printed geometry complicates the goal by offering not comprehension but transposed empathy, and the final cost is felt: "the sudden triviality of my old, tidy grief" forecloses the narrator's prior framework. Escalation is driven by protagonist choice under the Accumulative lens; pressure coheres through the sequence of actions and deepens at the touch of the halo.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—grief as rigid arithmetic versus fluid, borrowed perspectives—emerges through the concrete sequence: topaz type, printed geometry, transposed empathy. The narrator's opening desire and closing reweighting frame the question without stating a thesis. The halo fragment and vanishing stars recur with shifted meaning: stars dying transpose empathy, and the fragment focuses residue into equations. The final image—"its variables stolen and returned in unfamiliar order"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer rooted in prior particulars. Mara's borrowed personalities and deliberate ambiguity ("scattering half-truths until my own certainties cracked") embody the thematic solvent without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Single first-person POV with stable, character-particular perceptual signature: "language felt fragile under that kind of attention," "defiance taste familiar." Diction is controlled and voice-motivated—"lucid turbulence" tone achieved through elevated but legible metaphor ("borrowed personalities like jackets," "drawer everyone rummaged through"). Under peak stress, compression sharpens: "The mechanism sighed… a soft, devastating finality." No head-hopping; narration respects what the narrator can know and infers Mara's motives carefully. Minor: a few filter verbs ("felt like," "seemed to") where immediacy could be stronger, but they remain within the reflective voice and do not dull the closure beat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; openings are diverse. Information density is high: most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "She did not look up when the last of the star-dust wind slipped in with me" anchors action, atmosphere, and relationship dynamic). Clarity holds across figurative language; no mixed metaphors. Minor scaffold appears in a few adjacent lines with similar stems ("Mara claimed," "Mara insisted," "Mara smiled") and slight paraphrase in the mid-section explaining transposed empathy. The final beat is clean and propulsive. No loops touch closure, and the prose artifact load stays within tolerance, but the density of explanation in the middle third slightly dulls momentum before the press sequence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Core synthesis—grief as equation, transposed empathy via dying starlight and letterpress—is specific and non-obvious. The combination of topaz type, halo fragment, borrowed personalities, and the mathematics frame feels organic, not checklist. Mara's trait and the press mechanics earn their presence through causal pressure rather than ornament. The ending's emotional reweighting ("the sudden triviality of my old, tidy grief") grows inevitably from prior particulars. Risk is present in the elevated register and conceptual density, which succeed without obscuring clarity. The piece does not retreat to safe middle ground; it commits to its premise and follows through to a resonant close.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara is present from the opening, shapes the middle by setting type and instructing the narrator, and her borrowed personalities constrain the narrator's responses ("defiance taste familiar"). Her choice to guide the narrator through the press sequence is the enabling action for closure. The narrator's final stance shift directly results from Mara's instruction to touch the halo and the prior setup she orchestrated. Strong causal involvement across beats and ending.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The halo fragment is introduced early ("Closest to Mara sat a small metal ring… the halo fragment"), reappears when it focuses the dying starlight into the topaz type, and is physically touched by the narrator at closure, triggering the transposed empathy sequence. Its properties—"pale fire," "faint chorus"—are specific and irreplaceable; no other object could substitute. It constrains the central action and charges the final image. Three distinct beats; closure linkage is direct.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Transposed empathy is explained mid-piece and enacted on the page when the narrator touches the halo and experiences borrowed perspectives ("taste the iron in the throat of a stranger deciding to stay"). It shapes the dominant stake (understanding the mathematics of emotion) and changes the narrator's options by reweighting grief. The concept is not merely thematic; it alters the on-page situation and forecloses the old framework. Present in setup, development, and closure; causal role is clear.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's trait of borrowing personalities is introduced early ("tonight she wore my late brother's slouch, my mother's careful sarcasm") and recurs in dialogue attribution ("Mara smiled with my mother's mouth," "voice now stolen from the first person who ever lied to me"). It constrains the narrator's trust and emotional distance, making defiance "taste familiar." The trait is specific and irreplaceable, but its causal pressure is indirect; it colors interactions more than forcing a distinct choice. Two beats; no direct closure linkage beyond atmospheric charge.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Disorient" is explicitly named as Mara's method ("trying to disorient me through deliberate ambiguity") and enacted when the narrator pulls the lever, receives a geometry instead of text, and later stands inside the pattern, disoriented by transposed empathy. The action drives the middle turn (no text, only geometry) and the closure reweighting. The method shapes attempts and alters the narrator's stance. Causal role across two beats; closure participation is strong.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Deliberate ambiguity is stated as Mara's tactic ("scattering half-truths until my own certainties cracked") and demonstrated when she instructs "do not decide what you hope will appear." It constrains the narrator's approach and enables the transposed empathy effect by preventing a fixed expectation. The method is signaled early and recurs, but its mechanics are asserted more than dramatized in distinct beats. Two touches; modest causal pressure; indirect closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The topaz workshop is introduced in the opening line, provides the press and type that enable the central action, and houses the halo fragment. Its "amber sheen, drinking in what little starlight remained" ties the setting to the vanishing stars and the empathy mechanics. The workshop constrains the narrator's access to the press and fragment; the action cannot occur elsewhere. Three beats (opening, press sequence, closure); strong causal and closure linkage; specific and irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The timeframe "between vanishing stars" is stated early ("We always met between vanishing stars") and recurs when the second star "thinned to a smear" and the third has already vanished. It creates a live environmental constraint—the window is closing—but the urgency is more atmospheric than tactical; no on-page choice is forced by the time limit. Two mentions; modest pressure; indirect closure linkage through the final "remained" phrasing that bookends the opening.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The narrator's desire "to learn the mathematics of emotion" is stated early, restated by Mara, and dramatized when the narrator chooses an unsolved feeling and touches the halo to experience it. The motivation drives every major choice: returning to the workshop, selecting the feeling, pulling the lever, touching the fragment. Friction between want and cost is visible at closure when the narrator's "old, tidy grief" becomes trivial, a conceptual price. Three beats; strong causal and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Tone blends lucid prose (clear causality, clean syntax) with turbulent imagery ("buried sun under glass," "equations… symbols I half-recognized from school and half from nightmares"). The tone modulates with pressure: calm in exposition, compressed at the lever pull ("soft, devastating finality"), disorienting in the geometry sequence. It charges the final image—"its variables stolen and returned in unfamiliar order"—and remains coherent through turns. Distinct signature; strong closure linkage.</comment>
