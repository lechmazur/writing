<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Neve's interiority is vivid and particular—the clipboard as "portable altar," names "leak[ing] into the margins"—and their micro-choices (drawing the fake option, coding in chalk) layer professional habit with personal history. The relationship with Arlen arrives via sidewalk-chalk symbols, anchoring regret without over-explaining. Internal contradiction surfaces when they question whether the message is "for the anonymous sender, for Arlen, or for some earlier version of themself," showing contradictory impulses in scene. The final hesitation at the slot embodies embodied reluctance with visible cost, though the change remains a renunciation/Charged Poise rather than decisive action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors early (golden arcade, dawn, Neve, ebony clipboard). Escalation reads as density increase and pattern break: the sender's note intensifies pressure, Neve cycles through trial names, codes appear in margins, and the final folding/walking/holding sequence tightens cadence. Closure is Charged Poise—"feeling the whole future pause on the edge of the drop"—with the cost legible in the refusal to release and the weight of prior aliases. The lens holds; the image reweights prior particulars (names, margins, Arlen) without stating a moral. One beat-level ambiguity: the sender's note and Arlen backstory arrive close together, briefly muddying whether the primary pressure is professional or personal, but the ending coheres both.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The golden arcade at dawn, glass ribs turning "from gold to a pale, bleached coin," and the analog post counter as "hinge" anchor place and charge it with nostalgia. The ebony clipboard and marble table are handled concretely. The arcade's civic-curiosity status and hologram signs sketch the future-world lightly without exposition dumps. The counter as physical constraint shapes the final beat: Neve walks to it, rests the envelope there, feels the drop. Micro-setting (body, clipboard, counter slot) qualifies and charges the closure image, meeting the 9+ gate for Q3.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: assign a name that juxtaposes regret and forgiveness, signaled in the sender's note. Pressure coheres through trial attempts (Alia Vent, Jun North) and tightens when Neve adds the chalk code "Are you still there," collapsing professional task and personal haunting into one gesture. The final choice—Marin Verge plus the marginal phrase "You are allowed to arrive slowly"—is driven by Neve's agency and forecloses casual detachment with visible cost (the apology-care in folding, the hesitation at the slot). One meaningful deepening/tightening is present; the cost is felt but not paid on the page (Charged Poise). No explicit antagonist; coincidence does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: aliases as "small, controlled reincarnation," surface mail as time-accomplice, margins as the site of unofficial meaning. The chalk codes and the phrase "Are you still there" layer professional invention with survival history. The ending image—envelope poised at the slot, "the whole future pause on the edge of the drop"—offers a non-literal answer to regret/forgiveness without stating it. The line "Before a letter is mailed, does it already know where it is going" seeds the question and the final pause reweights it. No thematic echo or moralizing in the last paragraph; ambiguity lingers without confusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited, tight to Neve's perceptual signature: "futuristic nostalgia," "hinge," "portable altar," "eavesdropping on their own ghosts." Diction remains consistent and voice-particular throughout. Distance is stable; no head-hopping. The prose modulates with pressure: early lyric expansiveness ("golden arcade…projected onto the future") tightens in the final sequence ("folded…sealed…held…walked…rested"). Purposeful compression in the ending—"not yet surrendered, feeling the whole future pause"—charges the moment without obscuring clarity. No dialogue to assess. Free indirect style is clean; psychic distance shifts are intentional.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high: most lines advance character, atmosphere, or world-rule. Minor scaffold in the trial-names paragraph: "Each name hovered…waiting for the weight of a story that would justify it" restates what the list already showed, costing ~−0.2. One paraphrase loop near "They were carefully inventive…nudging reality by adding small, plausible labels" and the earlier "licensed to invent lives that letters could wear"—both describe the same inventive habit without new pressure, costing ~−0.2. No filter-verb stacks or template cadence runs. Figurative language is dense but coherent and voice-motivated; no mixed metaphors. Final image is propulsive and clear.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The pseudonym-creator premise and surface-mail frame offer a fresh synthesis of bureaucracy, identity, and time. The detail that Neve "had drawn it in the margins…and people kept finding it" (Subconscious Review option) and the sidewalk-chalk codes transform trope into lived invention. The emotional arc—professional task collapsing into personal haunting—feels particular to this voice and world. The Marin Verge name and its marginal blessing arise from established pattern (trial names, chalk language, regret/mercy prompt) rather than late convenience. The ending's pause-on-the-edge is a non-obvious image that reweights prior material in hindsight. Risk-taking in the accumulative/lyric design heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, meriting +0.3 within band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Pseudonym creator: setup early (second sentence), development across beats (trial names, chalk codes, final choice), closure participation (choosing Marin Verge shapes the ending image). Two distinct beats (trial attempts, final naming) plus causal pressure (must juxtapose regret/forgiveness) plus closure linkage. Specific cost: the apology-care and hesitation at the slot are tied to the weight of naming. Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage +1.4, cost +0.4 = strong elevation from 3.0 base.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Ebony clipboard: setup early (second sentence "balanced on their knees like a portable altar"), handled in beat one (message sheet), returned in naming sequence ("set the ebony clipboard on the marble table"), final handling implied when Neve walks away. Two touches across beats; lyric reprise ("portable altar" charges it with ritual weight). Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, lyric reprise reweights with ritual connotation +0.8, but no causal pressure or closure shaping beyond metaphor = mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Surface mail: setup early ("SURFACE MAIL…futuristic nostalgia…time itself to be an accomplice"), development (Delayed Delivery, Hand Sorting, Subconscious Review options shape Neve's task), closure participation (the envelope at the slot is the surface-mail act). Core concept shapes stakes (juxtaposition must fit surface mail's time-pressure logic) and tactics (Neve adds marginal codes, folds with care). Three beats (form selection, name invention, final mailing) plus causal pressure plus closure linkage plus specificity (hand sorting, chalk codes) plus cost (hesitation at drop). Early +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal +1.5, closure +1.6, specificity +0.7, cost +0.5 = strong elevation.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Carefully inventive: setup mid-first-third ("carefully inventive…nudging reality by adding small, plausible labels"), development (inventing Subconscious Review option, trial names, chalk codes), closure shaping (final name and marginal phrase). The trait enables actions with visible tradeoff: invention of the fake option "people kept finding" and the sidewalk-chalk language risk exposure. Two beats (fake option, chalk codes) plus causal pressure plus closure linkage. Setup slightly late −0.2, two beats +0.9, causal +1.0, closure +1.0, cost (risk of inspector notice) +0.3 = solid mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Juxtapose: setup in sender's note ("assign me a name that will juxtapose who I was with who I might forgive"), development across trial names (Alia Vent, Jun North each juxtapose elements), closure payoff (Marin Verge juxtaposes "shore and boundary, water and brink"). The action is the story's hinge: every naming attempt tests juxtaposition logic. Two distinct beats (trial names, final name) plus causal pressure (sender's request) plus closure linkage (Marin Verge solves it). Early signal +0.7, two beats +0.9, causal +1.3, closure +1.4, specificity (each name explicates its juxtaposition) +0.6 = strong.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Codes in children's sidewalk chalk: setup late second-third ("symbols in children's sidewalk chalk, the language they and Arlen had used"), development (Neve draws codes "Are you still there" and final code "You are allowed to arrive slowly"), closure participation (codes appear on the envelope Neve holds at the slot). Method signaled and used twice, but late arrival and swappability (could be any secret code) lower score. Late first appearance −0.4, two beats +0.9, causal (codes enable marginal messages) +0.8, closure linkage +1.0, swappability −0.6 = mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Golden arcade at dawn: setup opening line, development (light shifts "gold to pale, bleached coin," shops flicker awake, post counter as hinge), closure participation (Neve walks to counter, spatial pressure of the slot). Setting supplies the counter/slot that pressures the final beat and the dawn-to-higher-sun transition tracks time. Three touches (opening, midpoint shift, counter), micro-setting (counter/slot) alters tactics (must walk to it, feel the drop), closure linkage strong. Early +0.7, three touches +1.4, causal +1.0, closure +1.5, specificity (hinge metaphor, bleached coin image) +0.6 = solid.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Before a letter is mailed: setup in sender's note ("Before a letter is mailed, does it already know where it is going"), development (Neve's naming process is the before-mailing window), closure participation (Neve holds the envelope "not yet surrendered," crystallizing the moment). Timeframe is the story's premise; the entire arc lives in this threshold. Setup early +0.6, one continuous beat (the naming/holding sequence) +0.4, causal (the question seeds Neve's hesitation) +1.0, closure linkage (final pause answers the question imagistically) +1.3, but no second distinct beat or visible tightening from time pressure = mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>To discover meaning in the margins: setup second paragraph ("every alias was a small, controlled reincarnation"), development (names "kept trying to leak into the margins," Neve draws chalk codes there, "to discover meaning in the margins had once meant solving puzzles"), closure shaping (marginal phrase "You are allowed to arrive slowly" is the final discovery). Motivation dramatized across beats with friction (professional vs. personal, present vs. past). Three beats (leaking names, chalk codes, final phrase) plus causal pressure plus closure linkage. Early +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal +1.2, closure +1.5, cost (eavesdropping on ghosts, risk of inspector notice) +0.4 = strong.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Futuristic nostalgia: setup opening line ("looked like a memory someone had projected onto the future"), sustained through "SURFACE MAIL…already felt like futuristic nostalgia," analog post counter as "civic curiosity," and hologram signs around old counter. Tone modulates with pressure: early expansive lyricism tightens in final sequence without breaking coherence. The final image—envelope poised at the slot, "the whole future pause on the edge"—charges nostalgia with present cost. Coherent across turns, charges closure. Early +0.7, three touches +1.4, causal (tone shapes perception of surface mail's stakes) +1.0, closure +1.7, specificity (projected memory, hiss of disappearing trains) +0.7 = strong elevation.</comment>
