<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The performer's contradiction—state amplifier enacting quiet rebellion—is embodied through concrete choices (whittling, narrating). Mara's "bruised numbness" and clamped-down laughter ground her grief in physicality. The final loosening ("like loosening a belt one notch") registers as earned restraint rather than epiphany. Minor: "blank face" repeats without internal texture varying under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the wooden figure placed among dried stems, the "remade hush" carried as contraband, and Mara's "slight easing" crystallize a before/after with conceptual cost (sedition risk) legible on the page. Orientation anchors by ~80 words (performer, farmhouse, Mandate context). One meaningful deepening: whittling transforms theatrical visit into quiet defiance, narrowing both characters' options.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Turbines as omnipresent surveillance ("sensors under its blades") and sonic oppression constrain the performer's method and charge the final yard departure. Micro-setting details (chipped mug, pine shavings, dried bouquet) recur functionally. The wooden hybrid's hollow center invites rest, shaping Mara's micro-choice to place it. Spatial choreography is clean throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: cultivating prohibited "lightness in grief" under state surveillance. Pressure tightens when Mara voices sedition risk ("What if someone reports you"), and the performer's whittling forecloses safety with visible cost (contraband artifact, measured joy visit violated). Agency is renunciation: both accept danger for a momentary reprieve. The trade-off is clear and scaled appropriately.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme—resistance through unquantifiable presence—emerges from concrete particulars (wood shavings as "pale petals," the hush "built from...breathing"). The wooden hybrid (petals/blades) reweights the opening's bleached bouquet and mechanized cheer without stating a moral. The final image of "remade hush like contraband" offers a resonant, non-literal answer to grief-under-mandate. No thematic echo; the performer's staged narration stays in-world.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV holds the performer's interiority with distance control; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature: "dramatically narrating mundane tasks" colors all action ("heroic reduction of unnecessary volume"). Diction stays character-consistent ("State Joy Amplifier," "prohibited emotional paradox"). Dialogue carries subtext (Mara's "actually, not theatrically" distinguishes performance from intent). Minor: the turbines' "mechanical cheer" risks slight register drift but remains legible as POV judgment.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies; figurative density is high but controlled ("pale, turning skeletons," "slow comet," "saga Mara had not asked for"). Sentence openings diversify. Minor artifacts: "Outside, the turbines..." recurs as structural filler; "The performer decided..." tells a turn better shown. Paraphrase near end: "It was not happiness...she let it stay" loops concept without added pressure. Clarity and momentum hold; no closure-scene harm.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Premise—state-mandated joy, performer weaponizing theater into silence—synthesizes familiar dystopia with a non-obvious inflection (whittling as defiance, narration as cover). The wooden hybrid's dual identity (turbine/flower) feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk: sustained tonal flattening could alienate, but the piece commits fully. Transformation test passed: swapping names/places would lose the Mandate's specific constraint on grief.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Performer present throughout; choices (whittling, narrating, leaving the figure) create all key turns and the closure image. Early signal, three beats, causal pressure (defies mandate protocol), closure linkage (carries hush as contraband), irreplaceability (state role enables seditious cover).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dried bouquet appears in opening exposition and closing tableau; the wooden figure is "cradled" among stems, reweighting "brightness was regulated" into a hybrid defiance. Two-beat lyric structure with closure reprise, but middle development is passive (described, not handled). Setup, Payoff present; Development weak.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Remade hush" is announced mid-story, demonstrated through whittling ("building a hush...in actions"), and carried as contraband in final line. It shapes tactics (whittling under turbine drone) and charges closure with conceptual cost. Setup, Development (enables the seditious act), Payoff all present; high causal pressure and irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Moral ambiguity is stated ("morally ambiguous, possibly sedition") but not deeply dramatized. The performer's cover story ("improving narrative texture") shows cunning, yet no on-page moment forces a harder ethical trade-off. Setup and Development present; Payoff implicit (contraband carried). Swappable with "risk-taking" without major edits.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Whittling drives the central beat: each cut is narrated, Mara voices risk, the act creates the wooden figure that anchors closure. Early signal, two beats (introduction, completion), high causal pressure (seditious artifact), closure linkage (figure left as "co-conspirator"), irreplaceability (no other method builds the hush). Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dramatic narration ("heroic instrument," "saga," "chapter title") is signaled early and used twice (spoon, whittling). It enables seditious cover ("improving narrative texture") and constrains the performer's method under surveillance. Setup, Development, Payoff present; causal role in two beats; some specificity cost (could substitute "theatrical framing" with minor edits).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Farmhouse anchors all action; turbines supply surveillance threat ("sensors under blades"), sonic oppression (mechanical cheer), and spatial metaphor (shadows sliding). Setting pressures choices (Mara glances toward window) and charges final departure ("turbine-shadowed yard"). Setup, Development (turbine surveillance mentioned mid-scene), Payoff (departure image) all present; two beats, closure linkage, moderate causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"After the Happiness Mandate" frames all stakes (arrests, measured joy, prohibited paradox) and tightens the performer's seditious choice. Time is implicit (post-brother's death, "too many days of required cheer") but not a live clock. Setup and Development present; Payoff indirect (closure risk persists). One beat of causal pressure; swappable with generic dystopia timeframe.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"Cultivate lightness in grief" is announced early, dramatized through whittling and narration, and tested when Mara questions risk. The performer's final act (leaving the figure) enacts the motivation with visible cost (sedition, contraband). Setup, Development (performer explains intent), Payoff (Mara's easing, performer's contraband) all present; three beats, high causal pressure, irreplaceability (no other desire fits the closure).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Emotional void is sustained (blank faces, dry eyes, "slight easing" not happiness) and modulates with pressure (Mara's clamped-down laughter, performer's internal contraband). Tone charges the final image (void persists but now holds seditious reprieve). Coherent through turns; supports accumulative lens. Minor: "rich and steady" voice momentarily warms the void without clear cost.</comment>
