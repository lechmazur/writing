<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's interiority is concrete and character-specific, driven by guilt over the brother's drowning with embodied emotion ("moth-eaten cloth," the blue scarf memory). Lio's contradictory nature—"fiercely gentle," compassion as dangerous—is shown through action (punching men, humming while performing rituals) and stakes-driven choices. The final shift from "dimmer" Lio to "steadier" narrator earns a credible change through the orchard's price, though the choice to place the hand on the cloth lacks fuller internal conflict in the moment. Minor deduction for the protagonist's relative passivity; Lio drives most decisions on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraph (catacomb orchard, Lio and narrator, present action). The lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density builds through layered images (rust, pomegranates, roots trammeling bones) and the final beat reweights the premise—Lio as offering, not merchant—with visible cost (he looks older, narrator steadier). Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the protagonist's rearranged moments and Lio's dimming crystallize the bargain's price. One meaningful deepening via the protagonist's confession and the orchard's response. Minor deduction: the mechanics of the bargain (blood, language, light flare) feel somewhat formulaic and the final cost could be sharper on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard is vividly particular: sour cherry roots trammeling skulls, basalt altar with silver-dusted channels leading into soil, candles throwing doubled shadows. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered ("air tasted like rust and pomegranates"), and the environment directly constrains the climactic choice—the altar as mouth, the orchard as throat. The recurring image of roots trammeling (skulls, then the brother's scarf) charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clear throughout the descent and ritual. Minor slip: "dusky resolve made visible" reads slightly abstract for this otherwise concrete setting.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (escape guilt, become someone who watches) is signaled early and drives the protagonist's choice to place hand on cloth. The orchard's hunger and Lio's dimming provide escalating cost, and the final rearrangement of moments forecloses the prior self with visible price (Lio older, narrator steadier). Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening occurs when the confession triggers the orchard's response. Minor deduction: the protagonist's agency is somewhat reactive—Lio orchestrates the ritual, and the protagonist largely consents rather than driving reversals. The mechanics of the bargain (blood, backward language) feel slightly convenience-driven rather than earned through prior constraint.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from concrete particulars: compassion as dangerous promise, witnessing versus looking away, the orchard consuming pieces of Lio to spare others. The burned Fool card reweights at closure ("a beginning that refuses to calculate the fall") without overt moralizing. The roots trammeling bones/scarf motif accumulates meaning without forcing symbolism. The final image—rearranged moments, Lio dimmed, narrator steadied—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the protagonist's desire for transformation. The piece resists tidy morals; Lio's self-sacrifice is both heroic and costly, and the protagonist's relief carries the weight of what Lio paid.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable and distinct: perceptual signature filters setting through guilt ("moth-eaten cloth," the scarf as accusation) and wonder (candles "doubled and watchful"). Diction is controlled and purposeful ("trammel," "fiercely gentle," "dusky resolve"). Dialogue is minimal but effective: Lio's lines pursue goals (eliciting the memory, framing the bargain) and carry subtext. The prose modulates with pressure, tightening at the ritual's peak. Minor deduction: "fiercely gentle" and "reckless idealist" appear as labels before being fully dramatized, and the phrase "dusky resolve made visible" momentarily slips into abstract register. Filter verbs ("I saw," "I felt") cluster in the final beats but remain voice-consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and figurative language is dense but mostly coherent ("roots trammel," "moth-eaten soul," "air tasted like rust"). Information density is high; most lines advance setting, character, or stakes. Minor deductions: "fiercely gentle" appears twice in close proximity without adding pressure. The phrase "dusky resolve made visible" reads abstract and slightly strained. "Someone long ago had carved channels" and "inlaying meaning everywhere with silver dust" lean toward telling when showing would tighten. The final paragraph compresses key sensory detail ("smelled faintly of river water") that could anchor more strongly. No major loops or scaffold, but a few near-paraphrases ("I had been looking away...when I turned back he was gone" / "my hands empty, the water thick and fast") repeat the same event without added detail.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of catacomb orchard, bartered destinies, and self-sacrifice ritual feels specific and purposeful rather than checklist-assembled. The image of roots trammeling bones is fresh and charges the protagonist's guilt (brother's scarf trammeling the root). The Fool card as "beginning that refuses to calculate the fall" offers a non-obvious angle on tarot symbolism. The revelation that Lio is offering rather than merchant reweights the premise in hindsight. Minor deduction: the bargain mechanics (blood drop, backward language, light flare) echo familiar occult-ritual templates without full transformation. The emotional arc (guilt → rearrangement → steadiness) is emotionally honest but follows a recognizable redemption path. The piece's freshness lies in its images and Lio's characterization more than structural risk.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lio (reckless idealist) is present throughout and drives the ritual structure. His choices to bargain, hum, speak backward, and let the orchard eat pieces of him create key turns. The revelation that he is offering rather than merchant reweights his prior actions. His dimming at closure demonstrates cost. Strong beat involvement and causal pressure, but the protagonist's arc slightly overshadows Lio's agency in the final image.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The burned tarot card appears in three beats: laid out on the cloth, covered over the protagonist's hand, and bleeding with Lio's drop. Its image (figure stepping off cliff) is explained and reweighted ("a beginning that refuses to calculate the fall"), and it shelters the protagonist's guilt. It is causally active in the ritual and its scorched state charges the theme of transformation through destruction. Strong closure linkage and specificity.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Bartered destinies shapes the stakes: Lio trades stories/regrets for "the possibility of another" life, and the orchard rearranges the protagonist's moments. The concept is dramatized through the ritual (hand placed, blood dropped, light flaring) and the final cost (Lio dimmed, narrator steadied). It constrains the protagonist's choice and enables the ending's reconfiguration. Present in setup, middle, and payoff, with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Fiercely gentle" is applied to Lio twice: once as character label and once in the ritual's coaxing tone. It enables his contradictory nature (punching men / careful with relics) and the orchard's response to his voice. The trait constrains his method (coaxing rather than commanding) and charges the revelation that compassion is dangerous. Minor deduction: the phrase appears as summary before being fully embodied in action, and it is stated rather than shown in the climactic beat.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>"Trammel" is used three times with escalating meaning: roots trammel skulls (setting detail), roots "usually trammel rocks" (world logic), and the brother's scarf trammels the root (guilt anchor). The third use drives the protagonist's confession and frames the need for transformation. The word's recurrence charges the closure image (rearranged moments sifting through "like sand"). Removing this specific verb would break the thematic and causal linkage between orchard, guilt, and ritual. High irreplaceability and closure pressure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Inlaying meaning everywhere with silver dust" describes the altar's carved channels and appears once in the setup. The channels guide Lio's blood into the orchard's roots, enabling the ritual's mechanics. The method is signaled and participates in the climactic beat, but its specifics (silver dust, runes looping like vines) remain largely decorative. It shapes one turn but does not constrain earlier choices or reappear with reweighted meaning. Functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard is present throughout: setup (first paragraph), middle (walking among trees, altar description), and payoff (altar as mouth, orchard as throat, roots shivering). It supplies the ritual's resources (altar, roots, candles) and its constraint (the orchard must be fed). The revelation that it swallows offerings and feeds back changed futures is causally active and charges the final image. The environment's hunger and Lio's dimming are inseparable. High closure linkage and causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Within the glow of half-lit corridors" appears in the opening and frames the descent's atmosphere. The candlelight recurs (throwing shadows, hiccuping wax) but does not create urgency or constrain the ritual's timing. The piece reads as single-scene without a live clock; the glow provides mood but does not tighten decisions. Present in setup and development, absent from closure. Functional but replaceable with "twilight" or "shadow" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The motivation "to patch holes in the soul" drives Lio's bargaining and the protagonist's participation. It is dramatized through the protagonist's moth-eaten soul, the confession of guilt, and the desire to become "someone who does not look away." The cost (Lio dimmed, narrator steadied) proves the patching occurred. The motivation shapes three beats (arrival, confession, transformation) and is causally active at closure. Strong involvement and specificity, though the phrasing "patch holes" leans slightly abstract.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Dusky resolve" is named once ("a kind of dusky resolve made visible") and the tone—somber determination within shadow—coheres throughout: the protagonist's desperate choice, Lio's humming, the orchard's patient hunger, the final rearrangement. The tone modulates slightly (wonder at the orchard, grief at the memory, quiet acceptance at closure) without breaking coherence. It charges the final image (Lio older, narrator steadier) and supports the theme of transformation through shadow. Minor deduction: the explicit label "dusky resolve made visible" is somewhat on-the-nose, and the tone is more consistent than dynamic under pressure.</comment>
