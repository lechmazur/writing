<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The narrator's professional identity as "field liaison for anomalous fauna" provides clear interiority and embodied perception through specific sensory detail ("frostbitten hope," "gravitationally playful spirals"). However, the protagonist remains largely reactive throughout—observing Mara's garden and receiving the phone without making a meaningful choice that forecloses a path. The final line ("Maybe work now was to turn bitterness into a cosmic joke") reads as an abrupt, under-motivated shift rather than an earned stance crystallization. The lack of a decisive on-page choice or renunciation with visible cost keeps this in the mid-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes orientation clearly (researcher in underground garden) and maintains Accumulative/Textural pressure through layered sensory detail and mounting revelations. However, closure is weak: the final sentence introduces "turn bitterness into a cosmic joke" as a thematic tag without dramatizing what bitterness is being turned, what work is required, or what cost the narrator accepts. The Conceptual Repricing needed to land this ending is asserted rather than made legible through a final image that reweights prior material. The accumulation is strong, but the closure unit fails to deliver felt or conceptual cost on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The underground garden is rendered with vivid, purpose-driven detail: "bioluminescent moss...gravitationally playful spirals," "chamomile fog," "soil...pulsed with the slow heartbeat." The cordless phone and bone bowls become tactile anchors that constrain the narrator's understanding and charge the final revelation. The arrowhead at the archway ("dull triangle of flint...vibrated softly") provides a concrete constraint before entry. Spatial choreography is clean throughout, and the setting actively shapes the narrator's evolving comprehension of the metamorphosis phenomenon.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding what takes people up the mountain—is signaled early and accumulates pressure through revelation (voices in static, plants as metamorphosed persons). However, the narrator never faces a meaningful choice that narrows options or forecloses a path. Mara provides all information; the protagonist absorbs but does not act. The institute's mapping mission is mentioned but never tested against an ethical or tactical dilemma. Pressure is present but does not tighten through protagonist agency, keeping this in mid-band under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The theme of transformation versus erasure emerges organically through concrete images: people "composted into a larger, stranger chorus," the garden "refusing to fit on my grid." The tension between institutional classification and the mountain's untamed harmony is embodied in action rather than stated. However, the final line's "turn bitterness into a cosmic joke" feels imposed rather than earned—a thematic label that does not arise from the narrator's prior choices or the garden's particulars. The resonance is strong in the body but the ending does not reweight with a non-literal answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and sustained: "bruise in reality," "frostbitten hope, brittle and persistent," "harmony untamed ringing through their bones." The narrator's professional lens colors perception without over-explaining. Mara's dialogue carries subtext and her speech pattern differs from the narrator's interiority. The piece avoids head-hopping and maintains focalization cleanly. Minor slip: the final sentence's register ("turn bitterness into a cosmic joke") shifts abruptly into a more detached, meta tone that feels less grounded in the narrator's established voice under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and propulsive with strong figurative density: "purple lamps hummed like patient hornets," "her gray braid swinging like a pendulum that had made peace with time." Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high throughout. However, figurative language appears in nearly every sentence of high-pressure beats without clear pattern-teaching, creating occasional register drift ("river talk and thumb grease," "static-laden confessions" feel slightly over-decorated). No loops or scaffolding artifacts detected. The final line is the weakest: "Maybe work now was to turn bitterness into a cosmic joke" reads as unearned abstraction rather than concrete image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The premise—missing persons metamorphosing into plants via confessional transformation—offers a fresh synthesis of body horror and ecological grief. The cordless phone as recording medium and the bone bowls as vessels provide specific, non-obvious material anchors. The concept avoids stock "person becomes tree" clichés by routing transformation through voice and the mountain's loneliness. The piece commits fully to its strange logic without retreat. However, the final line's "cosmic joke" move feels like a late tonal shift that doesn't grow inevitably from prior particulars, slightly weakening the coherence of vision.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The cryptid researcher is present throughout and the undercover frame motivates the initial approach. However, the character never makes a choice that creates a turn—only observes and receives information from Mara. The professional identity shapes perception but does not constrain action or alter tactics. The researcher's institute mission is mentioned but never tested against the garden's reality in a way that forces a decision. Present and functional but not causal.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The flint arrowhead appears at the archway threshold, is handled by Mara, and "vibrated softly" to resist classification—a purposeful beat that frames the garden's resistance to institutional frameworks. It recurs conceptually when the narrator tries to "catalog the object" and the arrowhead "shrugs off the nets of classification." However, it does not return in the closure image or constrain a later choice. Two-beat involvement with thematic weight, but no closure linkage. Solid mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Harmony untamed" is introduced early as what people feel ("ringing through their bones"), recurs when Mara explains the metamorphosis ("a harmony untamed that made the bones of the mountain less lonely"), and shapes the narrator's understanding that the garden is not a threat but a redistribution. It constrains the institute's "map a threat" frame and reweights the stakes from erasure to chorus. However, it does not drive a specific on-page choice or appear in the final image. Strong thematic integration across beats with clear reweighting of the premise.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Gravitationally playful" describes the moss spirals in the opening paragraph, establishing the garden's reality-bending nature. However, it is purely descriptive—no character interacts with the spirals, and the trait does not constrain or enable any action. The phrase sets tone but remains ornamental. Present and vivid but functionally replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Metamorphose" is the core mechanism: people do not disappear but transform "into what the mountain cannot carry alone." The narrator's realization that "they metamorphose" is the pivotal turn that reframes the institute's missing-person files. Mara's whispered names trigger plant responses, dramatizing the ongoing transformation. The concept drives the narrator's shift from mapping a threat to recognizing a "larger, stranger chorus." Essential to the story's logic and present in the closure understanding, though the final line does not return to it directly.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The cordless phone is introduced at the garden's heart, pressed into the narrator's hands by Mara, and delivers the static confessions that prove the metamorphosis mechanism. It appears in one extended beat and its mechanics matter—voices are "recorded not through wires or satellites" but via the phone as seed-medium. However, it is not signaled before its revelation and does not recur or shape the ending. Strong single-beat causal work with clear mechanics, but late arrival and no closure presence limit the score.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The underground garden is established in the opening line, provides the spatial and conceptual frame for all action, and supplies the bone bowls, plants, soil, and phone that drive revelation. The setting's refusal to "fit on my grid" is the narrator's key realization. Mara's barefoot movement, the archway threshold, and the circle of bowls create clear spatial choreography that guides every beat. The garden's particulars (purple lamps, chamomile fog, pulsing soil) constrain understanding and charge the narrator's professional crisis. Essential and indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"After the missing return changed, after the people...stopped coming back at all" establishes the timeframe and motivates Mara's willingness to show the garden. The phrase frames the stakes and provides backstory context. However, time does not tighten decisions within the present scene—no clock pressures the narrator's exploration or understanding. The timeframe is a setup condition rather than an active constraint on tactics. Functional context but not a driver.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Turn bitterness into a cosmic joke" appears only in the final sentence without prior dramatization or friction. The narrator's bitterness is not established on the page, nor is there any choice or cost tied to this motivation. It reads as a late thematic assertion rather than a desire that shaped tactics or faced obstacles. Absent until the ending and not integrated into prior choices.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Frostbitten hope, brittle and persistent" is applied to Mara's voice early and captures the story's tonal register: awe mixed with professional wariness, wonder constrained by loss. The tone modulates appropriately—clinical observation gives way to embodied horror ("professional horror from sharpening my voice"), then to reluctant recognition. The garden's strangeness is never domesticated, and the narrator's inability to "fit on my grid" sustains the tension. The final line slightly weakens coherence by introducing "cosmic joke," but the dominant tone holds through most of the arc.</comment>
