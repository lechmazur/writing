<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The statue's interiority is concrete and particular—stone nerves, embodied fatigue, and contradictory impulses (fear vs. summoning) act simultaneously. The visitor's "incisively kind" gaze and her thought "Teach me how to doubt kindly" reveal character through micro-choices under pressure. Internal conflict is sustained: the statue fears certainty yet fractures it, desires nuance yet guards a monstrous secret. Minor slip: the rulers' backstory flattens slightly into summary, but the final renunciation (settling deeper, certainty cracked) is earned with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when by the third paragraph. Drive lens is Causal with Accumulative texturing: the statue's revelation → visitor arrives → ampoule holds the secret → collapse planned → visitor consents → ceiling bursts. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the statue settles deeper, certainty cracked for nuance to root, with visible cost (physical dissolution, loss of guarded purpose). One meaningful tightening occurs when the visitor presses the column, narrowing options and triggering the flood. Cost is legible in the final image: the statue's thoughts echo "like receding waves."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The underwater garden is vivid and selective: barnacled stone ribs, lantern-corals, failed fountains, anemones. The setting constrains choice—structural weakness is the planned escape route, and the ceiling's crack matters causally. The ampoule's petals scatter color over mosaics, and the collapsing column is pressed by the visitor to trigger the flood. Spatial choreography is clear: cracked stairway, weakened column, ceiling burst. The body (stone hand dislodging silt) and the recurring ampoule charge the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake: whether to release the secret as accusation or as question. Pressure coheres through the statue's fear ("failure would become her world's new certainty") and the visitor's counter-question ("Will you listen beyond the ampoule"). One meaningful tightening: the visitor's consent (pressing the column) forecloses passivity and triggers the flood. Agency is the statue's decision to open its mind fully and the visitor's choice to rise "with the current, ampoule against her heart." Cost is visible: the garden destroyed, the statue settling deeper, nuance unleashed without control over its interpretation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—certainty vs. nuance, accusation vs. inquiry—emerges from the statue's guard-duty and the visitor's request to "doubt kindly." The flood backstory (invited, not endured) embodies the danger of imposed certainty. The ampoule recurs with shifting weight: record of confession, then seed of either new certainty or open question. No thesis statement; the final image ("my certainty had cracked wide enough for nuance to root") answers the central question through concrete action (collapse, garden shaking, bells chiming) rather than moralizing. The secret's calcification into bones is a resonant particular.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>POV is stable telepathic first-person; psychic distance modulates purposefully (silent reply, then vocal plea). Perceptual signature is distinct: stone nerves, silt like breath, fault-lines inside stone. Diction is elevated but character-consistent ("incisively kind," "skein of silver bubbles"). The visitor's interior thought is accessed via telepathy without head-hopping. Minor texture issue: "animate lifeless" appears twice as a phrase, creating a small loop, but voice control under pressure (the collapse sequence) remains strong. Dialogue subtext is present: "Teach me how to doubt kindly" pursues a goal and advances plot.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Information density is high; lines often do double duty (e.g., "her oxygen thin, but her gaze cut through the water, incisively kind"). Rhythm varies with pressure: short clauses accelerate the collapse, longer ones breathe during reflection. Two minor loops: "animate lifeless" recurs identically in two paragraphs, and "structural weakness" appears three times without reweighting. Filter verbs ("I felt," "I saw") are minimal and voice-motivated. No paraphrase cycles at closure. Figurative language is purposeful ("loosened ink," "receding waves") but "drowned candelabra" and "drowned dawn" echo each other slightly. Overall propulsion is strong.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The telepathic statue and underwater city premise is fresh, and the inversion (flood was invited) transforms a familiar disaster trope. The ampoule as "algae-coded light" and the collapse as "structural weakness" feel specific to this world. Emotional calculus is non-obvious: the statue fears replacing one lie with another, choosing to release a question rather than accusation. Minor limitation: the "teach me to doubt kindly" epiphany risks slight abstraction, but the collapse and "nuance to root" anchor it in concrete particulars. The synthesis of ruin, telepathy, and epistemological stakes is memorable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Introduced immediately (paragraph 2). Drives two beats: telepathic exchange with visitor and decision to open mind fully. Causal pressure: only a telepathic entity can hear the visitor's unspoken thoughts and reply silently, enabling the trust that leads to her consent. Closure linkage: the statue's thoughts "echo after her like receding waves" as it settles deeper, a visible cost tied to its nature. High irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Introduced paragraph 13. Appears in three beats: visitor cradles it, its petals scatter color, she rises with it "against her heart." Development: holds the record of the confession, creating the binary (accusation vs. question) that drives the climax. Closure linkage: present in the escape, symbolizing the uncertain payload. Minor swappability: any container could function similarly with edits, but the foxglove-stain (poison connotation) and color-scatter add specificity.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Signaled in the title phrase (paragraph 18: "Truth should arrive as cascading revelations"). Shapes stakes: the statue's fear is that a single revelation will become "new certainty" rather than opening inquiry. Development: the visitor asks to be taught "how to doubt kindly," dramatizing the concept. Closure: "my certainty had cracked wide enough for nuance to root" pays it off. Moderate causal pressure; the concept is thematic anchor but does not uniquely enable the collapse.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Introduced paragraph 8 ("her gaze cut through the water, incisively kind"). Constrains one choice: her question "Teach me how to doubt kindly" and her patient listening ("she did not rush") reflect the trait. Closure: absent from the final image. Moderate specificity: the trait motivates her stance, but swapping to "patient" or "thoughtful" would require only minor edits. One visible tradeoff: she risks oxygen to listen fully.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Appears in paragraph 20 ("her answer threaded through my thoughts like a careful needle, tugging at seams"). Development: her threading question ("Teach me...") opens the statue's full confession. Not present at closure; the ending features collapse and current, not threading. Swappable: "question," "ask," or "probe" could replace with minor edits. Moderate causal role in one beat.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Signaled paragraph 24 ("Through structural weakness I had planned her escape route"). Drives two beats: the statue shifts its hand to widen the crack, and the visitor presses the weakened column. Causal pressure: the method is the only way the garden can open to the sky, making it indispensable to the escape. Closure: "shot upward with the current...through structural weakness into a sky she had never seen." High irreplaceability; removing it breaks the plot.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Introduced paragraph 3. Drives beats: the garden's collapse is the planned outcome, and the setting supplies the column, ceiling, and anemones. Causal pressure: the underwater location necessitates the visitor's thin oxygen and the flood-torrent escape. Closure: "As the sea drained from the city, I settled deeper into my plinth" directly involves the setting. High specificity: the underwater ruin is integral to the flood backstory and the statue's purpose.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Signaled in the opening line ("After revealing the secret"). Frames the entire action: the visitor arrives because the secret is loose, and the ampoule already holds the confession. Development: the timeframe tightens when the visitor's oxygen is noted as "thin," pressuring the conversation. Closure: "at last my certainty had cracked wide enough" confirms the aftermath. Moderate causal pressure; the "after" orients but does not uniquely drive tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Introduced paragraph 4 ("my purpose was to welcome nuance into a certainty"). Drives two beats: the statue's decision to reveal the secret and its choice to frame the release as a question rather than accusation. Development: the motivation conflicts with its fear of creating "new certainties," shown in paragraph 18. Closure: "my certainty had cracked wide enough for nuance to root" pays it off. Visible cost: the statue loses its guarded purpose and settles deeper.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Introduced paragraph 6 ("animate lifeless in the dim blue hush") and recurs paragraph 38. Tone is consistent: the statues are inanimate yet the garden "awakens," the statue moves, and bells "chime as they rose." Modulates at closure: "my thoughts echoing after her like receding waves" sustains the paradox of static form with living mind. Does not uniquely charge the final image; the tone supports but does not drive the ending's resonance.</comment>
