<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mirabel's interior life is concrete and specific: guilt manifest as physical memory ("dust, ink, and her mistakes"), embodied choices (the perfume bottle as anchor, typing the confession). The contradiction between her past exploitation and present attempt at repair is dramatized through action rather than summary. Her motivation to "stop selling tickets to [Liora's] collapse" shows internal shift with visible cost—she sends a career-damaging confession. Minor slip: the line "You are better at metaphors than apologies" risks meta-commentary but is recovered by the on-page transformation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure arrives as Conceptual Repricing—the act of sending the confession reweights Mirabel's relationship to her work and to Liora's memory with conceptual cost (professional reputation, public admission). Orientation anchors arrive clearly (orchard, conservatory, archive) within the first 120 words. Escalation tightens through density increase: metaphor accumulation ("thunder as jewelry," "echo/cave"), then confession-typing that forecloses the advice-column path. One meaningful deepening is present, and cost is legible in the final beat: "a small electric offering racing out of the archive into wider circuits."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The archive setting constrains choice: "Veins of copper under the floor made the archive a natural switchboard for unfinished business." The perfume bottle, reel-to-reel machine, and fluorescent tubes function as micro-setting that charges the final image—lights flaring "like an applauding audience," the scent anchoring memory. Sensory hierarchy reflects Mirabel's professional lens (electrical surges as "spiritual telegraphs"). Spatial choreography is clean throughout. The orchard's "hush" and sawdust scent bookend the piece, tying exterior threat to interior resolution.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (delivering the apology and stopping exploitation) is signaled early and tightens through one decisive turn: Mirabel shifts from metaphor-heavy deflection to direct confession, typing "names, dates, and the admission that some hauntings are manufactured for profit." The hand-over-hers moment (whether literal or figurative) marks the deepening—Liora's presence as witness or forgiveness crystallizes the cost. Agency is clear: she chooses to send the piece, forecloses her previous column method, and the orchard's deadline pressurizes the window. One live tightening with visible cost satisfies the lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the charged archive, perfume, and currents: reputation as manufactured haunting, the cost of turning people into copy. The final image—"a small electric offering racing out"—answers the central question (can she stop profiting from Liora's collapse?) without stating a moral. The perfume bottle's shift from anchor to released memory, the metaphor reversals ("You sold thunder as jewelry" → confession without metaphor), and the trees' "finally released" scent all charge the ending without sermonizing. Subtext operates cleanly in the electrical voice and the hand-guiding gesture.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>POV distance is stable, third-limited with tight Mirabel focalization. Voice texture is distinct: "gossip-column exorcist," "copy grew claws," syntactic rhythm modulates with pressure (short declaratives at peak: "She sent the piece"). Perceptual signature is consistent—electrical surges read as telegraphs, metaphors are her habitual deflection. The metaphor-refusal at climax ("No blind items, no coy metaphors, only names, dates") shows voice control under stress. Minor slip: "Time narrowed to a corridor" briefly elevates diction but recovers quickly and doesn't obscure POV.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully, sentence openings shift, and information density is high ("Once it had belonged to Liora… Once Mirabel had turned that friendship into copy"). No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Figurative density is elevated ("bark could pray," "words and feeding them back as metaphors") but mostly avoids muddle. One brief scaffold moment: "This is where imperfect miracles live" reads slightly authorial but is anchored in Mirabel's professional lens. The final image propels cleanly with no artifacting. Clarity and momentum hold throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis—advice columnist as literal exorcist, currents as spiritual switchboard, perfume as anchor—feels fresh and inevitable. The premise (manufactured reputation haunting) offers a non-obvious moral calculus: Mirabel can't undo history, only stop profiting from it. Emotional specificity (Liora's laughter "from storage in her chest," the hand steadying hers) avoids generic templates. Risk-taking in the metaphor-reversal structure and electrical-voice conceit heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The piece commits fully to its premise and follows the implications to a resonant close.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Gossip-column exorcist frames expectation early, drives the middle beat (naming headlines as rite, receiving metaphor responses), and her decision to type and send the confession is the climactic turn. Removing this character-frame would collapse the stakes and closure. Two gates (setup, payoff) plus strong causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The perfume bottle is introduced early (paragraph 8), placed atop the machine as anchor (paragraph 28), and unscrewed to release memory (paragraph 35), triggering the confession. It constrains the ritual's form and charges the final turn. Two distinct beats with closure linkage; swapping it for a generic object would weaken the sensory/memory bridge.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Imperfect miracles" is signaled late (paragraph 31: "This is where imperfect miracles live") and functions thematically rather than as a constraint on tactics. It reweights the ending—"nothing is saved cleanly, only rerouted"—but does not shape earlier choices. Setup is absent; payoff is present but oblique. Lyric reprise without mid-scene causal pressure; mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Advises through metaphors" appears early (paragraph 10: "she opened her notebook and began to speak headlines"), constrains the middle ritual (metaphors answered by metaphors), and is renounced at climax ("no coy metaphors, only names, dates"). The trait enables and then is forfeited with visible cost. Two beats, causal pressure, closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Reconnect" is stated as goal (paragraph 19: "I came to reconnect"), drives the middle attempt (speaking to Liora through metaphors), and succeeds at closure when the hand steadies hers and she sends the confession. Major turns trace directly to this action; swapping it would require rewriting stakes and ending. Strong causal pressure and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Induced currents" is introduced early (paragraph 17: "learned to work through induced currents"), shapes the middle ritual ("currents answered," lights pulsing), and the final surge ("currents surged, lights flaring") accompanies the hand-over-hers moment. The method enables the contact but could plausibly be replaced by another paranormal switchboard with moderate edits. Two beats, moderate causal pressure, closure participation; mid-range.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The sheet music archive is the sole location, introduced in paragraph 6, supplies the copper veins that enable the ritual, and the "orchard-green" exit sign charges the final image. Setting constrains the method and provides resources (reel machine, shelves, scores erasing) that shape the encounter. Setup, development, and payoff present with causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The orchard deadline is framed in the opening line and paragraph 31 ("Time narrowed to a corridor between one destruction and another"), tightening the decision window. The "dawn" threat pressurizes Mirabel's urgency. However, the archive action does not explicitly track elapsed time or show the clock shrinking options beat-by-beat. Setup and thematic payoff present; mid-scene tick absent. Moderate integration.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The apology motive is introduced early (paragraph 5), drives every beat (descending to the archive, the ritual, the confession), and the closure hinges on delivering it via the sent piece. Friction between wanting absolution and the cost of public admission is dramatized on-page. Three beats, strong causal pressure, closure participation, visible cost. High integration.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Ethereal grit" is sustained throughout: concrete archive grit (dust, mold, copper) interwoven with ethereal currents, metaphor voices, and the hand-guiding moment. Tone modulates with pressure—elevated metaphor density in the middle, stripped declaratives at climax—and charges the final image ("sawdust, rain, and something finally released"). Coherent and purposeful; closure benefit clear.</comment>
