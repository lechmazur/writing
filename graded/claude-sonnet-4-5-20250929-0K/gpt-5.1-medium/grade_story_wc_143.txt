<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Ilya's interiority is specific and embodied—"dawnlit melancholy settled in his chest, heavy and patient, like dust refusing to rise"—and his micro-choices (pressing his glove into dust, choosing the amber vial over red) reveal hierarchy of values under pressure. The daughter relationship supplies credible internal conflict between duty and preservation instinct. Minor slip: the "purposefully curious in a career that punished curiosity" feels like assigned trait rather than dramatized contradiction, though the choice to photograph and leave his own print partially earns it.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Ilya breaks the amber vial (beauty witnessed) while the red vial (extinction signal) stays cold, crystallizing his stance—he certifies destruction but refuses to mourn it as total loss, a renunciation with visible cost (the heritage zone dies on his approval). Causal lens holds: his inspection powers the countdown, his choice to declare stability forecloses reprieve, and the final gestures (photo, print, amber signal) reconfigure the stakes from binary preserve/destroy to witnessing-as-resistance. Orientation is clean by the second paragraph. One meaningful tightening: the T-minus-twenty ping narrows the window and forces the vial choice.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The moonlit summit, crater rim, and floodlit harvesters below create spatial pressure that Ilya navigates—anchoring the tripod at the rim's edge, kneeling by the marker, pouring powder onto basalt. The regolith's "dry, thin vibration" and the pulsar-white beacon blink anchor his sensory hierarchy (visual countdown, tactile contact with dust). The setting constrains his final choice: he cannot save the grain, only witness and signal. The glassy basalt pan and "jagged shadows that knife-edged away" charge the closure image of him leaving his own print beside history's.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early: photograph the footprint/grain before obliteration. One meaningful tightening via the T-minus-twenty ping and the explicit choice: declare instability (lie, defer) or certify (truth, irreversible). The vial system externalizes the stakes—amber chosen, red refused—so the cost is legible. Agency is renunciation with visible price: he could buy time but sends workers into different risks, so he accepts the loss and signals beauty instead of extinction. Minor dock: the grain itself remains abstract; we never see it or its coordinates tested, so the "nightwatch's hourglass sand grain" reads more as thematic token than object under direct pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of witnessing versus erasure emerges through the vial colors, the daughter's delayed receipt, and Ilya's choice to leave his own anonymous print—particulars that avoid overt statement. The "dawning hush" reframes industrial countdown as moral threshold. The daughter's question "Who inspects you when you make the craters?" seeds the final image: no one marks his faults, so he marks the dust himself, a gesture that reweights complicity without resolving it. The amber glow will peak after he's gone, a delayed answer that chooses beauty over extinction signal. No thematic echo or moralizing in the final lines.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-limited POV stable throughout; distance modulates purposefully from technical brevity ("checked the seals") to lyric interiority ("dawnlit melancholy settled…like dust refusing to rise"). Perceptual signature is consistent: crater rim as "throat," harvesters as "submerged city," the grain "trying to speak in frequencies too slow to hear." Diction stays within Ilya's engineer-poet register; no filter-verb stacks or head-hopping. One minor rhythm slip: "by his boot" and "on a flat shard of basalt by his boot" in adjacent actions feels like template echo, though it doesn't obscure the vial-breaking beat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Information density is high and propulsion strong through the countdown structure. Figurative language ("stranded iceberg," "knife-edged away," "velvet dark") vivid but controlled. Two line-level issues: "That something was a single grain…" after "He had come to photograph the last of something precious" is a paraphrase loop that restates rather than advances (−0.3). "The mission brief called this…the dawning hush, as if quiet could be scheduled. / Ilya preferred the older word: morning" toggles terminology without adding pressure, a scaffold move (−0.2). Otherwise clean syntax, clear action order, no grammar slips.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lunar heritage-zone countdown offers a fresh angle on preservation-versus-progress, and the chemical-vial message system to the daughter is a specific, non-obvious synthesis. The inspector-as-witness frame transforms the compliance plot into complicity meditation. Risk: the lyric register and delayed-signal structure heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. Dock: the "nightwatch's hourglass sand grain" label feels imposed rather than discovered—archivists naming it that way reads like thematic convenience. The daughter anchor and vial payoff feel earned in hindsight, lifting the piece above template.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Ilya (crater inspector) anchors all beats. His choices—check seals, frame the shot, press glove into dust, break amber vial, leave red vial unopened—drive the ending's Charged Poise. Setup clear in opening paragraphs; middle beats (tripod anchoring, tablet ping) show him navigating the countdown; closure hinges on his vial selection. Causal role across three beats and the ending image. Docked for light agency: he verifies rather than intervenes, so the grain's fate never truly rests on a hard fork he controls, only on his signaling choice.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The nightwatch's hourglass sand grain is named three times and supplies thematic resonance ("counting every footstep, every orbit, every silence"), but it never appears on the page as a handled object or visible coordinate. Ilya imagines it "down there" and feels the regolith's vibration, yet the grain itself remains abstract—no excavation attempt, no close pass with the camera, no moment where its presence alters his tactics. Setup present (paragraph 8–9); lyric reprise in the penultimate paragraph reweights the vigil motif, earning mid-band eligibility. Swappability moderate: "last untouched dust" could replace it with minor edits. Cap at functional-but-symbolic range.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Dawning hush introduced early ("the mission brief called this window…the dawning hush") and Ilya's preference for "morning, a time when you still had a choice to turn back" frames the inspection as a threshold decision. The concept reappears in the final line ("as the dawning hush finally broke"), bracketing the narrative and charging the closure moment when he chooses amber over red. It shapes stakes (the countdown is both temporal and moral) but doesn't directly alter tactics on the page—no scene where the "hush" imposes a physical constraint or enables a maneuver. Two-gate participation (setup, closure reprise) with thematic weight but limited middle development.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Purposefully curious appears once as a label in paragraph 5 ("Ilya Varick, purposefully curious in a career that punished curiosity") and his act of photographing the site before obliteration loosely dramatizes it. The trait doesn't visibly constrain or enable a specific on-page choice with cost—he was sent to inspect, so the photography is add-on rather than trade-off. No moment where curiosity forces him to linger past safety, bypass protocol, or sacrifice another priority. Present and logically consistent but ornamental; swappable with "sentimental" or "preservationist" without structural change.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Outlast surfaces in paragraph 12 ("verify structural stability so the machines could outlast storms…for decades") as the inspection's technical mandate. Ilya's role is to certify the rim will endure, but the action itself doesn't drive a key turn—he never tests the rim under stress, debates structural flaws, or uses endurance logic to justify his choice. The heritage zone's surrender and the grain's vigil evoke persistence thematically, yet "outlast" as a verb or constraint doesn't shape his vial decision or the final image. Functional presence in the brief but replaceable with "withstand" or "survive" without altering story logic. Introduced late (past the 40% mark in exposition); no closure participation beyond thematic echo.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Chemical reactions for timed messages seeded early (paragraph 14: "using chemical reactions for timed messages he had taught her") and demonstrated twice on the page: the amber vial cracked and poured in the penultimate paragraph, its slow gold bloom timed to peak hours later when his daughter sees it; and the implicit system (blue/green/amber/red) that structures his mission choices. The method enables the story's central decision (which vial to break) and charges the closure—Ilya's signal will outlive his presence, a delayed witness. The mechanics are specific (activator bead, powder on basalt) and irreplaceable; swapping for radio or photo would lose the asynchronous, chemical-patience motif. Present across setup, middle choice (which vial?), and payoff.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Moonlit summit anchors every beat: the windless silence, Mons Lucerna glowing above, the glassy basalt rim where Ilya kneels, the crater's throat below with dormant harvesters. The setting supplies the coordinates (rim edge), the tactile regolith vibration when he presses his glove down, and the spatial constraint (he cannot descend to retrieve the grain; he can only witness from above). The beacon's pulsar-white blink and the faint seam of distant sunrise frame the temporal pressure. The summit as vantage point charges the final image: he photographs "not the footprint itself…but the thin horizon where black sky bled toward distant sunrise." Environment is irreplaceable and essential across all three gates.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>During the space age frames the story ("During the space age, even secrets had countdowns and mission patches") and contextualizes the heritage-zone embargo, autonomous harvesters, and countdown ritual. The era supplies the tension between romantic preservation and industrial necessity. It does not function as a live clock that alters Ilya's moves beat by beat—the T-minus-twenty ping does that work—but it provides the cultural backdrop (archivists, mission patches, scheduled obliteration) that makes the vial-signal system legible. Setup clear; thematic presence throughout; minimal direct constraint on tactics. Two-gate participation (setup, thematic closure context) without middle pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>To photograph the last of something precious stated explicitly in paragraph 7 and dramatized across the arc: Ilya anchors the tripod, frames the horizon, shoots long exposures, and leaves his own print as witness. The motivation conflicts with his orders (verify stability, enable harvest) and his awareness that declaring instability would be a lie with consequences. The desire drives three beats (setup camera, take exposures, choose vial) and charges the closure—amber chosen over red signals he saw beauty, fulfilling the motive despite complicity. Visible cost: he certifies destruction to preserve one delayed image. Friction between want (preserve) and duty (certify) is on the page.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dawnlit melancholy introduced explicitly in paragraph 20 ("A dawnlit melancholy settled in his chest, heavy and patient, like dust refusing to rise") and sustained through the piece: "windless silence that felt older than recorded time," the "submerged city…dreaming of industry," the daughter's question about who inspects the inspectors. Tone modulates under pressure—elegiac in setup, tightening with the T-minus ping, then resolving to restrained acceptance as he breaks the amber vial and the hush breaks. The tone charges the final image (red vial stays cold; beauty signal sent; heritage dies). Coherent through turns and essential to the closure's emotional register.</comment>
