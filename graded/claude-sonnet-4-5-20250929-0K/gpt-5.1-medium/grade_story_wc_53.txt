<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The protagonist's interior is richly textured with contradictory impulses—scavenging borrowed lives while negotiating with their own absence—and the final choice to surrender relics feels earned by the accumulation of prior micro-decisions. Interiority is concrete and lyric: "resolve is only what remains when all the better things erode." The ghost conversation embodies internal conflict cleanly, though the protagonist's agency leans observational until the final offering. Embodied emotion is present but occasionally drifts into elevated diction that slightly obscures immediacy under peak pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story teaches its mosaic structure early—carousel, lagoon, ghost negotiation—and accumulates density through interwoven imagery (gears, music, reflections) that tightens toward the closure beat. The ending delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the protagonist empties their pockets, the ghost absorbs the relics, and the final image of "overlapping selves" reweights the scavenging premise with visible cost (the protagonist's burden transferred, their hollowness acknowledged). Orientation is clear by line 3. One slip: the causal link between collecting fragments and the ghost's final acceptance could be sharper; the ghost's critique ("echoes when you could have spoken") lands thematically but the transactional logic of the exchange is slightly soft.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The kinetic lagoon is not mere backdrop—it supplies the camera wheel, dictates the rowing approach, and its mirrored gears/machine-made tide charge every choice. The disposable camera wheel functions as micro-setting: its plastic teeth and fogged negatives materialize eroded ambitions and enable the ghost's response. Sensory hierarchy is consistent (mirrored surfaces, steam-clockwork seagulls, muffled calliope) and filtered through the protagonist's scavenging lens. The lagoon's fractured stillness directly shapes the final beat: "the lagoon echoes the motion with a slow, reluctant ripple." Spatial choreography (shore → skiff → center) is clean and purposeful.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—negotiating with one's own ghost to resolve chronological confusion and eroded ambitions—is signaled early and pursued through every beat. Pressure accumulates via the Accumulative lens: each scavenged relic tightens the protagonist's burden until the ghost's critique ("fed on echoes") forces the choice to surrender. The final surrender forecloses the scavenging path with visible cost (pockets emptied, weight transferred). Agency is present but mediated: the protagonist rows, offers, but the ghost's absorption does the final work. One meaningful deepening occurs when the ghost rejects the fragments as "rusts worth of other peoples eroded ambitions," narrowing options to genuine offering or continued orbit.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—the impossibility of filling oneself with borrowed lives and the cost of orbiting one's own absence—emerges organically from every image and choice without thesis statement. The disposable camera wheel, fogged negatives, and scavenged relics function as non-literal particulars that charge the theme. The ghost's line "you fed on echoes when you could have spoken" distills the thematic question without moralizing. The final image of the ghost "crowded with faint, overlapping selves" offers a resonant, oblique answer: the protagonist's burden is transferred but not resolved, and the cost (emptiness, acknowledgment of failure) is undeniable. No thematic echo or prompt-language intrusion; the carousel metaphor (orbiting a center refused) integrates seamlessly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Single first-person POV with a distinct lyric-philosophical voice: "resolve is only what remains when all the better things erode." Distance is stable; psychic access stays interior. Diction is consistently elevated and poetic, fitting the reflective, post-death frame; occasional phrases ("rusts worth," "syrupy drag") show specificity. The ghost's unspoken speech ("says without speaking") is handled cleanly. One minor slip: "believing every click preserved a future worth seeing" briefly narrates the unseen camera-owner's motive with unearned certainty, a small leak in focalization. Filter verbs ("I regret," "I thought") appear frequently but read voice-motivated given the reflective mode. No dialogue on the page; monologue and reported ghost-speech carry subtext.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Rhythm is varied and purposeful; sentence openings shift, and paragraph lengths create visual breathing. Information density is high: nearly every line advances image, memory, or negotiation. A paraphrase-loop issue: "I thought if I filled myself with enough borrowed lives, the gaps in my timeline would stop aching" and the ghost's "you fed on echoes" restate the same idea across adjacent beats without added pressure (−0.2). Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent; one mixed metaphor: "the lagoon sands them down, grain by grain, until they are smooth enough to skip" conflates grinding and skipping stones without clear vehicle. Stock phrase: "smooth enough to skip" is a minor cliché. No template cadence or major scaffold. Propulsion is strong through the final image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of kinetic lagoon, post-death scavenging, and ghost negotiation via disposable-camera-wheel particulars feels specific and non-obvious. The carousel-as-orbit metaphor transforms a familiar trope through the lived detail of "syrupy drag on every note" and "the crowd restless and unaware." Emotional specificity (feeding on borrowed stories to fill gaps) avoids generic grief templates. The final image—ghost absorbing overlapping selves—is fresh and earned. One proximity concern: "negotiate with one's own ghost" echoes common self-reckoning language, but the execution (scavenged relics, camera wheel mechanics) transforms it. Risk-taking in the lyric-mosaic structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity (+0.3 within band).</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The resolute scavenger is signaled in paragraph 4, drives the rowing choice (middle beat), and makes the key decision to surrender relics at closure. All three gates met; two distinct beats (trawl, offering); causal pressure (scavenging → burden → forced choice); closure linkage (final surrender). Swappability is low; the trait "resolute" shapes the persistence through the trawl and the willingness to empty pockets. Visible cost: the protagonist's identity as scavenger is renounced on the page.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The disposable camera wheel appears in paragraph 16 (~mid-story, setup penalty −0.3), is pocketed and carried to the skiff (middle beat), then handed to the ghost who turns it to summon confessions (closure beat). All three gates met; two distinct beats; causal work (wheel enables ghost's response); closure linkage (ghost turns wheel, triggering the final critique). Specificity high: plastic teeth, fogged negatives, the act of turning. One deduction for late setup; otherwise indispensable to the negotiation mechanic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Eroded ambitions are seeded in paragraph 5, shape every scavenging choice (middle: "ambitions go first; the lagoon sands them down"), and are explicitly named by the ghost at closure ("rusts worth of other peoples eroded ambitions"). All three gates met; causal pressure (the concept defines what is scavenged and why); closure linkage (ghost's critique hinges on this). The concept is not merely thematic—it constrains tactics (protagonist gathers smoothed ambitions, not raw hopes) and reweights the final image. Irreplaceable: removing this exact phrase would collapse the story's stakes.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Chronologically confused is named in paragraph 7, illustrated by "some days I remember the end of my life more clearly than the day it began," and underpins the need to "gather myself back together." Setup and middle development present; closure participation is oblique (the ghost negotiation addresses the confusion but does not dramatize it in the final beat). Two gates met → cap ~6.0; lyric reprise (early confusion → final overlapping selves) adds +0.3. One distinct beat (memory reflection); some causal work (motivates scavenging method). Swappability moderate; "disoriented" or "fragmented memory" could substitute with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Regret is seeded in paragraph 24 ("I regret the carousel most"), drives the reflection on orbiting absence (middle beat), and charges the ghost's critique at closure ("you fed on echoes"). All three gates met; two distinct beats; causal pressure (regret motivates the negotiation and frames the final offering). Closure linkage is strong but indirect: regret underpins the surrender, yet the word itself does not appear in the final image. Specificity moderate; "remorse" or "guilt" could approximate the function. Cost connection present (regret → acknowledged failure → emptied pockets).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The method is named in paragraph 12 and demonstrated in paragraphs 13–14 (trawl, retrieve wheel, gather stories). It shapes the middle attempt (scavenging beats) and the ghost critiques the method at closure ("fragments are not a life"). All three gates met; two distinct beats; causal work (method fills the skiff with relics that become the offering). Closure linkage clear (ghost's rejection hinges on the method's inadequacy). Swappability low; the specific act of collecting overheard stories (not memories, not objects alone) is necessary. One deduction: the mechanics are asserted more than shown; we see one camera wheel retrieved but the "years of scavenging" are summarized.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The kinetic lagoon is anchored in paragraph 2, supplies the camera wheel and seagulls (middle resource), and its "slow, reluctant ripple" echoes the ghost's headshake at closure. All three gates met; constrains choices (rowing is necessary, gears turn fastest at center); supplies resources (relics from shallows). Closure linkage strong (lagoon's ripple amplifies the ghost's rejection). Specificity high: mirrored gears, machine-made tide, brass lungs of the carousel. Irreplaceable: a static pond or ordinary water would not supply the kinetic/mechanical stakes or the "surface as skin of mirrored gears" imagery that charges every beat.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The timeframe is named in the opening line and establishes the still moment post-carousel. Setup clear; middle participation weak (the "after" state is backdrop but does not tighten decisions on the page beyond permitting stillness). Closure participation oblique: the halted carousel frames the negotiation but does not create urgency. Two gates met (setup, closure ambiance) → eligible ~6.0. One distinct beat (opening stillness). Swappability moderate; "at dawn" or "when the music stops" could serve similarly. No live clock that alters tactics; time is static rather than pressuring.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The motivation is named in paragraph 10, drives the rowing choice and offering (middle beats), and structures the entire closure beat (face-to-face negotiation, exchange of relics). All three gates met; three distinct beats; causal pressure (desire to negotiate → scavenge → row → offer → ghost's terms). Closure linkage absolute (the final image is the negotiation's result). Specificity high: not merely "confront" or "reconcile" but "negotiate," implying terms and exchange. Visible cost (pockets emptied, ghost absorbs the burden). Friction and conflict present (ghost critiques, protagonist has no verbal answer, only objects).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fractured stillness is named in the opening line, modulates through the trawl (clockwork seagulls, muffled music) and rowing (skiff sways, lagoon "trying to keep its fractured stillness"), and charges the closure beat ("slow, reluctant ripple" as the ghost gathers overlapping selves). All three gates met; tone coheres through accumulation and intensifies at the final image. Causal pressure (stillness is threatened by motion, negotiation, and the ghost's rejection). Closure linkage strong (final ripple embodies fractured stillness under pressure). Specificity and irreplaceability high: the exact pairing of "fractured" and "stillness" defines the lagoon's paradox and the protagonist's state.</comment>
