<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The narrator's grief over a lost voicemail is embodied through concrete action—fetching the box, connecting cables—and the final choice to play the recording forecloses the path of clinging to spectral echoes with visible cost. Internal contradiction appears in the recoil versus resolve ("everything in me recoils like tape catching on a bent reel") and the recurring amber talisman objectifies the tension between trapped time and agency. Minor slips: the constellation tattooist profession and baby-cry translation remain ornamental labels that don't constrain any on-page choice, and the brother's characterization stays thin despite carrying thematic weight.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands on the page as a Decisive Change: the protagonist offers the saved voicemail, the firmware quiets, and the meteors burn—a clear before/after with felt cost (surrendering the last living trace). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure builds through layered images (amber, monitor wail, tattoos) and the failsafe letter deepens stakes without reversing them. Orientation is anchored early (laboratory, night, narrator alone) and the causal chain from firmware cry → failsafe instruction → voicemail sacrifice reads cleanly. One friction: the handwritten-letters backstory and the firmware's sudden ability to cry like a newborn arrive without prior setup, creating a small motivational seam that doesn't break the closure but softens its inevitability.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The laboratory is vividly textured—tape machines, wax cylinders, server rack with firefly lights—and the amber piece constrains the narrator's stance ("so the firmware remembers it is not the only thing that can trap a life"), charging the final image when paired with the voicemail box. Sensory detail is filtered through the POV's grief-soaked attention (air tastes like "dusted vinyl and rain caught in microphones") and the meteors provide atmospheric pressure without becoming postcard. The micro-setting (mixing board, central console drawer) enables the climactic action. One slip: spatial choreography between the lab and upstairs room is cursory, and the "rooms above the lab" remain a placeholder rather than lived-in space.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—hushing the dissonance of guilt and recovering the brother's voice—is signaled early and tightens when the firmware cries in a simulated infant wail layered with the brother's deleted voicemail. The failsafe instruction forces a trade-off (offer "your truest sound") and the protagonist's retrieval and playback of the saved voicemail is an earned, high-cost agency move that forecloses clinging to the haunted echo. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens through escalating imagery and the clock showing "every hour at once." However, the firmware's sudden vocal manifestation and the failsafe's late appearance (final third) weaken escalation continuity; the turn feels more discovered than causally compelled by prior protagonist choices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme—grief as looped recording versus release through offering—emerges through particulars: the amber insect, the firmware's crying frequency, the constellation tattoos, and the brother's living laughter on the saved voicemail. The final image (his voice filling the room, firmware going quiet, meteors burning) offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in the amber totem's purpose and the narrator's recoil-then-resolve gesture. One slip: the baby-cry translation gift is announced thematically ("infants are born fluent in the oldest frequencies") but never dramatized in a concrete choice, weakening its integration with the thematic question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable, with a distinct perceptual signature (grief-soaked, techno-arcane) and purposeful diction ("throat in the dark," "misfiring in the silence between my heartbeats"). Psychic distance modulates effectively under pressure—short, breathless syntax when the firmware cries, then deliberate focus during the cable-connecting beat. The narrator's voice is specific and consistent, blending elegy with technical detail. Minor friction: the phrase "the way I translate baby cries into precise sentences" and the handwritten-letters exposition feel slightly external, as if serving the prompt rather than emerging from the narrator's lived idiom. No dialogue present; no penalty for absence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully (long lyric openings, terse action beats), and figurative language is dense but mostly controlled ("air tastes like dusted vinyl," "hands shaking as if the meteors are dragging my bones toward the sky"). Information density is high; most lines advance atmosphere, character, or stakes. Two artifacts lower the score: paraphrase loops ("the firmware feeds on anything old" / "the firmware has found a new frequency" / "the haunted firmware goes very quiet" recycle the same noun-phrase stem across beats) and stacked filter constructions ("I could still hear it," "I instinctively map," "I know instantly") dull immediacy in high-pressure moments. The loops don't obscure causality but reduce propulsion in the middle third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The synthesis—grief-as-deleted-audio meets haunted-firmware lab meets constellation tattooist—is fresh and the amber totem, saved voicemail, and baby-cry layer provide specific, non-obvious texture. The ending's logic (offer the truest sound to silence the echo) feels earned in hindsight and avoids the obvious exorcism trope. However, the constellation-tattooist profession and baby-cry translation remain ornamental quirks that don't transform the core arc; stripping them leaves the plot and emotional trajectory largely intact. The piece commits fully to its premise but hedges slightly by listing multiple unusual traits rather than centering one with full consequence.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The constellation tattooist identity appears early (first paragraph) and returns at the meteor-watching beat ("the tattoos I inked there to remember him"), reweighting the narrator's grief with a visual motif. However, the profession itself never constrains a choice or alters tactics; the tattoos are passive memorial rather than active pressure. The narrator's key decision—playing the voicemail—doesn't require tattooist skill or knowledge. Present across setup and closure, but swappable with any other memorial craft.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The amber with insect appears early on the central console, is handled ("When I held it to my ear"), reappears in reflection ("I keep the amber near the server rack"), and is touched again at the climactic beat ("I touch the piece of amber"). Its meaning evolves from curiosity to talisman to touchstone for resolve. It shapes the narrator's stance (reminding the firmware it is not the only trap) and charges the final decision, but it doesn't mechanically enable or block any action—its role is symbolic pressure rather than causal necessity.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Haunted firmware is introduced early, establishes the lab's function ("codebase where every deleted voice leaves behind a restless echo"), drives the middle turn (firmware cries like a newborn), and shapes the climax (goes quiet when offered the voicemail). It defines the stakes (deleted brother's voicemail persists in the system) and the failsafe tactic (offering sound to the firmware). Removing it collapses the plot. Minor friction: its sudden vocal manifestation in the final third feels like a rule expansion rather than prior setup paying off.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The baby-cry translation ability is announced early and thematically justified ("infants are born fluent in the oldest frequencies"), but it never constrains or enables an on-page action. The monitor spill "translates itself in my head," yet the narrator doesn't perform the translation—the text simply delivers the decoded message. The trait is told as key and curse but remains ornamental; swapping it for any other paranormal sensitivity wouldn't alter tactics or cost. Setup present, development and payoff absent.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Tether" appears in the letter instruction ("a way to tether the firmware back into silence") and shapes the climactic action (offering the voicemail to tether/anchor the firmware). The final beat enacts it: the firmware "goes very quiet" and the meteors burn, implying successful tethering. The word and concept drive the protagonist's goal and the ending's logic. Slightly swappable with "bind" or "anchor" in diction, but the mechanical role (connecting the saved voicemail to the firmware's need) is indispensable to closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Handwritten letters are introduced early, teach the narrator how to operate the lab and warn about the baby-cry gift, and the final letter in the console drawer provides the failsafe instruction that drives the climax. They frame the narrator's knowledge and prime the ending's tactic. However, their mechanics are summarized rather than dramatized (no on-page struggle to decode or retrieve them until the final drawer), and the medium itself (handwritten in antique furniture) doesn't impose a cost or constraint—email or a manual would function identically. Setup and payoff present, development thin.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The laboratory of lost sounds anchors the entire piece spatially and conceptually: tape machines and wax cylinders enable the narrator's work, the server rack houses the haunted firmware, the mixing board and central console are handled during the climax, and the high windows frame the meteors. The setting supplies the resources (failsafe letter, cables, saved voicemail box upstairs) and applies pressure (firmware manifestation, time folding). Removing the lab setting collapses both atmosphere and plot logic. Strong across all three gates.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"When time folds in on itself" appears in the opening and returns tonight ("Time is folding again; the clock above the mixing board shows every hour at once"), creating atmospheric pressure and signaling the firmware event window. However, the timeframe doesn't tighten decisions in a causal way—no countdown forces faster action, and the folding serves as mood rather than constraint. The narrator's retrieval and playback proceed at narrative pace without temporal friction. Present at setup and closure with thematic weight, but swappable with any other liminal-time marker.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The motivation to hush old guilt is stated early ("I work here to hush the dissonance of old guilt, the static that has followed me since the day my brother died") and drives every beat: moving into the lab, learning its systems, and ultimately sacrificing the saved voicemail to silence the firmware's cry. The final action directly enacts the motivation with visible cost (surrendering the last living trace). Internal friction appears in the recoil moment, and the guilt is embodied through the misfiring heartbeat image. Told clearly, dramatized adequately, irreplaceable to the arc.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Meteor hush—meteors that "hush the sky instead of burning through it"—establishes tone in the opening and modulates through the piece: silent meteors frame the lab work, they "streak silently" during the tattoo reflection, and "finally burn" at closure when the brother's voice plays. The tonal shift (silence to burning) mirrors the protagonist's release from static to sound. Tone is coherent and charges the final image. However, "hush" as sustained mood is less distinct than melancholy or dread—it gestures toward quiet awe but doesn't impose a unique pressure. Strong closure link, moderate distinctness.</comment>
