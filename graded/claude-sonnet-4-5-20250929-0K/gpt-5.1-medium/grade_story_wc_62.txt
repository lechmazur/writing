<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias is consistently rendered through interior contradictions—his desire for collective understanding versus solitary grief—and embodied reactions (exhaling fog, smoothing ribbon with calloused fingers). The grandmother's spectral presence creates genuine pressure that forces micro-choices across carving sessions. The final realization ("grief as a ribbon, binding solitary hearts") feels earned by the accumulated acts of carving and retracing, though the epiphany risks arriving slightly too tidily packaged. Minor deduction for the closing metaphor feeling slightly over-articulated rather than purely shown.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density builds through nightly carving sessions, the ribbon accumulates charcoal marks mapping grief, and the final retracing reconfigures all prior material into one body of shared ache. Orientation anchors (Elias, greenhouse, dusk, butterfly migration) land within the opening lines. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Conceptual Repricing hybrid): the final image of butterflies rising "like a great, steadying hand" reweights the entire carving practice with felt cost—Elias has externalized private grief into communal ritual. One minor causality slip: the grandmother's announcement "this year, the butterflies will stay longer" is asserted rather than discovered, though it sets the structural frame clearly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The greenhouse at dusk is rendered through "glass bones...tick as the heat fled," cracked brick, fig-tree shadows, and ivy clusters—all filtered through Elias's carver's attention. The ribbon roll becomes micro-setting: pale blue with silver threads, its loose end pinned under a rusted trowel, later unwinding as a spatial guide across graves. The potting bench, stone slabs "like unfinished doors," and charcoal marks transform setting into working space that constrains his ritual. The final hill and the butterflies' "soft roar" charge the closure image. Spatial choreography across the cemetery paths remains clear throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake is established early: Elias seeks "the shape of collective grief" and "how all the losses braided together beneath the surface." Pressure accumulates through the grandmother's directive to carve secret verses for each death, threading the ribbon as a map. The retracing walk is the decisive tightening: reading hidden words aloud summons "an answering murmur...a shared ache changing shape." The butterflies' synchronized rise serves as the final turn, reweighting the solitary act into communal gesture. Cost is felt in Elias's sustained labor across the migration span and the exposure of private grief made public. One deduction: the grandmother's guarantee ("we will retrace") removes some uncertainty from the middle stretch.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—grief as connective tissue rather than isolating wound—emerges organically from carving practice, hidden verses, and the ribbon's literal binding function. The butterflies operate as both migration clock and thematic counterpoint (individual creatures forming collective pattern). The final image offers non-literal answer: "grief as a ribbon, binding solitary hearts into one quiet body" reweights the opening "crowded with unfinished sorrow" without stating a moral. The family custom of trading poems seeds the practice without forcing symbolism. Subtext operates in the grandmother's gestures and the village's unspoken "distances between the living." Minor penalty: the closing metaphor risks slight over-articulation; one more line of pure image might have been stronger.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable, filtering all perception through Elias's carver-specific attention: "calloused fingers," charcoal marks, the way stone "could quiet an entire village." Psychic distance modulates purposefully—close during ribbon-smoothing, slightly elevated during the retracing walk. The grandmother's dialogue carries distinct diction ("thundering calm of rain on distant hills") that contrasts with Elias's terser responses. Diction remains voice-consistent: "glass bones," "woven pattern...flickering like a second ribbon," "trembling clusters." Free indirect thought is clean. One slip: "fiercely meditative man" is told rather than shown through choices, though his sustained carving practice demonstrates the trait. The reflection on family dinner poems integrates smoothly, anchored to present practice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies effectively: short crisis beats ("You brought it, she said") alternate with longer descriptive passages. Information density is high—most sentences advance atmosphere, character memory, or carving ritual. Figurative language is controlled: "glass bones," "river of color," "shadows of the fig trees" all serve POV and setting. Two minor issues prevent higher score: "the thundering calm of rain on distant hills" mixes scale incoherently (thundering versus calm), and the phrase "fiercely meditative" is asserted without embodied grounding. The closing line risks slight overwriting—"grief as a ribbon, binding solitary hearts into one quiet body" stacks three metaphoric elements where two might have been sharper. No template cadence or synonym loops detected.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The spectral-mentorship-as-craft-inheritance premise is fresh, and the ribbon-as-map mechanic is specific to this carver's practice. The integration of butterfly migration as temporal frame and thematic echo (individual-to-collective) elevates familiar grief material. The hidden-verse carving detail and the family poem-trading custom feel particular rather than generic. However, the grandmother-as-ghost-teacher and the metaphor-discovery ending both trend toward recognizable templates. The piece synthesizes its elements well but does not achieve full surprise; the retracing payoff is visible from the setup. Risk-taking in the accumulative structure and lyric pacing adds +0.2 within band, but the emotional arc follows a relatively predictable path from solitary to communal understanding.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's profession frames every beat: he brings tools to the greenhouse, smooths the ribbon, carves secret verses nightly, and leads the retracing walk. His decision to carve hidden lines (rather than refuse or delay) drives the accumulation. The final understanding arrives through his carver's hands and eyes, making the role essential. Early signal (carver introduced first line), three-plus beats (workshop mention, nightly carving, retracing), closure linkage (the ribbon map exists because of his carving), and specificity (charcoal marks, chisel slip memory) all present. Causal pressure: his choice to carve secret verses enables the ribbon map and the retracing ritual. Cost: sustained labor across migration span and exposure of private practice.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The ribbon appears in beat one (potting bench, pale blue with silver threads, loose end under trowel), is handled and marked with charcoal across multiple carving sessions, and becomes the physical guide during the retracing walk. Its "almost spent" state at closure signals cost. The ribbon's dual inheritance (grandmother's belonging and the spectral lesson's tool) charges both its introduction and its final function. Early signal, three-plus beats (introduction, marking spans, unwinding during walk), closure linkage (the ribbon's map enables the collective-grief discovery), and high specificity (pale blue, silver threads, charcoal marks, "thin, determined river") all present. Irreplaceability: no generic string or cord would carry the grandmother's presence or the map function.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The spectral mentorship is signaled early ("less visible than the ribbon: a spectral mentorship that returned each autumn"), dramatized across multiple night visits, and provides the directive that shapes the entire carving ritual. The grandmother's presence forces Elias to speak poems aloud and carve hidden verses, decisions he would not make alone. Her final instruction to retrace enables closure. Early signal, three-plus beats (felt presence, each visit's lesson, final directive), closure linkage (she walks with him during retracing, and the butterflies rise as she completes the teaching), and causal pressure (without her, Elias remains stuck in solitary grief). Cost: Elias must externalize private grief and follow a ritual whose outcome he does not control.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The attribute appears as label ("fiercely meditative man") in paragraph five but is demonstrated through sustained carving practice, patient ribbon-marking, and the nightly return to the greenhouse despite emotional weight. The trait enables his willingness to follow the grandmother's slow, repetitive ritual rather than seeking quick resolution. However, the trait is told more than shown through a specific on-page choice with visible cost. Setup present (label and workshop context), development evident (nightly carving patience), and closure linkage weak (the retracing walk does not hinge on this trait specifically). Swappability moderate: "patient" or "deliberate" could replace with minor edits. The trait supports but does not drive key turns.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The retracing action is seeded early ("we will retrace the sorrow"), prepared through the ribbon's accumulating charcoal marks, and executed in the final sequence where Elias and the grandmother walk grave to grave, the ribbon unwinding as a map. The act of reading hidden verses aloud during the walk summons "an answering murmur" and enables the collective-grief realization. Without retracing, the carving remains private and the closure does not land. Early signal (grandmother's directive), two-plus beats (preparation via marking, execution during walk), closure centrality (the walk *is* the closure sequence), high specificity (unwinding ribbon, charcoal marks aligning with verses, murmur rising), and irreplaceability (no other action delivers the map-to-meaning transformation). Cost: Elias externalizes hidden work and hears the village's shared ache.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The family poem-trading custom is recalled in one reflection paragraph, directly motivates Elias's readiness to speak poems aloud during carving, and implicitly justifies the hidden-verse mechanic. The custom does not appear in dramatized action but provides clear causal groundwork: Elias's comfort with poems as communal language makes the grandmother's directive legible. Setup present (reflection anchored to "remembering"), development implicit (poem-speaking during carving sessions), closure linkage indirect (the hidden verses exist because of this training). Swappability moderate: another family ritual involving language could replace it. The method shapes but does not drive the ending. Penalty for summary-only use: −0.3 within band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The greenhouse is established in the opening beat (ancient, glass roof ticking, dusk), houses the carving tools and stone slabs, and provides the recurring nightly workspace where spectral visits occur. The setting's "glass bones" and "shadows of the fig trees" create the atmosphere that enables the grandmother's emergence. The greenhouse's contrast with the outdoor cemetery anchors the private-versus-public grief dynamic. Early signal, three-plus beats (arrival, nightly carving sessions, butterflies against glass), closure linkage (butterflies "against the greenhouse glass" signal the retracing moment), and specificity (cracked brick, potting bench, fig trees, ivy) all present. The setting constrains the ritual by providing tools, slabs, and a liminal space between carver's solitude and cemetery's public mourning.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The butterfly migration is introduced in paragraph four, frames the grandmother's teaching span ("across the full span of their migration"), and provides the ticking clock for the ritual's completion. "Night after night" and "last night of the migration" track elapsed time. The butterflies' restless spirals against glass signal urgency before the retracing walk. The migration's end forces closure. Early signal, two beats (migration mentioned, final night arrival), closure linkage (butterflies rising "in a single thrum" at the moment of realization), and moderate specificity (first wave, sleeping clusters, restless spirals). The timeframe tightens decisions: Elias cannot delay beyond the migration window. Cost: the deadline pressures completion and the grandmother's departure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The motivation is stated clearly early ("he wanted...to discover the shape of collective grief"), drives every carving choice (selecting which poem, carving secret verses, marking the ribbon), and is satisfied at closure when he "understood that the village had been grieving not only for the dead but for the distances between the living." The motivation is tested when the grandmother directs him to carve in secret rather than public display, forcing a tradeoff between visibility and depth. Early signal, three-plus beats (workshop crowding triggers the desire, each carving session pursues it, retracing walk delivers it), closure centrality (the realization *is* the closure), and causal pressure (Elias's sustained effort over weeks enables the discovery). Cost: labor, exposure, and the grief he carries while mapping others' losses.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The tone "thundering calm" is seeded in the grandmother's voice description ("thundering calm of rain on distant hills") and maintained through the piece's patient accumulation, quiet carving beats, and the butterflies' "soft roar" that paradoxically "laid itself over the graves like a great, steadying hand." Diction throughout balances intensity (glass bones ticking, murmur rising, thrum of wings) with restraint (thoughtful, meditative, quiet body). The tone modulates appropriately: dusk stillness in the greenhouse, rising urgency as butterflies spiral, and final resonance when sound becomes tactile pressure. Setup present (grandmother's voice), coherence across beats, and closure charge (the butterflies' roar is both loud and calming). One slip: "thundering calm of rain on distant hills" internally contradicts scale (thunder is proximate and loud; distant rain is soft), weakening the tonal anchor.</comment>
