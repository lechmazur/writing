<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's interior life is concrete and embodied—the glass vial grows heavier with unfinished thoughts, the fear is "a clenched fist." The core choice to thank fear and ask it to step aside is motivated by the vial-uncorking pressure, but the micro-choices leading there feel somewhat telescoped; the protagonist's agency compresses into a single reflective move rather than a sequence of contradictory impulses acting in scene. The locksmith remains atmospheric and enigmatic without decisive on-page choices that constrain the protagonist's path. Interiority avoids therapy-speak, but the final beat's gentleness risks softening the visible cost required for the 7+ band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors quickly (viaduct, twilight, locksmith's threadbare coat). The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the vial's uncorking triggers a pressure-release that reweights the protagonist's stance toward fear. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—thanking fear and asking it to step aside crystallizes a new relationship with the trapped idea, and the cost is felt as the protagonist shifts from guarding to releasing. The piece teaches its lyric pattern early and holds it through the ending. One meaningful deepening occurs when the locksmith uncorks the vial and the "pressure" unfurls, altering the protagonist's internal stance. Minor deduction: the cost at closure is atmospheric and emotional but not entirely legible as a foreclosed path or concrete sacrifice on the page, keeping this below 7.8.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The viaduct functions as a charged threshold—"a hinge, a shadowed nexus under starlight"—and the first star's appearance constrains the locksmith's timing ("the hint has been given"). The river's "little broken roars" and the smell of rain from "somewhere past the map" anchor the scene in sensory detail filtered through the protagonist's anxious perception. The vial itself acts as a micro-setting object that charges the final image when uncorked. Spatial choreography is clear (edge of viaduct, river below, western hills). The setting actively shapes the moment of uncorking and the protagonist's disorientation, meeting the 9+ gate criterion.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—freeing an idea trapped behind fear—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs when the locksmith uncorks the vial and the protagonist feels the "clenched fist" of fear, then chooses to thank it rather than fight it. This choice narrows options (the protagonist accepts vulnerability) with a felt cost (releasing the protective stance). The escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens: the protagonist brings the vial, allows the uncorking, and shifts internal stance. The cost is emotionally legible but not materially specified—no visible renunciation or tactical sacrifice—keeping this in the mid-7s rather than higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the vial, the locksmith's axiom "everything you keep, keeps you in return," and the protagonist's shift from hating fear to thanking it. The final image—asking fear to step aside—offers a non-literal answer to the thematic question without moralizing. The recurring motif of the vial as keepsake-turned-weight accumulates pressure and charges the closure. No explicit thesis statement; the protagonist's epiphany is earned by the scene pressure. Subtext operates in the locksmith's cryptic lines and the protagonist's embodied dread. Minor limitation: the theme of "imprisoned ideas" risks abstraction, but the vial and hair ground it in concrete particulars, keeping resonance high.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice is lyric, consistent, and textured: "the sky was just beginning to bruise into twilight," "the town around us smudged into shadows," "the river spoke in little broken roars." POV is stable first-person with controlled distance and no head-hopping. Dialogue is sparse, goal-driven, and carries subtext—the locksmith's lines ("You are here for a lock, not for a joke") feel cryptic yet purposeful. Perceptual signature is strong: the protagonist filters setting through fear and longing. Rhythm modulates under pressure (short breaths when the vial is uncorked, longer cadences during reflection). Minor deduction: a few lines approach purple density ("everything you keep, keeps you in return" is elegant but risks maxim-speak), and the locksmith's speech occasionally tilts toward oracle-voice rather than grounded character idiom.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Figurative language is dense and mostly coherent: "the sky bruised into twilight," "the hair looked less like a keepsake and more like a vein torn from the dark," "space had inhaled." Rhythm varies and sentences avoid mechanical stems. Information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs. Template-cadence check: a few paragraph openings repeat "The locksmith [verb]" structure without taught pattern, triggering a −0.3 deduction in Q7. Stock metaphors appear ("sharp as a pin" for the star) without full transformation. The closure beat avoids loops and lands clearly. Overwriting density check: figurative language appears in most sentences of high-pressure beats (vial uncorking, pressure unfurling) without consistent lyric pattern-teaching, applying a −0.5 deduction per the Overwriting rule. Overall strong but falls short of 7.2+ due to accumulated craft slips that do not touch closure but reduce momentum in the middle third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The premise—enigmatic locksmith who opens non-physical locks—is familiar from fabulist and magical-realist templates. The piece transforms it through the specific vial (lock of hair, mother's deathbed gift) and the protagonist's internal conflict (fear as protector vs. jailer). The turn—thanking fear rather than conquering it—offers a fresh inflection on the "overcome your fear" arc. The viaduct as threshold and the first star as hinge-moment feel purposeful but not entirely original. Proximity check: the locksmith's role and dialogue echo common "wise guide" archetypes without full personalization. The piece commits to its premise and avoids hedging, but the core synthesis is recognizable from writing-prompt conventions. Within-band risk distinction: the choice to stage closure as gentle internal shift rather than confrontation is bold and coherent, adding +0.2 within the 6–7 range.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The locksmith is present early (setup), handles the vial and uncorks it (development), and delivers the axiom "everything you keep, keeps you in return" that frames the protagonist's final choice (payoff). He enables the protagonist's closure by uncorking the vial and observing with "care that felt almost reverent," but his own decisions do not create key turns—he acts as facilitator rather than agent. Two-beat involvement (taking vial, uncorking) + closure linkage (his axiom primes the protagonist's shift) + early signal place him in the 5.5–6.5 range. Swappability: a generic "guide" could replace him with minor edits, capping at ~6.0. Deduction for observation-without-decision in middle beats: −0.2. Final: 5.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The lock of hair is introduced early (setup), described as "the color of dried blood under moonlight" with tactile weight ("the vial grew heavier"), and is central to the uncorking beat (development). It appears in the final third when the protagonist feels the "pressure" rise from the vial, but the hair itself does not return with reweighted meaning at closure—the focus shifts to the abstract "idea" and "fear." Two-beat involvement (protagonist removes it, locksmith examines it) + early signal + causal pressure (the protagonist came to the viaduct because of the vial's weight). Payoff is partial: the vial is opened, but the hair does not charge the final image. Mid-development cap ~6.3 minus −0.1 for missing full closure reprise: 6.2.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Enveloped secrets (the idea trapped behind fear, the mother's deathbed words "there are doors inside you that no one else can see," the vial as container) shape stakes and tactics on the page. The protagonist's goal is to open the sealed idea, and the locksmith's method (uncorking the vial) dramatizes the concept. The concept drives the protagonist's choice to thank fear rather than fight it, altering tactics at closure. Early signal (mother's secret, vial as sealed keepsake) + two-beat involvement (vial brought to locksmith, uncorking) + causal pressure (the concept narrows options: the protagonist must accept vulnerability to unseal) + closure linkage (the concept reweights as "fear as door" rather than enemy). Specificity: the hair-as-secret is irreplaceable. Three gates met, causal pressure strong, closure participation clear: eligible for 7+. Minor deduction for thematic echo risk (concept borders on abstraction in final beat): −0.2. Final: 7.1.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Unassumingly bold is applied to the locksmith's stance ("unassumingly bold in his threadbare coat") but functions as label-only description. The trait does not constrain or enable a specific on-page action with visible cost—his boldness is asserted, not demonstrated through a choice that incurs a tradeoff. Setup present (early description) but no development beat where the trait alters tactics or closure participation where it charges the image. Late-appearance guidance does not apply (introduced early), but ornamental-use deduction does: −0.5. Cap for label-only trait per text-pattern: 4.6.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Disorient: "the air around us tilted, just enough to disorient my sense of where the ground ended and the sky began" occurs at the uncorking beat and triggers the protagonist's perceptual shift. This action enables the protagonist to feel the "pressure" and confront the "clenched fist" of fear, driving the final choice. Setup (locksmith hints at nexus and hinge), development (disorientation occurs during uncorking), payoff (disorientation allows the protagonist to access and thank fear). Two-beat involvement + causal pressure (narrows reality, enables internal access) + closure linkage (the shift in perception primes the final stance). Swappability test: removing "disorient" would require rewriting the uncorking's effect; it is not easily swapped. Eligible for 7+. Minor deduction: the disorientation is brief and does not recur or accumulate, keeping impact in mid-7s rather than high. Final: 7.3.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>A hint given by first star seen at twilight: the locksmith waits for the first star ("his eyes brightened, as though he had been waiting for that speck of light to speak"), and its appearance triggers the uncorking ("It says begin"). The method is signaled (locksmith follows the protagonist's gaze to the star) and its mechanics matter (the star authorizes the next move). Setup (twilight and viaduct framing), development (star appears, locksmith reads it), partial payoff (uncorking follows the hint, but the star does not return or reweight at closure). Two-beat involvement + early signal + causal link (the hint enables the uncorking). Missing full closure reprise: the star does not charge the final image. Lyric-resonance allowance: the star's "sharp as a pin" early image does not return with reweighted meaning. Mid-development cap ~6.0 minus −0.6 for missing closure participation: 5.4.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Shadowed nexus under starlight: the viaduct is described as "a hinge, a shadowed nexus under starlight" and the first star's appearance is awaited to authorize the uncorking. The setting pressures the protagonist's choice by providing a threshold space where the uncorking can occur and disorientation is plausible. Setup (viaduct and twilight anchor early), development (nexus framing and star appearance shape timing), payoff (the protagonist's disorientation and final choice occur within the nexus-space). Two-beat involvement + early signal + causal pressure (the setting enables the ritual uncorking and disorientation). Closure linkage: the setting does not return as a charged image at the end—the protagonist's focus shifts inward. Eligible for mid-6s. Minor deduction for postcard-description risk in middle beats ("bruised sky," "western hills") without full tactical constraint: −0.2. Final: 6.7.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Across the hush of cosmic possibility: the phrase appears once during the uncorking beat ("For a heartbeat, we were nowhere in particular, only suspended across the hush of cosmic possibility"). It evokes timelessness and suspension but does not track elapsed time, tighten a countdown, or constrain the protagonist's decisions. Setup absent (the phrase is not seeded), development present (the moment occurs during uncorking), payoff absent (time does not recur or charge the closure). One-beat involvement + no causal pressure (the timeframe is atmospheric, not tactical). Late first appearance (second half of story) + vague time (no clock or deadline) + ornamental use: caps at 4.6 per late-intro and decorative-use penalties. Minor lift for lyric coherence with the twilight framing: +0.2. Final: 4.8.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>To free an idea trapped behind fear: the motivation is dramatized early ("a bright, trembling idea that knocked whenever I tried to sleep, begging to get out"), drives the protagonist's journey to the locksmith, and shapes the final choice to thank fear and ask it to step aside. Setup (early interior monologue about the trapped idea), development (vial as embodiment of the trapped idea, protagonist's confession to locksmith), payoff (protagonist's final act of thanking and releasing fear). Three-beat involvement + causal pressure (the desire compels the journey and the final stance) + closure linkage (the motivation resolves in the final image). Friction between wants and costs: the protagonist fears releasing the idea but desires relief, and the cost is accepting vulnerability. Specificity: the motivation is character-particular (mother's deathbed words, vial's weight). Eligible for 7.5+. No major deductions. Final: 7.6.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Improbable longing: the phrase appears explicitly ("Improbable longing surged up in me, not for riches or love, but for the simple courage to let my own idea breathe") and the tone of yearning for release is sustained throughout (the protagonist's ache, the vial's weight, the "bright, trembling idea"). The tone is coherent through turns and modulates under pressure (anxiety at the viaduct, disorientation during uncorking, gentleness at closure). Setup (early interior longing and fear), development (longing intensifies as the locksmith prepares to uncork), payoff (longing resolves into the choice to release). Three-beat involvement + coherence + closure linkage. Minor deduction: the explicit naming of "improbable longing" mid-story risks label-speak and reduces subtextual charge; the tone could charge the final image more strongly without direct statement. Text-pattern deduction for label-only claim: −0.3. Final: 6.9.</comment>
