<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The designer's interiority is vivid and particular ("filters them through his ribcage," "steady ache shaped like a question mark facing upward"), with embodied contradiction between his serious playfulness and the soldiers' skepticism. His motivation to counter despair through spectacle is legible and drives micro-choices throughout (kneeling by crates, studying the knot, arranging shells). The captain and messenger remain functional pressures rather than developed characters, appropriate for this length. Minor deduction: the protagonist's arc lacks a visible transformation or renunciation with felt cost at closure—he completes his design as planned without a trade-off that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (wandering designer, blooming fortress courtyard, dusk/night) land clearly within the first third. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through sensory density, chants, and mosaic assembly toward the final image of the fiery hand. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (the spectacle executes, offering a note of defiance), but the cost remains abstract—no on-page consequence shows what the designer or garrison forfeits or risks beyond effort. The causal chain is clean (arrival → preparation → ignition), yet the ending feels more like completion than decisive change or charged poise with legible price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The blooming fortress is vivid and purposeful: vines with night-opening flowers, damp earth, bruised petals, covered lanterns demanded by archers. The courtyard's flagstones and cracks guide shell placement, and the "orange eye" workfire anchors spatial choreography. Sensory hierarchy reflects the designer's priorities (pollen, fear, echoes). The environment constrains choice (archers demand darkness, he works by feel) and charges the final image (the hand opens above the blooming walls). Micro-setting (the rag knot, fuses, crates) functions as setting and drives action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear early: counter despair before the invading army arrives at dawn. Pressure coheres through the designer's preparation and the garrison's brittle jokes spring-loading fear. One meaningful tightening occurs when he lights the first fuse after waiting "until the night feels thick enough to touch." Agency is present (he chooses timing, ties the knot to fuse, aligns shells), but the escalation reads as execution of a plan rather than a choice that narrows options or imposes visible cost. No reversal forces a trade-off; the design succeeds as intended without dramatized friction or price paid on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: defiance as design, sparks as refusal, the note "You are still held" written in fire. The cupped hand image avoids stated moral and reweights prior material (his walking chants, filtering fear through his ribcage, the soldiers' brittle jokes). Subtext operates in gesture and silence ("Do something with this or burn it," the messenger's snort yet lingering). The ending's resonance is non-literal and specific to this premise. Minor slip: "treats despair like a design flaw" edges toward thematic echo, though it remains in the narrator's voice rather than the protagonist's.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and close, with a distinct perceptual signature: the designer filters sensory detail through his craft (blossoms "brush each other with soft clicks, like cautious marbles in a pouch"), and his interiority is rhythmic and particular ("Wander wide, fire inside, ash to guide"). Diction remains controlled and voice-motivated throughout, with purposeful compression in phrases like "brightly elsewhere" and "serious playfulness." Dialogue is sparse but goal-driven (the captain's command, the designer's oblique answer about margins). Distance modulates cleanly with pressure (close during knot-tying, wider during soldier observations). No head-hopping or filter clutter.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, information density is high, and figurative language is vivid without overwhelming clarity ("ladder from sparks, rung by glittering rung," "sky is a stubborn page"). Minor density issue: a few adjacent lines restate content without adding pressure ("He thinks them brave for staying put when every instinct screams to be brightly elsewhere" closely echoes the prior garrison context). Template cadence appears in the middle third with repeated "He [verb]" stems across several lines (He kneels, He listens, He studies, He ties, He arranges), creating mild rhythmic monotony. No loops or scaffold that obscure causality; closure image is clean and propulsive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The premise—fireworks as anti-despair weapon during a siege at a blooming fortress—is specific and non-obvious, avoiding template plots. The designer's craft (ambient awareness, chants as doubt-defense, mosaic assembly) and the fire spinner's borrowed knot add fresh particulars. The cupped-hand finale grows inevitably from setup (his sketch on flagstones, the note's message). Risk-taking in lush, lyric diction heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Transformation test passes: swapping names/places would lose the blooming-fortress specificity and the designer's voice. Minor: the siege-artist trope has literary precedent; elevation comes from execution rather than entirely fresh ground.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Present from the opening line, the wandering fireworks designer drives every beat: he arrives, filters the garrison's fear, studies the rag knot, arranges shells, scratches the design, waits for the right moment, and lights the fuse. His choices (tying knot to fuse, aligning shells with cracks, timing ignition) create the key turn at closure. Visible cost is implied in his effort and the risk of failure ("misjudged wind turning his ladder of sparks into a rain of scars"), though the ending shows success without on-page consequence. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Introduced early (the captain tosses it: "Do something with this or burn it"), the rag knot appears in three beats: initial study, tying to fuse while chanting, and oiling before ignition. It enables the mosaic's palm ("the whirling knot, burning like a seed") and is specific to the absent fire spinner's craft. Functional across setup, development, and payoff. Caps at mid-6s because it is not irreplaceable—another fuel source could serve—and its properties (coarse cloth, fuel-soaked) are described but do not constrain a difficult choice or impose visible cost beyond effort.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The "note in mosaic" frames the premise early (he arranges shells "a note in mosaic written with fire") and shapes his tactics: aligning shells with cracks, sketching the cupped hand, timing the message "You are still held." The concept directly drives the ending image (the mosaic assembles, the note is written). It is present across setup, development, and payoff with clear causal pressure. Caps below 7.0 because the mechanics are summarized rather than dramatized in granular choices, and the cost of the mosaic method versus alternatives is not shown on the page.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Introduced in the second paragraph ("By habit he chants while walking") and reprised in three beats: "little nonsensical rhymes to keep doubt from clumping," whispering the chant while tying the knot ("Wander wide, fire inside, ash to guide"), and "Now he walks the circle of shells, murmuring, Let it lift them, let it lift me." The chant is tied to his coping mechanism after a prior failure and constrains his rhythm during preparation. However, it does not enable or prevent a key choice, and no visible cost or tradeoff is shown. Lyric reprise reweights the attribute at closure but lacks causal necessity.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The action "filter" appears once in interiority: "He listens now to the fortress itself, inhales fear and pollen, filters them through his ribcage." It is present in the middle third and describes his design process but does not drive a turn or constrain a later choice. The ambient-awareness method (9F) does more causal work. "Filter" reads as metaphor for his emotional labor rather than a repeatable action with mechanics that shape the ending. Swappable with "processes," "distills," or similar. Missing closure participation and development beats.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Signaled early ("practicing ambient awareness," "how he designs, through ambient awareness of crowd breaths, stone echoes, and unspoken wishes") and applied in development: he listens to the fortress, inhales fear and pollen, filters through his ribcage, and finds shells by shape rather than sight. The method enables his design approach and is present at closure (waiting "until the night feels thick enough to touch"). Setup, development, and payoff gates met. Caps at mid-6s because the mechanics are told more than shown in granular choices, and no scene dramatizes a cost or friction unique to this method versus another.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The blooming fortress at dusk is vivid and present from the title beat: vines, night-opening flowers, damp earth, bruised petals, covered lanterns, courtyard flagstones with cracks. The setting supplies resources (cracks guide shell placement, darkness demanded by archers shapes his workfire choice) and charges the final image ("Above the blooming fortress, a giant hand of fire opens"). Dusk transitions to night with no stars, tightening the hush. The environment constrains choices (darkness, ambient awareness required) and participates in closure. Strong setup, development, and payoff with causal pressure and specificity.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Signaled early ("the hush of a night with no stars") and present at closure ("He waits until the night feels thick enough to touch"). The timeframe creates atmospheric pressure and a live clock: the garrison believes the invading army will arrive at dawn, so the designer must act tonight. However, no on-page moment shows time running out or forcing a trade-off; he waits for the right moment by choice rather than deadline pressure. Setup and payoff gates met; development beat (a choice constrained by shrinking time) is weak. Lyric reprise reweights the hush but lacks urgent causal necessity.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Motivation is explicit early ("He has come to defy the gravity of hopelessness") and dramatized in choices: he studies the knot ("Do something with this or burn it"), arranges shells with care, waits for the right moment, and lights the fuse. Internal friction appears in his memory of prior failure ("misjudged wind turning his ladder of sparks into a rain of scars") and his hope that "the darkness will feel, for once, that something has reached up instead of down." The motivation drives all three gates and ties to the closure image. Minor cap: the phrase "defy the gravity of hopelessness" is slightly abstract and the cost of this defiance (what he risks or loses) is implied rather than shown on the page.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Tone is coherent and modulates with pressure: "serious playfulness" appears in his exact motions ("measured against disaster") paired with teasing gestures ("flicks the fuse like a teasing cat's tail"). The tone charges interiority ("steady ache shaped like a question mark facing upward") and dialogue (his oblique answer about margins). It holds through turns (soldiers' brittle jokes, his chants) and shapes the final image (the hand "catching hearts before they fall" blends gravity with lightness). Setup, development, and payoff gates met with strong perceptual signature. Diction supports the tone without forcing it.</comment>
