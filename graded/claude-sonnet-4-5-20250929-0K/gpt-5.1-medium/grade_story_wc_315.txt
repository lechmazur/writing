<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority through the parachute buckle, instrument handling, and grandmother's training. The protagonist's internal conflict between seeing and pointing, anger without aim, and weighing judgment creates genuine tension. Minor slip: "attentively inventive" eyes feels slightly ornamental rather than earned through action. The final choice to file the report carries visible cost in the protagonist's hesitation and the weight metaphor.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Situational lens holds cleanly: coherent pressure from the intercepted message forces stance crystallization through the protagonist's judgment call. Orientation anchors (arbor, clouds, cities below) establish by the opening paragraph. Closure achieves Charged Poise—the decision to file the report reconfigures the trust/betrayal stakes with felt cost ("stone dropped into an unseen sea"), and the final image of climbing down past lightning scars charges the near-miss with undeniable pressure. One meaningful tightening when the static clears and coordinates unfold.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The nocturnal arbor setting constrains every choice: braided lightning scars as ladders, thin air affecting thought, windless heights where trust lives or dies, swaying branch-seat reminding of fall risk. The parachute buckle (body-object hybrid) recurs with shifting weight and meaning. Micro-setting exceptionally integrated: instruments, sensor threads, and the arbor's physical constraints shape the protagonist's recording tactics. The final descent past lightning scars charges closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve trust under pressure) signaled early and maintained throughout. The intercepted message creates one decisive tightening: coordinates reveal a false promise that will either betray the council or shatter innocent alliances. Protagonist agency drives the turn—weighing rhythms, adjusting sensors, filing the report—with visible cost in the judgment's weight and timing risk. The choice forecloses the path of looking away, scaled appropriately for this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Trust as fragile pattern emerges through concrete particulars: lightning scars, sensor threads, muscle memory, the buckle's weight, grandmother's maxims tested under pressure. The final image offers non-literal answer—unseen revision of stories, trust coming close to falling—without moralizing. Subtext operates in "the watcher never points, only sees" contradicted by "seeing was a kind of pointing." Minor excess: "if something sacred had stepped away" edges toward abstract.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: sky read as narrative ("clouds shifted like thoughts changing their minds"), technical phenomena described through watcher's occupational lens, grandmother's voice internalized without quotation marks blurring POV boundary. Single stable POV with purposeful compression ("the worst of them could burn a city awake in minutes, and faith even faster") that matches urgency. Psychic distance modulates cleanly from instrument-focus to ethical weighing. No head-hopping, filter verbs serve voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High information density with strong propulsion—most lines do multiple jobs (establish world, advance choice, charge imagery). Rhythm varies purposefully, opening with short declaratives then expanding under reflection. Minor template cadence in middle third: three consecutive "I [verb]" constructions during the recording beat create slight monotony. Figurative language mostly purposeful ("stone dropped into an unseen sea," "salt white wounds") though "contrails" carries coordinates feels slightly forced for lyric effect.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: surveillance as sacred trust, arbor-as-station above clouds, watcher lineage through buckle and muscle memory. The transformation test succeeds—plot depends on this exact sky-listening setup and generational burden. Risk in the soundless, unseen stakes (no anthem, only quiet meetings) deepens rather than obscures. Minor derivative note: "keeper of hidden knowledge" archetype is well-executed but not fully transformed; the occupational specificity (sensor threads, braided scars) provides enough fresh detail to elevate.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Present early (title echoes through text), drives two key beats: adjusting sensors to tease out the hidden message, filing the report that unravels the false promise. Decisional agency clear in both moments. Causal pressure: the watcher role constrains options (can only see, not point) yet that seeing becomes pointing through the report. Closure participation: the identity held through final descent charges the ending. Specific cost tied to the role: bearing judgment alone, the weight of unseen revision.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Setup early (grandmother pressed it, engraved spiral map). Development: buckle shifts with breathing during hesitation, functioning as pendulum measuring doubt—one middle beat where physical object externalizes internal conflict. Closure: mentioned in passing but not causally active in final image. Two-beat involvement with one development moment earns mid-band; cost connection weak (buckle present during hesitation but doesn't constrain the choice). Swappable with another keepsake without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Setup immediate (paragraph 5: "my shift, my inheritance, the watcher's burden"). Development: burden shapes multiple tactics—listening for whispers, sifting patterns, weighing timing of report. Peak choice directly tests the burden: "But seeing was a kind of pointing when your reports could shift the balance of trust." Closure: "bearing the watcher's burden as gently as I could" and "never know how close its trust had come to falling" make the concept indispensable to final meaning. Causal pressure high; cost legible.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Present once: grandmother's eyes described as "attentively inventive" when giving the buckle. No on-page action where the trait constrains or enables protagonist behavior. Label-only mention that characterizes grandmother in flashback but doesn't alter present tactics or cost. Ornamental use; could be removed without affecting structure. Late first mention (memory, not setup) and no beat involvement.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setup: "no time to revise, only to recognize and react" frames expectation. Development: multiple beats—adjusting dials, teasing out threads, recording with voice, weighing message rhythms, filing the report. Peak turn: "let the muscles take over, and filed the report that would unravel the false promise." Closure: the revision metaphor charges final image ("unseen revision of its stories"). Irreplaceable: story hinges on correcting/revising false information to preserve trust. Causal pressure maximum; cost clear.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Setup early: "practiced remembering through muscle memory, not conscious thought" and grandmother's teaching. Development: two distinct beats where method matters—"fingers moved before fear could" and "muscles remembered the training better than my thoughts did" during sensor adjustment. Closure participation: "let the muscles take over" precipitates the filing decision. Causal enabler under stress; specificity (body knowledge vs. conscious thought) shapes how protagonist navigates high-pressure choice. Cost indirect but present in surrender of rational control.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setup immediate and detailed: braided lightning scars, branches humming with storms, thin air, swaying seat. Development: arbor constrains every action—sensor threads through leaves, branch crotch as unstable perch, lightning scars conducting static. Closure: "branches steadied, as if the sky itself approved" and descent "past the lightning scars" make setting indispensable to final meaning. Micro-setting par excellence: environment supplies resources (sensors, altitude) and pressures (fall risk, isolation) that shape outcome. Three-gate, causal pressure high.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Setup: title frame "after the radio static clears, when messages finally mean things." Development: timeframe structures the listening sequence—old static first, then hitch, then sentence unfolds. Peak moment: "Tonight, there would be no time to revise, only to recognize and react" sharpens urgency. Closure: "by dawn" anchors the overnight vigil. One strong beat (static clearing enables the intercept) and closure time marker; tightens decision window but doesn't impose strict countdown pressure. Mid-high band for shaping attempts and framing closure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Setup paragraph 15: "Our charge was simple to recite and brutal to bear, to preserve trust under pressure." Development: multiple beats where motivation is tested—anger with no aim, weighing timing (too late = betrayal, too early = shattered alliances), hesitation before filing. Peak friction: "My judgment, in that hush above humanity, felt like a stone dropped into an unseen sea." Closure: trust preservation achieved through unseen revision. Desire dramatized in conflicted choices with visible cost; want (to see clearly) conflicts with cost (bearing judgment alone).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Setup: "soundless echo under their ribs, as if something sacred had stepped away" establishes tone early. Development: tone modulates through pressure—quiet observation, flare of anger quickly muted, hushed weighing, gentle bearing of burden. Closure charges final image: "No cheer would rise up from the streets, no anthem, only a quiet meeting" and "never know how close" sustain the soundless-echo register. Coherent through turns; modulates with emotional intensity. High specificity (soundlessness = unseen consequences) constrains narrative voice and charges ending effectively.</comment>
