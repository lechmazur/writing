<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's voice is distinct and her contradictory impulses—closure seeker who reopens wounds—operate simultaneously through embodied choices (reaching for bandage, laughing despite pain). The mentor backstory and trauma-study framing feel purposeful, anchoring her present stance. Plants' distinct voices (ivy's damp rustling, rosemary's kitchen memories) show real differentiation. Minor slip: "displaced miracle" as self-diagnosis reads slightly overarticulated for peak interiority, though it's brief enough not to flatten pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as Conceptual Repricing: Mara shifts from asking people to bleed to reading scars themselves ("ask the tissue itself"), with the cost legible in her question "who tends the living hurt"—she forecloses the helper role. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: sensory density and plant voices build to the fern's spore-breath and the meteor-hush realization. Orientation anchors (tower, post-surgery dawn) arrive immediately. One minor elision: the exact mechanics of how coffee rings show scar-visions could be slightly clearer, but the conceptual cost remains undeniable.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The tower setting constrains choice (isolated recovery space) and charges the final image (meteor hush sky). Micro-setting details—stiff blanket, metal tray, frosted hourglass—recur with shifting meaning. Sensory hierarchy reflects Mara's professional lens (scar imagery, incision language). The hourglass's frozen sand and glowing grains provide a tactile, visual anchor that shapes her epiphany. Minor gap: spatial choreography of bed-to-window distance could be tighter when she addresses the ivy.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (learning to read scars vs. reopening wounds) is signaled early and tightens through plant voices challenging her method. Escalation operates through accumulative pressure: ivy's accusation, rosemary's memory-scars, coffee ring visions, culminating in Mara's question about tending living hurt. Agency is renunciation with visible cost—she must give up her closure-seeker identity. The fern's spore-breath and final realization foreclose her prior path. One micro-turn (coffee ring revelation) supports rather than diffuses the main arc.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: ivy as gossiper, rosemary's kitchen scars, coffee-ring craters. The final image—"some closures bloom only when you stop trying to seal them"—reweights the premise without stating a moral, offering a resonant answer to the central question. "Displaced miracle" recurs with shifting meaning (surgery failure → scar-reading gift). Subtext operates in plant voices (ivy's offense, rosemary's pragmatism). No thematic echo in final paragraph; the fern's spore-breath does the work.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature throughout: medical vocabulary (neural mesh, antiseptic), literary compression ("meteor hush," "rain trapped in cloth"), scar-study lens. Plant voices carry differentiated idiom without head-hopping—ivy's damp consonants, rosemary's practical memories. Distance remains stable; POV modesty holds (images in coffee ring are framed as visions she glimpses, not omniscient fact). Rhythm modulates under pressure: short bursts during plant dialogue, longer lyric reflection during closure. Free indirect style is clean when plants "speak."</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Information density is high: most lines advance character, world rules, or pressure. Rhythm varies purposefully (compressed plant dialogue, longer reflective beats). "Closure seeker who opens wounds" and "key, not a lock" work as character-specific metaphors. Minor scaffold appears in paired constructions ("I tell people... But you cannot close...") and one near-loop ("show me" → immediate plant response could tighten). No figurative muddle in peak beats. The hourglass description and coffee-ring mechanics carry visual clarity without purple prose.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis—trauma researcher becomes plant telepath who must read scars rather than interview witnesses—feels specific and earned. "Displaced miracle" transforms the botched-surgery trope into a purposeful gift. Coffee rings as divination medium and plants as truth-tellers avoid cliché through particular details (rosemary's roast memories, ivy's offense). Risk-taking in the accumulative structure and plant-POV interludes heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The mentor's "tunneling" backstory primes Mara's final epiphany. Transformation test passes: swap names/setting and the emotional arc loses its medical-gothic charge.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara as "closure seeker who opens wounds" frames her study, drives her surgery choice, and is challenged on-page by plant voices ("built like a key, not a lock"). Her final question—"who tends the living hurt"—is a decision to stop asking people to bleed, altering her professional identity with visible cost. Present in setup (mentor anecdote, "I came to this tower"), middle (ivy/rosemary confrontations), and closure (fern's spore-breath moment). Causal pressure: her prior method is what the plants condemn, forcing the shift.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Frosted hourglass appears on the metal tray with vivid detail (sand frozen mid-fall, grains lit like dust motes) and "hums without sound" to deliver a key insight ("displaced miracle... knocked sideways"). Present in setup and closure participation (speaks during revelation), but middle development is thin—it sits on the tray without being handled or tested. The static sand encodes the concept but does not constrain a middle choice. Two-gate fulfillment (setup + payoff) with strong specificity lifts it into mid-6s; lack of beat involvement caps it below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Displaced miracle" is seeded early (mentor's breakdown described as one), reappears when the hourglass explains the surgery outcome, and shapes closure—Mara's gift is displaced from neural filtering to residue-reading. It alters her stakes: she cannot close wounds anymore, only read them. The concept constrains her final choice (she must abandon her interview method) and the cost is legible. Present across all three gates with causal pressure. Specificity: the exact displacement (body → residue) matters to the scar-reading mechanism.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plant telepathy is setup in the opening line, drives every middle beat (ivy/rosemary/fern dialogues), and delivers the closure insight via the fern's spore-breath. It constrains choice—she cannot ignore their accusations—and enables tactics (asking the coffee ring, listening to rosemary's tissue memory). Visible cost: she wanted surgery to quiet hallucinations; instead she gained a noisier, confrontational gift. All three gates met with strong causal pressure and irreplaceability (swap for any other telepathy and the scar/plant metaphor breaks).</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Tunnel" appears as verb (mentor "tunneled away into her own damage") and method (Mara learned "to tunnel through other peoples pain with questions that sliced"). It frames her prior approach and the mentor's fate, priming the renunciation. Present in setup and thematically charged at closure when the fern offers an alternative. However, no on-page tunneling action in a middle beat—it's backstory only. Two-gate fulfillment (setup + thematic payoff) with metaphoric weight but no middle dramatization caps it in upper-6s.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Coffee rings are introduced via the bedside chart note, Mara stares at the ring "as if it were a fresh incision," and the ring delivers scar visions (child's wrist, man's chest, her future scalp). The method shapes her epiphany: scars exist in residue, not just bodies. Present in setup (chart instruction), middle (she examines it, images ripple), and closure (hourglass explains the displacement into residue). Mechanics are slightly soft (why coffee specifically?) but the ring's spread and misshapen edge provide tactile detail. Strong closure linkage and beat involvement.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Tower setting anchors isolation (post-surgery recovery) and the meteor-hush dawn charges the final image ("sky brightens in a meteor hush"). Plants (ivy on stone, potted rosemary, fern) are spatially placed and deliver pressure. Setup and closure gates met. Middle development: the tower contains the action but does not shift to constrain a middle choice—it's a stable frame. Micro-setting (bed, tray, window) functions well. Two-gate + lyric reprise (dawn → brightening sky) with thematic weight but limited middle pressure places it in mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"After the anesthesia wore off" opens the story and establishes the immediate post-op window, cueing her groggy state and fresh bandage. Dawn's progression ("barely started leaking" → "sky brightens") provides a gentle clock. Present in setup and closure (dawn arrival). Middle: no time pressure tightens her choices—she reflects at leisure. The timeframe grants verisimilitude (she's bedridden, recent surgery) but does not escalate stakes. Two gates met with minimal causal pressure; the window fits but does not grip.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Mara's desire "to learn to read the stories in scars" is stated early, demonstrated through her mentor study and interview method, and tested on-page when plants challenge her: "stop asking people to bleed... ask the tissue itself." The friction between her stated goal (map healing) and her method (reopening wounds) drives the conflict. Closure redefines the goal: she will read scars in coffee rings and residue, not living testimony. All three gates met with strong friction and visible cost (professional identity shift). Irreplaceable: swap motivation and the scar/tissue metaphor loses anchor.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Meteor hush" is seeded in the opening paragraph ("pause before a meteor appears") and returns at closure ("meteor hush" dawn brightening). Tone is hushed, lyric, and surgical throughout—no loud action, only whispered plant voices and introspective reflection. It modulates: early confusion (anesthesia fog), middle accusation (plant dialogues sharpen), closure stillness (fern's slow exhale, sky brightening). The hush charges the final image. Two-gate lyric reprise with consistent tonal control across beats and purposeful modulation under pressure. Strong coherence but not indispensable—softness in middle distinctness keeps it below 7.5.</comment>
