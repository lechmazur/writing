<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orrin's interior is richly embodied through the compass warming/cooling and languages flickering "like overlapping maps." The backstory fragments (mother, brother, apprentice) arrive as chords on his nerves and drive the final renunciation ("stay"). The peak choice—kneeling and agreeing to map what lay inside—feels earned by prior causality and forecloses the outward search with visible cost. Minor: the apprentice's anger is told rather than shown, and the absorption mechanism remains somewhat abstract, but neither undermines the closure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) at closure. Orrin's kneeling and the phrase "stay" crystallize after density builds through layered languages and remembered voices, reweighting his outward quest with undeniable cost. Orientation anchors (blind mapmaker, platinum compass ring, ultrasonic forest) land cleanly by the first third. One meaningful deepening occurs when the compass turns inward and the notes become sentences; closure reweights the premise with felt cost. The pause of shifting constellations bookends the piece, and the final map "no wall could hold" charges the ending image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The ultrasonic forest operates as micro-setting: its vibrations guide Orrin through undergrowth, the sound thins at the root-tangled hollow, and the silence presses like "cool hands" at closure. The compass ring functions as a charged object, warming and cooling to dowse inward ache. Body-as-setting: Orrin's skin absorbs languages, constraining perception and shaping the final phrase. Sensory hierarchy reflects his blindness (bone-deep sound, touch-driven grammar). The clearing's silence and soil-touch at closure anchor the renunciation with tactile specificity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—mapping uncharted emotional depths—is signaled early and tightens when the compass "did not point outward but inward." The trail of notes becomes sentences in voices he knew, escalating pressure by converting abstract search into embodied memory. The clearing's silence and the phrase "stay" narrow options: Orrin must map internal terrain before seeking further shore. Agency is renunciation (kneeling, agreeing to stay) with visible cost: abandoning the outward quest. One meaningful deepening under the Accumulative lens suffices here; the cost is legible on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—navigating guilt, forgiveness, and the possibility of being met—emerges from particulars: voices as chords, the compass pointing inward, the phrase "stay" burning through avoided rooms. The final image (a map no wall could hold) offers a resonant, non-literal answer without stated moral. The ultrasonic forest and platinum ring constrain and charge without symbolic overreach. The piece resists tidy resolution; Orrin's agreement to map what lay inside reweights longing and loss with undeniable pressure. No thematic echo or moralizing mars the ending.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable; perceptual signature is character-specific (ultrasonic hum, languages absorbed through skin, compass dowsing ache). Diction ("sap-slow grammar," "staccato arguments of insects") is controlled and purposeful. Reflection interleaves with present stimuli: voices arrive as chords triggered by notes, and each voice alters Orrin's stance toward the phrase "stay." No head-hopping; psychic distance modulates intentionally (closer at the clearing). Syntax and rhythm reflect Orrin's blind, tactile attention without filter-verb stacks or register drift. The final line's compression ("a new map that no wall could hold") charges closure without opacity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Information density is high: most lines advance character, pressure, or atmosphere. Sentence rhythm varies (short declaratives, longer accumulative phrases) without template cadence. Minor scaffold: "He believed that when the heavens stopped, the world below whispered its clearest directions" is slightly generic; "the phrase said only this: stay" borders on tell but serves closure. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn. Figurative language ("quiet blaze," "overlapping maps") is coherent and anchored. Proofreading clean; grammar stable. Peak beats (clearing, kneeling) maintain clarity and propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis—blind mapmaker dowsing emotional terrain in an ultrasonic forest during a celestial pause—is specific and non-obvious. The compass ring that points inward rather than outward transforms the dowsing trope with earned causality. Risk-taking: layered sensory modes (ultrasonic hum, skin-absorbed languages, notes as sentences) heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. The final image (a map no wall could hold) feels inevitable in hindsight. Minor: the "pause of shifting constellations" frame is slightly allegorical, but the emotional specificity (mother, brother, apprentice as chords) grounds universals in particulars.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orrin's choices drive key turns: stepping into the forest, following the compass and notes, kneeling to agree to "stay." His blindness and absorption ability shape perception and tactics throughout. Present in setup, middle (following vibrations, interpreting notes as voices), and closure (kneeling, agreeing). Causal pressure: his decision to map internal terrain before seeking further shore forecloses the outward quest with visible cost. High irreplaceability; removing the blind mapmaker breaks the sensory logic and the inward-compass turn.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The platinum compass ring appears in setup (slipped onto thumb), middle (warming/cooling, turning toward notes), and closure (grows heavier as voices arrive; points inward). Handled in at least three distinct beats. Reweighted meaning: initially a dowsing tool for outward search, it becomes a gauge of inward ache. Causal pressure: its turning guides Orrin through the forest and aligns to "whatever ache he refused to name." Cost connection: its weight embodies the emotional burden. Removing it would break the dowsing mechanism and the inward turn.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The hidden stillpoint shapes stakes: Orrin seeks it, the forest languages gather around its "hollow in meaning," and the ring pulses toward it. Present in setup (wait for the pause), middle (hollow that the ring pulses toward), and closure (the clearing where the melody resolves and Orrin kneels). It structures the search and defines the endpoint, though the stillpoint itself remains somewhat abstract. Causal role: the stillpoint is the destination that crystallizes the inward turn. Mid-band for moderate specificity; stronger closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Absorbing languages through skin constrains perception and enables tactics: Orrin drinks the forest through bark, mist, moss, and by nightfall the tongues flicker in him. Present in setup (label and explanation), middle (absorption of languages that gather around the hollow), and closure (languages braided into "stay"). Causal pressure: the absorbed languages become the voices that force the inward turn. Cost connection: enduring the absorption is described as an "oddness he had never been able to explain, only to endure." Visible tradeoff: the languages accumulate and pressure him. High integration; specificity and irreplaceability strong.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dowsing drives the search: the compass ring dowses for what Orrin truly sought, warms/cools, turns toward notes, and ultimately points inward. Present in setup (ring "said to dowse"), middle (dowsing guides him through the forest), and closure (ring as inward compass). Major turns trace to this action: the forest dowses him along the trail, and the ring's inward dowsing forces the renunciation. Causal pressure and closure linkage strong. Swapping "dowse" for "search" would lose the specific compass-ring mechanic and the inward-pointing turn. High irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The trail of musical notes is signaled early (notes tap against the air), shapes middle beats (each step strikes a pitch, notes unfurl, trail thickens into current), and resolves at closure (melody resolves into the phrase "stay"). Mechanics matter: the notes are ultrasonic, hesitant, then convert into sentences in known voices. Causal pressure: the trail leads Orrin to the clearing and the phrase. Cost connection: each note slips into his skin as a voice, accumulating emotional weight. Removing the trail would break the forest's dowsing mechanism and the lyric structure. High integration across all three gates.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The ultrasonic forest pressures choices throughout: its vibrations guide Orrin, the sound thins at the hollow, the silence at the clearing presses like "cool hands." Present in setup (description and entry), middle (hum guides him, forest dowses him), and closure (silence and soil-touch anchor the renunciation). The forest is not postcard; it is a micro-setting whose acoustic properties constrain tactics and charge the final image. Causal pressure and irreplaceability high; removing the ultrasonic forest would break the sensory logic and the dowsing trail. Excellent integration.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The pause of shifting constellations frames the piece (opening, "when the stars stilled," and closure "days later, the constellations shuddered and resumed"). It establishes the occasion and signals when the world "whispered its clearest directions." Present in setup and closure; moderate development (the pause is the window for the search). The timeframe does not tighten decisions beat-by-beat, but it brackets the journey and reinforces the stillpoint theme. Lyric reprise reweights the opening frame. Mid-band for framing function without live clock pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Navigating uncharted emotional depths is Orrin's stated goal, dramatized through his refusal of "ordinary maps," his seeking the stillpoint, and his absorption of voices as chords. Present in setup (declaration), middle (voices as navigation), and closure (agreeing to map what lay inside). Friction: the compass points inward, voices bring pain, and the phrase "stay" demands renunciation of the outward quest. Cost: forfeiting the search for external shore. Causal pressure and closure linkage strong. The motivation shapes every beat and drives the final choice.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Quiet blaze is coherent through turns: "quiet blaze" appears twice (compass description and the phrase burning through), and the tone balances restraint with intensity (hushed forest, voices as chords, silence pressing like cool hands). Modulates with pressure: the forest hum intensifies, then silence; the voices layer without shouting. The final image (map no wall could hold) charges with the same contained fire. Tone is consistent and purposeful, supporting the inward turn without flatlining or melodrama. High integration; the tone is indispensable to the ending's effect.</comment>
