<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's interior voice is concrete and character-particular, rooted in professional observation translated into personal stakes. The decision to go inland emerges through embodied hesitation (touching the pool, watching reflections shudder) rather than neat epiphany. The contradiction between wanting the sea's rhythm and needing Lysa is enacted rather than explained. Internal conflict operates simultaneously through gesture and perception, though the final choice arrives more as seepage than dramatic cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece coheres through density increase and cadence shift rather than causal turns; the pause deepens and reweights the stake. Orientation anchors early (grotto, tide, Lysa opposite). Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration via Charged Poise: the narrator's realization that "to foresee was not to predict the single future, but to notice how many futures brushed against this moment" reconfigures the dominant stake (choosing inland versus coast) and the decision "seeped in like groundwater" forecloses passivity with felt cost. The cost is legible in the renunciation of waiting for certainty and the commitment to seasonal return.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The grotto functions as micro-setting that constrains choice: the tidal pool's reflection becomes the instrument of foresight, star-silver on jade charges the cicada, and the stone ledge stages the physical distance between narrator and Lysa. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (salt-swollen notebook, waves whispering, star-dimpled water). The body and pool anchor the final turn when the narrator touches the reflection and it shudders, making temporal layers visible. The setting charges the closure image through the interplay of tide, stone, and reflection.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (whether to leave the coast) is signaled early and remains coherent. One meaningful deepening occurs when the narrator realizes pauses are tides themselves, shifting from waiting for answers to recognizing overlapping possibilities. Agency manifests as endurance that transforms into decision; the narrator's touching the pool and seeing multiple futures forecloses the option of waiting indefinitely. Cost is felt in the renunciation of certainty and the compromise of seasonal return. No explicit antagonist, but Lysa's presence and the cicada apply steady pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme (transition as revelation, foresight as noticing futures rather than predicting one) emerges organically from the tidal-pool metaphor, the molt imagery, and the cicada poised between husk and flight. The ending offers a resonant answer—"Let us go inland together, and return each summer"—that refuses binary resolution and reweights the premise without stating a moral. Subtext operates through the jade cicada's patience, the gap between wanting sea-measure and needing Lysa, and the narrator's tangential approach to choice. No thematic echo or diagnosis at closure; insight is earned through concrete perception.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature: the narrator filters everything through tidal metaphors and observational precision. Diction remains character-consistent (chronicler's idiom: "fleeting configuration," "transition periods," "texture of time"). Lysa's single line of dialogue arrives naturally and goal-driven. Psychic distance modulates purposefully when reflection deepens at the pool. No head-hopping, filter verbs are voice-motivated, and the compression during the foresight moment ("Each vision glimmered like a tide mark") fits the narrator's professional lens without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines advance perception or metaphor. Sentence rhythm varies and accelerates during the pool-touch moment. Minor scaffold appears in adjacent reflective beats ("I had come to the grotto hoping..." / "But the pause only deepened...") that restate waiting without added pressure (−0.2). Some figurative density in mid-passage ("time here was not a river but a shore, each moment a different kind of sand") borders overwriting but remains legible and voice-motivated. No loops touch closure; the final line is direct and imagistic.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of tidal observation, jade cicada symbolism, and tangential foresight feels specific and non-obvious. The transformation of "foresee" from prediction to noticing overlapping futures is a fresh inflection earned by the narrator's vocation. The ending's seasonal compromise avoids binary resolution and grows from prior particulars (molt imagery, tide cycles, cicada's underground patience). Risk: the extended metaphorical register and reflective mode could alienate, but voice coherence and closure legibility prevent gimmickry.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Present early as vocational identity and lens. Shapes two beats: observing the tidal pool as professional habit, then using that lens to understand choice ("people were just another sort of tidal pool"). The final decision emerges from chronicler's skill—noticing how futures brush the present—but observation slightly outweighs active decision-making. Integration is functional across setup, middle reflection, and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Jade cicada appears early on the stone between them. Handled twice: Lysa taps its back mid-pause, narrator reflects on its carved eyes and molt metaphor. Returns with reweighted meaning at the ending beat ("seemed to listen with us, pinned between husk and flight") to charge the narrator's realization about waiting. Closure linkage is strong; the cicada's molt imagery seeds the decision to transform rather than harden.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Transition periods structure the entire piece: the pause in conversation is explicitly framed as a tide itself, the grotto moment is between tides, and the narrator's vocation centers on "what lived between certainties." The concept shapes tactics (narrator watches the pool for revelation during the pause) and redefines options (realizing every hesitation is a transition). Appears in setup, middle deepening, and closure; the final decision is to honor transitions by returning seasonally.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Warmly observant" frames the narrator's stance early ("warmly observant of every fleeting configuration"). Enables the narrator's patient attention to the cicada and pool but does not constrain a choice with visible cost. The trait supports voice and lens but remains label-adjacent; no moment where warmth versus detachment alters tactics. Functional but replaceable with "attentive" or "curious" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Foresight (noun) drives the middle turn: the narrator explicitly tries "to foresee our life inland" and realizes foresight requires tangential approach. The pool-touch beat enacts foresight as seeing multiple futures simultaneously. The realization that "to foresee was not to predict the single future" directly enables the final decision. Present in middle development and closure; causal pressure is strong. Could be reframed as "imagine" with edits, but the specific mechanics (noticing overlapping possibilities) feel integral.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Through tangential approach" is signaled mid-story ("I could only approach it tangentially, through side glances") and shapes the narrator's method of understanding choice. The mechanics matter: the narrator refuses direct prediction and instead notices futures at the edge of vision. Appears in middle reflection and implicitly at closure when the decision "seeped in" rather than arrived frontally. Functional integration but slightly abstract; the method is told more than enacted in distinct beats.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Ancient grotto under stars anchors who/where/when early. The setting provides resources: tidal pool as foresight tool, stone ledge for spatial distance, stars for light and metaphor. Micro-setting (the pool itself) constrains the narrator's method and charges the closure image when reflections shudder. The grotto's liminality (cliff mouth, between tides) mirrors the transition theme. Strong closure participation; the setting's properties enable the final realization.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Timeframe ("across the pause in a difficult conversation") is announced early and tracked throughout. The pause deepens and stretches; its duration becomes the subject of reflection ("the pause only deepened"). Time pressure is ambient but real—the conversation cannot remain paused indefinitely. The narrator's realization that pauses are tides reweights the timeframe itself, and the ending resolves the pause with a decision. The frame tightens options and charges the closure; live clock without mechanical urgency.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"To discover the texture of time" appears as explicit desire mid-story ("I wanted, more than I could tell her, to discover the texture of time in that silence"). Dramatized through the narrator's attention to how time "snagged on memories and futures, thick here, thin there." Friction between wanting discovery and needing to decide is present but understated. The motivation seeds the foresight attempt but does not face a sharp cost on the page. Functional across setup and middle; closure participation is oblique.</comment>
