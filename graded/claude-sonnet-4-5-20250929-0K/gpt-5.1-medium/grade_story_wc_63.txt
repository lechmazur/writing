<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's interiority is strongly embodied—thumb on grooves, fever-press of time—and the guilt/duty contradiction drives the arc. The shift from "incremental absolution" as penance to "stewardship" is earned through the pendulum pause and the memory sequence. Minor slip: the final covenant feels slightly over-articulated for peak emotional pressure, edging toward label-speak, but the embodied cost (teaching apprentices, sharing the rake handle) grounds it.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a clear Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis/Charged Poise hybrid): the narrator commits to shared teaching rather than solitary penance, foreclosing the old path with visible cost. The pendulum's arrested swing teaches the lyric lens early and holds through the ending. Orientation anchors arrive promptly (tower, harbor, obsidian ridge). One micro-tension: the "kneeling of time" frame risks slight abstraction, but the concrete image of the hanging brass bob and the narrator's tactile memory keep causality legible under an Accumulative/Textural lens with lyric elements.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The obsidian ridge, pendulum bob, and broken rake handle all constrain choices and charge the closure image. Sensory detail is vivid and filtered through the narrator's professional/grief lens: "breathing weight of the sea," "fevered hands" of time. The tidal setting directly informs backstory causality (brother's death) and primes the final choice to teach others. Spatial choreography remains clear across the iron spine and harbor view.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—absolution through perfect timekeeping versus genuine stewardship—tightens meaningfully during the pendulum pause. The narrator's agency is clear: the decision to invite apprentices and share the rake handle forecloses solitary penance with visible cost. The "scorching" insight and the pendulum's resumed arc deliver escalation and a felt price. No convenience plotting; the brother's death anchors all pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges cleanly from particulars: incremental absolution, the pendulum's pause, the rake-handle inscriptions. The final image—apprentices holding the broken handle—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the guilt/duty question without moralizing. The shift from "polishing minutes" to "stewardship" reweights prior material with conceptual cost. One subtle strength: the story resists explaining the epiphany, trusting the brass bob and tidal imagery to carry meaning.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>POV remains stable; perceptual signature is strong (professional precision, tidal metaphors, tactile focus on grooves and gears). Diction fits the narrator's voice throughout—elevated but not academic, grief-laden without therapy-speak. Minor slip: "incremental absolution" and "shared balance" edge toward prompt-echo phrasing, but they're threaded through enough concrete action (winding, tide-charts, teaching) to avoid pure abstraction. Psychic distance modulates purposefully during the pause.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Line-level craft is strong: rhythm varies, figurative language is coherent (clock-spring snap, frost on windowpanes), and information density is high. Two deductions: (1) "incremental absolution" and "shared balance" recur as near-paraphrase across multiple beats without significant reweighting until the end (−0.3 for mild loop). (2) A few filter-verb stacks in reflective passages ("I had come to believe," "I realized") slightly dull immediacy in high-pressure beats (−0.2). Closure beat remains sharp.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The clock-tower/guilt synthesis is compelling, and the pendulum-pause frame offers a fresh lyric angle. The broken rake handle is a specific, non-obvious talisman. Risk: the piece leans on a familiar grief-and-penance template, but transforms it through the shared-teaching resolution and the tidal/mechanical imagery. Not groundbreaking, but the execution elevates the material above stock.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Present early, drives the nightly ritual, memory sequence, and final teaching covenant. The winder's precision ethic shapes every beat and the closure hinges on their decision to share responsibility.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Signaled early, returns in the pause beat with reweighted meaning (arrested mid-arc), and the narrator makes a covenant with it at closure. Its brass materiality and mechanical role pressure the absolution logic throughout.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Concept is named and dramatized: the narrator's obsessive winding embodies it, the insight ("polishing minutes") critiques it, and the teaching decision redefines it. Present across setup, middle reflection, and closure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Trait is stated early and shown in the narrator's obsessive calibration and nightly ritual. It constrains the old path (solitary penance) and enables the new one (teaching). Visible cost at closure when the trait shifts from private duty to public stewardship.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Emerge" is the action of the past surfacing during the pendulum pause. It triggers the memory sequence and the realization, shaping the middle turn. Present and functional, but somewhat abstract; a more embodied verb might have scored higher.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The broken rake handle appears early (relic kept, inscriptions studied nightly), is used as a mnemonic anchor in the middle, and returns at closure when the narrator vows to place it in apprentices' palms. Its mechanics—reading grooves as forgiveness—matter across three beats.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Tidal obsidian ridge anchors the setting, supplies the brother's death (causality), and returns in the closure paragraph as "broken mirrors" that echo the narrator's fractured guilt. It constrains backstory logic and charges the final image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The pendulum's pause is signaled early, structures the entire middle reflection, and its resumption marks the closure beat. Time literally kneels, shaping the narrator's insight and decision. Indispensable to the story's lyric logic.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Motivation is stated and dramatized: the narrator winds to "restore shared balance," realizes the phrase has been self-serving, and redefines it as public stewardship at closure. Friction between solitary absolution and genuine teaching is clear and costly.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Tone is lyric, meditative, and quietly intense throughout—"fevered hands," "scorched," "hinged air." It modulates under pressure (the pause deepens reflection; the resumption tightens into resolve) and charges the final image. Coherent and purposeful across all beats.</comment>
