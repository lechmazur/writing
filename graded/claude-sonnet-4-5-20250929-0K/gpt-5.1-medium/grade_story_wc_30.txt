<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The titan-gear librarian exhibits a distinct perceptual signature—brass-boned, hinge-hearted, filtering the world through archival metaphors—and faces a clear internal conflict between catalog and reverie. The fisherman's fragmented selves create embodied interiority ("brave and fearful, patient and impulsive") that the protagonist must hold simultaneously. The smelting process shows contradictory impulses acting in scene, and the final exchange (reflection-borrowing) demonstrates earned cost. Minor deduction: the fisherman's motivation remains somewhat abstract; his panic is told more than shown in micro-choices under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the fisherman squares his shoulders with "newly whole" weight, meets repetition with curiosity, and the final reflection-swap crystallizes the migrating-identity premise with visible cost (both characters exchange traits). Orientation anchors clearly by the second paragraph (who, where, the disappeared-tomorrow premise). One meaningful deepening occurs when the protagonist opens the creel and must choose how to re-forge the fragments, narrowing from observation to active smelting. The "by accepting contradictions" method shapes the resolution. Cost is legible: the librarian's furnace gears intensify, the fisherman gains coherence by surrendering singular identity, and both wear each other's features in the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The tidal atrium functions as micro-setting that constrains choice: water level dictates which shelves are accessible, the glass bones amplify the moon-phase fluctuation, and the submerged step becomes the stage for the smelting conversation. Sensory hierarchy reflects the librarian's archival priorities (marble, salt, moonlight thickening when the moon is missing). The creel—woven reeds darkened by currents, wet with salt and moonlight—is handled across multiple beats and its emptying/lightening charges the closure. The setting's physical logic (flooded arches, rising tide) remains consistent and the final image uses high water as a mirror for the identity exchange.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early: preserve wonder in routine amid identity migration and the disappeared tomorrow. The inciting choice occurs when the librarian opens the creel and discovers unbound selves; the escalation tightens when the fisherman returns asking "Have you seen my day?" forcing a reweaving decision rather than simple return. The smelting intensifies pressure ("gears turning with slow, tectonic assurance") and the resolution is earned by the protagonist's acceptance of contradictions, which reweights the fisherman's relationship to repetition. Visible cost: the librarian must hold molten, unresolved desires in their chest furnace, and both characters trade fragments of self. One minor gap: the fisherman's agency in the final beat is more receptive than decisive, slightly diffusing protagonist-driven closure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the tidal atrium's paradox: cataloging the uncatalogable, preserving wonder within cyclical routine, and holding contradictory selves without resolution. The creel and its contents (selves "the size of a breath") operate as non-literal image rather than symbol. The final reflection-swap offers a resonant answer to the central question—identities migrate, routine continues, but curiosity and shared fragments make repetition bearable—without stating a moral. The "wintersun serenity" tone charges the ending: pale warmth leaning closer to watch the experiment, waves striking glass bones with "softer rhythm," content to circle without knowing where tomorrow lies. No thematic echo or label-speak in the final passage; complexity persists (yesterdays continue, but the gaze meets them differently).</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Single-POV focalizer maintained throughout with a mechanical-lyric register ("titan-gear," "hinge-hearted," "furnace gears") that remains voice-consistent under pressure. Psychic distance is stable; the librarian's perceptual signature filters everything through archival and metallurgical metaphors. The fisherman's dialogue ("Have you seen my day? I woke up, and it was yesterday again") carries subtext (panic beneath calm) and advances plot by externalizing the identity-migration stakes. Brief convergence at closure (borrowing each other's features) reads intentional and thematically motivated rather than accidental voice bleed. Minor constraint: the elevated diction ("tectonic assurance," "oscillating between catalog and reverie") borders on over-writing in a few mid-passage beats, though it remains legible and voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines do double duty (e.g., "moonlight thickens; it always does when the moon is missing" establishes world logic and tone simultaneously). Rhythm modulates well from lyric description to the fisherman's arrival to the smelting climax. Template-cadence check: several paragraph openings use similar declarative structures ("I know what I must do," "I recognize the panic," "I invite him to sit") across the middle third, creating mild formulaic drag (−0.4). No paraphrase loops or filter-verb stacks. The figurative language is dense ("metal of them glows," "startled minnows") but mostly coherent; one mixed metaphor: "metal of them glows evenly within my chest's furnace gears" slightly conflates molten state with mechanical operation, though context clarifies intent. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and recharge motifs effectively.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The core synthesis—librarian as alchemist of migrating identities in a tidal archive after tomorrow vanishes—is specific and non-obvious. The piece transforms the "lost identity" trope by spatializing it (identities as tidal flotsam) and embedding the resolution method in the premise (smelting contradictions rather than choosing one truth). The fisherman's creel and its contents, the moon-phase fluctuation mechanic, and the reflection-borrowing closure feel inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in the elevated lyric register and the quiet, image-driven ending heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Minor proximity concern: "preserve wonder in routine" and the general archive-librarian frame echo common craft-essay idiom, though the execution personalizes it through the titan-gear body and the specific smelting action.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Titan-gear librarian present throughout as focalizer and agent. Drives two key choices: opening the creel (inciting incident) and the smelting/reweaving decision (climax). The librarian's mechanical nature (furnace gears, brass bones) enables the smelting method and constrains perception (everything filtered through archival metaphors). Final image includes the reflection-swap, which recharges the librarian's hybrid identity. Early signal, beat involvement across inciting and climax, causal pressure (the smelting choice alters the fisherman's outcome), and closure linkage all present. Slight deduction: much of the middle passage is observational interiority rather than active decision-making until the smelting intensifies.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Bamboo creel introduced early (lowest stair, left behind). Handled in at least three beats: discovery, the invitation to sit with it between them, the fisherman peeking inside, and the return ("lighter, almost empty"). Its state change (wet → lighter/empty) tracks causally and alters the fisherman's outcome. The creel's woven reeds and salt-moonlight detail make it irreplaceable; a generic container would not carry the same tidal-atrium resonance. Participates in closure: handing it back lighter signals the smelting's success. Strong setup, development (container for unbound selves), and payoff (return with reweighted meaning and visible cost).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Migrating identities present from early exposition ("identities have gone wandering, migrating from face to face") and operationalized when the unbound selves appear in the creel. Shapes two major stakes: the librarian's archival dilemma and the fisherman's fragmented coherence. The concept constrains tactics (cannot simply return the selves; must smelt them) and enables the smelting method. Final image literalizes the premise: the librarian and fisherman exchange reflection-features, demonstrating that identity migration continues but can be inhabitable. Setup, development (discovery of loose selves, fisherman's triple gaze), and payoff (reflection-swap) all present with high specificity and causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Moon-phase fluctuation mentioned three times: initial exposition ("Who you are fluctuates with moon phases now"), the librarian's own thoughts oscillating on moonless nights, and "moonlight thickens...when the moon is missing." The attribute constrains the librarian's cognitive state ("even my thoughts fluctuate") and informs the fisherman's warning to stay away on such nights. However, the moon phase does not directly enable or prevent an on-page action with visible cost; it flavors the world logic and the librarian's interiority but remains somewhat atmospheric. Present in setup and development, mild closure linkage (the ending occurs during thickened moonlight), but the causal pressure is softer than other elements.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Smelting introduced at the climax choice ("To archive them, I must smelt their scattered fragments") and executed across several beats: holding contradictions, letting desires stand molten, the furnace gears intensifying, inviting all truths into a single heat. The action is irreplaceable; cataloging, sorting, or other archival methods would not resolve the contradiction-holding dilemma. The smelting redefines the fisherman's options (from dissolution to coherence) and shapes the closure (he carries "something newly whole"). Setup occurs at the decision point rather than early in the text, so mild late-signal penalty, but strong development and payoff with high causal pressure and cost connection (the librarian's chest furnace works under load).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Method ("by accepting contradictions") signaled at the climax ("I must smelt their scattered fragments...by accepting contradictions") and demonstrated immediately: "a mother afraid of the sea wants to live beside it; there, a sailor yearns for a house that never floods. I let both desires stand, molten and unresolved." The method shapes the entire resolution—refusing to choose one version, holding mismatched truths side by side—and appears again in the closure reflection: "content, for now, to circle here" without resolution. The mechanics matter on the page: the contradictions must be held in heat until they fuse without losing their tension. Setup at decision point, strong development and payoff, high irreplaceability and cost (requires the librarian's furnace capacity).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Tidal atrium anchors who/where early (second paragraph). It provides the physical constraint that enables the story: the ocean stores memories here, the tide rises to middle shelves (tracking the moon's absence), the flooded doorway and submerged step become the stage for the encounter. The glass bones and marble stacks create the acoustics for the smelting scene. The setting's micro-details (water lapping at knees, high water as mirror) charge the final image (reflection-swap). The atrium is indispensable; no other setting would support the tidal-memory-migration synthesis. Early signal, beat involvement throughout, causal pressure (water level dictates accessibility), and strong closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Timeframe ("after tomorrow disappears") introduced in opening line and elaborated ("Days stopped advancing two cycles ago"). It creates the conditions for identity migration and the fisherman's complaint ("I woke up, and it was yesterday again"). The disappeared tomorrow frames the entire narrative and the librarian's preservation-of-wonder motivation. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions moment-to-moment; the story does not track a live countdown or escalating temporal pressure within the scene. It functions more as premise and atmosphere than as a constraint that alters tactics beat by beat. Setup strong, thematic development throughout, mild closure linkage (ending gestures to ongoing yesterdays), but weaker on within-scene causal pressure compared to other elements.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Motivation ("to preserve wonder in routine") stated early ("I tend the atrium to preserve wonder in routine, to keep the daily reshelving from becoming a clockwork trance") and dramatized in the climax choice: rather than mechanically returning the selves, the librarian invents a reweaving method. The motivation is tested when the fisherman asks for his day back—returning them would be routine; smelting them preserves wonder. The final image shows the method succeeding: the fisherman's gaze "meets each repetition with curiosity." Friction between want (preserve wonder) and cost (must hold contradictions in the furnace, must accept ongoing identity migration) is visible. Early signal, drives the central choice, and charges the closure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Tone ("wintersun serenity") established early ("Wintersun serenity hangs through the flooded arches, a pale warmth stretched thin but steady") and maintained throughout: the prose rhythm is measured, the images are luminous and calm despite the existential premise. Tone modulates slightly under pressure—"The smelting inside me intensifies, gears turning with a slow, tectonic assurance"—without breaking into panic or melodrama. The final passage recharges the tone: "winter-pale but resolute," "softer rhythm," "content, for now, to circle here." The serenity does not flatten the stakes; it creates a contemplative frame that makes the identity crisis bearable and charges the ending with quiet inevitability. Coherent through turns, strong closure participation.</comment>
