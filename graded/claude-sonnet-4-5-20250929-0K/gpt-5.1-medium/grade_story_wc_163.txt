<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's interiority is concrete and embodied ("a knot of smoke that had lived there since the village burned"), with motivation evolving through on-page micro-choices (dimming the lights, redesigning cycles). Internal contradiction appears in the tension between the sky-reader's expertise and underwater uselessness, driving genuine struggle. The final shift—from seeking fixed belonging to recognizing it as "the interval between breaths shared in noticing"—is earned through prior causality, though the epiphany skirts close to label-speak at the threshold.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page as Resonant Reconfiguration (conceptual repricing of "belonging") with visible cost: the protagonist abandons their identity as star-reader to become a listener. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout: density increases through layered images (feather, lights, shrimp), pattern breaks when the protagonist stops diagnosing and starts co-creating, and the final cadence shift ("breathing rhythm, teaching me how to belong by listening") reweights the dominant stake. Orientation anchors clearly by line 7 (Mira at airlock, facility context). One meaningful deepening occurs when voluntary movement toward half-lit zones reveals the core insight.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The underwater facility constrains choice materially: protocol override, dome glass as canvas, bioluminescent shrimp visibility. The body becomes micro-setting ("our shoulders almost touching," condensation-fogged glass traced with feather), and the burnt feather functions as tool that alters tactics in the climax. Sensory hierarchy is POV-filtered (sky-reader notices constellations, light patterns, celestial analogies). The drowned city charges the final image when its "gentle pulses" embody the redesigned rhythm, making environment indispensable to closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—learning the rhythm of belonging—is signaled early and tightens when the protagonist realizes "my charts curled damply in my bag, useless." One meaningful deepening occurs at the observation theater when dimming lights reveals the architecture of attention, narrowing options from diagnosis to co-creation. Agency is renunciation with visible cost: the feather becomes pointer instead of relic, surface identity yields to underwater collaboration. The price (foreclosing sky-reader certainty) is legible in "a knot of smoke that had lived there" loosening, though the escalation is gentle rather than urgent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: light as harbor, belonging as interval, the feather's shift from symbol of leaving to instrument of shared work. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without stating a moral—"breathing rhythm, teaching me how to belong by listening" reweights the opening's "quiet ache" through image and earned insight. The bioluminescent shrimp function as true motif, constraining the redesign choice and charging closure. Subtext operates in Mira's "crooked curiosity that felt like a door unsticking" and the shared silence; no overt thematic declarations until the final beat, which skirts but does not cross into sermonizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with distinct perceptual signature: the protagonist filters everything through celestial metaphor ("towers like reefs made from forgotten errands," researchers "orbiting kiosks that glowed like wayward moons"). Dialogue carries subtext and advances plot (Mira's "Down here we have ceilings, not heavens" establishes stakes). Psychic distance modulates purposefully, tightening under pressure. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register inconsistent with a grieving refugee ("licking back the gloom in brief, luminous respite"), and the final phrase "shadowseam wonder" feels imported rather than earned through the narrator's idiom.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs (setting, interiority, thematic charge). Rhythm varies purposefully, accelerating through the light experiment and breathing in the bioluminescent shrimp moment. However, figurative language clusters densely in non-peak beats without pattern-teaching ("drowned avenues," "skeletal railings," "algae-furred statues" in quick succession), and several phrases loop conceptually: "coastline that kept rearranging itself" echoes "rhythm of belonging" without added pressure. The burnt feather description contains slight redundancy ("the last relic of my surface life" restates what "leaving" already conveys). No filter-verb stacks or template cadence, but density in early paragraphs flirts with overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The premise—landscape astrologer underwater—offers a fresh, non-obvious synthesis that inverts expertise into vulnerability. The transformation test passes: plot and emotional arc depend on this exact mismatch (sky-reader learning from ceilings). The lighting-as-tides insight and bioluminescent shrimp as wild constellation are specific, non-generic inflections that grow from established particulars. Risk-taking in the accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. However, the "learning to belong" arc is a widely used template; transformation comes through specificity (feather, facility, Mira's economy of gesture) rather than a non-obvious moral calculus, keeping the piece in the strong but not exceptional band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The landscape astrologer appears in paragraph 1, drives the middle choice (dimming lights against protocol), and shapes the ending by redesigning lighting cycles and tracing patterns with the feather. Two distinct beats: observation theater experiment and overnight redesign work. Causal pressure is moderate—the role inverts from diagnosis to co-creation, enabling the collaboration with Mira that narrows options from surface identity to underwater listening. Specificity is strong (charts as "useless as old horoscopes," feather as pointer). Cost is conceptual: forfeiting expertise for apprenticeship. Setup, development, and payoff gates are met.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The burnt feather appears in paragraph 16 (late, ~40% mark), is handled in paragraph 35 (tracing patterns on glass), and returns with reweighted meaning: from "smelled of leaving" to instrument of shared design. Two beats: initial possession and climactic use. Causal work is modest—it enables the glass-tracing that Mira translates into switch sequences, but any pointer would serve that function; specificity lies in its symbolic shift from relic to tool. Closure linkage is indirect: mentioned in the redesign sentence but not in the final image. Gates: setup late (−0.4), development present, payoff present but not charged. Lyric reprise (seed → return) reweights meaning, qualifying for mid-band despite swappability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Luminous respite" appears once in paragraph 23 as a descriptive phrase for researchers' pale suits. It does not shape stakes or constrain choices on the page; the underlying concept (light as refuge) drives the plot, but the exact two-word phrase is ornamental. The thematic idea of light offering harbor is functional, but the required phrase itself is decorative. Gates: setup absent, development absent (concept yes, phrase no), payoff absent. Ornamental use (−0.8), swappable (−0.6).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Softly ingenious" describes Mira in paragraph 8. The trait manifests once on-page: her "crooked curiosity" leads her to key in the override against protocol, enabling the core experiment. One beat involvement. Causal pressure is present but modest—the trait enables rather than constrains, and Mira's decision could plausibly stem from other traits (curiosity, trust). Cost is indirect: protocol violation risks her position, though this is not dramatized. Gates: setup early (+0.6), development present (one beat +0.4), payoff absent (Mira does not appear in the ending image). Label-plus-demonstration rather than label-only, but single-beat limits reach.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Captivate" appears in paragraph 24 and drives the core turn: the observation that volunteers and fish drift toward half-lit zones, revealing "the architecture of attention trying to find balance." This insight narrows options from repair to redesign and redefines the protagonist's approach from diagnosis to collaboration. Two beats: the observation moment and the resulting overnight redesign work. Causal pressure is strong—without this realization, the ending's "tides of invitation" would lack foundation. Closure linkage is direct: the final breathing rhythm enacts what captivation revealed. Gates: setup mid-story (−0.3), development strong (+0.9), payoff strong (+1.2). Specificity high: the action's mechanics (drifting toward light) matter and are irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"A shared exhale spotting the first fireflies of summer" appears in paragraph 30 as a simile for the moment when the protagonist and Mira watch bioluminescent shrimp rise. The method (shared breath, mutual noticing) is signaled and demonstrated once. It does not shape prior attempts or constrain tactics; it names the climactic moment rather than enabling it. One beat involvement. Causal work is minimal—the exhale is effect, not cause. Closure linkage is thematic: "the interval between breaths shared in noticing" echoes the method, charging it retrospectively. Gates: setup absent, development present (one beat at climax), payoff present via echo. Lyric reprise qualifies for mid-band despite appearing only at the turn.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The forgotten underwater city research facility anchors the story from paragraph 1, constrains all choices (airlock entry, dome observation, protocol override, overnight work timeline), and supplies the bioluminescent shrimp resource that enables the final redesign. The facility's ceilings/no-heavens condition creates the protagonist's uselessness, driving the need to learn rather than teach. Three or more beats: arrival, observation theater, overnight redesign. Causal pressure is high—the setting's light failure problem defines the stakes, and its dome structure enables the glass-tracing solution. Closure linkage is direct: "the whole dome became a chamber" and the city's "gentle pulses" are the ending's physical manifestation. Gates: setup immediate (+0.8), development strong (+1.4), payoff strong (+1.5). Irreplaceability high.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Until sunrise" is declared in paragraph 33 and tracked through "By the time the first gray of morning filtered through leagues of water" in paragraph 35. The timeframe tightens the redesign work into one overnight session, compressing the collaboration and lending urgency to the mapping and switch-sequence translation. One sustained beat (the redesign work). Causal pressure is moderate—the deadline shapes the intensity but does not visibly alter tactics or force trade-offs on the page. Closure linkage is structural: sunrise marks completion. Gates: setup late (~65% mark, −0.4), development present (one beat +0.4), payoff present (dawn as closure marker +0.7). Time pressure is asserted more than dramatized; no visible cost from the constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"To learn the rhythm of belonging" appears in paragraph 6 and drives every choice: accepting the underwater assignment, experimenting with light, co-designing with Mira, and the final realization that "belonging was not the fixed point on a chart...but the interval between breaths shared in noticing." The motivation is dramatized through friction—the protagonist's charts are useless, expertise fails, and the burnt feather shifts from relic of leaving to tool of shared work. Two major beats: the light experiment and the overnight redesign. Causal pressure is strong; the want versus cost tension (forfeiting certainty for collaboration) is visible. Closure linkage is direct and transforms the initial desire. Gates: setup early (+0.7), development strong (+0.9), payoff strong (+1.5). Cost is felt: the knot loosening, identity yielding.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Shadowseam wonder" appears in paragraph 32 ("the whole dome became a chamber of shadowseam wonder") and names the tone that modulates throughout: lyric awe tempered by grief and uncertainty. The tone is coherent through turns—wonder at the drowned city, grief in the burnt feather, curiosity in Mira's crooked smile, awe in the bioluminescent shrimp—and charges the final image ("breathing rhythm"). One explicit naming plus tonal consistency across beats. Causal role is atmospheric rather than tactical; tone supports rather than constrains choice. Closure linkage is strong: the breathing rhythm enacts shadowseam wonder (interplay of light/dark, known/unknown). Gates: setup present (established early through imagery), development present (modulates with pressure), payoff strong (tone crystallizes in final image). The compound word itself is ornamental (−0.3), but the tonal effect it names is integral.</comment>
