<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theo's interiority is concrete and professional—his debunker lens colors every observation. The stakes drive him from verification to moral calculus, embodied in "the hairs along his neck rose, registering a pattern his rational mind had not yet parsed." The final choice to withhold the diamond is earned by prior causality, though his internal contradiction (dismantling fantasies vs. meeting a real cabal) could press harder in the final beat. Minor: the phrase "devotional" leans slightly abstract for this POV under peak pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Causal with accumulative texture (letters → diamond → choice). Orientation anchors by line 3. The closure—Theo's refusal to deliver the diamond—is a Decisive Change with visible cost: the orchard may wither and survivors will choke. One tightening intensifies stakes when he recognizes the geometric scars link fruit to diamond, narrowing his options to custody or destruction. The "choose not to deliver it back" final line lands the change with felt cost, though "slowly choke" slightly softens urgency.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The radioactive orchard is vivid and pressures every choice: respirator mask, glowing dust under UV lamp, fruit with geometric scars. The chain fused to the trunk and the diamond buried in roots constrain Theo's discovery tactically. The "crushed, fractured halo" image charges the final beat, making the stillpoint tangible. Sensory hierarchy is professional (UV lamp, spade strike "rang like glass but felt like ice"), though "murky light" is slightly generic for this precise POV.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early: verify the fruit vs. excavate buried truth. One meaningful tightening occurs when Theo recognizes the diamond as both key and imprint, reweighting the Committee's intent. His final decision—withhold the diamond—narrows options with on-page cost: orchard dependents will starve. Agency is decision under causal pressure. The stakes briefly telescope (governance of regions) but refocus on immediate survivors, keeping the scale grounded.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: engineered resilience as leverage, the conspiracy debunker meeting an actual secret government. The diamond's geometric scars return as motif, constraining his final choice. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—Theo's refusal encodes the tension between dismantling fantasies and confronting real power—without stating a moral. "Finally met something like a secret government, and chose not to deliver it back" reweights his career without lecture.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>POV distance is stable and professional: "Theo did not believe in curses; he believed in leverage, in blackmail, in data." Perceptual signature is sharp and technical (UV lamp, fracture analysis, "intuit the shape of a conversation"). Purposeful elision (shredded letters) imposes work and pays off when reconstructed. Minor slip: "the air in the shed tighten" drops a verb under moderate pressure, and "slowly choke on dust" in the final graf leans slightly explanatory rather than trusting the image.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies well; sentence openings shift with scene pressure. Information density is high (letters → pilot project → contingency keys in tight sequence). Two small loops: "flawed diamond" mentioned three times in close proximity without variation, and "geometric scars" echoed within two paragraphs without added pressure. The closure image is clear. No major artifacts touch the ending, but the repetitions slightly dull momentum mid-story.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The premise—conspiracy debunker finds a real conspiracy encoded in a flawed diamond—transforms the trope through the orchard's engineered resilience and the stillpoint-as-template mechanism. The geometric scars linking fruit to diamond feel specific and inevitable in hindsight. Theo's final moral calculus (custody vs. starvation) avoids middle-ground hedging. The radioactive wasteland as laboratory is fresh, though "cursed diamond" and "secret government" touch familiar ground without full subversion.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theo's debunker identity frames his lens early ("the man who broke viral myths") and drives the key turn: he interprets the diamond as leverage, not magic, enabling his final choice to withhold it. His professional skepticism constrains how he reads clues (UV lamp, fracture analysis). Present in setup, development (letter reconstruction), and closure (refusal to deliver). Causal pressure is strong; irreplaceability high—remove the debunker trait and the moral calculus collapses.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The diamond appears early in rumor, returns mid-story as excavation goal, and dominates the closure as the key Theo refuses to hand over. Its "cloudy vein" and geometric scars constrain his recognition of the orchard's imprint. Three beats: rumor, discovery, refusal. Causal pressure and closure linkage are excellent. The "crystalline stillpoint" language could be slightly more grounded in Theo's technical register, preventing a perfect 9+.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The stillpoint concept is seeded in the Committee brief ("hidden stillpoint at the heart of catastrophe"), reconstructed in the shredded letters ("crystalline stillpoint"), and drives Theo's final realization: it's a template that controls resilience. The concept shapes his recognition that the Committee wants custody, not safety data, altering his tactics. Present in all three gates; causal work is solid. Slight swappability: "control key" or "master seed" could substitute with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Sharply observant" is embodied in Theo's UV lamp use, pattern recognition in the shredded letters, and noticing the geometric scars on fruit match the diamond's ridges. It enables the letter reconstruction and the final connection. One clear beat: intuiting the conversation's shape. Present in setup (mask, notebook, fogged lenses) and development (sorting table, UV lamp). Missing a visible cost tied specifically to over-observation or a tradeoff; the trait enables without friction.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Intuit" drives the letter-reconstruction beat ("started to intuit the shape of a conversation") and the final recognition ("recognized them as the same geometric scars"). Two beats; both causally essential. The action is signaled early ("eyes sharply observant") and pays off at closure when intuition links diamond to fruit. Strong irreplaceability: swap "deduce" or "infer" and the perceptual leap feels less embodied. Closure linkage solid but not transformative—slightly short of 8.5.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Reassembling shredded letters occupies a sustained middle beat (sorting table, UV lamp, "fingers moving with a patience that felt almost devotional") and yields the pilot-project intel and the "crystalline stillpoint" phrase. The method shapes Theo's understanding and primes the diamond search. Present in setup (packing shed discovery) and development; echoes at closure when he connects the scars. One friction: the reassembly itself is efficient—no failed attempts or tactical cost—so the method enables without complication.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The orchard is the story's engine: radioactive dust storms require the respirator; glowing fruit under UV lamp enables clue discovery; the sickliest trees mark the burial site; the chain and roots constrain excavation. The setting pressures every choice and supplies the final stakes (survivors depending on the fruit). Three or more beats; causal pressure is exceptional. The final image—"orchard's wind seemed to still"—charges the closure. Highly indispensable; remove the wasteland orchard and the story collapses.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"After the liquidation" anchors the timeframe early and explains the sealed records, the Reconstruction Committee's motives, and the Directorate's buried experiment. It frames the post-crisis stakes (survivors depending on the orchard). Present in setup and development; informs closure context (Theo withholds the key from the new regime). No live clock or ticking pressure; the timeframe contextualizes rather than tightens tactics. Functional but not irreplaceable—"after the regime change" would substitute with minimal edits.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theo's desire "to excavate truth from comfortable lies" is stated early and drives the letter reconstruction and diamond search. It creates friction at closure: he spent years dismantling fantasies, now faces a real cabal, and chooses not to expose it—renouncing his mission to prevent starvation. The motivation is dramatized in choices (digging, reconstructing letters) and conflicted at the end. Strong causal work and closure linkage. Slight abstraction: the phrasing leans declarative rather than fully embodied.</comment>
