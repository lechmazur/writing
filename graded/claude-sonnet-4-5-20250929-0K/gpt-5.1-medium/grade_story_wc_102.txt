<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Arun's journey from withheld gestures to shared breath with the stranger is earned through the camera's revelation. Interior contradiction appears in the pause between inhaling/exhaling where unused love lingers, embodied through chest-tightness and the swarm of sparks. The progression from observing his own lanterns to releasing one through breath shows agency under pressure. Minor slip: the boy's rapid shift from "tense, phone clenched" to tearful openness compresses emotional movement, though the breathing-synchronization anchors it.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens inferred: the piece gathers density through image-layering (mist, lanterns, sparks) and reaches closure when Arun exhales a lantern that hovers between him and the boy—a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with conceptual cost visible in the release. The camera experiment provides causal linkage (crystal → corridor → recognition → boy encounter → shared breath). Orientation anchors (twilight viaduct, Arun, camera box) appear early. One meaningful deepening: the realization that unused love lives in the breath-pause, which directly enables the final gesture.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The viaduct's mist, climbing roses, and lantern-rail create a boundary space that supports the monk's claim and frames the camera work. The crystal fitted into the aperture constrains the experiment and charges the final blue glow. Micro-setting succeeds: the railing where the boy leans becomes the site where breath-sharing occurs, and the camera box's weight shift ("accepting an old and complicated debt") embodies thematic pressure. Sensory selection (violet hush, river exhale, ribs under wet skin) reflects Arun's receptive state without catalog.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: finding where unused love is stored and whether it can be released. The camera experiment tightens when Arun turns the lens on himself, seeing the corridor of withheld gestures—narrowing his understanding. The boy encounter deepens stakes by offering a live test of the breathing method. Agency is clear: Arun approaches, matches breath, and releases the lantern. Cost is visible in the "lantern loosen inside his own chest" and the shift from solitary pilgrim to active participant. One meaningful escalation under the accumulative lens is sufficient here.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme—unused love as unspent gestures trapped in the breath-pause—emerges through the camera's revelation and the boy encounter without thesis statement. The corridor of lanterns, each a withheld confession, particularizes the abstract. The ending image (blue glow, lanterns drifting into arches) offers a non-literal answer: release is possible through shared rhythm, not solitary observation. Quiet resonance succeeds. The sparks "battering the inside of his ribs" and Arun's recognition of the boy's overflow root theme in embodied specifics.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with Arun's perceptual signature: he notices boundary thinness, breathing changes, and spark-people through a spiritually attuned lens. Diction ("foggy lucidity," "gravity of unspent orbits") reflects his contemplative idiom without register drift. The single line of dialogue ("Breathe with me a moment") is purpose-driven and advances plot. Free indirect style is clean. Distance modulates appropriately: compression during the camera vision, then outward engagement with the boy. No head-hopping; the boy's interiority is inferred through Arun's embodied echo ("his own lungs tightened").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout (mist swallowing sound, ribs under wet skin, sparks battering ribs, lanterns as suns). While vivid, the accumulation risks slight overwriting in the middle third where multiple metaphors layer without rest (corridor/lanterns/sparks/procession/darkness/wound within ~6 lines). Rhythm varies and information density is strong. No paraphrase loops detected. Clarity holds at closure. The "foggy lucidity" phrase recurs twice, the second time feeling slightly scaffolded. Propulsion is steady but the figurative load in peak beats nudges toward the overwriting threshold without crossing into opacity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of past-life memory, camera obscura, breathing-as-diagnostic, and the pilgrim-of-sparks conceit is specific and non-obvious. The transformation of "unused love" from abstraction into breath-pause and then shared exhalation offers a fresh angle. The viaduct in bloom and Kwan Yin's Tear integrate Buddhist motifs without cliché. Risk is present in the lyric density and metaphysical frame. Minor dock: the boy's rapid inclusion at the end echoes the stranger-on-bridge template; the encounter itself is earned, but the beat structure (approach, mirror breath, release) follows familiar gesture.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Arun sets down the camera, chooses the location, fits the crystal, points the lens at himself and then at the boy, and approaches to breathe with him—each decision advances the arc. His choice to experiment with the crystal, then to turn observation outward toward the boy, drives the key turns. The final shared-breath moment depends on his active engagement. Setup early, middle experimentation, closure participation clear.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The crystal appears when the monk hands it over, is fitted into the camera aperture (enabling the vision), and returns at closure as the blue glow painting both faces. Three beats: receipt, use, reprise. Its almond shape and "kindness so sharp it cuts disguises" specificity supports irreplaceability. Cost linkage: the vision it magnifies leads Arun to recognize his own unused love and act. The crystal's mechanics (fitted, light refolding) matter on the page.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Pilgrim of sparks" is named once midway ("The camera had turned him into a pilgrim of sparks") and shapes the vision of the corridor, which then motivates his engagement with the boy. The concept reframes his quest from abstract to imagistic and enables the final gesture. It appears in the middle third, constrains his understanding, and charges the ending implicitly (sparks rising into arches). Two-gate presence (middle development, payoff linkage) with moderate causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Spiritually curious since childhood" is stated early and enables the relationship with the monk, the acceptance of the crystal, and the willingness to experiment. It constrains his approach (meditative breath-matching rather than verbal persuasion). The trait licenses the entire event chain. Setup clear, middle and closure supported. Cost is indirect: his openness makes him vulnerable to the drowned-life memory's overflow. Moderate causal necessity.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Heal" appears explicitly in Arun's intention ("tried every tidy method of healing") and implicitly in the boy encounter where breath-sharing eases the boy's tension. The final release ("the world itself might heal in places he would never see") ties closure to the action. Two beats: Arun's self-directed healing attempt, then offering it to the boy. The verb's mechanics (shared breath as method) are on the page. Removing "heal" would shift the goal from repair to mere observation.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The monk teaches Arun to listen to breathing changes (signaled early), the camera vision hitches when Arun's breathing tightens and clears when he deepens it, and the boy encounter depends on matching breath rhythms. Three beats with visible mechanics. The method shapes both the vision's legibility and the final intervention. Cost: Arun must regulate his own breath under pressure to see clearly. Specificity is high; the pause-between-breaths locus is unique.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The viaduct is chosen because "boundary lines were thin here" (setup), its mist and arches frame the camera work, and the final image sends lanterns into "the damp arches where the viaduct bloomed and waited." Three beats. The setting supplies the monk's rationale, visual texture for the vision, and a receptive space for the ending gesture. Constraint is moderate: the blooming roses ghost through the crystal, charging its use. The railing becomes the site of encounter. Mid-high integration.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the past life memory surfaces" is established early (past-tense framing of the drowning memory, bells, child's laugh) and motivates the entire quest. The memory's pressure ("whenever he inhaled too sharply, he felt whole shorelines rush into his lungs") persists through the camera work and the boy encounter. Two beats: it seeds the unused-love question and colors his recognition of the boy's swarm. The timeframe tightens decisions implicitly by making breath itself fraught. Lyric reprise of the drowned woman's hand in the corridor.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Arun's stated goal ("to find where unused love is stored, and if it could be released without burning") drives his camera experiment, the vision provides an answer (the breath-pause), and the boy encounter dramatizes the release. Three beats with friction: the monk's metaphor ("birds trapped in a library") versus the camera's stark corridor of failures. The final gesture costs Arun a lantern from inside his chest. Motivation is concrete and conflicted, though the boy's arrival feels slightly convenient timing-wise.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Foggy lucidity" is named once and sustained throughout: the mist, the monk's gnomic teaching, the camera's patient-yet-unforgiving images, and Arun's words coming "from the foggy lucidity inside him" at closure. Tone modulates with pressure (the vision tightens breath, the boy encounter opens into shared rhythm) and charges the final blue glow. The oxymoron holds across beats without static repetition. Coherence is high; the violet hush and damp arches support the mood without breaking into clarity or full obscurity.</comment>
