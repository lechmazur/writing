<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's core trait ("hides behind truth") is stated but never dramatized in a scene choice with visible cost. His interiority leans heavily on elevated, abstract phrasing ("discover the color of sound," "hiding behind truth the way others hid behind lies") that reads more like authorial gloss than embodied thought under pressure. The final vow ("I will no longer hide behind truth") arrives without prior on-page contradiction or failure that would earn the shift; we never see him refuse a question or pay a price for evasion. Embodied emotion is sparse—most beats describe atmosphere or metaphor rather than physical sensation or micro-choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land cleanly in the opening lines. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: layers of image (tag, library, luminous vows) build toward a final reconfiguration when Elias speaks his vow and the world "brightens." However, the closure unit lacks legible cost on the page—the library brightens, the tag clears, and Elias surfaces able to see sound-colors with no visible forfeit, struggle, or price paid. The Cost Proof Test fails: no sentence in the ending beat shows what he lost or risked to gain this ability. The orientation penalty is waived (clear early anchors), but the absent cost at closure prevents high-band entry.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The sunken-ship library is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (barnacled pilings, silt like slow snow, swollen wood, waterlogged books leaking radiance). Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from pier to ladder to water to hull to corridor. The library itself constrains the final choice: Elias must enter, find the book, and speak his vow inside this space, satisfying the 9+ gate requirement that setting shape a key action. Micro-setting (the tag warming in his palm, the door carved "Vows") charges the closure image. No occupation or professional depth is needed here; the lamplighter role functions as atmospheric framing.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"discover the color of sound"—is signaled early but remains abstract; we never see Elias fail at this goal or face a trade-off that tests commitment. The middle sequence (tag hums, he follows, dives, finds library) unfolds without resistance or reversal; each step yields discovery rather than complication. The ending presents a vow and immediate reward (he can now see sound-colors) with no dramatized cost or path foreclosed. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful tightening or deepening is required; here the pressure never narrows options or forces a sacrifice, only grants access. The escalation guardrail for Accumulative (density increase, pattern break, or cadence shift that reweights the stake with cost) is not met.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Theme (the persistence of broken vows, the courage to promise despite failure) emerges through the library conceit and Elias's realization. The final vow attempts resonance but arrives as direct thematic statement: "I will no longer hide behind truth; I will speak what I fear, and listen for its color." This explicit articulation in the climax beat replaces scene pressure with stated moral, triggering the Thematic Echo penalty (−0.5 in final paragraph). The library itself—vows as luminous, persistent objects—offers a strong central image, but the ending tells us the lesson rather than charging it through action or implication. No counter-reading is invited; the piece resolves into a tidy before/after without ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization is stable; no head-hopping. The narrative voice carries a lyric, elevated register ("meteor hush," "lantern pole on his shoulder like a mute flag," "wandering purposefully") that remains consistent but trends toward poetic gloss over character-specific perception. Elias's way of noticing leans heavily on metaphor and abstraction; we get little idiomatic or vernacular texture. Psychic distance is controlled, though filter verbs ("he recognized," "he understood," "he realized") cluster in the library sequence, slightly dulling immediacy. No dialogue appears, so voice distinction tests do not apply. The prose reads as a singular, purpose-driven style but lacks the perceptual signature or diction particularity that would reach high bands.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high in the library sequence, where each image does double duty (atmosphere + stakes). However, several adjacent lines loop conceptually: "Each book leaked a soft radiance… lines of text lifting free as drifting ribbons of pale, silent light. He recognized them not as stories, but as luminous vows…" restates the same content across three sentences without added pressure. Template cadence appears in the opening ("Elias… moved… He worked… Elias hid…"). Figurative language saturates most sentences in the underwater beats without pattern-teaching or payoff, creating density that slows rather than propels. No clarity break at closure, so the Non-closure Accumulation Cap applies: two distinct issues (paraphrase loops, template stems) trigger −0.8 within Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The core conceit—a sunken library of broken vows—offers a fresh image, and the lamplighter-as-listener angle adds specificity. However, the emotional arc (solitary seeker gains magical ability through underwater epiphany) follows a familiar template without transformation through lived detail or moral friction. The ending grants the protagonist his goal with no visible trade-off, undercutting conceptual risk. The library's particulars (hotel key tag, carved door, luminous text) are vivid but the plot structure (call → journey → discovery → reward) reads as stock quest mechanics. The piece commits fully to its lyric premise but does not challenge or complicate it; Elias's character and the vow-library do not interrogate each other in ways that surprise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Present early, shapes the inciting observation (lantern drop) and the decision to dive. Does not drive the library encounter or the final vow; his occupation functions as atmospheric framing rather than constraint. Two beats (lighting lamps, climbing down) but no cost tied to the role itself.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Tag appears in three distinct beats: falls into water, hums to guide him, warms in the library, flares clear at closure. It enables the journey and charges the final image. The "library card" realization is told rather than shown through use, capping the score below 8.5. Early signal, closure linkage, and causal pressure present.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The library of luminous vows is the story's central image, present by the second third and shaping the final beat when Elias adds his own vow. It reweights the abstract quest into concrete action. However, the vows themselves do not constrain choice—Elias simply reads, realizes, and speaks; no friction or cost emerges from the concept. Setup, development, and payoff gates are met, but causal pressure is light.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Stated in the opening paragraph but never demonstrated in scene. We do not see Elias answer a question, evade, or pay a price for this trait. The trait is invoked again in the climax vow ("I will no longer hide behind truth") but the shift is asserted, not earned by prior dramatized failure. Label-only use; no visible tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The word "signify" appears once in reflection: "every vow here had once tried to signify something truer than speech." It colors the theme but does not drive a turn or constrain a choice. Easily swappable with "mean" or "express." Ornamental thematic echo, not causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Appears in one sentence: "The tug in that humming drew him along the darkened planks by wandering purposefully, as though he followed footsteps only he could hear." The method is named but its mechanics do not recur or shape later attempts. First-third signal but no development or closure participation. Functional mention, replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The sunken-ship library is signaled early (derelict shape offshore), explored in detail mid-story, and is the site of the climactic vow. It supplies the vow-book that Elias reads and constrains the action (he must dive, navigate hull, enter the room). The setting charges the final image when "the library brightened; shelves straightened." Three gates met, causal pressure and closure linkage strong, specificity high.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>The lantern release brackets the story (town gathers, lanterns rise, one drops the tag; Elias surfaces "beneath the last of the ascending lanterns") but does not create urgency or narrow options. Time is vague underwater; no clock pressure. Present but ornamental, does not tighten decisions.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Stated early ("to discover the color of sound that lived inside waves") and echoed in the library ("someone had promised to hear what others could not"). The final beat grants this ability: "every sound shimmered with a color he could now see." However, the desire is never tested against a competing cost; Elias pursues it without friction or sacrifice. Setup and payoff present, but no on-page conflict between want and price. Lyric reprise reweights the stake, qualifying for mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The phrase "meteor hush" opens and closes the story, and the prose sustains a lyric, contemplative register throughout (no tonal breaks or modulation under pressure). The tone charges the final image: "In the meteor hush, he walked the pier, each footstep a small promise carrying new color." Coherent and purposeful, but static—no tonal shift to reflect escalation. Strong reprise, but the single-note mood caps the score below 7.0.</comment>
