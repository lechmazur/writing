<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's interiority is concrete and particular—her button-mapping method and her shift from "belief in forecasts" to understanding "shared wisdom" as "courage to let other people's echoes rewrite your own" feels earned. The backstory (~25%) is substantial but anchored to present stimuli (the buttons, the warehouse silence) and tilts her stance toward action. Internal contradiction operates: she once trusted the Council yet now steals to "loosen that order," and the final choice to release the echo carries visible cost (ending the containment she worked years to penetrate). Minor: the porters and seamstresses remain off-page influences rather than on-page pressure, limiting relational crucible work.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (Mara, amber warehouse beneath cliffs, "the night the cliffs finally stopped humming") land within the opening lines. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: silence → dust constellations → button pattern → jar unsealed → echo spilling through aisles builds density and cadence shift that reweights the dominant stake (prophecy as singular decree vs. "tangled invitation"). Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Mara tips the jar wider, seeding "new, unearthed silence, and endless raw possibility" with conceptual cost legible in the phrase "as the truth unravels above"—the Council's order will fracture. One meaningful deepening (button map → jar → release) is sufficient at this length. Causality remains clean under the accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The amber warehouse is vividly particular: "resinous panes that glowed like trapped sunsets," "dust floated like slow constellations," chalk marks and missing index books. Sensory selection (touch on resin pane, low murmur, air thickening) reflects urgency and filters through Mara's professional attention. The buttons function as micro-setting, constraining her search method and charging the final image when she pours them "like a tiny, clattering constellation." Spatial choreography (aisles, tiers, crate placement) tracks cleanly. Does not quite reach 9+ gate: while the warehouse pressures her search, the environment itself does not force a binary choice at closure; the jar's contents do that work.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (steal the echo to "spin a prophecy into raw possibility before the Council bound it into law") is signaled in paragraph five and braided with a secondary (restore voices the Council has silenced). One meaningful tightening: locating the jar and hearing its polyvocal chord forces Mara to choose—seal it back or release it—and her decision to "tip the jar wider" forecloses containment with visible cost (the warehouse will "breathe," the truth will unravel above). Agency is decisive renunciation of control (she abandons theft-for-self, releasing the echo to all). Escalation under the Accumulative lens reads as density increase (button map → counter-seal → murmur → full release) that narrows her tactical options and raises social cost. Cost is legible on the page: "by morning...the warehouse would breathe" implies discovery and consequence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the canyon echo's "tangled invitation" versus the prophecy writer's "linear orders." The insight "shared wisdom...was not the same as shared conclusions; it was the courage to let other people's echoes rewrite your own" arises from Mara's embodied experience (hearing the valley's last chord, cataloging buttons from others). The jar returns with reweighted meaning: at first a theft target, then a polyvocal reminder that "futures were always made from too many voices to fit inside a single decree." Final image (echo threading through confiscated relics) offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Minor: the phrase "quietly inspired and suddenly certain" in the penultimate paragraph edges toward summary statement rather than pure dramatization, though it remains tied to the sensory flood of the echo.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable and controlled; psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during the jar unsealing, pulling back slightly for the final vision). Perceptual signature is distinct: Mara notices buttons, chalk marks, smugglers' songs, the "grammar beneath coincidence"—a cataloger's selectivity. Diction stays within her plausible lexicon (mix of artisan precision and poetic compression). No dialogue on the page to judge. Purposeful compression ("the sharing had thinned into ordered obedience") and lyric cadence ("dust floated like slow constellations") are pattern-taught and legible. Filter verbs ("she had waited," "she realized") remain sparse and voice-motivated. Syntax and rhythm reflect calm determination under pressure without flattening into template cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Information density is high: most lines advance atmosphere, character knowledge, or pressure. Figurative language ("slow constellations," "trapped sunsets," "unearthed silence") is vivid and coherent, concentrated in scene-setting rather than overwhelming peak beats. Sentence openings vary; paragraph rhythm breathes. Minor artifacts: "quietly inspired" (penultimate paragraph) leans toward label-only trait naming, and "the truth unravels in whispered alleys Mara tried not to imagine" mid-story introduces a syntactic hiccup (comma splice or awkward embedding). The phrase "as the truth unravels" recurs as a timeframe marker but does not loop—it reweights. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn detected. Proofreading is clean. Strategic telling compresses Mara's years of preparation efficiently.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The amber warehouse of confiscated curiosities and the button-mapping method offer fresh, specific angles on prophecy-theft and archive-breaking plots. The canyon echo as "tangled invitation" rather than deterministic oracle transforms a familiar trope (stolen prophecy) through Mara's realization that the Council "sliced that chord into linear orders." Emotional complexity (despair braided with laughter in the valley's last afternoon) avoids generic rebellion templates. Transformation test: swapping names and setting would weaken the story; the button catalog and resinous crates are particular to this voice. Risk is moderate: the lyric, accumulative design and quiet ending (release rather than confrontation) elevate without obscuring clarity. Does not quite reach 9+ band: the core frame (resist authoritarian decree by releasing suppressed voice) reads as a recognizable synthesis rather than a wholly unprecedented premise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara the hourglass turner drives all major beats: she maps the warehouse via buttons (setup), walks the aisles counting shelves (development), whispers the counter-seal, unseals the jar, listens to the echo's chord, and makes the climactic choice to tip the jar wider and release the echo (payoff at closure). Her decision alters tactics (from theft-for-prophecy-spin to open release) and forecloses containment with visible cost. Early signal (paragraph one) and causal pressure across three beats. Specificity: "hourglass turner" colors her patience ("waited years for the hush") but does not mechanically constrain action on the page beyond thematic resonance with time and patience.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The canyon echo in a jar appears in setup (paragraph four: "somewhere among them waited"), development (paragraphs eighteen–nineteen: located, unsealed, lid loosened), and payoff (paragraphs twenty-eight–thirty: Mara hears the chord, realizes its polyvocal nature, tips the jar wider to release it). The jar is handled physically (palm pressed to pane, lid loosened a fraction, jar tipped) and its meaning evolves: theft target → singular prophecy source → "tangled invitation" → agent of warehouse transformation. Causal pressure: the jar's contents force Mara's final choice and shape the ending image (echo seeping into crates). Irreplaceability high: the specific properties (swirl of shadow and gold, murmur of overlapping voices) are load-bearing.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Shared wisdom shapes stakes (Mara's goal is to prevent the Council from binding prophecy into law by restoring polyvocal input) and tactics (she seeks the echo to "spin a prophecy into raw possibility"). On-page friction: her realization that "shared wisdom...was not the same as shared conclusions" changes her intention from theft-for-herself to open release. The concept appears in setup (paragraph six: "They called it shared wisdom"), middle reflection (paragraph seven: "the sharing had thinned into ordered obedience"), and payoff (paragraph thirty-three: her insight about courage). Two beats plus closure linkage. Minor: much of the concept's work occurs in reflective interiority rather than embodied tactical constraint, limiting top-band eligibility.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Quietly inspired" is labeled in paragraph six ("quietly inspired by the way elders shared storms and harvests") as past belief and recurs in paragraph thirty-three ("Quietly inspired and suddenly certain") at the decision beat. The trait enables her initial trust in the Council and her final willingness to release the echo, but the second mention leans toward summary label rather than embodied tradeoff. Early signal and closure participation present; causal pressure modest (the attribute colors motivation but does not create a on-page friction or visible cost). Swappability moderate: a near-synonym like "cautiously hopeful" could substitute with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Unscrambling drives the middle beats: Mara pours the buttons "like a tiny, clattering constellation, ready to unscramble the pattern they formed" (paragraph fourteen), uses their geometry to locate the jar (paragraph seventeen), and the thematic echo of unscrambling appears when she hears the valley's chord and refuses to let it remain "sliced...into linear orders" (paragraph twenty-nine). The action is signaled early (paragraph twelve: "mapped...by cataloging lost buttons"), executed on-page (paragraph fourteen), and its mechanics (button colors/types → aisle locations) matter to success. Causal pressure: without unscrambling, she cannot locate the jar. The action is specific enough that swapping it (e.g., "decode") would require recasting prior setup.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Cataloging lost buttons is seeded in paragraph twelve ("mapped the warehouse in secret over years, by cataloging lost buttons traded from porters and seamstresses"), demonstrated in paragraph fourteen (buttons poured and their "quiet geometry" read: "Blue bone for the northern aisle, two-hole brass for the west"), and pays off in paragraph seventeen when "Her chart placed the canyon echo three aisles in." The method constrains her search (she cannot simply wander; she relies on the button map) and its mechanics are made visible (color/notch → shelf location). Early signal, middle use, payoff via successful location. Irreplaceability high: the button catalog is peculiar to Mara's patient, artisan approach and ties to the theme of small voices (porters, seamstresses) contributing to a larger map.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The amber warehouse beneath cliffs is anchored in paragraph one, detailed across paragraphs nine–ten (confiscated curiosities in resinous panes, chalk marks, missing index books, cliffs as passive guards), and pressures Mara's choices: she must wait for the cliffs' hush to hear what remains (paragraph two), navigate by button map because half the index books are missing (paragraph ten), and use the counter-seal because the crates are amber-locked (paragraph twenty). The warehouse's properties (dust, amber glow, aisle tiers) shape her search tactics and the final image (echo seeping through aisles and crates). Micro-setting (the crate, the jar within) charges the climax. Spatial choreography is coherent.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"As the truth unravels" appears as a timeframe marker in paragraph sixteen ("as the truth unravels in whispered alleys") and again in the final line ("as the truth unravels above, the warehouse would breathe"). The phrase signals urgency (the Council's decree is imminent, the city is already fracturing) and the "by morning" detail in the final paragraph tightens the clock, implying Mara's window for action is this single night. However, the timeframe functions more as atmospheric pressure than a live on-page countdown that alters her tactics beat-by-beat. Early signal and closure participation present; causal pressure modest. The time element constrains setup (she acts tonight) but does not force a mid-action adjustment.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara's motivation—to spin a prophecy into raw possibility before the Council bound it into law—is stated in paragraph five and dramatized through her goal-directed search, her decision to unseal the jar, and her climactic choice to release the echo rather than hoard it. The motivation creates friction: she initially plans to "steal that echo, not for herself" yet still intends instrumental use ("spin a prophecy"), but hearing the valley's polyvocal chord shifts her intention to open release (paragraphs thirty–thirty-four). Setup, middle pursuit, and payoff choice all reflect the motivation. Cost is visible: releasing the echo forecloses her original plan and invites Council reprisal. Swappability low: the specific desire (raw possibility vs. fixed law) is tied to the story's thematic core.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Unearthed silence is introduced in paragraph three ("an unearthed silence settled over the rows"), recurs as "the hush" Mara waited for (paragraph two), and charges the final image ("new, unearthed silence, and endless raw possibility"). The tone is coherent: quiet, patient, accumulative, with lyric compression and restrained urgency. It modulates subtly—calm cataloging in the search, thickening air and "low murmur" at the jar's opening, then the polyvocal flood and Mara's certainty. The tone supports the Accumulative lens and does not break under pressure. The recurring "silence" vs. "echo" polarity reweights at closure: silence becomes generative rather than empty. Closure linkage strong; the tone is load-bearing for the final image's effect.</comment>
