<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's insomnia and compulsion to paint transience ground her choices clearly; her decision to trade the brooch arises from established character logic (threshing meaning, chasing omens wryly). Internal contradiction shows in "never quite believed in them, but never quite risked ignoring them either." The embodied exhaustion ("a thought she could almost think before exhaustion smudged it away") and her walking-by-rain habit anchor her particularities. One micro-deduction: the guard's nod at the checkpoint reads slightly too knowing, verging on convenience, though it remains within earned-stasis range.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with Situational pressure—details accrue (failed tide, amber insect, rain trails) and compress into the checkpoint exchange, a Charged Poise moment where Mara steps onto the slick road with packed canvases, offering the brooch instead of papers. Orientation anchors arrive early (tidal island, post-water-wars, insomniac painter). The closure reconfigures her status from island observer to active trader, the brooch becoming currency between worlds; cost is legible in her departure and the guard's recognition of "an exchange of hungers." One hairline slip: the phrase "an overdue appointment, an exchange of hungers between worlds that had pretended to be separate" leans slightly abstract where a sharper image would lock the RR tighter.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The tidal island constrains movement (twice-daily road appearance/disappearance), the exposed seabed yields the brooch, and the rain trails function as navigational method. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful: "sky had the color of a bruise remembering better days," "wet stones gleaming like vertebrae." The amber brooch charges the final exchange, and the slick road surface recurs to anchor her departure. Micro-setting (body, tool, recurring object) all constrain choice and charge closure, meeting the 9+ gate cleanly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: secure reprieve for the island (filters, not trinkets). Mara's agency drives escalation—finding the brooch, deciding to trade it, walking the rain trail to the checkpoint. The tightening is meaningful: she moves from observer to actor, risking the mainland crossing. Visible cost: she leaves the island with only the brooch and packed paintings, no papers, trusting the artifact to substitute. One minor gap: Eron's joke ("Unless you can exchange it for rainfall somewhere") lands with slightly too much on-the-nose weight as the pivot moment, nudging convenience.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges concretely: the attempt to "thresh meaning from experience" enacted through Mara's painting of transience, her pursuit of rain trails, and the brooch as "preserved time." The final exchange dramatizes convergence—forest (amber), sea (failed tide), and human need (filters vs. trinkets)—without stating a moral. The closing image ("an exchange of hungers between worlds that had pretended to be separate") reweights the brooch from omen to currency, from past to present utility, with conceptual cost legible. No thematic echo or explicit moralizing; the insect's "fossilized surrender" and Mara's earnest attention to omens cohere without over-explanation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Mara; psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during brooch discovery, slightly wider during village gathering). Perceptual signature is character-specific: she notices patterns (rain trails, tides, omens) and textures ("honeyed oval," "silver veils"). Diction remains controlled and voice-consistent under pressure. One cluster of filter verbs in the middle passage ("felt a prickle," "felt, against all better judgment") slightly dulls immediacy but does not break voice. Dialogue is sparse, natural, and advances plot (Eron's practicality vs. Naida's wryness). No head-hopping; tense stable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally; figurative language is dense but mostly coherent ("breathing sea," "vertebrae," "bruise remembering"). Two slips lower the score: "the world was trying to tell her something in a language of trapped wings and hardened sap" edges into stock lyricism, and the final beat's "exchange of hungers between worlds that had pretended to be separate" is slightly overwritten, abstract where image would serve better. Minor paraphrase loop: "amber brooch" and variations appear in six consecutive beats, some purely descriptive. Information density is high elsewhere; no scaffold or template cadence. These artifacts touch but do not obscure closure, so penalty remains moderate.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Core premise (post-water-wars tidal island, insomniac painter finds amber artifact) synthesizes familiar elements with specific detail: rain trails as navigation, the brooch as pre-war relic turned currency, "wryly earnest" stance toward omens. The checkpoint exchange where artifact substitutes for papers offers a fresh inflection on survival economies. One deduction: the water-wars setting and refugee/ration economy are well-worn templates; transformation is present but not radical. The piece commits fully to its premise and avoids safety hedging, but lacks a bold structural or perspectival risk that would elevate originality further.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Insomniac painter present from opening line; her compulsion to paint transience frames the search. Her choices drive two major beats: deciding to trade the brooch and walking the rain trail to the checkpoint. Observation (noticing the failed tide, finding the brooch) enables the decision, which alters her tactics (leaving the island, offering the brooch instead of papers). Closure participation strong: she steps onto the road with packed canvases, embodying the shift from observer to actor. Early signal, two beats, causal pressure, closure linkage, and visible cost (departure, risk) together push high.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Amber brooch appears in beat two (discovery on seabed), reappears in beat three (village gathering), and drives beat four (decision to trade) and closure (offered at checkpoint). Meaning evolves: from omen ("language of trapped wings") to practical currency ("exchange it for rainfall somewhere") to embodied convergence at the checkpoint. Four distinct beats, early signal, causal pressure (enables the journey), closure linkage (the exchange itself), and cost connection (her survival depends on its value). High irreplaceability: its trapped insect and fossilized time anchor theme.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Unearthed convergence named explicitly ("an unearthed convergence of vanished forest, vanished sea, and the thin, remaining filament of their lives") and thematically present: the amber (forest), failed tide (sea), and Mara's choice (remaining life) converge at the checkpoint. The concept shapes her interpretation of the brooch and her decision to trade it. Closure participation: the guard recognizes "an exchange of hungers between worlds that had pretended to be separate," reprising convergence. However, much of the convergence work is thematic rather than causal—it colors meaning more than it narrows tactical options. Early signal, lyric reprise, closure linkage, but limited causal pressure keeps it mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Wryly earnest described directly ("Mara was wryly earnest about omens; she never quite believed in them, but never quite risked ignoring them either") and enacted: she pockets the brooch despite skepticism, deciding to trade it. The trait constrains one on-page action—accepting the omen's weight—and enables the journey. Closure: her earnest risk-taking (offering the brooch instead of papers) reflects the trait. Setup clear, one beat involvement, modest causal pressure, closure linkage present. Cost is indirect (the trait's contradiction drives her choice, which carries departure risk). Label-plus-enactment keeps it from higher bands; no second distinct beat where the trait visibly trades off against another value.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Exchange named as possibility ("exchange it for rainfall somewhere"), decided upon ("I will go when the road dries enough"), and enacted at closure (offering the brooch instead of papers). Two beats: decision and execution. The action redefines her options from passive observer to active trader and reconfigures the brooch from omen to currency. Causal pressure high: the exchange is the story's hinge. Closure linkage unmistakable. Cost legible: she risks the mainland with no papers, depending entirely on the brooch's value. Early signal (Eron's joke), middle development (her decision), and closure execution meet all three gates.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rain trails signaled early ("she walked by following rain trails, chasing those silver veils"), established as method during her vigils, and enacted at closure ("walked by following rain trails that slanted toward the distant gleam of city lights"). Mechanics clear: she navigates by tracking narrow drifting rains. Two beats: habit (past vigils) and present journey. The method shapes her departure route and charges the final movement. Early signal, closure participation, and specificity (rain as navigation) elevate it. However, the method does not constrain a middle choice or introduce friction—it is means, not obstacle—limiting causal pressure slightly.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Tidal island present from opening, constrains movement ("Twice a day the road appeared and vanished"), and supplies the exposed seabed where the brooch is found. The failed tide (beat one) triggers Mara's search. The island's isolation and single well gather the village (beat two). The land-bridge's availability enables her departure (closure). Three beats, early signal, causal pressure (setting change creates opportunity), closure linkage (she walks the now-dry road), and irreplaceability (only a tidal island would expose the seabed and gate departure). Micro-setting (body/tool) less prominent than macro, but the road's vertebrae image charges the final movement.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Water wars establish context (rations, treaties, salted atmosphere, desal lines) and tighten present stakes (filters vs. trinkets, the failed tide as post-war consequence). The timeframe shapes Mara's insomniac history and the village's scarcity. However, the wars are backstory; no on-page clock tightens during the story window. The timeframe colors every choice but does not escalate within the narrative present. Early signal, thematic resonance, and pressure context present; closure participation indirect (the guard recognizes post-war exchange logic). Lack of live ticking or tactical tightening during the story's hours/days keeps it mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Motivation stated ("Her whole life since the water wars had been an attempt to thresh meaning from experience, as if the right pattern might redeem the squandered oceans") and dramatized: she paints transience, follows omens wryly, and decides the brooch might "trade this shard of preserved time for some small reprieve." Two beats: interpreting the brooch and choosing to trade it. The desire drives her departure and charges the checkpoint exchange. Early signal, closure linkage, and friction present (the village's practicality vs. her search for meaning). One deduction: much of the motivation is told in reflection; on-page micro-choices (pocketing the brooch, deciding to go) enact it, but the dramatized conflict between meaning-seeking and practical survival could be sharper.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Haggard awe established early ("haggard awe of people who had seen cities buckle but still marveled at a well-preserved bug"), sustained through imagery ("sky had the color of a bruise remembering better days," "silver veils," "honeyed oval"), and modulates under pressure (wry observation at the village, quiet resolve at departure, charged recognition at the checkpoint). Tone coheres across beats and charges the final image: the guard's nod "as though recognizing an overdue appointment" carries both exhaustion and reverence. Early signal, coherent modulation, closure charge. One minor slip: the phrase "haggard awe" is named once, risking label-only use, but the tone is embodied throughout in syntax and image choice, keeping it high.</comment>
