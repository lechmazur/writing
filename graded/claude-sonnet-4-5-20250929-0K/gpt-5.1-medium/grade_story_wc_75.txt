<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The narrator-protagonist shows clear interior contradiction—arriving as a "cultured outsider" for preservation work yet carrying a "private mission" and "foolish" motives. Embodied emotion is strong: "the sour dread of stone that had seen too many partings," the emerald lens creating underwater greens where "the present thinned." The final choice to stay and teach "wondering which of us history would spare" reads as Earned Stasis with visible cost (abandoning contract end, accepting uncertain fate). Minor deduction for the slightly diagnostic phrasing "private mission to rescue dying arts" in early reflection, though it's quickly grounded in the opera-glass action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through layered images (museum/refugee camp, baking initials, emerald-glass vision) and deepens via the protagonist's deepening immersion. Orientation anchors (grotto city, waterfall, Lira as guide) land by ~15% of text. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): the narrator stays "after my contract ended, teaching children to bind stories to their letters of bread, wondering which of us history would spare"—a renunciation of the extraction mission with undeniable opportunity cost and existential stakes made legible on the page. One meaningful deepening (kitchen scene → emerald-glass revelation → final commitment) tightens the dominant stake from passive cataloging to active transmission. Cost is visible: the narrator forgoes extraction and assumes the displaced persons' uncertain fate.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The grotto city setting constrains and charges multiple choices: the waterfall curtain as gate, the high-arched mist-clouds, the dark niches where beehives once hung (establishing scarcity), and the spiral stair into the kitchen anchor spatial choreography. The emerald lens as micro-object functions as setting-extender, shifting perception and enabling the protagonist's insight ("dough bright as riverweed, the faces… shimmering with faint outlines"). Sensory detail is vivid and selective—rosewater, yeast, stone, mist—filtered through the museum-guide POV. The setting's transformation from "frozen in time" to "thawed" by war directly shapes the stakes and charges the final image of teaching amid dissolution.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving dying arts versus witnessing vanishing) is signaled early and tightens through one meaningful reversal: Lira's command "look at us with it" shifts the narrator from detached cataloger to participant. The emerald-glass scene reveals ghostly crafts and guides Lira's whispered directive: "help us keep… in hands and throats, before… it thaws and runs back into the waterfall." Agency at closure is clear—staying to teach—with visible cost (abandoning extraction, accepting shared uncertainty). Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens; the protagonist's immersion deepens from arrival through kitchen encounter to lens-vision to final commitment. One friction: the war context and displaced-persons pressure are established but remain somewhat abstract; the on-page stakes center more on cultural transmission than immediate survival.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme (ephemerality, cultural memory, complicity in preservation versus participation) emerges organically from image and action—no thesis statements. The bread-initials custom, the beekeeper's absence, the emerald lens showing "ghostly… tools" and "translucent sheets of musical notation" all concretize the tension between static museum logic and living transmission. The final image—teaching children to "bind stories to their letters of bread, wondering which of us history would spare"—reweights the opening "museum and… refugee camp" duality without stating a moral. Subtext operates in gesture (Lira's "soft command," the displaced shaping dough) and in the protagonist's unspoken shift from extraction to solidarity. Minor deduction: "private mission to rescue dying arts" in early reflection leans slightly abstract, though it's quickly embodied in the opera-glass relic and later dramatized through the choice to stay.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with strong perceptual signature: the narrator filters everything through a museum-guide's vocabulary ("defaced statues," "rolled maps," "historically oriented") and the emerald lens device. Psychic distance modulates purposefully—close in the kitchen, pulled back during the lens-vision. Voice is distinct and consistent: "I was not sure which was more arrogant" and "wondering which of us history would spare" carry the same wry, elegiac register. Lira's dialogue—"war is a strange sun," "their name does not crumble in our mouths"—is elevated but consistent with her role as "keeper of customs" with "the vocabulary of a footnote." One friction: some late phrasing ("afterimage of a world that had already decided to vanish") edges toward authorial summary rather than the narrator's lived idiom, though it remains within an educated guide's register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; strong concrete images dominate (basalt arch, mist-clouds, damp dough shaped into letters). Information density is high—most lines advance character, world, or stakes. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "everything felt so brittle" / "stone that had seen too many partings" restate fragility; "catalog whatever history had not been washed away" / "rescue dying arts before they slipped under the tide of necessity" loop the preservation motive; "thaw even the oldest stone" / "before… it thaws and runs back into the waterfall" repeat the thaw motif without added pressure. Template cadence in mid-section: "I told her… She asked… I said… She asked… I raised…" runs across five beats. Combined, these trigger −0.6 for loops and −0.4 for template stem repetition (−1.0 total in Q7). The closure beat itself is clean and propulsive, capping the deduction.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of museum-guide narrator, grotto refuge, emerald opera-glass, and the bread-initial custom feels specific and non-obvious—not a stock "war refugee" or "preservationist" template. The emerald lens as a concrete device that "made the present look as if it were about to dissolve" and later reveals "ghostly… tools" is a fresh inflection on memory and witnessing. The choice to stay and teach rather than extract transforms the preservation trope into complicity and shared risk. One friction: the "cultured museum guide" arriving at a half-museum/half-refugee-camp setting leans toward a recognizable "expert witness" frame, though the protagonist's foolish motive and final renunciation elevate it. Risk-taking (lyric register, extended reflection, quiet ending) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; +0.3 within band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character "cultured museum guide" is present early and frames the narrator's perception (vocabulary, lens for objects). The guide role enables the initial hire and shapes the observation mode throughout. Key turn: the narrator's choice to stay "after my contract ended, teaching children" directly flows from the guide's "historically oriented" stance shifting from extraction to transmission. The role constrains the final choice (forgoing professional detachment) with visible cost. Present in setup, middle (kitchen tour, lens interpretation), and closure (teaching decision). Strong causal pressure and closure linkage; irreplaceable in that a different profession would not carry the same thematic weight of museum-versus-life tension.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Object "emerald-tinted opera glass lens" appears early (pocket mention), is used in two distinct beats (protagonist looks at kitchen, sees ghostly crafts; Lira commands its use), and charges the final choice by making "the present look as if it were about to dissolve" and revealing "what you must help us keep." The lens is specific (salvaged from flooded theater, tints green, thins the present) and irreplaceable—no generic magnifier could carry the layered opera/memory/dissolution associations. It enables the protagonist's insight that motivates staying. Present in setup, development (lens-vision scene), and closure participation (the "help us keep" directive leads directly to teaching decision). Strong causal and thematic pressure; minor cap for not being physically present in the final sentence itself, though its effect reverberates.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Core Concept "displaced persons" is present early ("half museum and half refugee camp," "displaced persons who now slept between defaced statues") and shapes stakes throughout: the bread-initial custom adapted for "strangers who have lost their papers," the loss of festivals and beehives, and the narrator's realization that preserving culture means staying with the displaced rather than extracting artifacts. The concept pressures the protagonist's choice at closure (join the displaced, share their uncertainty). Present in setup, middle (kitchen scene with women and children baking), and closure (teaching displaced children). Strong thematic and causal weight; the entire narrative arc turns on the museum/refugee-camp duality and the choice to remain.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Attribute "historically oriented" is mentioned once explicitly ("They called me because I was historically oriented, because I knew how to listen to objects") and functions throughout via the narrator's vocabulary and the emerald-lens relic. It enables the initial hire and frames the observational stance. The trait constrains the final choice implicitly—staying to teach is the historically oriented impulse redirected from objects to "hands and throats." However, the phrase itself is label-only after first mention; the trait's work is done through voice and action rather than repeated assertion. Present in setup and implicit in closure; functional but somewhat replaceable with "expert" or "preservationist." Mid-band for enabling role without repeated on-page pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Action "thaw" is present as metaphor early ("war is a strange sun, and it can thaw even the oldest stone") and returns in Lira's directive ("before the last of it thaws and runs back into the waterfall") and is implicit in the bread shaping (temporary, dissolving memory). The action shapes the stakes (culture is melting away) and pressures the protagonist's choice to stay and teach before dissolution. However, "thaw" is metaphorical throughout—no literal thawing act occurs on the page. Present in setup (Lira's line), development (implicit in baking and lens-vision), and closure framing (teaching against dissolution). Strong thematic charge but abstract execution; swappable with "fade" or "vanish" with minor edits. Mid-high band for thematic centrality despite metaphorical remove.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Method "a family custom of baking bread shaped like initials" is introduced in the kitchen scene (mid-story), explained with specificity ("so that their name does not crumble in our mouths"), adapted for displaced strangers, and directly invoked at closure ("teaching children to bind stories to their letters of bread"). The custom is mechanically detailed (damp dough, trays, cooling, taste) and shapes the final action—teaching this exact practice. Present in development and closure; the custom's adaptive use (letters for lost strangers) adds urgency. Strong closure linkage and specificity. Minor cap for late first appearance (~40% mark) and for being swappable with another craft tradition (weaving, carving) with modest edits, though the edibility and ephemerality are thematically apt.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Setting "grotto city behind a monumental waterfall" is present immediately (title moment), detailed early (basalt arch, mist, terraces, hanging gardens, dark beehive niches, spiral stair), and pressures choices throughout: the waterfall curtain as threshold, the high mist-clouds creating atmosphere, the kitchen carved into rock. The setting's transformation from "frozen in time" to war-thawed frames the dominant stake. Spatial choreography is clear (gate, bridge, terraces, stair, kitchen). The grotto's museum/refuge duality charges the closure choice—staying means inhabiting this liminal space. Present in setup, development (every scene occurs within or references the grotto), and closure (teaching "here" carries the grotto's uncertain fate). High irreplaceability; the waterfall/grotto as both shelter and trap is load-bearing. Strong across all three gates.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Timeframe "after the beekeeper's last visit" is mentioned twice ("It was after the beekeepers last visit, the elders kept reminding me" and "since the beekeepers last visit the bees have not returned") and establishes a before/after marker tied to the flowers setting no seed and festivals losing honeyed smoke. The timeframe signals decline and sets tone but does not tighten a live decision on the page—no countdown or approaching deadline. It frames context (bees gone, scarcity) rather than pressuring tactics. Present in setup and referenced in development; absent from closure. Functional as backstory anchor but replaceable with "since the war began" or similar. Mid-band for contextual work without escalation pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Motivation "to rescue dying arts" is stated early ("my real reason for coming… a private mission to rescue dying arts before they slipped under the tide of necessity") and dramatized through the opera-glass salvage, the observation of lost crafts (beekeeping, festivals, carpentry, music), and the emerald-lens vision of ghostly tools. The motivation is conflicted on the page: the narrator admits it is "more foolish," questions whether recording or mending is "more arrogant," and ultimately transforms the impulse from extraction to transmission (staying to teach). The motive drives the arrival, the lens use, and the closure choice. Present in setup, development (lens scene), and closure (teaching = rescuing by embedding). Strong friction between stated want and final cost (abandoning detachment). High causal and thematic pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Tone "rosewater dread" is established early ("rosewater from the communal basins, but under it lay the sour dread of stone that had seen too many partings") and sustained throughout: the "brittle" air, "afterimage of a world that had already decided to vanish," "thaw and runs back into the waterfall," "wondering which of us history would spare." The tone modulates under pressure—elegiac observation (arrival), embodied unease (kitchen), charged revelation (lens vision), quiet resignation (closure)—without static repetition. Rosewater (beauty, ritual) and dread (loss, dissolution) are layered in nearly every paragraph. The final line's "wondering which of us history would spare" distills the tone perfectly. Present in setup, development, and closure; charges the final image. High coherence and irreplaceability.</comment>
