<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Nari's motivation is concrete and her interiority is character-particular throughout, especially in the pivot where she understands the puzzle as "a loom turned sideways." The decision to sacrifice her tapestry is embodied through the physical act of unweaving and earns the closure cost. Minor issue: the elder's declaration and mother's mourning are told-only backstory rather than dramatized pressure in the present scene. Emotional progression remains credible; no therapy-speak intrudes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with causal escalation at closure. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the third paragraph. The puzzle assembles through motivated beats (trade → assembly → understanding its cost → sacrifice → breath exhaled), and the final image of "distant footsteps turned, as if hearing" lands as Charged Poise with felt cost—the tapestry unmade, the loom "bare and skeletal." One meaningful deepening that narrows options with visible price paid on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The orchard setting constrains Nari's solitude and the puzzle's assembly on "packed earth beside her loom" charges the final sequence. Spatial choreography is clean: bamboo, apples, lantern, loom positions track across moves. The tree sap amber bead recurs with purpose (lips → puzzle corner). Micro-setting (the loom, the puzzle on earth, frost on apples) shapes the tactile ritual of unweaving and feeds the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—carrying a message to Haru—is signaled early and tightens when Nari realizes the puzzle demands the tapestry as payment. The choice to feed the threads is protagonist-driven agency with visible cost: "the loom stood bare and skeletal." One clear reversal (puzzle as loom turned sideways) and a final act that forecloses the prior path. The escalation is textural and causal; the price is unmistakable on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of sacrifice and connection emerges organically through the puzzle-as-loom metaphor and the unweaving act. The final image—"distant footsteps turned, as if hearing"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to whether messages cross impossible distance without stating a moral. The tree sap amber bead and silver threads accumulate meaning across beats and reweight at closure. No thematic echo or moralizing; complexity is held without false balance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Nari; perceptual signature is consistent (solitude, threads, Haru's absence). Diction stays within her lexicon with purposeful elevation ("raveling silence," "stoically sparkling") that reads voice-motivated rather than register drift. No dialogue present; the piece maintains narrative distance and rhythmic control under pressure. Minor slip: "raveling silence spilled from the puzzle" verges on mixed metaphor but remains legible within the tapestry conceit.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and propulsive with high information density. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; no paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. Minor overwriting cluster: "raveling silence," "unraveling tapestry," "raveling silence spilled" recur within a short span and the metaphor vehicle (thread/unravel) is applied to silence, time, and puzzle without always clarifying the vehicle's logic—this risks figurative muddle in a high-pressure beat. Clarity holds but the density of textile metaphor in proximity draws attention to itself.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The puzzle-as-sideways-loom is a fresh synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight and the specific fusion of bamboo orchard, jigsaw fragments, and tapestry sacrifice avoids stock templates. The piece commits fully to its conceit and follows implications without retreat. Minor proximity concern: "threads catching echoes of things not yet happened" and "puzzle as loom turned sideways" lean toward familiar magical-realism devices; the execution is specific enough to transform them.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Nari's choice to trade wool for the puzzle (beat 1), to assemble it by following "the tug in her chest" (beat 2), and to sacrifice her tapestry by unweaving and feeding threads into the puzzle (beat 3) are all causal turns driven by her agency. The final beat—hanging the amber bead and pulling the last thread—closes the arc. Present throughout and essential to closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The bead appears early (Nari presses it to her lips to whisper messages), recurs as a concrete anchor for Haru, and returns at closure when she hangs it on the puzzle's corner as "a small sun setting in cardboard sky." Three distinct beats with evolving function; the final placement charges the image. Slight swappability: another keepsake could serve similar symbolic work, lowering irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Raveling silence" is named early, recurs when it "spilled from the puzzle," and operates as both atmosphere and metaphor for the unweaving/reweaving stakes. It shapes tone and the final moment when "another, fainter rhythm" answers "from a great distance" through that silence. Present in setup and closure; causal role is more atmospheric than tactical, limiting the score despite thematic charge.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Stoically sparkling" modifies the amber bead's trapped bubble. It appears once, mid-story, as descriptive detail. The trait does not constrain or enable an on-page action with cost; it enriches texture but remains ornamental. No development or closure participation beyond the bead's broader role.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Recommence" appears in "to recommence the puzzle's forming she would have to feed the tapestry to it." The word marks the pivot where Nari understands the cost and begins the final sacrifice. The action it names—resuming assembly after understanding the price—drives the climax. Present in one key beat that redefines options; slightly late (past midpoint) and the synonym "continue" or "complete" would function similarly, capping at upper-mid band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The jigsaw puzzle edges are traded for in the market (beat 1), assembled by lantern light (beat 2), understood as "a loom turned sideways" (beat 3), and completed by feeding tapestry threads into gaps (beat 4). The method shapes tactics across the arc and delivers the closure image: "the finished puzzle window" exhales and footsteps turn. Essential and specific.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The forgotten orchard provides solitude that makes "the threads listen," the packed earth beside the loom becomes the workspace for puzzle assembly, and the crooked apple trees among bamboo frame the scene's textural specificity. The setting enables Nari's ritual and the micro-geography (loom, earth, lantern) constrains the physical acts of assembly and unweaving. Present in setup, middle, and closure; tactical role is present but secondary to the puzzle and tapestry.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Through the hush of time's unraveling tapestry" appears early as metaphor and motive. Time pressure is implied by "hours slipped past" and the long arc of ten winters, but no live ticking clock tightens decisions on the page. The timeframe is atmospheric and thematic rather than a tactical constraint that alters moves. Lyric reprise in setup and closure, but mid-scene development is minimal.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Nari's desire to carry a message to Haru drives the weaving for ten years, the puzzle purchase, the assembly ritual, and the final sacrifice. The motivation is dramatized through concrete choices and the friction between wanting connection and the cost of the tapestry is palpable in "she knew...that to recommence the puzzle's forming she would have to feed the tapestry to it." Causal pressure across all beats and closure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Tone of latent sacrifice is established early ("she wove because she could not bear how quickly words dissolved") and builds through "threads never bind without cost," "Latent sacrifice had been woven into every thread already," and the final unweaving that makes sacrifice "plain, a cut that could not be resewn." The tone modulates from wistful patience to acceptance of cost and charges the final image. Coherent and purposeful escalation to closure.</comment>
