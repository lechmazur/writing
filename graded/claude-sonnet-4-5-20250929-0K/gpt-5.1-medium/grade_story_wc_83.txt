<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's internal contradiction—choosing control over preventing harm—is enacted through micro-choices: rerouting power, increasing resolution, nudging the model toward repair. Interiority remains concrete and embodied (the crystal heating against the thigh, the taste of soured lies). The final pivot to "repair instead of ruin" forecasts a path with visible cost (abandoning the mission's logic), though the choice itself happens in the last line, leaving the full consequence off-page. One small slip: the phrase "bleak exhilaration" is explicitly named twice, reducing some of the work to label.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece builds density through iterative reflection on the wedding blast, the geode's physical presence, and the vortex on the screen, culminating in a cadence shift when the narrator redirects the model. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final line crystallizes a choice—"nudge the model toward repair instead of ruin"—with the cost made legible through prior reflection on complicity and the heating geode. Orientation is clear by line three (floating observatory, feeds, survivor identity). One persistent constraint (the vortex over the ruined village) shapes the final tactic. The lens holds; the closure lands with felt cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The floating observatory and its console anchor the setting; the geode crystal functions as micro-setting, heating and humming to constrain perception and charge the final choice. Sensory detail is selective: "feeds spill light across the glass like bleeding constellations," the crystal's "ache like a word trying to remember its own pronunciation." The vortices on the console become tactile through the metaphor "fingerprints left on fogged glass." The observatory's orbital remove mirrors the narrator's moral distance, and the geode's physical warmth grounds the turn. Spatial choreography remains clean; no props teleport.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake: whether to use predictive power to prevent harm or perpetuate it. Pressure accumulates through the vortex's persistence, the geode's heating, and the narrator's reflection on complicity, tightening when the anomaly sharpens around "three coordinates like a triangle of absence." The final beat—rerouting processing power and nudging the model toward repair—narrows options by breaking mission protocol, with the cost (professional defiance, ethical leap) legible on the page. Agency is clear: the narrator's hands move "before my conscience can interrupt." One meaningful deepening under the Accumulative lens is sufficient at this length; the cost is felt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the contrast between "unused potential" as abstraction versus its human particulars: "the girl who wanted to be a pilot, the uncle who baked bread like architecture." The geode, split by the blast and carried in two halves, becomes a charged image of division and incompleteness that the final choice attempts to re-unite conceptually. The ending offers a non-literal answer to "what has already been stolen" by redirecting the hunt inward, reweighting the premise without stating a moral. "Bleak exhilaration" is named twice, which slightly reduces subtext, but the final image—thumb on the geode, eyes closed—resonates without sermonizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and controlled: "survival were anything but a slow detonation," "Names are shrapnel that never works its way out." POV remains stable (single first-person), and psychic distance tightens appropriately under pressure (the final beats compress into physical sensation and choice). The prose reflects the narrator's technical fluency ("perturbation theory," "probability clouds") without register mismatch. One minor slip: "bleak exhilaration is the only honest phrase I have for the feeling" verges on self-commentary, though it recovers by embodying the feeling in subsequent beats. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent (data, physics metaphors, the survivor's scarred lens).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; figurative density is high but mostly coherent ("shadow across the ruined desert like a question mark that never closed," "probability clouds shimmer and tilt"). One mixed metaphor: "wells" as basins of possibility are "hauled up in buckets," but vortices don't map cleanly to liquid extraction—minor incoherence. The piece carries minimal scaffold; information density is strong (most lines do double duty). A run of "I told myself… The truth is… I wanted…" in the middle third uses similar stems, creating brief template cadence (−0.3). The final image is clean and propulsive. No paraphrase loops or filter-verb stacks in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The orbital surveillance frame is familiar, but the combination—wedding survivor operating the system, the geode as physical anchor, "unused potential" as both data artifact and human loss—feels specific and non-obvious. The turn (hunting inward rather than outward) grows from established particulars: the vortex over the village, the geode heating, the narrator's complicity. The emotional calculus (choosing repair over ruin while knowing the cost) avoids the safety middle. Risk: the reflective density could flatten momentum, but the piece earns its mode by anchoring each reflection to present stimuli (the vortex, the crystal, the console). Transformation test: the plot would not survive a generic swap; the geode and the survivor identity are load-bearing.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Present throughout as POV and focalizer. The survivor identity frames the opening, drives reflection on complicity mid-piece, and motivates the final choice to redirect the model. The wedding/blast backstory is not ornamental—it supplies the emotional and ethical pressure that makes the final turn credible. Causally active in at least three beats: the opening anchor, the realization about unused potential pooling under the rubble, and the closing decision. Cost is tied to this character's specific history; another operator would lack the motive. Strong closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Introduced early (wedding table, split by blast). Handled in at least four beats: initial description, "hums faintly… as if remembering gravity," "heats against my thigh, an ache like a word trying to remember," and the final moment ("thumb on the geode"). Each return adds meaning: from inert memento to active constraint (the heating charges the narrator's decision). Causally involved: the physical sensation prompts the realization about the buried half and "unused potential," shaping the final choice. Closure participation is strong (thumb on geode anchors the ending gesture). Irreplaceable: no generic object would carry the wedding/blast link and the split-twin logic. Cost is legible (carrying the wound, the choice to act).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The concept "unfiltered awakening" is named explicitly twice and shapes the narrator's framing of data work: "the bright, terrible joy of seeing the machinery of the world with no filter at all." It drives the middle beat (the exhilaration when models cohere) and charges the final realization (the vortex revealing what was stolen). The awakening is enacted on the page—the narrator sees the system's truth and chooses differently—rather than merely asserted. Setup is clear; closure linkage is moderate (the choice to "nudge the model toward repair" extends the logic of seeing clearly). One friction: the phrase itself is slightly abstract; more embodied pressure would lift the score.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Intangibly tangible" describes the vortices on the console: "like fingerprints left on fogged glass." The attribute is signaled early (middle third) and constrains action—the vortices cannot be dismissed as error, compelling the narrator to increase resolution and follow the anomaly. The paradox (invisible yet present) mirrors the theme of unseen potential. Causally active in one key beat (the vortex's persistence forces the investigation). Closure linkage is indirect (the final choice to investigate the blind spot grows from the vortex, which embodies this attribute). Cost: pursuing the anomaly breaks protocol. Moderate specificity; another descriptor could substitute with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The hunt is the mission ("to find where unused potential pools") and the structural spine. Present from the opening ("I watch the feeds"), developed through the perturbation-theory explanation, enacted when the narrator investigates the vortex, and transformed at closure ("the hunt aims… inward, toward the crater at my own center"). Drives at least three beats: the mission framing, the anomaly investigation, and the final redirection toward repair. The ending inverts the hunt's purpose (from targeting to healing), making it indispensable. Removing "hunt" would collapse the story's logic and stakes. Irreplaceable action; visible cost (professional defiance, ethical pivot).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Perturbation theory" is explained mid-piece ("that polite mathematics of nudging") and shapes the mission's method: "Change one subsidy, one rumor… and watch the probability clouds shimmer." It is dramatized in the final beat: "I… nudge the model toward repair instead of ruin." The method is signaled, its mechanics matter (the narrator uses the same tool for a different end), and it charges the closure by making the choice concrete and tactical. Setup ~40%; middle mention; closure participation strong. Cost: the nudge implies visible risk (mission breach). One friction: the mechanics remain somewhat abstract (we don't see the subsidy or rumor), capping upper range.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The floating observatory is anchored early ("dragged its shadow across the ruined desert") and supplies resources (the console, the feeds, the orbital vantage) that enable the mission and constrain choice (the narrator can see patterns invisible on the ground). The setting's remove mirrors moral distance. Causally active in two beats: the mission framing and the vortex investigation. Closure linkage is moderate (the final choice happens at the console, using observatory tools). Specificity is good (orbital array, quantum market analytics, circuit breakers cooling), though the latter is underused. Removing the observatory would break the story's logic. Cost: operating from orbit is both power and complicity.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The timeframe "while circuit breakers cool" is mentioned in the opening and once more mid-piece ("While the circuit breakers cool from the last simulation surge, I stare…"). It does not tighten decisions or alter tactics—the narrator's investigation proceeds without time pressure. The cooling is atmospheric (suggests a pause) but does not function as a live clock. Setup is present; middle development is minimal (static label); closure participation is absent. Replaceable with "during downtime" or similar. No cost tied to elapsed time.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The motivation "to find where unused potential pools" is stated explicitly and drives the mission, the vortex investigation, and the final pivot. It is conflicted on the page: the narrator admits the mission became complicity ("I wanted to stand at the center of the crosshairs"), then redefines potential as human loss ("the girl who wanted to be a pilot…"), and finally redirects the hunt inward. Causally active in three beats: mission framing, realization, closure choice. Friction between stated aim (predict disruptions) and true motive (control) creates authentic tension. Cost is legible (choosing repair over mission orders). Strong closure linkage; the motivation is transformed rather than resolved.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The tone "bleak exhilaration" is named twice and embodied throughout: the "bright, terrible joy of seeing the machinery," the "ache like a word trying to remember," the paradox of choosing control after surviving a drone strike. The tone modulates appropriately (bleakness in reflection on complicity, exhilaration when data coheres, a charged tension at closure). It charges the final image (eyes closed, thumb on geode, choosing repair—grimly hopeful). Coherent through turns; no tonal whiplash. One friction: explicit naming reduces some subtext, and the balance tips slightly more bleak than exhilarated in the final third. Strong integration overall.</comment>
