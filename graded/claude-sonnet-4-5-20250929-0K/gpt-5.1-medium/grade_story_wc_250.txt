<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The guardian's interiority shows embodied patience and "spiralingly calm" depth, but much is told rather than enacted through micro-choices. The dentist's motivation is clear—guilt lodged "like broken teeth"—and his final phone call earns modest closure, yet the two-year backstory and the woman's off-page suffering dilute present-tense pressure. Internal conflict remains largely serial (guilt → hesitation → action) rather than simultaneous contradictory impulses acting in scene. The shutter-tapping and mirror-tilting gestures are vivid, but the dentist's arc relies heavily on reflective summary rather than on-page struggle that forces trade-offs with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: the guardian's water-light weaving accumulates until the dentist's phone call closes the arc with a Decisive Change (he dials after months of avoidance). The closure lands on the page with felt cost—"heart rattling" and "haltingly" signals the emotional price—and the canal's acceptance of his tremor provides resonant validation. Orientation is swift (cobalt dock, canal, guardian, house, dentist upstairs by paragraph nine). One escalation point (light meets water, dentist responds, call connects) tightens options. Minor causality softness: the guardian's specific water-circle actions feel more metaphoric choreography than a mechanism the dentist could plausibly perceive as reply, though the lens allows this as accumulative pressure rather than strict because/therefore linkage.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The cobalt dock, bruised-glass canal water, and upstairs room with shutters anchor the space cleanly. Sensory detail is vivid—"gleamed like a buried memory," "trembling constellations," "slap of waves"—and reflects the guardian's patient attention. The dental mirror as micro-setting object constrains the dentist's final choice: he tilts it, sees light on the door, and that fragile beam becomes the catalyst for picking up the phone. The guardian's hand in the canal and the dock's wet boards provide tactile grounding. Cap at mid-7s because the broader occupational world (dentistry, canal operations) remains underdeveloped and the house interior is generic beyond the mirror and shutters.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether the dentist will voice his apology—is signaled early and tightens once: the guardian's light-weaving prompts the dentist to shift from aimless shutter-tapping to purposeful pattern, then to the phone call. The reversal is gentle but present: "fear loosened half a notch," shutters "reopen in a new rhythm," and the call connects. Escalation is driven by the guardian's agency (guiding reflections) and the dentist's responsive choice, consistent with the Accumulative lens. Cost is legible—"heart rattling," words "haltingly"—though the woman's off-page pain and the two-year delay keep the present-tense price moderate. No explicit antagonist; pressure is internal and ambient, which fits the situational/accumulative hybrid but limits peak intensity.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The theme—regret softening toward change, silent empathy bridging isolation—emerges through the light-and-water exchange rather than statement. The phrase "teach darkness the value of stars" is poetic yet borders on abstraction; it gains traction when literalized in the scattered constellations on wet boards and the dentist's response. The final image ("the next secret ready to turn toward light") offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture: the guardian's hand-circles, the dentist's mirror tilt, the shutters' hesitant rhythm. Minor slip: "half-spoken secret" recurs as a tag rather than evolving through specifics, and the opening metaphor "buried memory surfacing" feels ornamental. The piece invites reflection on unspeakable guilt and witnessing, avoiding tidy resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The narrative holds third-person limited with a stable omniscient-lyric distance, anchored to the guardian's perception and the dentist's upstairs interiority in clean section-break switches. Voice is literary and metaphor-dense ("spiralingly calm," "bruised glass," "trembling constellations"), which suits the stillwater tone but occasionally drifts into elevated diction that flattens urgency: "acknowledgment without scraping it raw," "braiding with the soft slap of waves." No dialogue appears, so those bullets are moot. Psychic distance is controlled, though the phrase "Everything here moved within the edge of a half-spoken secret" reads as authorial commentary rather than POV-filtered perception. Filter verbs ("felt the shift," "watched the shutters") appear frequently but remain voice-motivated. Perceptual signature is present in the guardian's attuned listening and the dentist's dental-mirror focus, though not maximally distinct.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Rhythm and sensory specificity are strong—"cobalt dock after rain," "dental mirror between his fingers," "flickering crescent moons." Several lines do double duty: "stillwater tension that pressed against ribs and thoughts" fuses setting and emotion. However, paraphrase loops appear: "half-spoken secret" recurs in paragraphs four and fifteen almost verbatim without added pressure. Template cadence: "The guardian [verb]… They [verb]… The dentist [verb]…" runs across multiple paragraphs. Metaphor density is high—"buried memory surfacing," "voice trying to weave itself from shadow," "braiding with the soft slap of waves"—and while individually evocative, the cumulative effect in a 900-word piece (note: count appears to exceed 800) risks overwriting without pattern-teaching. Stock phrase: "heart rattling" is a minor cliché. Propulsion is steady but not urgent; several scaffold sentences ("From that night the guardian's watch turned into silent empathy") summarize rather than advance. Apply −0.6 for paraphrase loop and template cadence, −0.4 for metaphor density in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The guardian-dentist dyad and the water-light communication offer a quiet, non-obvious synthesis of witnessing and guilt. The dental mirror as conduit is specific and purposeful, avoiding stock symbolism. Tone and emotional restraint distinguish the piece from melodramatic confession narratives. However, the core arc—bystander empathy catalyzes a delayed apology—follows a familiar template of moral prodding and redemption. The two-year backstory, off-page victim, and guardian-as-catalyst role feel derivative of "silent helper" archetypes without a bold structural or perspectival risk. The guardian's passivity (watching, guiding reflections) and the dentist's interior loops limit narrative surprise. The ending gesture ("kept walking, alert for the next secret") signals serial episodic work rather than transformation. No close echoes of famous lines, but the piece hedges toward safety middle in both plot and moral calculus.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The silent canal guardian is present throughout, introduced in paragraph two, and their water-circle action in paragraph twenty-three prompts the dentist's mirror tilt and phone call. Setup, development, and payoff gates are met. The guardian's choice to "guide each shimmer" and "nudge reflections" directly enables the dentist's shift from aimless to purposeful shutter patterns, then to dialing. However, the guardian's agency is largely observational and metaphoric choreography rather than a decision with its own visible cost or tradeoff. The guardian "felt the shift" and "rose, joints protesting quietly," but no tactical narrowing or sacrifice tied to their own stake is dramatized. Causal pressure is moderate; the guardian's action is necessary to the dentist's change but does not carry its own distinct price. Two beats (water-circle, final rise) plus closure participation yield mid-band; lack of felt cost for the guardian caps the score.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The dental mirror appears in paragraph twelve ("turning a dental mirror between his fingers"), reappears in paragraphs thirteen and twenty-four when the dentist tilts it to reflect light, and its "narrow beam" becomes the catalyst for the phone call in paragraph twenty-eight. Setup, development, and payoff gates are met. The mirror's specific property—reflecting light—enables the dentist's micro-choice to send a "fragile and brave" circle onto the door, which loosens his fear. This is purposeful and irreplaceable: a generic object would not fit the dentist's profession or supply the light-reflection mechanics. The mirror is handled on the page in at least three beats and directly shapes the closure turn. However, the mirror's role is tactical enabler rather than contested resource with its own cost; the dentist "set the mirror down" without sacrifice or loss tied to the object itself. Strong causal linkage and closure participation, moderate cost connection.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Silent empathy is the conceptual spine: the guardian's listening becomes "a promise" (paragraph nineteen), and the water-light exchange in paragraphs twenty-three to thirty-two embodies wordless acknowledgment. The concept shapes the guardian's tactic (guiding reflections rather than speaking) and the dentist's response (interpreting the patterns as reply). Setup is implicit by paragraph six ("listen to currents and wakefulness"), development occurs in the light-weaving beat, and payoff is the successful call without spoken coaching. However, the concept remains largely thematic rather than a choice-constraining force with visible cost. The guardian's empathy is competent and unconfronted; no moment tests whether silence is sufficient or whether speech might serve better. The dentist's shift from "fear loosened" to dialing is enabled by the empathy but does not dramatize a tradeoff between silence and voice with its own felt price. Present in two beats, causal in one, but cost is oblique.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Spiralingly calm" is introduced in paragraph six as the guardian's trait and echoed in paragraph thirty-six ("sat spiralingly calm"). The phrase is vivid and specific, signaling deep patience "that the water recognized as kin." However, it functions as characterization label rather than a constraint or enabler with on-page cost. No beat dramatizes a moment where the guardian's calm is tested, threatened, or traded off against urgency. The trait supports tone and matches the guardian's observational role, but it does not narrow options or shape a tactical choice. Present in setup and closure, but ornamental—swappable with "patient" or "still" without structural loss. One beat (final sitting) is charged by the attribute but not causally dependent on it. Cap at mid-4s for label-only use without dramatized tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Weave" appears in paragraph eleven ("trying to weave itself from shadow"), paragraph twenty-three ("tracing circles until ripples began to weave the lamplight"), and implicitly in the dentist's and guardian's pattern-making (paragraphs twenty-six, thirty-one). Setup, development, and payoff are met. The guardian's weaving of reflections is the specific action that prompts the dentist's mirror tilt and phone call; the verb's recurrence ties visual pattern-making to communication. The action is irreplaceable: without the guardian's hand-circles and "teaching the darkness the value of stars one glint at a time," the dentist's shift from aimless to purposeful lacks external catalyst. However, "weave" as metaphor is abstract; the mechanics (how water-circles create "trembling constellations") are impressionistic rather than concrete. Two distinct beats plus closure linkage, causal pressure present, but specificity is moderate and cost is indirect.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Creating patterns with shutters is introduced in paragraph ten ("creating patterns with shutters, opening and closing them in hesitant sequences") and recurs in paragraphs twenty and thirty-two when the dentist shifts to "purpose now, slow codes of doubt and wanting to be seen" and finally "the shutters stayed open at last." Setup, development, and payoff gates are met. The method signals the dentist's internal state and provides the guardian with a visible cue to respond to, establishing the wordless exchange. The shutter patterns are necessary to the guardian's recognition that "this was the hour when regret either hardened to stone or softened toward change." However, the method is passive signaling rather than active problem-solving; the dentist's final choice (phone call) does not depend on the shutters' mechanics. Two beats, causal role in one turn (guardian interprets and replies), but the method is swappable with other signaling devices (lights, knocking) without major rewrite. Closure linkage is present (shutters stay open) but summary-only.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The cobalt dock after rain is the story's title phrase and anchors paragraphs one, twenty-five, and forty-one. Setup, lyric reprise, and payoff are met. The dock's wet boards provide the surface for "trembling constellations" (paragraph twenty-five), which the guardian uses to reply to the dentist; without the rain-slicked dock, the light-reflection tactic would lack grounding. The setting also embodies the "stillwater tension" and constrains the guardian's method to water and light rather than speech. However, the dock is backdrop more than active constraint; the story could function on a different waterside location with minor edits. The setting charges the final image ("on the cobalt dock after rain the canal guardian kept walking") and reweights the opening, but does not alter tactics mid-scene. Strong lyric reprise, moderate causal pressure, one beat plus closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Within the edge of a half-spoken secret" appears in paragraphs four and fifteen as a phrase describing the ambient state, not a ticking clock. The timeframe is atmospheric rather than mechanical: "tonight" recurs (paragraphs eight, eighteen, twenty), signaling urgency, but no countdown or deadline tightens the dentist's decision. The two-year backstory establishes duration of avoidance, and "the hour when regret either hardened to stone or softened" (paragraph twenty-one) hints at a tipping point, but the exact temporal pressure remains vague. The guardian's watch is described as ongoing ("unsleeping ear"), and the dentist's nightly routine ("brushing it nightly") implies repeatability rather than unique urgency tonight. Present in setup and mood, but does not constrain tactics or create a live clock that alters moves. Functional as tone, replaceable as timeframe.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"To teach darkness the value of stars" is stated in paragraph eight as the guardian's sharpened purpose "tonight" and literalized in paragraph twenty-five ("teaching the darkness the value of stars one glint at a time"). Setup and development gates are met; the motivation drives the guardian's water-circle action, which is the catalyst for the dentist's shift. The desire is dramatized through the light-weaving beat and is specific to the guardian's role. However, the motivation is poetic abstraction without on-page friction: no moment tests whether teaching (passive, indirect) suffices or whether direct intervention might serve better. The guardian's purpose is competent and unconfronted; the cost is "joints protesting quietly" (paragraph thirty-seven) but not tied to a trade-off the guardian must make. Two beats, causal pressure in one, closure linkage indirect. The motivation is irreplaceable to the guardian's character but lacks internal conflict or visible sacrifice.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stillwater tension is introduced in paragraph three ("a stillwater tension that pressed against ribs and thoughts") and sustained through diction ("silent," "hesitant," "trembling," "fragile," "haltingly") and rhythm (long sentences, layered clauses). The tone modulates subtly: early stillness gives way to the dentist's "heart rattling" (paragraph thirty) and the call's breakthrough ("words came haltingly" yet "crossed the water more surely than boats," paragraph thirty-nine), then returns to the guardian's calm walk (paragraph forty-one). The tone is coherent across turns and charges the final image: the canal's acceptance and the guardian's resumed watch preserve the stillwater frame while admitting the dentist's small rupture. However, the tone is static mood more than dynamic modulation; the piece never risks breaking into overt urgency or loud confrontation, which fits the concept but limits range. Tone shapes all beats and the ending, with purposeful cadence shift at closure.</comment>
