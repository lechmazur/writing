<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lio's trait of wilting near dishonesty provides a distinct perceptual signature and motivates his journey, but the embodied emotion at pivotal beats relies on stock phrasing ("slid under his ribs and caught there," "throat constrict"). Internal contradiction is present—his reverence for honesty versus the city's suppression—but the final choice to step inside reads as discovery rather than a renunciation with visible cost. The piece remains in mid-band because the protagonist's agency at closure is more observational than decisional.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes orientation early (who, where, when) and follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: the map assembly functions as a density increase that reweights the dominant stake (finding lost conversations). The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—Lio steps inside, doors exhale the city's unsaid truths, and the cost is felt as atmospheric pressure rather than paid in a decisive act. The zinc plate's recognition mechanism at the gate provides a subtle causal turn. One meaningful deepening is present, but the final image charges without a visible forfeiture, placing it solidly in the 7s under the inferred lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The greenhouse city's toxic sky, hydroponic streets, and condensation banks are filtered through Lio's craft-specific lens (gold leaf, living vines). The zinc plate fragment and map shreds constrain his choices—he must piece together the map to locate the observatory—and the corroded seal at the observatory gate responds to the postal authority, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is coherent across the studio, corridors, and observatory. Sensory detail (humidity, rust, stale ink) modulates with urgency. The micro-setting (worktable, floorboards, map) and the macro (sealed city, abandoned observatory) both shape tactics and the ending.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding where lost conversations go—is signaled early and tightens through the map assembly and the walk to the observatory. Lio's choice to pack his tools and venture into the sealed space is motivated by prior pressure, but the escalation is accumulative (density increase) rather than a sharp reversal. The ending crystallizes options (he will hear what the city tried not to say) with atmospheric cost, but the cost is felt rather than paid in a visible forfeiture. One meaningful deepening is present under the Accumulative lens; agency is present but leans observational at closure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme (candor, suppressed truth, the weight of unspoken words) emerges organically from Lio's craft, the city's sealed atmosphere, and the map's legend. The final image—doors exhaling "a hush that smelled of stale ink and long-delayed honesty"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without stating a moral. The recurring motif of condensation and breath accumulates pressure and reweights the stake. Subtext operates in gesture (finger snagging, doors unlatching) and implication. The piece resists tidy resolution and invites reflection through purposeful ambiguity. No thematic echo or explain-everything ending.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV distance is stable third-limited; focalization remains with Lio throughout. Perceptual signature is present (he notices honesty cues, humidity, gold-leaf texture) and vocabulary is controlled. The piece uses purposeful compression and lyric phrasing ("roots strong," "wilted near dishonesty") that fit the voice. Free indirect style is clean. No dialogue appears. Register occasionally drifts toward elevated diction ("gilt-edged," "exhalation of a hush") but remains voice-motivated. Psychic distance shifts are intentional. Filter verbs ("realized," "felt") are used sparingly and fit the contemplative tone.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is high; most lines advance character, atmosphere, or plot. However, several paraphrase loops and template cadences appear: "He realized…" / "He felt…" stems recur; "honesty" and "dishonesty" are repeated without added pressure in adjacent lines; "condensation" appears in four beats with diminishing return. Figurative language ("roots strong," "breath on a tongue") is frequent but mostly apt. The final beat is clear and propulsive. Overwriting and scaffold are present but do not obscure causality. Apply −0.6 for paraphrase loops and template stems; the artifacts do not touch the closure beat directly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of calligrapher, sealed city, toxic sky, and lost-conversation vault is specific and non-obvious. The map-assembly sequence and postal-plate mechanism feel organic rather than convenient. The premise (candor as physical sensitivity, words stored in living vines) transforms familiar tropes through grounded world logic. Emotional complexity (reverence for truth versus the city's silence) is present. The ending resists explaining everything and commits to its lyric, atmospheric stance. Risk-taking in the quiet, discovery-focused closure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity (+0.3 within band). No close echoes of famous lines detected.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Lio is present throughout and his choices (rereading commissions, pulling up the board, piecing the map, packing tools, walking to the observatory, pressing the zinc plate) drive all key beats. He is signaled early, shapes at least three distinct beats (discovery, assembly, journey), and his final action (stepping inside) is causally linked to the closure. However, the final beat leans observational—he steps inside to hear rather than making a renunciation or forfeiture—so the cost is atmospheric rather than a visible tradeoff. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage place him above mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The zinc-etched postal plate fragment appears in three distinct beats: discovery under the floorboard, packed as a talisman, and pressed against the corroded seal to unlock the observatory. It is signaled early, used tactically in the middle (packing), and causally active at closure (the lock recognizes postal authority). The fragment's unique property (postal authentication) is irreplaceable. Visible cost is tied to its use: Lio must risk entering the sealed space. Early signal +0.5, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +1.2, specificity +0.6. No significant frictions.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Candor shapes Lio's profession (writing sentences that will not rot) and motivates his journey (the map's promise of lost conversations). It is present by implication in the opening third and explicitly named in "candor in small moments had always mattered more to him than any vault of seeds." However, it does not constrain an on-page choice with visible cost—Lio never faces a dishonesty versus truth trade-off in scene. It operates more as thematic backdrop than tactical stake. Early signal +0.5, beat involvement (map legend, walk) +0.4, thematic linkage +0.3, but no causal pressure or cost connection (−0.5 ornamental use). Caps at mid-band for lack of friction.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Wilts near dishonesty" is established early ("made his hands tremble and the gold leaf crumple") and motivates his general practice, but it does not constrain a single on-page action with cost during the story. The trait is mentioned and shapes his worldview, but no beat shows him reacting to a present lie or facing a trade-off because of this sensitivity. It is functional to his backstory but replaceable in the plot. Early signal +0.4, label-only friction −0.6, no causal pressure or cost connection. Caps at 4.6 for missing middle development gate.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Reread" triggers the discovery: Lio rereads commissions, his finger snags the rough edge, and he pulls up the board to find the map. It is signaled early, causally active in one major beat (inciting discovery), and primes the assembly sequence. However, it does not recur or shape the ending. Early signal +0.5, one distinct beat +0.4, causal pressure (narrows options to investigate) +0.8, specificity (checking gold for evasion ties to his trait) +0.4. No closure linkage (−0.2 for single-beat use). Mid-band for solid setup without payoff reprise.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Piecing together the shredded map is signaled early (discovery under floorboards), executed in a detailed middle beat ("matched humidity stains like puzzle edges"), and directly enables the journey to the observatory. The method is specific (matching stains, following ghostly inks) and irreplaceable—without it, Lio cannot locate the target. Early signal +0.6, two distinct beats (discovery, assembly) +0.9, causal pressure (enables tactics) +1.1, specificity +0.5. No direct closure linkage (the map is not present at the observatory gate; the zinc plate is), so −0.3 for missing final reprise. Strong development score.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The greenhouse city under toxic sky is established immediately and recurs across all major beats: sealed glass corridors, condensation banks, hydroponic streets, dormant irrigation pipes, brittle stems, and the storm drumming on glass. The setting pressures Lio's choices (sealed observatory, corroded lock, dense air) and charges the final image (doors exhaling stale ink, long-delayed honesty). Early signal +0.8, three beats (studio, corridors, observatory) +1.4, causal pressure (toxic sky seals city, seals observatory) +1.3, closure linkage (doors, hush, smell) +1.4, specificity (postal mechanisms, condensation) +0.6. Exceptional integration.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"After the oasis dried" anchors the timeframe as a completed past event that motivates the sealed city. The phrase appears in the opening and is referenced obliquely ("before the oasis dried," "since the sky first turned poisonous"). However, it does not tighten present decisions or create a live clock. Lio's actions unfold over "one evening" and "the storm thickened," but elapsed time does not alter his tactics. Early signal +0.5, thematic linkage +0.3, but no causal pressure on present choices (−0.5). Functional but replaceable timeframe; swappable with "after the disaster" or similar. Caps at mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"To find where lost conversations go" is signaled early (map legend), motivates the map assembly and the walk to the observatory, and is restated at closure ("to hear what the city had tried not to say"). Lio's desire is dramatized through his choices (piecing the map, packing tools, pressing the zinc plate) and carries friction (risking the sealed space, unspoken warnings). Early signal +0.7, three beats (map reading, journey, gate) +1.4, causal pressure (drives all middle choices) +1.2, closure linkage (he steps inside to fulfill it) +1.3, cost connection (atmospheric risk, door exhaling unsaid things) +0.5. Strong integration across all gates.</comment>
