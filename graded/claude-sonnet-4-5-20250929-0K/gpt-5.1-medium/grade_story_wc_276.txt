<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The fisher's interior life is embodied through his gift (transliterating emotions), and his final choice—refusing to transliterate the goddess's echo—emerges from contradictory impulses acted on the page. The renunciation forecloses the path of always reading others' tides and carries visible cost: he dissolves the question unsaid. Minor slip: the grandmother's whispered technique and his history as "the man who transliterates emotions" are told rather than shown constraining earlier beats, keeping this just shy of 8+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure is an Earned Stasis: the fisher refuses to transliterate the echo and lets the question dissolve, forecloing the path of external answers with visible cost (the waves move again in new, broken rhythms). The accumulative lens holds: density builds through layered imagery (sound garden, constellations, rail spike memory) to a decisive moment of refusal. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive by the second paragraph. One micro slip: the mechanics of how "voicing silence" locks the waves mid-surge leans abstract, but the cost at closure remains legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The sound wave garden constrains movement (zigzag navigation, pitch bends by angle) and the rail spike's tactile history (rust-dark, cold iron remembering rails) charges the voicing-silence beat. The body under pressure is vivid: lungs ache, salt taste, searing shapes across inner sight. The frozen droplets "like notes on a staff" and the final "broken rhythms" tie setting to closure. Sensory hierarchy tilts toward auditory/tactile as befits the fisher's gift, and spatial choreography (bow, skiff advance, throat of the garden) tracks cleanly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (catching the echo to ask one unanswerable question) is signaled early and tightens when the echo arrives as grief and crowding prayers. The peak choice—refusing to transliterate and letting the question dissolve—is driven by protagonist agency and forecloses the path of demanding answers, with visible cost in the new rhythms. One reversal/deepening when the kneeling goddess offers only reflection, forcing him to see his own stitched-from-tides life. Pressure accumulates under the textural lens and narrows to a crystallized stance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme (the cost of always translating others' pain, the choice to hold one's own raw feeling intact) emerges through particulars: the fisher's gift, the rail spike's history of pinning certainty, the goddess's empty hands. The ending offers a non-literal answer—he refuses to transliterate the last emotion, and the world makes its own song—without stating a moral. The kneeling figure's blank face and the reflection in her hands deepen the question of why gods maim their creations into a personal reckoning. Subtext operates in the "taste of salt," the "impossible grief," and the waves' broken rhythms.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: the fisher reads widow's silence as currents, sailor's laugh as wind; his interiority filters everything through transliteration metaphors (emotions into measures, joy into weather). Diction is controlled and lyric ("frothing in mute patterns," "sleepwalking constellations shuffling their stars") with purposeful compression that fits the accumulative lens. Psychic distance tightens at peak stress (searing shapes, crowding prayers) without losing coherence. Minor artifact: "the not-knowing tugged at him more sharply than hunger" leans slightly expository but stays character-voiced.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High information density: nearly every line advances atmosphere, mythology, or internal state. Rhythm varies (short declaratives at the voicing-silence beat, longer accumulative flows in the garden description) and no paraphrase loops appear. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent ("constellations shuffling their stars like hands fumbling through dark pockets"). One friction: "the echo of a goddess" and "the goddess's echo" appear in consecutive early paragraphs, a mild synonym cycle. Minor overwriting in "bright, searing shapes that skittered across his inner sight"—three modifiers in peak beat—but it does not obscure causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of soundscape-as-setting, emotional transliteration as gift, and the refusal-as-closure feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The rail spike (object from drowned certainty used to voice silence) and the goddess's kneeling figure (offering reflection, not answer) avoid stock myth tropes. Risk-taking in the lyric accumulation and the quiet ending (he dissolves the question, waves sing in broken rhythms) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The ending transforms the premise: instead of bending the world for an answer, he lets it make its own song.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The cool-headed fisher appears in setup (first line), drives the zigzag navigation and the voicing-silence action in development, and makes the key choice at closure (refusing to transliterate, dissolving the question). His calm under pressure (cool-headed even as constellations tangle) enables the final renunciation. The attribute is causally active across all three beats and the closure would fail without his specific restraint.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The rail spike is introduced early (lodged in the bow, hammered with bare hands), used at the peak beat (takes it in both hands, pours the un-spoken word into it, ring of hush spreads), and burns in his grip during the goddess's reflection, urging him to choose. Its history (pinned iron to earth, calendars to certainty) charges the voicing-silence mechanics and the final choice. Three distinct beats; the cost is tied to its weight of departed certainty.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Sleepwalking constellations appear in setup (drifting out of alignment, shuffling stars) and signal the timeframe when patterns break. They form a spiral at the throat of the garden, marking arrival. The concept shapes setting atmosphere and timing but does not directly constrain a choice or alter tactics; the fisher uses their alignment to know he's reached the right place, not to solve a problem. Lyric reprise (spiral around dark center) reweights the moment but lacks causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Transliterates emotions is established in setup (known in harbor towns, turns grief into measures, joy into weather), enables the middle beat (his gift stirs, transliterating the echo into searing shapes without consent), and the final choice hinges on refusing to transliterate the last raw feeling. The trait constrains (he cannot stop the automatic transliteration of the echo) and the renunciation forecloses his usual path. Visible cost: the waves break into new rhythms only after he forces the gift to stillness.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Zigzag navigation appears in setup and development (skiff advances in careful zigzag, cutting across chords, each angle bends the pitch). It demonstrates the fisher's method and cool-headedness but the major turn (reaching the throat, voicing silence, refusing to ask) does not trace directly to the zigzag action. The action could be swapped for another navigation method (e.g., spiral approach) with minor edits. Functional but not indispensable to closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>By voicing silence is seeded in setup (grandmother's whispered technique), enacted in development (inhales, shapes un-spoken breath into soundless word, pours it into the rail spike, ring of hush spreads, garden stops moving), and directly enables the echo's arrival and the final choice. The mechanics matter: the silence locks the waves, creating the space where the echo can emerge. Removing this method would break the closure logic; no generic "casting a net" would work. All three gates; high causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Sound wave garden is introduced in setup (water rises and falls in rippling chords, each crest hisses a note), constrains the zigzag navigation in development (cutting across chords, pitch bends by angle), and the throat of the garden is where the voicing-silence occurs. The setting pressures movement and timing (waves rise higher at the throat, break without sound) and the final image (waves move again in new, broken rhythms) depends on the garden's transformation. Essential to closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>When patterns break themselves is signaled in setup (tonight was the hour) and marks the window when an echo can be caught without tearing the world. The timeframe tightens the decision (this is the only time) and the constellations' sleepwalking confirms it. However, no on-page clock or countdown pressures tactics during the middle beats; the time constraint is established but not dramatized as urgency. The closure hinges on the fisher's choice, not time running out. Two gates (setup, thematic link to patterns breaking); missing live pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>To catch the echo of a goddess is the dominant stake, signaled in setup (he fished for sound, to catch the echo; people said whoever caught it could ask one unanswerable question). The motivation drives the journey to the throat of the garden and the voicing-silence action. The friction between the desire (to ask) and the cost (seeing his own life stitched from others' tides) is dramatized at closure when he dissolves the question unsaid. The not-knowing tugs at him, and the refusal forecloses that want with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Feral lullaby tone is established in setup (notes slither in wary, half-wild harmony, tone slipping into feral lullaby) and modulates with pressure (mute patterns, tremor softer than breath, impossible grief). The tone charges the final image (new, broken rhythms turning into their own song) and coheres through the lyric accumulation. The blend of lullaby (soothing) and feral (untamed) matches the goddess's echo and the fisher's renunciation. Consistent and purposeful; not quite indispensable but strongly integrated.</comment>
