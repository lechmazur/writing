<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The musician's motivation to unravel the ghost's code is clear and sustained, with embodied tension in humming intervals and tracing marks. However, interiority relies heavily on abstract musical metaphors ("standing inside someone else's pulse") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final choice to "accept the score" feels declarative rather than earned through visible internal conflict with cost. Backstory about the maestro and regime is extensive but remains anchored to present stimuli through the program.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening lines; the drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with density building through water imagery and musical notation discoveries. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the musician bows and raises his instrument, crystallizing his acceptance of the ghost's rebellion with the cost felt in "wordless conversation they would play together." The tightening occurs through progressive revelation of the hidden score's subversive nature, reweighting the dominant stake from curiosity to complicity. One meaningful deepening is present and legible under the lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The flooded opera house with flickering lanterns provides vivid, purposeful atmosphere through selective detail (peeling gilt, crystal prisms, warped staff lines). Spatial choreography remains clear as the musician wades toward the podium. The water functions as micro-setting, constraining movement and transforming the program into the score, directly enabling the climactic discovery. The antique program as recurring object charges the final image when combined with the raised instrument, satisfying the 9+ gate requirement.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—unraveling the ghost's coded rebellion—is signaled early and escalates through accumulative discovery: faces in stains, then blot-notes, then the realization about gaps and silence. The musician's agency is present in choosing to trace, hum, and finally accept the score with visible cost: complicity in a banned work's mutiny. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful tightening occurs when he realizes "the code was not only in the markings, but in the pauses," reweighting his understanding and narrowing his path to acceptance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the interplay of hidden resistance, silence as refusal, and complicity across time. The final image—raising the instrument to play the ghost's rebellion—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of artistic resistance without stating a moral. Subtext operates effectively in "mutiny bloom inside silence" and the physicalized relationship between water damage and coded music. The piece resists easy resolution, maintaining complexity in the protagonist's choice to honor what is absent.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-person limited with consistent perceptual signature: the musician filters everything through musical terminology ("dissonant," "unresolved chords," "intervals"). Diction stays within the character's professional lexicon throughout. Psychic distance modulates purposefully, tightening during the program examination. No head-hopping; free indirect style is clean. The prose voice carries distinct texture with musical cadence, though some figurative language borders on elevation ("patient tide," "drowned sun") without breaking credibility.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with strong propulsion through most beats. Information density is high, with sentences advancing discovery and atmosphere simultaneously. However, metaphorical language saturates several passages without pattern-teaching: "pale, swollen leaf," "planets around a drowned sun," "trapdoor," creating density that occasionally slows momentum in the middle third. A minor paraphrase loop appears when describing the phrase's dissonance ("crooked, dissonant" / "snag on silence rather than flow"). Stock metaphors like "patient tide" and "sunken cathedral" are present but don't obscure causality. No artifacts touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of flooded architecture, water-damaged musical notation, and political subtext feels specific and non-obvious. The frame of reading rebellion through literal water damage transforming into musical code offers fresh integration. Risk-taking in the quiet, accumulative structure pays off without obscuring clarity. The emotional core—choosing complicity with a ghost's resistance—avoids generic templates through the specificity of musical mechanics and the flood's double function as destroyer and revealer.</comment>
