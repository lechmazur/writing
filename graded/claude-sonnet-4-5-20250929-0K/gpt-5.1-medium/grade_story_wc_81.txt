<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to trace honest origins is embodied through concrete actions—opening ledgers, breaking kelp-thread ribbons, tracing gaps in the stacks. Her internal contradiction between institutional loyalty and truth-seeking creates genuine pressure, culminating in the resolve to "follow the gaps like tunnels" with visible cost (defying council divers, risking her indexer role). The perceptual signature is strong—"read spines the way other people read faces"—and her micro-choices (carrying the stamp as compass, breaking the ribbon) reveal hierarchy of values. Minor weakness: the "dappled resolve" moment reads slightly abstract rather than fully embodied in contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors cleanly: Mara, forgotten library, sunken city, blackout established by ~100 words. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the blackout creates "reclaimed stillness" that allows secrets to surface, pressure accrues through gap-tracing, and closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—Mara discovers the hidden folio, testimonies unfurl, "unapproved yet unmistakably true." The final image reweights her years of indexing with conceptual cost (institutional complicity now undeniable). One meaningful deepening occurs when she moves from suspicion to physical proof. Cost is legible: she crosses from archivist to dissident. Lens holds throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Setting is integral: the blackout removes watchers ("no watchers peering through the observation dome"), enabling Mara's investigation. Concrete details—brass lantern, swollen ledger pages, kelp-thread ribbon, mineral-stained aisle—are woven through action. The library's "breathing darkness" and "papery hush" modulate with the blackout's pressure. Spatial choreography is clean (desk, stacks, narrow aisle, mis-shelved folio). The stamp as micro-object constrains choice (she carries it "as if it were a compass"). The folio's physical state (ribbon seal, faint stamp outline, margin dates) charges the closure image. Meets the Q3 9+ gate: environment and object constrain choice and charge the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—tracing honest origins of what was missing—is signaled early and tightens when Mara discovers the hidden folio. Escalation reads under Accumulative lens: the blackout's stillness → nagging question → moving through gaps → breaking the ribbon → testimonies revealed. Agency is clear: her decision to "follow the gaps" and break the seal forecloses her complicit passivity with felt cost (council dismissal recalled, sedation vs. peace). One meaningful deepening (suspicion to proof) narrows options. The price is conceptual and relational: institutional trust shattered, her role redefined. Meets escalation test for this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme—what stories are curated, who controls memory, the gap between official narrative and suppressed truth—emerges through concrete particulars: missing hillside pamphlets, empty author sequences, the crude stamp imitation, handwritten testimonies. "Gaps spoke louder than surviving spines" operates as image, not thesis. The final folio discovery offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing: "unapproved yet unmistakably true" reweights the library-as-ark myth with undeniable conceptual cost. The stamp motif recurs with purpose (truth of arrival, then forged arrival, then absence of acknowledgment). No thematic echo or sermon. Meets Q5 9+ test.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited throughout, with a distinct perceptual signature: "read spines the way other people read faces," "papery hush," "dappled resolve." Diction is controlled and specific to Mara's indexer sensibility ("registration desk," "acquisitions," "catalog in her head"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully—close during lantern-holding, wider for civic context. No head-hopping. One brief elision (which stories were unrecorded) is functional and paid off when the folio reveals the answer. Rhythmic control is strong; syntax compresses under pressure ("Here, at last") without losing clarity. Voice remains coherent. Meets the perceptual-signature and rhythm tests for 9+ eligibility.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Sentence openings vary; rhythm modulates with scene pressure. Information density is high—most lines do multi-job work (e.g., "swollen book of acquisitions from a century before the flood" anchors time, object, and decay). No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Minor density slip: "the library exhaled a faint, papery hush, not quite its usual breathing, more like the pause before confession" stacks three metaphoric vehicles without full coherence (exhale/hush/pause/confession). A second mild overwrite: "dappled resolve" in a high-pressure beat feels elevated beyond POV lexicon. Deduct −0.6 for two distinct density issues per the tightened overwriting check. Otherwise clean and propulsive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The premise—forgotten library in sunken city, indexer discovers suppressed histories during blackout—synthesizes familiar elements (underwater dystopia, hidden archive, institutional cover-up) but transforms them through specific indexer POV and the stamp motif. The blackout as "reclaimed stillness" that lets secrets surface is a fresh angle. Emotional arc (complicit archivist → dissident witness) feels earned. Minor deduction: the "floodmakers" and "hillside families" dynamics echo template narratives of suppressed testimony without a fully unique moral calculus. The folio's kelp-thread seal and crude imitation stamp add specificity. Transformation test: plot would lose coherence with generic swaps. Solid but not exceptional originality.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara (logical page indexer) drives key beats: opens ledger, floats alternative hypothesis to council, resolves to follow gaps, carries stamp as compass, breaks ribbon, discovers folio. Her indexer logic enables the gap-tracing method and the recognition of the mis-shelved folio. Present in setup, middle choices, and closure. Causal pressure: her decision to investigate during blackout creates the discovery. Cost: crosses from archivist to dissident. Meets all three gates and shows strong causal work.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Stamp appears in three beats: Mara finds it at desk ("told the truth of arrival"), notes it feels colder during blackout, carries it "as if it were a compass" through stacks, then recognizes crude imitation in folio ("date space left eternally blank"). Setup clear, mid-scene use functional (compass metaphor), closure linkage present (imitation stamp reveals forgery). Moderate causal pressure: guides her physically and primes recognition. Not indispensable—investigation could proceed without it—but adds thematic charge (official vs. unofficial record). Scores in 7.0–8.4 neighborhood; call it 6.8 for replaceability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Reclaimed stillness" is introduced early ("reclaimed stillness flooded the aisles"), shapes the inciting condition (blackout removes hum, allows secrets to surface), and reappears implicitly in the "patient silence" that enables discovery. It constrains tactics: without watchers, Mara can investigate freely. Closure linkage is indirect—the stillness is the enabling condition, not the final image. Meets setup and middle-development gates; payoff is structural rather than explicit. Scores in 5.0–6.9 band for one-key-turn work; 5.9 fits.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Tranquilly perceptive" is introduced early ("tranquilly perceptive woman who read spines the way other people read faces") and enables her to notice the library's changed breathing, recognize gaps in sequences, and spot the mis-shelved folio. It constrains her method (observation over confrontation) and charges her resolve moment. Present in setup and middle beats; implicit in closure (perception yields discovery). No explicit cost tied to the trait itself. Functional across beats but not indispensable—another investigator trait could serve. Scores ~6.2.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Readjust" appears once: "let her eyes readjust to the layered darkness between shelves." It enables her to navigate without electric light but does not drive a major turn or constrain later choices. Setup only; no middle development or closure participation. Easily swappable with "adapted," "adjusted," or "waited." Present but ornamental. Caps at 4.6 for missing middle/closure gates; slight lift for sensory anchoring yields 5.4.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Alternative hypothesis" is signaled early (Mara "floated the idea... to the city council divers"), shapes her middle resolve ("follow the gaps like tunnels, trace the honest origins"), and is confirmed at closure (folio testimonies prove the hypothesis correct: library was curated to favor floodmakers). Causal pressure: hypothesis drives investigation method. Cost: council dismissed her, she proceeds anyway. Meets all three gates and ties to closure proof. Scores in 7.0–8.4 band; 7.1 fits for solid integration.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Setting (forgotten library inside sunken city during blackout) is introduced immediately, pressures every beat: water holds still, observation dome watchers absent, emergency buoys failed, stacks guide navigation, narrow aisle yields folio. Micro-setting elements (desk, stacks, mineral-stained aisle) constrain movement and enable discovery. Setup, middle, and closure all occur within and depend on this setting. Indispensable: remove the underwater library and the story collapses. High causal pressure, closure linkage, irreplaceability. Scores ≥8.5 eligible; 8.3 for very strong integration.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Blackout timeframe is introduced in opening line, tightens decisions (no watchers, no electric veins, emergency lights failed), and persists through closure ("Tonight, though... without the ordinary buzz"). It enables Mara's investigation by removing surveillance and hum, creating the "reclaimed stillness." Present in setup, middle pressure (she feels "dappled resolve... with no watchers"), and implicit in closure (discovery happens because blackout allowed it). Specific cost: investigation possible only now. Scores in 7.0–8.4 band for essential timeframe work; 7.6 fits.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Motivation ("to trace honest origins") is introduced early ("motivated by one quiet task"), dramatized through actions (opening ledger, tracing gaps, breaking ribbon), and conflicted (council dismissal vs. her resolve, peaceful sedation vs. truth). It drives the investigation and is fulfilled at closure (folio reveals "honest origins she had sought"). Cost: institutional defiance, role redefined. Friction between want (truth) and social cost (council rejection) is on the page. Meets all gates with strong causal pressure and closure linkage. Scores ≥8.5 eligible; 8.1 for very strong integration.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Dappled resolve" appears once in a key moment ("she felt the dappled resolve that always surprised her"). Tone is coherent—quiet determination, scholarly focus modulating to defiant clarity—and charges the investigative beats. It does not explicitly modulate at closure, where tone shifts to revelation ("unapproved yet unmistakably true"). Setup present, implicit in middle pressure, partial closure charge. Not indispensable but adds tonal specificity. Scores ~6.4 for one-turn shaping without full closure integration.</comment>
