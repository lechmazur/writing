<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The dye master's motivation is clear and specific—he wants to understand story magnetism—and his new heart provides embodied internal conflict ("quietly explosive...testing how much wonder the ribs could hold"). The three patrons offer distinct voices and micro-portraits that reveal character through compressed particulars. However, the protagonist remains largely observational; his realization in the penultimate paragraph is told rather than enacted through a difficult choice with visible cost, and the final bow reads as acceptance rather than a decision that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who, where, and when within the opening lines; the drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural, with density increasing through the three patron encounters and a cadence shift in the wing-reveal beat. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (the realization "they were not magnets for stories but mirrors for longing") that reweights the protagonist's quest, and the final image—bowing as "strangers becoming luminous"—charges prior material. Cost is conceptual and felt (the protagonist's earlier framework is dismantled), though the price could be more visceral; the ending reweights but does not foreclose a live option with on-page consequence, keeping it shy of 8+.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The floating tea house, braided prayers, valley mist, and cliff-edge ledge create a vivid, purposeful micro-setting filtered through the dye master's professional eye ("watching colors steep"). The blue morpho wing functions as a charged object that constrains the final turn: holding it up through dusk light becomes the vehicle for the protagonist's insight, and its "delicate weight" tilts the tea house, making the environment respond to thematic pressure. Sensory details are selective and voice-appropriate, avoiding catalog; the setting subtly guides the protagonist's perception and the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—learning why some people magnetize stories—is signaled early and governs all three encounters. Pressure accumulates through the patron confessions, each one adding weight ("the sense of quietly explosive pressure swelled behind his ribs"), and the wing-reveal beat deepens understanding by reframing magnetism as mirroring. The protagonist's agency is primarily perceptual rather than decisional; he observes and realizes but does not make a choice that narrows options or incurs visible cost. One meaningful tightening occurs (the final realization), sufficient for this length under an Accumulative lens, but the lack of a costly trade-off or foreclosed path keeps it mid-7s.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—the magnetism of stories and the nature of witnessing—emerges through concrete particulars: bandaged throat, migrating secrets, balloon-like tales, and the morpho wing's refusal to separate colors. The final image ("mirrors for longing...less broken, more legible") reweights the central question without stating a moral, and the protagonist's realization feels earned by the accumulation of patron portraits. Subtext operates in gesture and image (the wing "leaning toward...like a compass needle"), and the quiet ending resonates without sermonizing. No thematic echo or label-speak mars the closure, and the piece invites reflection beyond plot.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV remains stable in close third, and the dye master's perceptual signature—tracking light, steeping colors, watching for "first unfurling"—is consistent and voice-specific. Dialogue is minimal but purposeful, with the ink-fingered woman's mouthed response and the courier's fatalistic aside carrying subtext. However, elevated diction pervades high-pressure beats ("iridescent caution rippled," "glancing radiance," "riverwater through dye"), creating register drift that pulls away from embodied urgency; the prose remains lyric-literary even when pressure should compress. Figurative density is high throughout without a taught pattern that pays off, and the final lines ("borrowed heart kept time with strangers becoming luminous") edge into abstraction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is generally high, with many lines doing double duty (setting, character, theme). Clarity is strong in spatial choreography and sequence. However, metaphoric density appears in most sentences ("folded blue morpho wing remembering how to fly," "like mica," "metal filings to lodestone," "blade of dusk," "riverwater through dye") without sufficient breathing room or pattern-teaching, creating cumulative overwriting (−0.5). Several lines loop conceptually: "stories gathered...drawn by altitude, heat, and silence" and "stories arrive already half written" cover similar ground; "quietly explosive" and "iridescent caution" are restated rather than advanced (−0.3 for paraphrase). Stock metaphors ("testing how much wonder the ribs could hold") and filter-verb stacks in reflective passages dull immediacy in a few beats. These issues do not obscure causality but reduce propulsion and cap the score at mid-6s.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of transplant-as-perception-shift, occupational detail (dye tracking light trails), and the morpho wing as inheritance is specific and non-obvious. The floating tea house and the three patron micro-portraits avoid stock templates, and the final turn (magnetism reframed as mirroring) feels earned in hindsight. However, the "new heart = new perspective" premise is a familiar metaphor in literary fiction, and the story does not fully transform it through lived complication or moral calculus; the protagonist's realization is observational rather than tested by cost. The particulars are fresh, but the emotional arc could apply to other catalysts with minor edits, limiting irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The watchful dye master is present throughout and his observation drives the structure (three patron encounters, wing reveal). His watching "the way he watched colors steep" and the decision to hold up the wing create two beats. However, his choices do not alter tactics or foreclose options; the realization happens to him rather than through a difficult decision with cost. He observes and concludes but does not act under pressure in a way that changes the outcome. Setup and development gates are met; closure participation is passive (he "saw" and "bowed"), limiting the score to mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The blue morpho wing appears in the donor-papers beat, is carried at the belt for courage (embodied presence), and is unhooked and turned through dusk light in the closure sequence, where its shimmer "leaned toward the three patrons" and its "delicate weight" tilts the tea house. Three distinct beats, early signal, closure linkage, and causal pressure (the wing's behavior triggers the protagonist's insight) push this into the 7+ range. Its irreplaceability is high: removing it would break the lepidopterist backstory and the final turn. Cost connection is conceptual (the protagonist's framework shifts), keeping it shy of 8.5.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Iridescent caution is mentioned once as a label ("a kind of iridescent caution rippled across his thoughts") but does not constrain choices or tactics on the page. It echoes thematically in the protagonist's careful observation but is not dramatized as a trade-off or tension. Setup gate is met (first third); middle development and closure participation are absent. The concept is ornamental, swappable with "hesitation" or "wariness" without structural impact. Late mention and label-only use cap the score at ~4.2.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Quietly explosive appears twice: as a descriptor of the new heart's beats ("quietly explosive, as if testing how much wonder the ribs could hold") and later as swelling pressure behind the ribs during the patron confessions. It shapes the protagonist's receptivity and primes the final realization but does not constrain an on-page action with visible cost. Setup and development gates are met; closure participation is thematic rather than causal. The trait could be replaced with "intense" or "overwhelming" with minor edits, limiting irreplaceability. Lyric reprise without middle choice caps the score at mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Illuminate appears in backstory ("learned to illuminate fabric by tracking sun trails") and is applied metaphorically ("tried the same with people, turning questions this way and that to catch their glimmers") and literally (turning the wing through dusk light to reveal shimmer). Three beats, early signal, and closure linkage are present. The action enables the final insight (the wing's shimmer triggers the realization), meeting causal pressure. However, the mechanics are passive (observation rather than effortful technique under constraint) and the protagonist does not face a trade-off in choosing to illuminate. All three gates met, causal role present, but limited cost keeps it at ~6.1.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Tracking sun trails is introduced in backstory ("twist the cloth until the last slant of light caught hidden particles") and echoed when the protagonist turns the wing through dusk light ("scraped past the mountain, a thin blade of dusk"). Two beats; setup and closure gates met. The method's mechanics matter (angling through light reveals hidden color), and the wing-reveal applies the same technique. However, the method is not tested under pressure or chosen over an alternative; it simply recurs. Lyric reprise with closure linkage but no middle constraint or cost caps the score at ~5.9.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The floating rock tea house is anchored early (tethered by braided prayers, drifting low, settled on a ledge) and returns in the final beat ("the tea house seemed to tilt around [the wing's] delicate weight"). It provides spatial pressure (altitude, hush, intimacy) that draws the three patrons and frames the protagonist's observation. Three beats (opening, mid-scene "settled for the night," closure tilt), early signal, and closure participation are present. The setting constrains choice by isolating the group and charging the final image (the tilt), meeting causal pressure. Cost is conceptual (the protagonist's framework shifts in this space), keeping it shy of 8+.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The timeframe—first evening after receiving the donor heart—is anchored in the fourth paragraph and governs the protagonist's heightened perception throughout ("every sound seemed underlined," "new rhythm...kept tripping"). The donor-heart backstory primes the protagonist's quest and the morpho wing. Two beats (setup, donor-papers reveal) and thematic presence at closure (the "borrowed heart kept time"). Setup and development gates met; closure participation is thematic rather than causal. The timeframe enables the protagonist's state but does not tighten decisions or create a live clock. Lyric coherence with early signal and closure reprise lands at ~6.3.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The motivation—to learn why some people magnetize stories—is stated early ("one quiet reason") and governs all three patron encounters and the final realization. It shapes the protagonist's questions and his choice to hold up the wing, meeting causal pressure. Three beats (stated goal, applied in questioning, answered at closure); setup, development, and closure gates met. However, the desire is not conflicted or tested; the protagonist pursues it without friction or cost until the answer arrives. The friction between want and method is minimal (observation, not sacrifice), capping the score at mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Valley-mist wonder is anchored early ("seeped through the open slats, curling around kettles") and recurs in mid-scene ("mist pooled in hollows") and at closure ("valley mist rose to meet them, pale tendrils pressing against the slats like listeners without ears"). The tone is coherent and modulates with pressure: lyric and unhurried in setup, denser during patron confessions, expansive and charged in the final image. Three beats, setup and closure gates met, and tone charges the ending by framing the protagonist's realization in the mist's presence. The tone is indispensable to the story's texture and final effect, meeting high irreplaceability.</comment>
