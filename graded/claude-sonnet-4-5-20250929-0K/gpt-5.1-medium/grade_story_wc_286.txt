<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The potter's interior life is rendered through craft-specific perceptual filters ("vessels shaped in anger rang differently when tapped") and embodied choices under pressure. His micro-decisions—placing clay and seed, circling the oasis—constrain later options and earn the final stance of "gently, sharply" without therapy-speak. Internal contradiction appears in "no self-loathing, only a sharp gentleness" toward alternate selves, showing simultaneous impulses. The ending's Earned Stasis forecloses harsher paths with visible cost (the wasteland beyond might never change) while the potter commits to local kindness.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (potter, oasis, dusk) land cleanly in the opening. The piece accumulates pressure through layered observations of fractured timelines, building density via the lantern-glass revelations until the final act—placing clay and seeds at each hive—reweights the dominant stake (understanding resistance to change) with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). Cost is legible: "this circle of stubborn life would, in some timeline, swarm again" crystallizes the conditional future and the potter's acceptance of uncertainty. One persistent constraint (water scarcity, mentioned in "water itself was rarer than sleep") subtly shapes the gesture's weight.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The oasis setting constrains the potter's movement (circling the perimeter, kneeling on grit) and charges the final image through具体 details: cracked hives, dry well, hairline sprouts "phototropic to kindness." Sensory hierarchy reflects the potter's craft attention (shadows marking hours, grit grinding knees). The abandoned beekeeping infrastructure—hive frames, empty boxes—functions as micro-setting that the potter physically manipulates, and the sprouts' emergence at closure directly ties environment to the enacted choice. Body and tool (lantern glass, clay) ground the speculative premise in tactile action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("why some places resist change") is signaled in paragraph four and tightened through the glass-revealed double-images showing branching outcomes. The potter's agency—placing clay and seeds at each hive—forecloses passivity with visible cost: he commits local effort knowing "the wasteland beyond might never change." The tightening is driven by protagonist choice under the inferred Accumulative lens, and the cost (accepting conditional success, enduring uncertainty) is unmistakable in "fragile yet enduring, and he walked on, gently, sharply, into whatever version of tomorrow awaited." One reversal: seeing his own small cruelty (swatting a bee) pivot an entire timeline toward salt crust.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme (small kindnesses tip outcomes) emerges organically from the potter's craft metaphor ("clay remembered pressure") and the fractured-timeline imagery without thesis statements. The recurring motif of "phototropic to kindness" operates concretely: sprouts lean toward his hands, timelines bend toward gentle gestures. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—the oasis "would, in some timeline, swarm again"—that reweights prior material (the glass visions, the seed-planting) without moralizing. "Sharp gentleness" fuses opposites in a way that charges the final image and resists tidy resolution, honoring ambiguity (the wasteland's indifference persists).</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable, filtering all perception through the potter's craft lexicon ("turning wheel," "cooling clay," "kiln warming"). Perceptual signature is consistent: he notices shadows marking hours, grit texture, the thrum of absent bees. Psychic distance modulates purposefully—close in the climactic planting sequence, slightly withdrawn in the final reflective beat. Diction occasionally elevates ("phototropic," "embroidered the cracked earth") but remains within a literate artisan's register. Minor slip: "almost phototropic to kindness" in paragraph 19 feels slightly explanatory, nudging subtext toward statement, though the image itself earns the idea.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Information density is high: most lines advance image, character stance, or thematic accumulation. Rhythm varies effectively, with longer contemplative sentences giving way to shorter declaratives in the planting sequence. Two minor issues prevent higher scoring: "by following sun patterns" repeats across paragraphs 8 and 14 without added pressure (paraphrase loop, −0.2), and "fractured timelines" is named three times in close succession (paragraphs 9–10) where once would suffice (template cadence, −0.3). No loops touch the closure beat, so non-closure cap applies. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and reweight the oasis image cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of pottery craft, multiverse-adjacent timelines, and apiary restoration feels specific and non-obvious; the premise transforms familiar "butterfly effect" territory through the potter's embodied practice (circling like a wheel, clay as memory). The phototropic-to-kindness conceit risks abstraction but is grounded in on-page micro-actions (water dish, seed placement) whose outcomes the glass reveals. Emotional calculus—"sharp gentleness toward the version of himself who had not yet learned"—avoids both cynicism and sentiment. The piece commits fully to its speculative frame without retreat, and the risk (lyric pacing, heavy metaphor load) heightens stakes without obscuring the closure image.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Present throughout; the potter's identity shapes perception (craft metaphors dominate). His choices—circling, kneeling, placing clay—drive all beats and the closure. Observation deepens into enacted kindness, altering the timeline overlay. Removing "potter" specificity would strip the craft-based causality and thematic resonance.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Introduced early (paragraph 6), handled in three beats: salvage backstory, placement atop hive frame (paragraph 13), revelation of double-images (paragraphs 16–22), and implicit reprise in final paragraph ("faded lantern glass showed his overlapping selves softening"). It enables the fractured-timeline vision and charges the ending by making kindness visible. Specific properties (crazed fractures catching light) matter causally.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Introduced by name (paragraph 9), the concept structures stakes: understanding why one path preserves life. It shapes on-page tactics (the potter reads the glass to see branching outcomes) and the closure (he chooses to "flood this place with kindness" to tilt timelines). The overlapping selves and conditional future ("in some timeline, swarm again") make the concept integral to the ending's Charged Poise.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Appears late (paragraph 19: "brighter strands of time bent toward certain gestures, almost phototropic to kindness") as an observation, then again (paragraph 27: sprouts "phototropic to kindness made tangible") in the ending image. It explains the mechanism but doesn't constrain a middle choice; the potter acts on kindness before the trait is named. The ending reprise reweights it, but the lack of mid-story pressure limits integration.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>First mentioned (paragraph 15: "almost-sound... like bees trapped inside a buried jar"), recurs (paragraph 21: "not-quite-sound of bees grew louder"), and crescendos (paragraph 23: "layered thrum like a kiln warming"). The thrum signals the oasis responding to the potter's presence and escalates as he plants seeds, adding sensory pressure. Removing it would flatten the accumulative build toward the ending's conditional promise of swarming bees.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Introduced twice (paragraphs 8 and 14) as the potter's firing practice and his method of circling the oasis. It shapes his orientation (shadows mark hours) and ties craft discipline to the timeline experiment. The repetition in paragraph 14 feels explanatory rather than causal. Present in setup and middle but not explicitly invoked at closure, limiting its charge.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Anchored in opening line, the oasis supplies all spatial and thematic infrastructure: cracked hives frame the potter's circuit, the dry well motivates water scarcity (paragraph 20), and hairline sprouts (paragraph 27) manifest the ending's conditional hope. The abandoned apiary's emptiness creates the pressure (why did this place survive?) and the potter's planting gestures exploit that setting to test his hypothesis. Removing the beekeeping specificity would collapse both stakes and closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Signaled early (paragraph 11: "distant village chimneys began to smudge the sky") and returned (paragraph 12: "chimney smoke flattens against the evening wind... when the boundaries loosened"). It marks the threshold when the glass reveals timelines, thus timing the potter's investigation. Not invoked at closure and does not tighten decisions during the planting sequence, so its causal role is limited to enabling the middle revelation.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stated explicitly (paragraph 4) and dramatized throughout: the potter examines the glass, circles the oasis, and plants seeds to test his understanding. The motivation generates all on-page choices and the ending directly answers it ("places resist change when enough kindness has soaked into their stories"). Visible friction between the desire for certainty and the conditional outcome ("in some timeline") adds cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Established early ("unhurried care," "zen-minded") and sustained through paradoxical phrasing: "sharp gentleness" (paragraph 18), "gently, sharply" (final line). The tone modulates with pressure—contemplative in the glass-reading beats, more urgent in the planting sequence—without breaking coherence. It charges the final image by fusing acceptance and intensity, making the ending's Charged Poise feel inevitable rather than sentimental.</comment>
