<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lio's interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion through the river-stone bracelet and softly deliberate movement. The final choice to house unbound shadows is earned by prior causality and his regret, though the decision arrives without visible internal contradiction or struggle in the moment. Micro-choices accumulate pressure effectively, and the backstory about his hollowed-out family anchors his present stance without flattening momentum. The Overseer and Lane remain functional rather than fully individuated presences.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure. The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Lio's request to become a moving archive reweights his regret and the library's function, with conceptual cost legible in "luminous regret burning through each word." Orientation anchors clearly by the opening paragraph. The shadow's discovery, the tape viewing, and Lio's absorption create a meaningful tightening under the accumulative lens, and the final protocol request reconfigures his role with felt cost. One micro turn (shadow climbing his wrists) sets up the closure without disrupting coherence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The blooming library above clouds is vivid and purposeful, with translucent petals and magnetic-tape dust creating textured layers. The river-stone bracelet functions as micro-setting, constraining Lio's attention (the chill, the shadow sensing the stones) and charging the final image when the shadow winds around it. The monitor and tape reel supply concrete staging for the pivotal beat. Spatial choreography remains clear through the descent and the shadow's pooling at Lio's feet, and the setting's layered archives directly enable the story's central action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving lost hope and managing unbound shadows—is signaled early and tightens meaningfully when Lio realizes Lane's trajectory was erased. The shadow's approach and Lio's choice to absorb it constitute a decisive tightening driven by his agency, with visible cost: he must carry futures that were never realized. The price is legible in the "ache" and "scorching" pain, and his request to the Overseer forecloses his prior passive role. Coincidence does not resolve; Lio's decision and the shadow's response drive closure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from Lio's regret, the Archive's function, and Lane's lost trajectory: hope persists even when its dreamer is gone. The river stone, the softened jaw of hopeful dreamers, and the seedling imagery recur with purpose, reweighting at closure when Lio becomes the vessel for unbound futures. The ending image—"let me be their moving archive, so that lost futures can still cast a light somewhere"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in the shadow's quivering recognition and Lio's whispered invitation, and the piece invites reflection on preservation and erasure with earned complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with consistent psychic distance and perceptual signature: Lio notices dusk, coolness, and hope's jaw-softening through his cataloger's lens. Diction remains within his register, and the voice modulates purposefully under pressure ("sting that felt like remembering," "luminous regret burning"). The Overseer's parchment-wing presence and rustling voice are distinct. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks that dull immediacy. Purposeful compression in phrases like "darkness clung politely" and "grief that had forgotten why it started" is taught early and coherent at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally, and information density is high: nearly every sentence advances character, world, or pressure. Figurative language is vivid and coherent ("sky bruised violet," "parchment wings," "luminous regret"), though density approaches the high end in the opening third without obscuring clarity. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Minor scaffold remains in phrases like "as if sensing" and "as if some brightness," but these are voice-motivated and do not dull the closure beat. Sentence openings vary, and the final line propels forward with clear image and action.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The premise—a library of shareable dreams, unbound shadows, and a dusk noticer who becomes their vessel—synthesizes familiar genre elements (archive fantasy, memory preservation) with specific transformation: the river stone, silent video footage, and the particular ache of Lane's erased hope. The emotional core is authentic rather than novel for novelty's sake, and the metaphorical weight of "preserving the shape of hope" feels earned rather than ornamental. The story commits fully to its premise without retreat, and the ending's reweighting of Lio's role offers a non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lio, the sharp-eyed dusk noticer, is present throughout and makes the pivotal decision to house unbound shadows. His noticing triggers the inciting action (the paling clouds and alarm), and his observation of Lane's tape informs his final choice. The title functions as identity anchor, and his request to the Overseer at closure is a key turn. His observation enables decision rather than replacing it, and the role constrains his tactics (tending dreams, reading relics).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The river stone appears in three distinct beats: Lio's bracelet cooling when the anomaly enters, the shadow stretching toward the stones, and the shadow winding around them when Lio absorbs it. The object's meaning reweights from personal talisman (anxiety-smoothed by generations) to a conduit for unbound hope, and it directly enables the shadow's recognition and absorption. The stone's final function charges the closure by linking Lio's personal regret to Lane's lost trajectory.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The shadow unbound is the inciting problem, shapes the dominant stake (managing lost futures), and drives the central action. Its properties (quivering, stretching toward the stones, pooling, climbing Lio's wrists) constrain tactics and enable the climax. Lio's decision to house such shadows redefines his role and the Archive's function. The concept is causally active throughout and integral to closure; removing it would collapse the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Softly deliberate movement is shown early ("as if he feared bruising the dreams") and recurs in Lio's approach to the shadow ("murmured") and kneeling. It reflects his regret-driven carefulness and contrasts with the urgency of the alarm, creating a visible tradeoff: his gentleness delays direct confrontation but enables trust. The trait constrains his pace and shapes his final invitational stance, though it does not decisively alter a high-pressure choice.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Metamorphose anchors the climax: Lio's whispered invitation ("metamorphose through me") enables the shadow's absorption, the flood of Lane's future-that-never-was, and his proposal to the Overseer. The action is irreplaceable; without it, the resolution collapses. It appears late but transforms all prior material (the shadow's quivering, the river stones, Lio's regret) and directly produces the story's conceptual repricing. The word choice elevates the act beyond mere absorption to a generative transformation.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The method is introduced in the analog-artifact layer ("taught Lio how to read these relics by comparing silent video footage") and used once when Lio loads Lane's tape. It provides the mechanism for discovering Lane's lost hope and shapes the shadow's origin story. The method could be replaced with another archival technique without major structural loss, though the specificity of "decades apart" and "sleeping faces" adds texture and supports the theme of preservation across time.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The blooming library above clouds is present from the opening line, supplies the translucent-petal dream storage, and creates the layered descent to the analog archive. The setting enables the shadow's detection (alarms), provides the tape technology for Lane's discovery, and charges the closure by offering a spatial metaphor for Lio's new role as moving archive. The clouds' paling signals the inciting problem, and the library's structure (upper blooms, lower relics) directly shapes Lio's journey and tactics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The era after dreams become shareable is established early and defines the Archive's function. It creates the premise that enables Lane's childhood dream to exist without her adult return, generating the unbound shadow. The timeframe is not a ticking clock but a settled condition that shapes all choices and makes the story's conflict possible. The specificity of "2051" on Lane's tape anchors the world-building, and the historical layering (shareable era versus analog relics) supports the thematic weight of preservation.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Preserving the shape of hope is dramatized throughout: Lio's job tending lost possibilities, his reading of the hopeful jaw, the shadow as Lane's erased trajectory, and his final request to house unbound futures. The motivation is conflicted with visible cost—his regret is "bright and aching," and the shadow's absorption scorches him. The friction between his inability to change his own past and his care for others' lost hopes drives the central choice and charges the closure image.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Luminous regret saturates the voice from the opening ("regret felt useful instead of heavy") and modulates with pressure: the "chill along his wrists," the "sting that felt like remembering," and the final "luminous regret burning through each word." The tone coheres through all turns, balancing melancholy with the blooming library's light and the shadow's "cool tide." The oxymoronic pairing of luminous and regret charges the final image, where pain and illumination coexist without resolution.</comment>
