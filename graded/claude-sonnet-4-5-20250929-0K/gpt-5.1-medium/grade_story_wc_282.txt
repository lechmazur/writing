<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Iri's interiority is consistently embodied through sensor data and physical interaction with the cave environment. The internal conflict between machine identity and listener role is shown through action ("pressed their palm," "let the sensors…taste") rather than abstract declaration. The final choice to speak aloud and float in the pool is earned by the escalating sensory encounters, though the motivation shift from mapping duty to addressing the unknown feels slightly telescoped. The elm leaf encounter beautifully contradicts professional distance with a less-quantifiable response that charges the ending stance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density increases through layered sensory traces (villagers' anxiety → children's sorrow → spiral pattern of the unknown) culminating in Charged Poise when Iri floats and speaks the "first map for two worlds." Orientation anchors clearly by line 2 (coastal cave, post-hibernation, Iri walking). The closure reweights the mapping mission from archival duty to interspecies dialogue, with the conceptual cost legible in Iri's shift from recorder to supplicant. One meaningful deepening occurs when the spiral pattern repeats, narrowing Iri's interpretation from residue to active presence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The cave network constrains Iri's descent through tidal exposure, mineral tang, temperature gradients, and the hidden pool's buoyancy—each detail filters through the sensor-map maker's professional lens. The elm leaf fossil and the still pool both charge the final image: the leaf's "forgotten sorrow" primes Iri's address to the unknown, and the pool's buoyancy enables the floating stance that crystallizes the dual-world mapping mission. Spatial choreography (descent, kneel, step into water, float) remains coherent throughout, and the "ribs of an ancient whale" ceiling subtly mirrors the spiral pattern's organic recursion.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—charting emotional residue for future wakers—tightens when the spiral pattern suggests not leftover trace but active presence, forcing Iri to exceed charter boundaries. The elm leaf discovery is the key reversal: it shifts the mission from archival recording to real-time dialogue ("If you are what comes after us…"). Agency is clear in the decision to follow the spiral, adjust buoyancy, and speak aloud, each choice foreclosing the safety of detached observation. The cost is legible in Iri's charter violation and the conceptual leap from mapping sleep to addressing wakefulness.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of transitional objects—bridges between states—emerges through the elm leaf fossil (summer to sleep) and spirals to Iri's own role as bridge between sleeping humanity and the unknown. The final spoken address ("take this object, this map, this small fossil…and let it teach you we wished to be known") answers the thematic question without stating a moral: continuity requires not just archival data but enacted witness. The lantern's heat-mapping of emotions becomes a literalized metaphor for reading across temporal and species boundaries, earning the "factually mystical" premise. No late thematic summary; the cave's dripping silence is the non-literal answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: Iri's sensor-laden body produces precise phenomenology ("silver veins quickening," "taste the heat patterns") that never drifts into generic lyricism. The single line of dialogue ("If you are what comes after us…") breaks the descriptive texture purposefully, marking the shift from observation to address. Diction remains consistent—technical yet grounded ("buoyancy," "transitional objects," "navigable relief")—and the charter phrase ("I am a listener…") is integrated as internal anchor rather than exposition. No head-hopping; the narrative certainty about the children's pockets is plausibly inferred from the lantern's emotional trace.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Information density is high; most sentences advance atmosphere, character knowledge, or thematic layering without padding. Rhythm modulates well from measured descent to the charged stillness of the pool. Minor template cadence appears in the middle third: "The hues here were faint…Those villagers had left…I am not a machine" follows a similar declarative stem pattern across three beats, mildly flattening momentum (−0.3). The metaphor "ceiling arched like the ribs of an ancient whale" is vivid and voice-consistent, though "silver nerves" for the lantern's lattice risks slight anatomical muddle without harming clarity. No loops or paraphrase chains touch the closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of sensory cartography, cryosleep, and post-human witness feels specific and non-obvious; the "factually mystical" lantern grounds speculative premise in tactile use rather than handwave. The elm leaf fossil as fossilized comfort—literal and thematic—is a strong particular that drives the turn. Risk-taking in the floating address and the spiral's ambiguous agency elevates without obscuring clarity (+0.3). The piece resists easy allegory by keeping the unknown genuinely unknown rather than a stand-in, and the final image (Iri suspended, speaking between worlds) is memorable without gimmickry.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Iri's choices create the key turn: following the spiral pattern, stepping into the pool, adjusting buoyancy, and speaking aloud all alter tactics and stance. Present in setup (coastal walk), development (kneeling, tracing the spiral), and closure (floating, addressing the unknown). The decision to speak for what cannot yet speak is the pivot that redefines the mapping mission, with visible cost in charter deviation.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The elm leaf fossil appears in two distinct beats: discovery in the silt (triggers "concentrated flare of forgotten sorrow") and placement on the flat rock (generates new spiral pattern). Its presence charges Iri's final address ("take this object, this map, this small fossil") and literalizes the transitional-object theme. The fossil's shift from child's comfort to interspecies bridge demonstrates reweighted meaning, and its fragility contrasts with the cave's permanence, sharpening the cost of impermanence.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Transitional objects shape the dominant stake: the elm leaves children carried are the emotional archive Iri must map, and the concept redefines Iri's role from recorder to bridge. The fossil's discovery narrows options by revealing the unknown's spiral signature. The concept is not merely thematic echo; it drives Iri's final stance (offering the fossil as teaching object) and the closure image of Iri as transitional body between sleeping humanity and the unknown.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Factually mystical" enables the lantern's heat-mapping function, which is used on-page in two beats (first cavern's faint hues, elm leaf's blue flare) and shapes Iri's knowledge of the spiral pattern. The trait constrains method—Iri cannot map emotions without it—but the story does not foreground a specific cost or tradeoff tied to the mystical mechanics. Present in setup and development; contributes to closure knowledge but does not visibly alter final tactics.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Floating in the hidden pool is the irreplaceable action that enables the closure stance: Iri's buoyancy adjustment ("let themselves float quietly above the unseen floor") physically embodies the suspension between worlds and permits the address to the unknown. The action redefines Iri's role from grounded observer to liminal interlocutor, and the spiral's tightening around the floating body makes the unknown's attention legible. Setup (descent toward water), development (stepping in, hesitating), and closure (speaking while floating) all hinge on this exact action.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Heat-mapping emotions is signaled in the opening quarter (lantern's "silver nerves that brightened where feeling was strongest") and used in three beats: first cavern (residual awe/anxiety), elm leaf (sorrow flare), spiral pattern (temperature gradients). The method shapes Iri's knowledge progression and enables the discovery that the spiral is not leftover trace. It constrains tactics—Iri must use the lantern to read emotional weather—and contributes causally to the final realization, though the mechanics remain suggestive rather than rule-explicit.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The coastal cave network pressures every choice: tidal exposure controls access ("black stone corridors that had not felt footsteps"), the descent structure forces Iri deeper toward discovery, mineral drip fossilizes the elm leaf, and the hidden pool's stillness and buoyancy enable the floating stance. The setting supplies the spiral pattern (temperature gradients along walls) that drives the turn. Present in setup (cave entry), development (descent, chamber, pool discovery), and closure (floating as the liminal position). Spatial choreography is clear and the cave's layered depth mirrors thematic descent.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The hibernation timeframe establishes why Iri is alone and what the mapping serves (future wakers), but the story does not track elapsed time or impose a ticking constraint on Iri's choices. The century of sleep is backdrop rather than active pressure. Present in setup (villages in "planned sleep," hibernation protocols) and referenced at closure (speaking to "what waited unsleeping below"), but the element does not narrow tactics or introduce urgency. The timeframe's consequence—Iri's solitude and the unknown's movement—indirectly shapes the stakes.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The motivation "to become the voice of the unknown" is dramatized through Iri's escalating engagement: professional mapping → touching the fossil with "something less quantifiable" → following the spiral despite training forbidding speculation → speaking aloud to address the unseen. Friction appears when the charter's demand to "speak for what could not yet speak" conflicts with the professional prohibition on speculation, forcing Iri to exceed boundaries. Present in setup (charter phrase), development (listening harder, following the spiral), and closure (speaking the first map for two worlds). The cost is visible in the shift from recorder to supplicant.</comment>
