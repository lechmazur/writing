<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The claustrophobic explorer's interiority is concrete and embodied throughout—breath shortening, walls "shivering nearer in imagination," reciting measurements as prayer. Internal contradiction drives pressure: prudent surveyor versus compulsion to descend despite terror. The final choice to descend "accepting the key might change him first" earns the renunciation with visible cost (forsaking open sky, accepting transformation). Minor: the grandmother's voice and archive backstory remain abstract; tightening that anchoring would sharpen motivation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds cleanly: compass fragment → hall selection → pedestal action → staircase reveal → descent decision. Closure achieves Charged Poise: the protagonist stands at threshold, cost legible ("every instinct clawing upward"), accepting transformation as price. Orientation anchors quickly (canyon, moonrise, temple). One meaningful tightening occurs when wrong passage choice could "tighten until ribs protested"—the compass narrows options with felt stakes. Cost is visible in the final beat's physical and psychological surrender.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The canyon's compression, starlight lattice, and "obedient light" column all constrain navigation choices. The brass tube/pedestal and blueprint compass are handled objects that alter spatial access. The temple's impossible geometry—doorways nearer than shadows, three halls from one—directly pressures the explorer's claustrophobia and decision-making. Spatial choreography remains coherent despite surreal angles. The staircase's "compressed midnight" charges the final image. Scope fits: environment drives every turn.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncovering the key) signals early and tightens through claustrophobic pressure escalating to "air itself might tighten until ribs protested." The compass alignment narrows three passages to one—a genuine decision with spatial/survival cost. Final descent forecloses escape, accepting transformation as price: "the key might change him first." Agency is protagonist-driven throughout; coincidence (temple response to compass) complicates but does not resolve. One clear reversal when temple reorganizes, forcing trust in instrument over nerves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of spatial mutiny as rebellion against imposed silence emerges through architecture that "sighs" and "resents the lock," paralleling the explorer's "patient rebellion" against fear. The compass fragment (broken relic from forbidden archives) and lonely organ unite exile/silence/voice motifs without stating thesis. Final image—descent as acceptance of transformation—answers the question of how to argue with fear through surrender rather than conquest. Wistful rebellion tone charges closure: exploration as negotiation, not domination. No thematic echo in final paragraph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Single POV with stable distance; perceptual signature is consistent—surveyor's measurements, spatial awareness, claustrophobic filter colors every observation. Diction fits character: "prudently adventurous," "spatial mutiny," technical precision ("flagstones," "concentric circles"). Purposeful compression in phrases like "deepening water" and "wounded wings" stays voice-coherent. Minor slip: "a lonely church organ" phrase feels slightly elevated/imposed compared to surrounding texture, though the resonant-chamber mechanics recover specificity. Psychic distance modulates effectively under rising pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; figurative density ("starlight stitched," "dewless sheen," "compressed midnight") mostly serves atmosphere without overloading. Information density high: most lines advance setting, character state, or choice. Two friction points: "He did not know whether the temple resented... or welcomed" offers synonym pairing without added pressure (−0.3). "Negotiating with the skittish stones" in high-pressure beat drifts slightly precious (−0.2). Sentence openings vary; no major loops. Clarity sustained through complex spatial choreography. Propulsion strong to closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Spatial mutiny" as architectural rebellion offers fresh synthesis of claustrophobia/temple exploration. The broken compass as navigation tool and the organ-as-instruction system transform familiar lost-temple tropes through specific mechanics. The ending—descent accepting transformation as cost rather than triumphant discovery—subverts genre expectation. Voice and concept cohere. Risk: surreal geometry could obscure, but clarity holds. Wistful-rebellion tone distinguishes this from standard adventure. The grandmother/archive frame remains slightly template; specificity there would elevate further.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Setup: introduced immediately. Development: claustrophobia constrains hall choice ("walls pressed like accusations," breath management, measurements as prayer), drives compass reliance over instinct. Payoff: final descent directly confronts and accepts claustrophobic terror with visible cost ("every instinct clawing upward"). Trait shapes three key beats and charges closure image. Swappability low: another explorer type would not generate identical pressure or ending nuance.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Setup: introduced mid-story (~30%) with grandmother anchor. Development: handled twice—alignment test eliminates two passages, then inserted into socket to activate chamber. Payoff: directly enables staircase reveal and descent opportunity. Causal pressure high: without it, protagonist cannot navigate or unlock. Specificity matters: broken state (snapped legs, etched arc, sharpened tip) and extinct ink suggest irreplaceability. Late first appearance prevents higher score; earlier seed would strengthen integration.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Setup: named early via grandmother ("spatial mutiny"), framing expectation. Development: demonstrated across multiple beats—corridors disagree with intuition, doorways/pillars lie, passages ripple and recoil, temple reorganizes with footsteps. Payoff: final chamber's impossible height and window constellations confirm premise; concept structures entire navigation challenge and closure stakes. Causal pressure extreme: concept is the obstacle and the discovery. Irreplaceable: story logic fails without this exact rule-set. Cost tied directly to concept's pressure on claustrophobia.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Setup: present in opening ("prudently adventurous, measuring each risk like a surveyor"). Development: trait enables compass trust over nerves—prudence selects instrument, adventure accepts descent. Payoff: final choice balances both ("his most patient rebellion"). Visible once in middle choice, returns at closure. Cost: prudence nearly fails him (trembling nerves vs. measurement prayer), adventure exacts transformation price. Functional but could be swapped for "cautious risk-taker" with minor edits; wording specificity is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Setup: introduced early via grandmother's story ("the story began to transfix him for years"). Development: mentioned as ongoing state but not dramatized in middle action. Payoff: implicit—his presence results from transfixion, descent accepts its pull. Action is backdrop motivation rather than turn-driver; obsession brought him here but does not shape navigation choices or compass use. Swappable: "compel," "obsess," or "haunt" would function similarly. Lyric reprise (early seed to implicit closure) reaches mid-band but lacks beat involvement.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Setup: foreshadowed via "resonant chamber designed... to carry sound inward through stone and memory" and sketch recognition. Development: brass tube identified, mechanics explained. Payoff: compass pin activates chamber, chord rises, walls uncoil, staircase appears—method directly unlocks closure opportunity. Causal necessity high: without this exact method, no descent. Signaled moderately early (~60%); earlier hint would improve. Two beats (identification, activation) plus closure linkage. Specificity strong: organ-as-architecture-instruction is irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Setup: named in opening ("shadowed nexus under starlight"). Development: starlight column guides navigation, narrows to "disciplined column" marking correct passage; canyon shadows pool "like deepening water," cliff walls pressure choices. Payoff: staircase descent into "compressed midnight" fulfills shadowed-nexus promise; new slit windows frame "unfamiliar constellation[s]," reweighting starlight motif. Setting constrains every choice and charges final image. Irreplaceable: removal breaks navigation logic and atmospheric closure. Three beats plus closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Setup: mentioned early ("fallow period, when valley was empty of pilgrims and official oversight"). Development: solitude noted but does not constrain choices or create urgency. Payoff: absent from closure. Functional explanation for lack of interference but does not shape tactics or escalation. Swappable: "off-season," "night," "abandonment" would serve identically. No cost or pressure tied to time window; lacks causal involvement beyond setup justification.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Setup: stated early ("traveled here to uncover a vital key lost to time"). Development: drives navigation choices (compass use, passage selection, chamber investigation). Payoff: descent toward key with accepted transformation cost. Motivation sustained and tested against claustrophobic fear—friction between desire and terror generates pressure. Cost visible: must sacrifice safety/sky. Minor: "vital key" remains abstract; what unlocks or why "vital" is not dramatized, keeping it mid-concept rather than embodied stake. Two beats plus closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Setup: taught early through "wistful rebellion" of temple ("slow, reluctant sigh") and explorer's stance ("patient rebellion," "arguing with fear"). Development: tone modulates with pressure—measurements as prayer, compass trust, music's "silent plea." Payoff: final surrender ("most patient rebellion... accepting the key might change him first") crystallizes wistful-rebellion register—longing without conquest, submission as argument. Coherent across turns, charges closure image. Distinct from standard adventure tone; irreplaceable for this ending's emotional texture.</comment>
