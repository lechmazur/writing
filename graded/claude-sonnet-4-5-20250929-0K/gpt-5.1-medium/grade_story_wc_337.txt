<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Ilan's internal world is grounded through embodied detail—the net's history "thrums," voices "curl around his wrists like damp fingers"—and his motivation to restore masks and names is earned through the backstory of his brother's loss. The micro-choice at each knot ("I will keep it only across sharing a secret") shows a hierarchy of values, and his final understanding that masks will "fit more gently" registers a credible internal shift. Minor deduction: the restless spirits remain abstract presences rather than individuated pressures, and the brother's absence is told rather than dramatized in a choice that alters present tactics.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive by the second paragraph. The escalation unfolds through knot-by-knot accumulation, each releasing a voice or memory, building density until the final name spills out and the spirits settle—a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant) where Ilan's ritual forecloses wandering with visible cost (he carries the secret briefly, then releases it). One meaningful deepening occurs when the second knot releases a voice and Ilan commits ("I will hold what you cannot"), reweighting his role from passive restorer to active vessel. Cost is legible in the final image: the interlaced hush shifts from unrest to grounded stillness, and his future work is reconfigured.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The prism sanctuary is more than backdrop: starlight refracts through glass columns "like a held breath," and the stone floor holds the net, grounding the ritual spatially. The tapestry needle and net are handled across multiple beats, constraining Ilan's method (threading, teasing fibers, slipping through the star-knot). Micro-setting details—salt smell, moonlit dust, shadows thickening—modulate with pressure and charge the final image when the hush "carries a grounded stillness" that sinks "gratefully into the stone." Sensory selection reflects urgency: calm detail in setup, sharpened starlight and crowding shadows as the ritual intensifies.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: "restore a name" to ground restless spirits. Pressure coheres through the accumulative lens: each knot Ilan unravels releases a voice or memory, building density and narrowing his path to the final star-knot. The second knot's release prompts a micro-turn when Ilan commits ("I will hold what you cannot"), and the final knot confronts him with the question "Will you keep what you hear?"—forcing a stance crystallization with visible cost (he holds the secret briefly, then lets it go). The spirits' settling and the reweighted hush make the cost undeniable. One meaningful tightening occurs; escalation is driven by Ilan's agency under the chosen lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: masks as vessels for shattered identity, names as anchors for the dead, and the interlaced hush that shifts from unrest to grounded stillness. The net and needle function as charged motifs—each knot holds a night at sea, and the final name "tastes of brine, tar, and unshed apologies." Ilan's brother's absence seeds the emotional urgency without explicit moralizing, and the ending offers a non-literal answer: silence can accumulate meaning instead of fear, and restoration extends beyond the living. The phrase "across sharing a secret" recurs with reweighted meaning, deepening the theme of temporary holding versus permanent release. No overt thesis; resonance arises from action and image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Single POV, third-person limited, with a distinct perceptual signature: Ilan notices texture (net "stiff with time," needle "old enough to remember"), embodied sensation ("words curling around his wrists"), and the hush's evolving quality. Distance remains stable; no head-hopping. Diction is elevated but consistent ("exhume," "interlaced hush," "lucid unrest"), matching the voice of a solitary craftsman in a ritual space. The single line of dialogue from the old woman and Ilan's whispered responses carry subtext and goal pursuit. Purposeful compression in the knot-release sequence maintains rhythm without obscuring causality. Minor note: "across sharing a secret" appears twice in identical phrasing, a small elision that could be tighter.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and controlled, with varied sentence rhythm and high information density. Figurative language ("tide pools gathered stray fragments of the sea," "shadows thickened...like curious birds") is coherent and purposeful. The knot-release sequence propels through concrete action without loops. Minor deductions: the phrase "accumulates silence" appears twice in near-identical constructions (line 3 and line 16), creating a small paraphrase loop. "Across sharing a secret" recurs verbatim in lines 10 and 32 without variation, reading as template cadence in a high-stakes beat (the final commitment). These artifacts do not obscure causality but slightly dull propulsion in peak moments. No filter-verb stacks or register drift; syntax varies effectively.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The premise—unraveling a fisherman's net to reach a dead captain and restore a name—transforms the familiar restorer-of-broken-things trope through specific ritual logic and embodied stakes. The interlaced hush, the prism sanctuary, and the net's living history feel particular to this voice and world. The final synthesis (masks, nets, names, and silence all serve the same grounding function) is non-obvious and earned through prior particulars. The ending's reweighting—silence accumulates meaning rather than fear—feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in the lyric, accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. No close echoes of famous lines; the piece commits fully to its premise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setup: Ilan introduced in opening line. Development: his decision to thread the needle (beat 1), his commitment at the second knot ("I will hold what you cannot," beat 2), and his final promise to keep the name "only across sharing a secret" (beat 3) all constrain and enable tactics. Closure: his final understanding that masks will "fit more gently" directly follows from the ritual's success. Causal pressure: each choice narrows options and grounds the spirits. Specificity: the exact occupation (mask restorer) and his brother's loss make the role irreplaceable. Cost: he absorbs the secret temporarily, a visible emotional and relational price. All three gates met; strong causal work across three beats and closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Setup: introduced at line 15. Development: Ilan threads it with star-colored twine (beat 1), lowers it to the first knot (beat 2), and slips it through the final star-knot to release the name (beat 3). The needle "accumulates silence with every stitch," giving it charged specificity. Closure: its final use directly releases the captain's name, shaping the ending. Two gates met (development, closure). Causal pressure: the needle is the tool that enables the ritual. Minor cap: introduced after the first third (~20% mark), applying a small late penalty. Nonetheless, strong beat involvement and closure linkage push the score solidly into the 7+ band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Setup: "interlaced hush" appears in line 2 and recurs in lines 19, 29, and 37. Development: the hush "settled over the sanctuary, layer upon layer of listening" (beat 2), and "deepened, no longer empty but woven with stories" (beat 3). Closure: the final image states "the interlaced hush remained, but now it carried a grounded stillness." The concept shapes stakes (Ilan must transform unrest into grounded silence) and the ending reweights it. All three gates met. Minor friction: the hush itself does not directly constrain Ilan's tactics; it is more atmosphere than active pressure. Nonetheless, the purposeful early–final reprise that reweights the stake qualifies for mid-7 territory under lyric allowance.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Setup: "accumulates silence" appears twice (lines 3 and 16), applied to the sanctuary and the needle. Development: the needle's silence-accumulation is mentioned as Ilan threads it, and the sanctuary's accumulation frames the ritual. Closure: the final hush "carries a grounded stillness, a silence that accumulates meaning instead of fear." The attribute reweights the ending image and reflects Ilan's transformation. Two gates met (setup, closure). The attribute is more thematic than directly constraining—Ilan's actions are not visibly limited by silence-accumulation—but the ending makes the conceptual cost (shift from fear to meaning) legible. Lyric reprise and conceptual charge elevate the score into the 7+ band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setup: "exhume" appears in line 17 ("ready to exhume itself") and is enacted across beats 2–4. Development: each knot Ilan unravels exhumes a moment—voices, laughter, the crack of ice (beat 2), and finally "not bone nor treasure, but a single name" (beat 4). The action drives every major turn and is irreplaceable; swapping "exhume" for "release" or "uncover" would lose the resonance with Ilan's brother's return and the dead captain's burial at sea. Closure: the final name's exhumation settles the spirits and reconfigures Ilan's understanding. All three gates met; strong causal pressure, specificity, and closure linkage. Cost: the ritual demands Ilan's emotional labor and temporary burden of the secret.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Setup: introduced at line 8 ("centuries-old fisherman's net") and line 9 ("the only way to reach the dead captain was by unraveling knots"). Development: Ilan threads the needle and lowers it to the first knot (beat 1), teases the second knot loose (beat 2), and finally slips the needle through the star-knot (beat 4). The method shapes every attempt and tactic; the net's structure (each knot holds a night at sea) makes the mechanics irreplaceable. Closure: the final knot's unraveling releases the name and grounds the spirits. All three gates met. Causal pressure and specificity are high; the method is the story's engine. Cost: the ritual's duration and emotional toll are visible.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Setup: "prism sanctuary under starlight" in the opening line. Development: the sanctuary's glass columns refract starlight "so that every surface gleamed like a held breath" (beat 2), and shadows thicken at the edges (beat 3), reflecting the ritual's pressure. The stone floor holds the net, grounding the action spatially. Closure: the spirits "sank gratefully into the stone," and the sanctuary's hush shifts to grounded stillness. The setting supplies the ritual space and its refractive, charged atmosphere. All three gates met. The sanctuary does not directly constrain Ilan's choices (he could perform the ritual elsewhere), but it charges the final image and provides the micro-environment (stone, glass, starlight) that shapes perception and tone.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Setup: "across sharing a secret" appears in line 10 (the message's transmission) and line 32 (Ilan's promise). The phrase is present but does not function as a legible time constraint. Development: no middle beat where the timeframe alters tactics or creates urgency. Closure: the phrase recurs but does not tighten the ending; the ritual's duration is untracked. The timeframe is thematic (secrecy as a temporary holding) rather than mechanical. Two gates nominally met (setup, closure mention) but without causal pressure or clock-driven escalation. Cap at ~4.6 for late/weak development and lack of tactical constraint. The phrase is more metaphor than functional timeframe.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Setup: "to ground restless spirits" stated explicitly in line 6 and reinforced in line 12 ("can you restore a name?"). Development: Ilan's commitment at the second knot ("I will hold what you cannot") enacts the motivation (beat 2), and his hesitation before the final knot reflects internal conflict (beat 3). Closure: the spirits settle "gratefully into the stone," and Ilan's understanding that masks will "fit more gently" reweights the motivation. All three gates met. The motivation is dramatized through choices and internal friction (fear of what the final knot might unmake), and the ending makes the cost (temporary burden of the secret, emotional labor) legible. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Setup: "lucid unrest" in line 2 ("every color quivered with lucid unrest"). Development: tone modulates as pressure rises—calm ritual detail in early beats, sharpened starlight and crowding shadows in middle beats, and the voice "like shifting ballast" in beat 3. Closure: the hush shifts from unrest to "grounded stillness," resolving the tonal arc. The tone charges the final image and coheres through turns. All three gates met. The tone is consistent yet modulates appropriately, and the ending makes the transformation (unrest → stillness) palpable. Strong tonal control under pressure; the final image is charged by the contrast.</comment>
