<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The protagonist's interiority is concrete and purposeful—"I shocked myself by feeling lighter too" embodies a contradictory emotional discovery. Internal conflict emerges through the tension between professional habit ("solving their ghosts from the safety of my basement office") and the physical presence demanded by collective grief. Micro-choices under pressure are visible: asking the boy for details, writing in the notebook, recognizing the task as hosting rather than curating. Minor slip: the final realization ("my task was to host a communal puzzle") articulates insight cleanly but borders on telling what has been shown across prior beats.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when early (archivist, lavender field behind factory, present day hiring). The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: density increases from solo arrival to crowded table, from one boy to communal constellation-building, and the cadence shift in the final paragraph reweights the protagonist's role from passive curator to active host. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final image crystallizes the communal puzzle with undeniable pressure, and the cost is the forfeiture of archival distance. One meaningful deepening satisfies the 600–800 word requirement, and the lens holds without contradiction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The lavender field constrains choice (guides the path, hosts the table) and charges the final image ("lavender field murmured approval"). Micro-setting details are purposeful: folding chairs and rickety table anchor the makeshift archive, rusted chimneys frame dereliction, and oil under fingernails plus cartoon stickers on the lunchbox filter through the protagonist's observational bias. Spatial choreography remains clean across moves. Minor cap: the factory ruins function more as backdrop than active constraint in the middle beats, though the lavender recurs with escalating function.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: catalog community grief before bulldozing. The tightening is visible—first visitor (one boy) expands to crowded table to neighbors reading each other's fragments—and the protagonist's agency shifts from listening/labeling to facilitating communal puzzle-building with felt cost (loss of professional detachment). One meaningful deepening (individual → collective) suffices at this length. The escalation is driven by accumulation rather than causal reversals, consistent with the Accumulative lens, and the final recognition ("healing threaded through lavender air") reweights the task with undeniable pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: the map case transforms from reliquary to traveling archive, the lavender shifts from setting to approval chorus, and the protagonist's task evolves from cataloging to hosting. The ending offers a resonant answer—healing via communal puzzle rather than solitary curation—without stating a moral. Subtext operates in Myra's "stories are what cling, as vines climb" and the boy's lighter walk. Minor reservation: "healing threaded through lavender air" leans abstract, though it follows concrete beats and the metaphor is earned by prior particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and consistent: "puzzle man had a certain earnest whimsy I did not entirely dislike" and "like restless whales" anchor a perceptual signature mixing professional precision with lyric compression. POV remains stable first-person throughout with no head-hopping. Dialogue carries subtext and goal pursuit—Myra's "volunteer facilitator of whatever this is" conveys wry exhaustion, the boy's "small but heavy" words pursue connection. Psychic distance modulates purposefully from detached observation to felt lightness. Free indirect phrasing ("Archives prefer silence; grief prefers an audience") integrates cleanly without filter clutter.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies across sentence lengths and structures; opening lines anchor voice and stakes cleanly. Information density is high—most lines advance setting, character, or pressure. Minor deductions: "rippled in afternoon heat, buzzing softly" and "curled at the edges like dried petals" lean toward stock imagery without fresh inflection. The phrase "almost apologetic hand" and "like restless whales" offer stronger texture. Paraphrase check passes—no adjacent loops. Template cadence: "I asked… I wrote… I felt" in the boy's beat shows minor repetition but does not obscure cause/effect. No filter-verb stacks or register drift in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The premise—archivist of delicate mysteries hired to catalog collective grief in a lavender field behind ruins—offers a fresh synthesis. The transformation of professional distance into communal hosting is earned through specific beats (boy's photo, crowded table, neighbors tracing arcs). Risk-taking is modest but purposeful: the accumulative structure and lyric compression heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. The combination of industrial decay and cultivated beauty avoids generic "healing field" templates. The "subtle puzzle archivist" and "transmute pain into a masterpiece" phrases carry slight prompt echo but are dramatized through action rather than merely stated.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The subtle puzzle archivist drives three beats: arrival and setup, listening to the boy and writing in the notebook (choice to label and sketch), recognizing the communal task. The final realization ("host a communal puzzle") is causally shaped by the protagonist's prior listening and labeling. Introduced early, present in middle development (boy's story), and shapes the ending insight. The character's decisions alter tactics from solitary curation to facilitation. No swappability—remove the archivist role and the closure collapses.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dove gray map case appears in four touches: sent with photographs, carried down the path, latches winking in sun, and becomes "traveling reliquary." Early signal, reweighted meaning across beats (delivery vessel → active archive), but no direct choice is constrained by its presence. The case holds the photographs but does not enable or block a tactic. Functional and thematically charged, yet replaceable with another container without breaking story logic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Collective healing shapes stakes explicitly ("catalog an entire community's grief") and on-page tactics: the protagonist listens, labels, facilitates neighbors reading each other's fragments, and recognizes the task as communal puzzle. The concept is not merely thematic—it alters the protagonist's approach from archival distance to active hosting. Present in setup, middle (boy's lighter walk), and ending ("healing threaded through lavender air"). The final image reweights the concept with undeniable pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Perceptively calm" is attributed to Myra ("her voice perceptively calm, as if inviting me into a long exhale") but does not constrain or enable an on-page action with cost. The trait colors her dialogue staging but remains label-only; no choice hinges on this quality. Present in one beat, no development, no closure participation. Swappable with other calm descriptors without impact.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Linger" appears twice with escalating function: the boy "chose to linger even after silence returned, toes digging into the dirt" (testing whether ground holds him) is a micro-turn showing earned relief, and eventually "people began reading each others fragments" suggests collective lingering. The boy's linger choice is dramatized with cost (vulnerability, testing) and shapes the protagonist's realization of lighter feeling. Present in middle and implied at ending. One major beat traces to this action; not indispensable but meaningful.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Via arcs in black-and-white photographs" is signaled in the boy's beat ("I understood my task would unfold via arcs in black-and-white photographs"), shapes middle action (protagonist sketches photo lines, writes stories), and culminates in neighbors tracing arcs between their photos to build constellations. The method is mechanically present and causal: the photographs enable the communal puzzle. Early signal, middle development (writing and sketching), ending payoff (constellation-building). Not swappable—remove the photographs and the closure logic breaks.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The lavender field pressures choices throughout: guides the protagonist down the path, hosts the makeshift archive table, embodies the hum of activity, and "murmured approval" at the ending. Setting is both spatial anchor and active participant—without the field, the table placement and final image collapse. Early setup, middle constraint (table among flowers), ending charge. Micro-setting (body/tool) clause is satisfied: the lavender wraps the boy's ankles and the scent functions as sensory anchor. Indispensable to closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"As vines climb" appears once in Myra's dialogue ("the stories are what cling, as vines climb") as metaphor, not a tracked timeframe that tightens decisions. No scene clock or deadline pressure shapes tactics. Time passes ("first afternoon," "third day," "eventually") but remains vague and does not alter moves. Present but ornamental to pacing; swappable with other timeframe markers. Does not constrain a choice or charge the ending.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"To transmute pain into a masterpiece" motivates the protagonist's arrival ("Please help us transmute pain into a masterpiece… made my chest tighten") and shapes the recognition at closure (healing as communal puzzle rather than solo alchemy). The desire is dramatized through the boy's visit and the crowded table, with friction visible in the protagonist feeling "underqualified" and the tension between archival silence and grief's need for audience. Early signal, middle friction, ending reweight. Cost is present (loss of professional distance). Strong integration but the phrasing itself leans prompt-like.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Earnest whimsy modulates across beats: the opening "pointing nowhere" and "unlikely place for an archive" carry whimsy, "puzzle man had a certain earnest whimsy I did not entirely dislike" names the tone, Myra's "fox who had taken up knitting" sustains it, and the ending "murmured approval" and "healing threaded through lavender air" charge the final image with earnest lyricism under pressure. Coherent through turns, no tonal breaks. The tone shapes the perceptual signature and primes the communal rather than clinical closure.</comment>
