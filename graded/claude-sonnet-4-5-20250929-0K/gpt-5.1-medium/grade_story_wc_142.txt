<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Jae's internal contradiction between Carnival Row loyalty and Planning Office pragmatism is embodied through the burning foundation stone chip, and the final choice between "stay and fight, or help our people slip away" is earned by prior causality. However, interiority occasionally drifts into abstraction ("hopeful desperation," "orderly intuitive") rather than staying concrete. The relationship with Lilo adds pressure but could show more micro-choices that visibly foreclose options. Embodied emotion is present but sometimes filtered through retrospective summary rather than immediate sensation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story operates under a Causal lens with clear because/therefore linkage: Jae feeds data to Lilo, who encodes warnings in murals, which enables Carnies to migrate and form co-ops before buyouts. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive cleanly in the opening paragraphs. Closure reads as Charged Poise: Lilo's serpent mural poses the final question with undeniable pressure, and the cost is felt in Jae's realization that they may only be "buying time." The reversal—from naive belief in a "middle passage" to recognizing the walls are closing—narrows options. One deduction: the escalation occurs more through summary ("those months," "slowly the carnival began to lean") than through dramatized on-page beats that show the tightening in real time.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The raft city is vividly particular: "lashed together from tankers, pontoons, and the skeletons of drowned suburbs," and the carnival setting constrains choices throughout (vendors migrate, performers buy decks, murals guide movement). The foundation stone chip functions as micro-setting, warm against Jae's chest and burning hotter under pressure. Spatial choreography is clear (Carnival Row, Planning Office, "under the rusted roller coaster"). One slip: the Council's holographic models and the investors' "mirrored yachts" feel slightly generic compared to the textured carnival details, and we never see how the physical maze structure itself forces a tactical choice in a dramatized beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—navigate gentrification without the raft cracking apart—is signaled early and coherent. Jae's decision to collaborate with Lilo constitutes agency, and the data-to-mural pipeline tightens pressure by enabling Carnie counter-moves. However, escalation occurs largely in summary: "those months," "slowly," "the Council noticed the drift." The key reversal (leak of privatization documents) arrives late and is told rather than dramatized, reducing its felt cost. The final choice posed by Lilo's serpent is Charged Poise with felt stakes, but the path to that moment lacks on-page turns that force Jae to trade off options or suffer visible losses in real time.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges cleanly from particulars: dual allegiance, the tension between legibility and labyrinth, and the question of whether resistance can succeed or only delay. The foundation stone chip and Lilo's murals carry thematic weight without overt statement. Lilo's line "Order is just a story someone gets paid to tell" and the serpent's final question offer non-literal answers that reweight prior material. One deduction: the phrase "hopeful desperation" appears as a label in narration, and the line "buying us time before the inevitable" edges toward thematic summary rather than letting the image alone speak.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person, and Jae's voice carries a distinct texture: "I made a living as a culture shock absorber," "the orderly intuitive." Dialogue is sparse but functional; Lilo's line about order feels natural and advances theme. Perceptual signature is present (the burning chip, attention to migration patterns). One persistent issue: filter verbs and passive constructions appear in peak beats ("I felt the chip grow hotter," "I wondered whether"), dulling immediacy when the pressure would benefit from direct sensation. Diction occasionally shifts into slightly elevated register ("crooked yet deliberate," "resonant answer") that feels mildly at odds with the street-level carnival voice established early.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but several prose artifacts accumulate. Paraphrase loops: "The Carnies wanted the opposite: a labyrinth so wild no title deed could find purchase" is restated in different words two paragraphs later. Template cadence: multiple paragraphs open with "The [noun]" or "I [verb]" stems. Stock phrases: "racing pulse," "like slow, hungry sharks," "tasted of hopeful desperation." Figurative language occasionally stacks without payoff: "neon tides," "schools of fish," "serpent wrapped around three barges" all appear in quick succession in the final third. No loops touch the closure beat directly, so the Non-closure Accumulation Cap applies: two distinct issues (loops and template cadence) warrant −1.5 total within this category.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The premise—encoding resistance in graffiti art on a floating carnival city—is specific and fresh. The dual-allegiance conflict and the raft-city setting transform familiar gentrification material through vivid particulars. However, the core emotional arc (well-meaning insider caught between power and community) and the trajectory (warnings, incremental successes, inevitable encroachment, final choice) follow a recognizable template. The foundation stone chip and Lilo's murals add texture but do not fundamentally alter the structure. Risk-taking is moderate: the telling mode and summary-heavy escalation avoid the boldest on-page dramatization that would make the story feel wholly singular.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Jae's role as culture shock absorber is signaled early and frames the premise. The decision to collaborate with Lilo is a key turn, and the final question posed by the serpent depends on Jae's accumulated choices. However, much of Jae's work occurs in summary ("I fed Lilo the data, block by block") rather than in dramatized decision beats. Present in setup, middle choice, and closure; functional across beats but not indispensable—another insider role could generate similar pressure with modest edits.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The chip appears early, recurs ("the chip grow hotter," "the hotter the foundation stone chip burned"), and carries thematic weight (literal anchor, dual allegiance). It is handled in at least two distinct beats and charges interiority. However, it does not mechanically constrain a choice or alter tactics on the page; its function remains symbolic and emotional rather than causal. Present in setup and development, contributes to closure resonance, but removing it would not break plot logic—Jae's internal conflict could manifest another way.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dual allegiance is the engine of the story: Jae's split between Carnival Row and the Planning Office creates the central tension, motivates the covert collaboration with Lilo, and drives the final dilemma. It shapes stakes and tactics on every page, not merely as theme but as lived pressure. Present in setup, development, and closure; essential to the plot. One small friction: the conflict is sometimes told in summary rather than tested in on-page scenes where Jae must choose in real time between competing goods.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Orderly intuitive" appears as a label early ("my friends called me Jae, the orderly intuitive") and is referenced once more ("any orderly intuitive could read the currents here"), but it does not demonstrably constrain or enable an on-page action with visible cost. The trait is asserted rather than dramatized through a tradeoff or capability test. Present in setup but ornamental in function; swappable with "data analyst" or "pattern-reader" without structural change.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Reorganization is the inciting action: the Council asks Jae to help reorganize the maze, Jae and Lilo reorganize covertly through graffiti, and the story's escalation flows from the tension between official and secret reorganization. It drives at least two beats (the Council's request, the graffiti collaboration) and shapes the ending (the serpent's evacuation-route body is a final reorganization). Present in setup, development, and closure; removing it would collapse the plot. One friction: much reorganization occurs in summary rather than in discrete dramatized acts.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The graffiti-encoding method is signaled clearly ("we would reorganize the city through messages encoded in graffiti art") and its mechanics are specified (blue swallow = rent hikes, cracked mask = planned sale). It enables the Carnies' counter-moves and is causally active across the middle. The serpent mural at the end extends the method and poses the final question. Present in setup, development, and closure; essential to the plot. One friction: we never see Jae and Lilo execute the method in a dramatized scene—it is recounted in summary ("I fed Lilo the data, block by block"), which reduces felt specificity.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The raft city is vivid and specific, and its structure matters: vendors migrate between barges, performers buy decks, the maze resists title deeds. The carnival environment pressures choices and supplies resources (strong moorings, stages, support beams as graffiti surfaces). The setting is present in setup, development, and closure, and removing it would require a fundamental rewrite. One friction: while the setting is richly described, we do not see a single dramatized beat where a spatial feature (a narrow passage, a weak mooring, a crowded pier) forces a tactical choice in real time.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The timeframe "before privatization" is signaled early and creates urgency: "everyone knew the tide was turning," and the leak of privatization documents tightens the clock. The before/after boundary charges the stakes. Present in setup and development, and the closure question ("stay and fight, or help our people slip away") depends on the imminence of privatization. However, the time pressure is asserted more than tracked; we do not see a countdown or discrete deadline that alters Jae's tactics beat by beat. The timeframe matters but could be more causally active.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The motivation to navigate gentrification is signaled early, dramatized through Jae's collaboration with Lilo, and tested in the final dilemma. It is present in setup, development, and closure. Friction between the desire (middle passage) and the cost (walls closing in) is legible, and the final question depends on this motivation. One friction: much of the navigation occurs in summary ("those months," "slowly"), and we do not see Jae make a hard on-page choice that sacrifices one value for another until the very end. The motivation is essential but could be more visibly conflicted in discrete beats.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Hopeful desperation is coherent through turns: "Those months tasted of hopeful desperation," the carnival's resilience, Jae's naive belief, and the final recognition of buying time all carry the tone. It modulates with pressure (optimism → realization) and charges the final image (the serpent's question). Present across the arc and contributes to closure resonance. One friction: the phrase "hopeful desperation" is stated outright rather than emerging solely from image and action, and the tone occasionally flattens into retrospective summary ("I thought, naively") rather than sustaining immediacy under stress.</comment>
