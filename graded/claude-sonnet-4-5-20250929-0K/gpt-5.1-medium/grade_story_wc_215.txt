<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motive is layered—staying to preserve silence and unspoken words—and the interiority is deeply embodied ("almost laughed, but the sound died behind my teeth, a bee that chose not to sting"). The final confrontation with Mara crystallizes the choice to remain keeper/witness with clear relational cost. Minor: the protagonist's perceptual signature leans heavily on repetition of silence/witnessing metaphors without full contradiction or hierarchy-of-values friction; interior voice occasionally drifts into abstract statement ("texture of our silence") rather than lived perception under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors early (recluse, apiary, ghosts now visible, stained glass box). The piece reads Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through layered exposition of the covenant and intensifies when Mara speaks, then resolves via Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the protagonist renews commitment to witness with conceptual cost legible in Mara's acceptance and the "hush so dense." One escalation beat (Mara's arrival and her reaching toward the scroll) narrows the protagonist's options but does not foreclose a live path in causal terms; the closure reweights the covenant as witness rather than prison. The causality is weaker—most of the story is layered reflection and world-building rather than linked decisions—though the final exchange lands with undeniable thematic pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Vivid, selective detail throughout: hives "cracked and empty," "glassy dunes," "wind hissed through warped frames," the stained glass box "shattered chapel windows" with "looping grooves pressed by absent hands into softened glass." The apiary and box are integral to closure—the protagonist opens the box and light bends through Mara, activating the covenant's visibility. Spatial choreography is clear (gate, shed, box, protagonist and Mara's positions). Minor: the description occasionally leans ornamental in the middle third ("colors pulsed like slow bees") rather than constraining a live choice on the page.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake is preservation of the covenant/unspoken words; secondary is the protagonist's isolation. One tightening occurs when Mara manifests and speaks, crystallizing the protagonist's witness role and Mara's acceptance ("Keep it… not as prison, but as witness"). Cost is conceptual—continued solitude and burden—rather than a forfeited live option or decisive reversal. Escalation reads as deepening under the Accumulative lens but lacks a second reversal or agency-driven turn that narrows options before the ending; most pressure is accumulated exposition rather than tactical friction. The resolution is Earned Stasis with felt conceptual cost but no causal link to an on-page sacrifice or choice that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme (silence vs. speech, witness vs. abandonment, the weight of the unsaid) emerges through the apiary, the covenant scroll, and the protagonist's patient vigil. The final exchange—"Keep it, not as prison, but as witness"—reweights the covenant without stating a moral, and the closing image ("silence and meaning, each holding the other in careful, astonished trust") offers a resonant, non-literal answer. No thematic echo in prompt language. Minor: some thematic phrasing leans abstract ("mute eloquence," "texture of our silence") rather than anchored purely in concrete particulars, and a few lines risk borderline sermonizing ("promises of return, bargains with thirst") though they remain integrated.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person, perceptual signature is consistent (silence, bee imagery, "contextual clues"), and diction remains elevated and slightly archaic in a coherent way ("tranquilly perceptive," "fogged mirrors"). Mara's dialogue is sparse and ethereal, appropriate to a ghost; the protagonist's interiority modulates with the encounter. Minor: some filter verbs ("I sensed," "I understood") and exposition ("because you could bear the quiet we could not") slightly dull immediacy in key beats, and the protagonist's voice occasionally drifts into abstract summary ("the true covenant: not between the living and the dead, but between silence and meaning") rather than staying grounded in immediate perception.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies; sentence openings are diverse; information density is high. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent ("wind hissed… with a kind of mute eloquence," "colors pulsed like slow bees," "her voice weaving around my ears like smoke too tired to rise"). Minor issues: some paraphrase loops ("The covenant was tangled because their desires had been" echoes "Every unsent letter… glowed before me"), occasional metaphor density in reflective passages risks slowing momentum ("a bee that chose not to sting" is vivid but adds ornament at a contemplative beat), and a few phrases lean stock ("fogged mirrors," "dust motes into brief constellations"). No major artifact touching closure; beats remain legible.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of beekeeping, ghosts, stained glass covenant, and the theme of unspoken words feels specific and non-obvious. The final reconfiguration—covenant as witness rather than prison—is earned through the protagonist's patient observation and Mara's acceptance. The piece commits fully to its premise and follows the implications (ghosts linger, protagonist stays). Minor: the core setup (ghosts bound by regret, lone keeper in wasteland) has echoes of familiar post-apocalyptic and haunting templates; transformation is present but incremental rather than bold, and the emotional arc is more contemplative than risk-taking.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The protagonist (astonished recluse) is present throughout, signals early, and makes one key choice at closure: keeping the box as witness after Mara's request. The decision alters the meaning of the vigil (prison → witness) with conceptual cost (ongoing solitude, burden). Two gates met (setup, closure); middle development is observational rather than choice-driven. Score guided by: early signal +0.5, one beat +0.4, closure linkage +1.0, specificity +0.4, cost connection +0.5 = ~6.8 raw; subtract −0.4 for middle passivity. Rounds to 6.4.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The stained glass box appears early (setup), is described in detail, and is opened at the climax, causing light to bend through Mara and reveal the covenant's grooves. Three beats: introduction, protagonist's daily witness, climax opening. Causal pressure: opening the box visualizes the covenant and enables Mara's final request. Closure linkage: the box's role as witness is reweighted in the final exchange. Score guided by: early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +1.2, specificity +0.6 = ~7.8 raw. Rounds to 7.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The tangled covenant is introduced early, shapes the protagonist's motive (preserve it), and is visualized when the box opens. It constrains the protagonist's choice to keep the box rather than let Mara read/claim it, and is reweighted as witness at closure. Three gates met (setup, middle tension, closure). Score guided by: early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +0.8, closure linkage +1.0, specificity +0.5, cost connection +0.4 = ~7.2 raw; subtract −0.6 for covenant functioning more as thematic frame than on-page tactical constraint (protagonist never faces a decision to destroy/release it). Rounds to 6.6.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The attribute (tranquilly perceptive) is stated early and colors the protagonist's observation of ghosts and the covenant's grooves ("I understood them anyway, through contextual clues"). It enables the protagonist to read Mara's intentions and the scroll without speech. Two gates met (setup, middle use); closure reprise is implicit (protagonist's continued witness role). Score guided by: early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +0.6 (enables understanding but does not constrain a live choice with cost), specificity +0.4 = ~6.4 raw; subtract −0.6 for label-only mentions and no visible tradeoff or cost tied to the trait. Rounds to 5.8.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Gazing appears in multiple beats (protagonist gazes at the box daily, gazes during Mara's visit, the final exchange is framed by patient witness). The act of gazing enables the protagonist to perceive the covenant's meaning and supports the witness role reweighted at closure. Three gates met (setup, middle, closure). Score guided by: early signal +0.5, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +0.7 (gazing as method of understanding but not a tactical constraint), closure linkage +0.9 = ~6.5 raw; subtract −0.3 for swappability (could be "watch," "study," "observe" with minor edits and similar effect). Rounds to 6.2.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The method (through contextual clues) is signaled early ("I read their intentions… through contextual clues") and used when the protagonist decodes the covenant's grooves ("I understood them anyway, through contextual clues stitched from years of watching bees"). Two gates met (setup, middle use); closure reprise is implicit (protagonist's witness role depends on this perceptual method). Score guided by: early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +0.6 (enables understanding but does not constrain a choice), specificity +0.5 = ~6.5 raw; subtract −0.4 for being more a perceptual mode than a dramatized constraint with cost. Rounds to 6.1.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The apiary is introduced immediately, provides the spatial anchor for all action, and the hives/shed/box form the setting for the protagonist's vigil and Mara's manifestation. The wasteland context frames isolation and the ghosts' inability to leave. Three gates met (setup, middle, closure). Score guided by: early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +0.8 (setting enables the vigil and frames the covenant's stakes), closure linkage +0.7, specificity +0.6 = ~7.2 raw; subtract −0.1 for the wasteland functioning more as backdrop than live constraint on tactics. Rounds to 7.1.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The timeframe (after ghosts become visible) is stated in the opening and situates the story after a prior shift, but the "after" functions as static backstory rather than a tightening clock. No ticking deadline or time-driven escalation; the protagonist's years-long vigil and Mara's arrival "that morning" are vague. Two gates met (setup, implied at closure); middle development does not use time pressure. Score guided by: early signal +0.4, one beat +0.4, closure linkage +0.3 (time frame implied in final witness role) = ~4.1 raw; subtract −0.3 for vague tracking and no tactical constraint from time. Rounds to 3.8; however, the "after" frame does charge the thematic stakes (ghosts now visible but ignored protagonist), lifting to ~4.8. Rounds to 4.8.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The motivation (preserve unspoken words) is introduced early, drives the protagonist's vigil, and is tested when Mara asks the protagonist to keep the box. The final reweighting (witness, not prison) reframes the motive with conceptual cost (ongoing solitude, burden). Three gates met (setup, middle, closure). Score guided by: early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +1.3, cost connection +0.5 = ~7.8 raw; subtract −0.5 for motive being more stated and thematic than dramatized in a live choice with immediate friction (protagonist never faces temptation to abandon the vigil). Rounds to 7.3.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The tone (mute eloquence) is established immediately ("wind hissed… with a kind of mute eloquence") and sustained through the protagonist's reliance on silence and contextual clues. The final image ("silence and meaning, each holding the other in careful, astonished trust") charges the closure with this exact tone. Three gates met (setup, middle modulation via Mara's sparse speech, closure). Score guided by: early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +0.8 (tone shapes the protagonist's perceptual method and witness role), closure linkage +1.5, specificity +0.7 = ~8.1 raw; subtract −0.5 for occasional drift into abstract statement ("mute eloquence" itself risks being a label rather than fully embodied in every beat). Rounds to 7.6.</comment>
