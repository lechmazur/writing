<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's interiority is concrete and specific—polishing glass to carry grief, measuring "how much sorrow each can safely carry." Embodied contradiction appears in the pause to "weigh the shard…testing its heft against the ache in my chest." The final choice to share light with refugees is earned by the grandmother's loss and the prior village scene, foreclosing solitary mourning with visible cost. Minor slip: the "thin trembling place behind my sternum" risks over-articulation, though it stays within poetic voice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the protagonist opens the cloth, refugees' faces fill with glow, and the final image—"the world holds still, listening to its own heart learn a gentler way to shine"—reweights the opening vow with undeniable emotional cost. Accumulative/Textural lens inferred and held: density increases through memory layering, the polishing ritual deepens, and the cadence shift at closure charges prior material. Orientation anchors (grotto, mist, narrator's craft) arrive early and remain stable. One meaningful tightening: the memory of village children resurfaces and converges with present refugees, narrowing the narrator's path to this exact act.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The grotto functions as micro-setting: "walls slick and dark, breathing out ocean hush" and "mist folding like petals" constrain the ritual and charge the final image when refugees wait "where the mist hangs thickest." The polishing stone and basin anchor tactile action. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency: during memory the air is "tender sharpness that tugs loose a forgotten hour"; at closure, collective glow "press[es] faintly against my ribs." Spatial choreography is coherent throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—sharing light without fire—signals early ("sworn to map light that never burns") and tightens through the memory of raids, then deepens when the narrator approaches waiting refugees. The escalation is accumulative: each polished shard gathers pressure until the basin "brims with a shy galaxy." Agency is decision and endurance with visible cost: the narrator returns nightly "because I never found her again," foreclosing personal closure to serve others. The final act—opening the cloth—crystallizes the vow with felt price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: "light without fire" is not stated but shown through grandmother's sea glass, the village burning, and refugees' need. The final image—"the whole sky has bowed low enough for them to touch"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to how grief transforms into service. Subtext operates in "I polish glass because I never found her again" and the recurring motif of waves learning gentleness. No didactic summary; emotional truth anchors complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct: "earthbound star watcher," "constellations sleeping inside," and sensory anchors filtered through ritual attention. Psychic distance remains stable first-person throughout. Diction is purposeful—"serpentine," "zephyr bloom," "reflectively vibrant"—and voice-motivated, though density approaches overwriting in some lines ("fractured points arranging themselves into the pattern of her window"). No head-hopping; internal voice coherent under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Information density is high: most sentences layer action, memory, and sensory detail. Rhythm modulates well from reflective opening to charged closure. Minor overwriting: "veils of mist drift through the tunnels like slow comets" and "zephyr bloom" in close proximity risk figurative saturation without pattern-teaching. Template-cadence slip: "I begin to rub…I watch…I pause…I listen…I gather" runs of identical first-person stems across the middle third. No loops or scaffold; clarity remains high.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of gem polishing, refugee trauma, and inherited ritual feels specific and earned in hindsight. The grandmother's sea-glass vow transforms into the protagonist's nightly practice with visible logic. Risk: lyric density and non-linear memory threading could obscure, but the closure image remains legible. Freshness lies in "light without fire" as both literal craft and emotional stance, avoiding generic redemption arcs. The ending resists summarizing the moral.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The earthbound star watcher frames the opening, drives the polishing ritual across multiple beats, and makes the final decision to approach refugees. Choices include returning nightly despite grief, measuring sorrow each shard can carry, and opening the cloth—all alter tactics and foreclose solitary mourning. Present in setup, middle constraint (listening "with the thin trembling place behind my sternum"), and closure action.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sea glass anchors the opening basin, grandmother's memory ("turning a shard…between her fingers"), the polishing action ("milky green and dull…grows reflectively vibrant"), and the final distribution to refugees. Its evolving state—from dull to glowing—drives escalation. Removal would collapse the craft, the inheritance link, and the closure image. Irreplaceable and charged across at least four distinct beats.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The pearl of stillness appears once explicitly: "shine without flame, gleaming like a pearl of stillness held in the throat of the cave." It reweights the basin's transformation and charges the grotto's function as sanctuary. Setup and payoff present; middle constraint weak. Lyric reprise without mid-scene use, but the return anchors the ending's tone and stakes. Swappable language could reduce it, yet "stillness" vs. "fire" distinction matters.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Reflectively vibrant describes the worked glass: "the shard grows reflectively vibrant, catching threads of dim light." The trait enables the final effect—refugees' faces "fill with that cool, reflectively vibrant glow"—and distinguishes polished from raw shards. Present in middle action and closure; constraints what the narrator can offer. Not ornamental; removal would flatten the transformation. Minor: could substitute "luminous" with small edits.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Weighing occurs explicitly: "I pause to weigh the shard in my hand, testing its heft against the ache in my chest." This moment articulates the narrator's method—balancing brightness and sorrow—and sets up the final distribution choice. Present in middle beat and implicit at closure when shards are gathered and given. Causal: the weighing determines readiness. Swapping to "examine" would weaken the cost metaphor but not break structure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Gem polishing is signaled early ("My craft is gem polishing"), detailed mechanically ("rub the glass in slow circles…flat and dark stone…fine sand"), drives the middle transformation beats, and produces the glowing shards distributed at closure. Mechanics matter: the rhythm, the listening, the gradual brightening. Removal would erase the protagonist's agency and the story's central action. Essential across setup, development, and payoff.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The serpentine grotto in mist anchors all action: "walls slick and dark, breathing out ocean hush," "mist drift[ing] through tunnels," and "deepest curve…where the mist hangs thickest" where refugees wait. Setting provides concealment, ritual space, and sensory pressure ("tender sharpness," "zephyr bloom"). The coiling structure mirrors the narrator's returning path. Present throughout; shapes tactics (nightly return) and charges the final image. Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>As memories resurface appears in the title position and triggers the grandmother flashback: "I close my eyes and, as memories resurface, the grotto becomes the cliffside village." The timeframe governs the narrative's dual-layer structure—present ritual interleaved with past loss—and the memory's content (raids, sea glass gift) primes the closure act. Present in setup and causally tied to the ending's emotional charge. Not a ticking clock; more a threshold that unlocks motive. Could be implicit with edits.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>To share light without using fire is dramatized early ("sworn to map light that never burns"), tested in memory (village children needing courage without sparks), and fulfilled at closure (opening the glowing cloth). Internal conflict: "I polish glass because I never found her again"—the vow costs ongoing grief. Friction between wants (find grandmother) and enacted choice (serve others) is palpable. Drives all three gates and the final choice. Essential and irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Zephyr bloom modulates tone: "the air a zephyr bloom against my skin" at the ritual's center, and implicit in "tender sharpness" and "sky…bowed low" at closure. The tone remains soft, charged, and reverent throughout, tightening slightly as refugees appear but never breaking into harshness. Coherent across turns; charges the final image by maintaining gentleness under pressure. Not static; the bloom metaphor reweights light and air. Swappable with "gentle radiance" but loss of specificity would dilute.</comment>
