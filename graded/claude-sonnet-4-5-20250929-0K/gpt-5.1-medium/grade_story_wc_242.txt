<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lena's interiority is concrete and specific—"cultivated estrangement" shapes every choice, from spinning the glass disc to teaching endings how to begin differently. Her motivation to reshape Mara's loop is consistent with her isolation philosophy, and the final moment when she "sat in the tunnel's dim throat, listening as the city's distant circuits hummed with newly rearranged endings" shows earned satisfaction scaled to this length. Minor demerit: Mara remains a voice without embodied contradiction; her shift from loop to liberation feels slightly telescoped, though the stakes and cost remain legible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through layered images (glass disc, streetlamp flicker, loops) and deepens when Lena applies her method to Mara's specific crisis. Orientation is clear by ~80 words (tunnel booth, night, Lena alone). Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final image reweights the premise—"stories passed over the dark and did not fall"—with visible conceptual cost (Lena's solitude reconfigured as bridge, not exile). One meaningful tightening occurs when Mara's streetlamp synchronizes with Lena's instruction, narrowing options and charging the ending.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The subway utility tunnel constrains Lena's existence and charges the closure: "a narrow, echoing bridge where stories passed over the dark" transforms isolation into purpose. The glass disc is handled twice (opening solitude, then deepening tone for Mara), and the flickering streetlamp above Mara creates spatial pressure that Lena exploits for the final instruction. Sensory detail is filtered through Lena's priorities—"dripping dark," "chipped tiles," "thin electric pause"—and the micro-setting (booth alcove, rotary switchboard) grounds every beat without catalog bloat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: can Lena teach Mara to step sideways from the loop? Pressure coheres when Mara reveals she's under the streetlamp "now," raising immediate risk. The tightening is modest but legible: Lena presses harder on the glass disc and gives Mara a concrete synchronization task (lamp dims = affair ends; brightens = sister call). Cost is felt—Mara whispers "finally, dialing home"—and Lena's method forecloses passivity. Band guardrail met: the tightening forces a trade-off and the price charges the final image.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—loops as questions the past keeps asking until taught a different verb—emerges through concrete action (glass disc tone, streetlamp flicker, Mara's sister call) rather than statement. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer: the tunnel becomes "a narrow, echoing bridge where stories passed over the dark and did not fall," reweighting isolation as connection without moralizing. Cultivated estrangement is dramatized with visible cost (Lena's solitude buys her the skill to reshape others' endings), and the glass disc recurs with shifted meaning (solitary note → shared instruction tone).</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Lena; perceptual signature is distinct—"thin electric pause," "concrete throat," "melodically haunted tone"—and diction remains character-particular throughout. Dialogue (Mara's apology, Lena's metaphor "loops were not curses but questions") feels purposeful and advances the stake without exposition. Distance modulates intentionally: close on Lena's fingertip pressure, wider on the city's circuits. Minor slip: one phrase—"its coiled cord heavy as a chain"—slightly over-poeticizes a beat that needs propulsion, but voice control under pressure is otherwise exemplary.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is high—most lines do double duty (e.g., "the rising note threading into the line" advances tone and tactic). Opening and closing images anchor voice and stakes cleanly. Demerits: mild overwriting in early figurative clusters ("night hovered between the hum of streetlamps, a thin electric pause that made the darkness feel held instead of simply vacant") and a few template cadences ("she spun it… until a tone rose"; "she listened… then said"). No loops touch closure, but cumulative minor artifacts in the first third prevent entry to the 8+ band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis—phone booth operator as loop-breaker, glass harmonica as instruction tool, streetlamp flicker as synchronization cue—is specific and non-obvious. The premise transforms a familiar "stranger helps stranger" template through occupational specificity (rotary switchboard, maintenance line) and the cultivation-of-estrangement frame. Risk-taking is present: lyric diction and accumulative design heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. Mild proximity concern: "teach endings how to begin differently" echoes self-help idiom, but the on-page enactment (lamp dims/brightens, sister call) grounds it in lived particulars.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lena's role as underground phone booth operator frames every beat: she answers Line Four, deploys her taught method, and sits afterward listening to "newly rearranged endings." Her choices (spinning the disc, asking Mara where she stands, pressing harder to deepen tone, instructing the lamp-synchronization task) create all key turns. Closure hinges on her occupation—without the booth and switchboard, the story's logic collapses. Early signal, causal pressure across beats, closure linkage all present.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The glass harmonica disc appears in two distinct beats: opening solitude (Lena spins and strokes it for tone) and the call with Mara (the rising note threads into the line; Lena presses harder to deepen tone, instructing the synchronization). It returns in the closure unit ("Lena let the glass disc slow to stillness"), reweighting from private ritual to shared instruction tool. Setup, development, and payoff gates met. Mid-band ceiling: the disc enables rather than constrains; removing it would weaken tone but not break causality if Lena used voice alone.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Cultivated estrangement" is named once but enacted throughout: Lena trims contact into careful shapes, builds wrong-number friendships instead of proximity, and her final satisfaction is solitary—"sat in the tunnel's dim throat, listening." The concept shapes her stake (teach endings without stepping close) and her method (neutral script, strategic silence, detachment that paradoxically enables connection). It constrains her final choice—she does not pursue Mara further, only listens to the city's circuits. Early signal, beat involvement, closure linkage all present with visible cost (isolation as price and tool).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Melodically haunted" describes the glass disc's tone in the opening and when it threads into Mara's call. The tone enables Lena's instruction by creating atmospheric pressure, but no on-page action hinges on "haunted" versus another tonal quality. Present in two beats but functions as mood rather than constraint. Setup and development gates barely met; payoff participation is atmospheric only. Swappable with "plaintive" or "piercing" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The loop is the story's engine: Mara's affair "stuck in replay," Lena's mission to teach loops into different verbs, the streetlamp "looping from bright to dim like a failing memory," and the synchronization task that rewrites the loop around a sister's number. Major turns (Mara's decision to call her sister, Lena's satisfaction at newly rearranged endings) trace directly to loop-breaking. Early signal, causal pressure, closure participation all strong. Removing "loop" would require total rewrite; no near-synonym fits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Wrong number friendships" is signaled early (backstory on the first misdialed man, years of "a hidden loop of late-night voices") and Mara arrives via misdial. The method shapes Lena's identity and frames her stake, but the on-page call with Mara does not hinge on the misdial mechanism—Lena's instruction would work identically if Mara had dialed intentionally. Setup and thematic presence strong; middle development weak (the "wrong number" is mentioned but not leveraged as complication or resource). Payoff: Mara dials her sister correctly, but that's exit, not loop-closing irony tied to the method.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The subway utility tunnel anchors Lena's isolation ("concrete throat below the avenues," "dripping dark," booth alcove) and is reweighted at closure as "a narrow, echoing bridge where stories passed over the dark and did not fall." The setting supplies her occupation (underground phone booth), her tool (rotary switchboard), and the atmospheric cost (nobody topside remembers hiring her). Setup, development, and payoff gates met. Causal pressure: the tunnel's depth and invisibility enable her cultivated estrangement; removing it would break the story's spatial and thematic logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Between the hum of streetlamps" appears in the opening atmosphere and again when Mara describes "messages appeared between the hum of streetlamps, when the city's edges blurred." The timeframe sets mood but does not tighten decisions—no live clock pressures Lena or Mara, and the story could occur at any night hour. Present in setup and thematic echo but does not constrain middle tactics or charge the ending beyond tone. Functional but replaceable; "late night" would serve equivalently.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Lena's desire "to teach endings how to begin differently" is dramatized early (backstory on the insomniac, her decision that her true job was to reshape endings) and drives the entire Mara sequence: asking where she stands, instructing the lamp-synchronization task, and the final satisfaction when "the city's distant circuits hummed with newly rearranged endings." Motivation faces friction—Lena must balance detachment (cultivated estrangement) with intervention—and the cost is visible: she remains alone in the tunnel. Early signal, causal pressure across beats, closure linkage all strong.</comment>
