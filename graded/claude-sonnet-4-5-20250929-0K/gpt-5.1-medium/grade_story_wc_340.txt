<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Etta's interiority is concrete and character-specific, with her curiosity functioning as both strength and burden. Her motivation to "seek out the joy beneath anguish" drives her theft of the maintenance key and shapes her perception throughout. The final shift—carrying the diary's "method" rather than the object—demonstrates earned internal change. Minor weakness: the "affectionate detachment" toward nobles could be more embodied through contradictory impulses in a specific beat rather than stated as a quality she "hardly understood."</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with clear causal linkage: Etta's decision to steal the key enables the climb, the goggles enable decryption, the diary's method alters her interpretive stance. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): she returns "an ascending one, eyes tuned to the joy beneath anguish," reweighting her servant role with visible conceptual cost—she cannot steal the diary but must carry its invisible interpretive burden. Orientation anchors are clean by paragraph three. One meaningful deepening occurs when the encryption reveals itself as annotation rather than concealment, narrowing her understanding and transforming her goal.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The icebound spire functions as constraint and atmosphere: frost traces "silver ferns," the corridor is "frosted in pale, patient blue," and the observatory's rotating prisms create the scattered light essential to decryption. The goggles—micro-setting as tool—charge the final method by resolving chaotic colors into script. Sensory detail is filtered through Etta's servant priorities: she notices "dusted around them," "scrub-water cracks," creating lived-in specificity. The spire's cold and isolation pressure her limited time and constrain her choices at the lock.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—learning to read hidden joy—is signaled early and deepens when the lock requires "consolation more than force," a micro-reversal that transforms her approach from theft to empathy. The diary's revelation that "every cruelty be annotated with the small joys" narrows her understanding from seeking secrets to adopting a method, a meaningful tightening under the Accumulative lens. Agency is clear: her decision to close the diary "gently, not to steal it" forecloses the path of possession with visible cost—she returns empty-handed but cognitively altered. The timeframe (ten-floor climb) provides coherent pressure without requiring multiple reversals.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: the captain's method of annotating cruelty with joy, Etta's own "midnight songs in the laundry," the nobles' "quiet anguish that hid its own frightened joy." The diary functions as Conceptual Repricing—its encryption insists suffering and gladness coexist, reweighting Etta's interpretive stance without stating a moral. The final image—"eyes tuned to the joy beneath anguish"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the thematic question through sensory metaphor (tuned eyes) rather than declaration. The piece resists binary resolution; Etta remains a servant, but her perceptual frame has shifted with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice is consistent and textured: "an ascending servant by accident and stubborn, misdirected hope" establishes formal yet intimate third-person with purposeful compression. Psychic distance modulates cleanly from close observation ("the truer reason pressed at her chest") to wider framing ("she faced the descent as a servant still"). Perceptual signature is character-specific: she reads the nobles' complaints as "code for something truer," filtering the world through her inquisitive detachment. Minor slip: "affectionate detachment she hardly understood" leans slightly toward author explanation rather than dramatized contradiction, but the phrase is brief and doesn't obscure the POV.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally with strong propulsion: "The elevator hummed as it pierced the clouds" sets kinetic momentum. Information density is high—most lines advance setting, character, and stakes simultaneously. A few adjacent lines show minor paraphrase: "to seek out the joy beneath anguish" appears in paragraph 4, then "the joy beneath anguish in anyone" in paragraph 13, and returns in the final line; while purposeful as motif, the exact repetition without syntactic variation borders on template cadence. No filter-verb stacks or major loops touch closure. One figurative stretch: "breath a ghost ahead of her" is evocative but borders cliché; overall clarity remains high.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The premise—encrypted diary decoded via cracked goggles and scattered light—synthesizes familiar elements (sky-palace servant, forbidden knowledge) into a specific, non-obvious frame: the encryption as compassionate annotation rather than concealment. The emotional truth—that suffering and joy coexist and must be read simultaneously—feels earned rather than imposed. The transformation test holds: plot and arc would collapse if the diary were merely sad or the goggles merely decorative. Minor limitation: the "servant seeks forbidden knowledge" template is visible, though the piece transforms it through Etta's interpretive rather than revolutionary goal.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Etta is present throughout and her choices drive all major turns: stealing the key, timing the climb, using the goggles to decode the lock, pressing where the script brightens, and deciding not to steal the diary. Her decision to carry the method rather than the object is the story's pivotal closure choice, foreclosing possession with visible cost. Early signal, multi-beat involvement, causal pressure, and closure linkage all present.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The goggles appear early ("Around her neck hung the airship captain's goggles"), enable the lock decryption ("through the tinted glass the colors resolved into lines of script"), and facilitate the diary reading ("reading through scattered light as it fell across the paper, goggles amplifying each glint"). They constrain her method—without them, the encryption remains chaotic—and their "cracked yet tinted" state makes them irreplaceable. Three beats, causal pressure, closure linkage, and high specificity.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The encrypted diary is the goal from paragraph 10 ("Rumor claimed that in the spire's observatory, the last airship captain had left a diary so dangerous it was locked"), drives Etta's tactics at the lock and lectern, and delivers the thematic payload: the encryption's purpose reframes her understanding. However, "discovery" undersells what occurs—she reads and internalizes but does not take the diary. The concept shapes two major beats (lock, reading) and the closure reweighting. Setup, development, payoff present; causal pressure high.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Warmly inquisitive" is attributed early ("Her curiosity had always been warmly inquisitive") and motivates the theft, but on-page demonstration leans toward told quality. The trait enables her approach to the lock ("murmuring apologies and small kindnesses") and diary interpretation, but the visible cost is indirect—her warmth has been punished with "colder and colder work," a backstory claim. One clear choice (consoling the lock) shows the trait under pressure. Setup and development present; payoff implied through method adoption but not dramatized with sharp cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Unfold" structures the climactic beat: "the door unfolded slowly, petals of ice scraping aside" and the diary's pages "edged in symbols that shifted." The action is irreplaceable—no other verb would carry the petal/revelation layering—and it redefines Etta's access to the diary. Present in two major beats (door, metaphorical unfolding of meaning) and charges the closure by framing her cognitive shift as an unfolding. Setup at door, payoff in final understanding. High specificity and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Through scattered light" is seeded when the goggles reveal "seams others did not see," developed as the observatory's "rotating prisms painted frantic colors," and operationalized when "she angled the diary beneath the spinning prism above, reading through scattered light as it fell across the paper." The method is irreplaceable—without prism and goggles, the encryption remains opaque. It shapes her attempt at the lock and the diary reading. Setup, development, and payoff all present; causal pressure high. Minor: the method could be more constrained (does ambient light suffice, or only prism light?).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The icebound spire pressures Etta through cold ("her breath a ghost ahead of her"), isolation (no guards appear, amplifying her agency), and verticality (the ten-floor climb creates urgency). The observatory's rotating prisms supply the essential scattered light. The setting is irreplaceable—a ground-level archive would not provide prism mechanics or isolation. Setup at ascent, development through cold and empty corridor, payoff via prism. The spire constrains access and supplies resources; high integration.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The ten-floor climb is signaled early ("the elevator climbs ten floors without stopping") and brackets the narrative, creating a time constraint. The timeframe motivates her theft timing and implies urgency, but the clock is not tightened on the page—no countdown or pressure from the elevator's return. The frame returns at closure ("faced the descent"), providing structure. Setup and payoff present; development weak (no mid-climb pressure test). Functional but not causal in shaping tactics beyond initial timing.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The motivation is dramatized early ("the truer reason pressed at her chest: to seek out the joy beneath anguish") and tested when the diary reveals its method: "every cruelty be annotated with the small joys that survived beside it." Etta's friction between wanting the diary and adopting its invisible method creates visible cost—she returns without proof but with altered perception. The desire structures all three acts: theft, decryption, renunciation. Setup, development, payoff with felt cost. High causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Affectionate detachment" is established toward the nobles ("she dusted around them with an affectionate detachment she hardly understood") and modulates when she extends it to the door ("murmuring apologies and small kindnesses") and the captain's memories. The tone charges the final image: she returns "an ascending one," detached from possession yet affectionate toward hidden meaning. Present across beats, coherent through turns, and reweighted at closure. Minor: the phrase "hardly understood" slightly externalizes the tone rather than embodying it through contradictory action.</comment>
