<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Corin's interiority is embodied through gesture and choice (sliding the bookmark into the mold, opening the kiln, placing the vessel on the console). His motivation is particularized—the shift from precision lenses to "safe zones for inquiry"—and arrives with visible cost: "each perfect circle he shaped seemed to tighten around his own chest." The narrator's evolving stance is less fully dramatized; the final shift ("felt my own cautious heart shift, slightly, within its ribs") reads earned but registers as conceptual more than enacted. Minor diagnostic label-speak ("weighty lightness") skirts but does not cross into therapy-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation is legible within ~120 words (abandoned control room, glassblower, cold morning). The piece accumulates through motif reprise (ice, heart, control/invitation) and cadence shift; the final image—vessel on console, invitation to return—delivers Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with undeniable cost: the protagonist's cautious heart shifts, options crystallize. One meaningful deepening occurs when Corin explains the shift from targeting lenses to vessels that "cradle questions." Closure is on the page, cost is felt, and the lens holds.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The abandoned control room constrains choice: cables, dead panels, icicles, and consoles frame the transformation from command center to inquiry space. The kiln, bookmark, and melting ice are micro-setting elements that charge the final image (the vessel placed on a console "like a crown laid sideways"). Sensory detail is vivid and selective: "water ticked and slipped from metal like hesitant thoughts." Spatial choreography is coherent throughout. The setting directly shapes the thematic closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early: transforming a place of certainty into a safe zone for inquiry. One meaningful tightening occurs when Corin narrates his shift from blowing targeting lenses to crafting vessels for unfinished thoughts, narrowing his options and foreclosing the old precision work. The protagonist's final choice to return and "bring someone who thinks they are uninteresting" crystallizes agency with felt cost: stepping into a question that warms itself. Escalation is driven by protagonist observation and receptivity; coincidence does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through image and action: control versus invitation, certainty versus inquiry, ice (frozen heart) thawing into new shapes. The bookmark's transformation—cracked spine becoming translucent vessel—is concrete and particular, avoiding abstraction. The final image ("stepping into a question that warms itself") offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture and silence: "dramatically narrating mundane tasks" slips past defenses. No thematic echo mars the ending.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>POV is stable (single first-person); perceptual signature is distinct ("I apologized out of habit," "felt my own cautious heart shift"). Corin's dialogue carries distinct idiom and theatricality ("as if announcing the weather on a stage no one had paid to enter"). Purposeful compression and lyric cadence are taught early and sustained. Minor filter-verb use ("seemed to tighten") is voice-motivated and does not dull immediacy. Diction remains within POV lexicon; no head-hopping or unmotivated register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; opening and closing lines anchor voice and charge the final image. Information density is high: most lines advance character, atmosphere, or theme. Minor overwriting appears in runs of figurative language ("Light crept through fractured windows, catching dust and frost, turning the dead panels into dim, watching faces"; "water ticked and slipped from metal like hesitant thoughts")—not incoherent, but dense enough to slightly slow momentum in two beats. No loops, no scaffold. Sentence openings vary; paragraph structure modulates with pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Core premise—glassblower repurposing a control room into an inquiry space during thaw—is specific and non-obvious. The bookmark's metamorphosis into a translucent spine anchoring a vessel for breath is particular to this voice and setting. "Dramatically narrating mundane tasks" as a method to reveal values is fresh and earns its place. The transformation from targeting lenses to question-vessels grounds the thematic shift in concrete occupational detail. Risk-taking in pacing and lyric compression heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
