<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's interiority is concrete and her project is motivated, but her choices feel observational rather than genuinely conflicted under pressure. The invitation to Jonas and her confession arrive without visible internal contradiction or cost that would foreclose a path. The final collaborative mapping reads more as a shared activity than a decision that forces her to sacrifice or transform; the "tired curve of relief" is embodied but the stakes of letting him in remain abstract. Backstory about the grandmother and the project is substantial but anchored to present objects (tape, cards) and does prime the confessional beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates atmosphere and thematic density through card readings, whispers, and the measuring-tape ritual, ending with a collaborative map that reweights the premise from solitary diagnosis to shared construction. Orientation is clean (who, where, when established early). The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final image of placing cards "along the shared axis" and sketching "a way sideways into something patiently unknown" crystallizes a shift from Mara's solo project to a joint venture. However, the cost is felt rather than visible—no on-page forfeiture or tactical change in the ending beat itself, only the affective charge of "relief" and shared effort. Under the accumulative lens, this cadence shift and density reweighting satisfy closure, but the faintness of enacted cost at the exact ending moment caps the score.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The rain-beaded skylight, dangling cables, scarred floorboards, and measuring tape create a vivid, purposeful micro-setting. The tape's placement "between two cracked tiles, aligning its zero with the north-facing window" grounds Mara's ritual in spatial specificity. The skylight's water-bead trajectories anchor the thematic claim about "analog time between the drips," and Jonas's kneeling near the tape at the thirty-three mark integrates setting into the confessional beat. The final image ("zero lay between them") charges the closure by literalizing shared origin in the room's geometry. One minor gap: the loft's emergency-power hum and obsolete machines are vivid but remain atmospheric rather than constraining a choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Mara's project to map cultural patterns after the crash—is signaled early and sustained. The story tightens once when Jonas asks to be taught and Mara shifts from solitary mapping to collaboration, narrowing her stance from diagnosis to shared construction. Under the Accumulative lens, this deepening reweights the project's meaning. However, the tightening is more thematic than tactical: no on-page price is paid (no forfeited solitude, no tactical loss), and Jonas's request is granted without friction or trade-off. The final collaborative placement of cards is a meaningful gesture but lacks the felt cost of an option foreclosed or a visible sacrifice that would lift escalation into the high 7s.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the premise: "cultures are just conversations repeated until they calcify," "vertical empires...coded, not carved," "multiplying paths...so they do not fall so far." The measuring tape and card spreads embody the project without overt moralizing until the final exchange, where Mara's explanation ("we keep repeating this one," "I want to see which cultures can grow sideways") edges close to thesis articulation. The closing image—"a way sideways into something patiently unknown"—offers a resonant answer to the central question without a stated moral. The piece resists false complexity, but the explanatory dialogue in the penultimate third dilutes subtext slightly, preventing full 8+ entry.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization is stable and Mara's perceptual signature is distinct: "candle-smudged focus," "inked lines like braille beneath her skin," attention to the tape's faded numbers and the skylight's comet-like drips. Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven ("You still live like the grid might never come back" / "Listen closely enough...you can hear the city relearning analog time"), with subtext in Jonas's mix of "skepticism and hope." The prose rhythm modulates with emotional intensity, shortening at the confession and opening again at the collaborative close. One friction: Mara's explanatory lines ("I am reverse engineering how we believed money could replace meaning") inch toward thesis articulation, slightly flattening the voice-as-character texture in a key beat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and imagery is fresh ("cables dangled like ivy," "water beaded and traveled the glass like cautious comets," "tiny figures toppled without parachutes"). Information density is high; most lines advance atmosphere, character, or theme. Minor scaffolding appears: "She called it reverse engineering belief, teasing structure from the scattered data of human desire" and the subsequent line both describe the project in adjacent sentences without added pressure. The phrase "a black lattice of streets folding into a spiral staircase" is vivid but edges toward overwriting in a reflective beat. No major loops or template cadence, and the final image propels cleanly. The prose is strong but not flawless.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of cartomancy, measuring tape as inherited tool, and post-crypto collapse setting is specific and non-obvious. The "onyx-ink sigil" and the ritual of aligning tape with compass points feel particular to this voice and world. The turn from solitary mapping to collaborative construction is earned in hindsight by Jonas's recurring presence and Mara's thematic question. The premise avoids template predictability, and the "sideways" cultural growth metaphor is fresh. However, the core emotional arc—expert alone, then joined—echoes familiar mentor-invites-student beats, and the ending's satisfaction is gentle rather than boldly risky. Within-band risk distinction does not apply; the piece is inventive but not boundary-pushing.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara is present throughout, deals cards at multiple beats (opening spiral, Tower/Fool/sigil trio, final collaborative placement), and her decision to invite Jonas and teach him drives the ending. The cartomancy is her method and identity, shaping her stance and the closure image. However, her choices feel more illustrative than conflicted; the final collaborative act is a meaningful turn but lacks on-page cost or tactical sacrifice. Early signal strong, beat involvement high, closure linkage present, but causal pressure is moderate because the decision to share is granted without friction.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The measuring tape appears in the opening ritual (stretched between tiles, aligned with the north window), is touched by Jonas at thirty-three, and returns in the final beat when Mara slides it "so that zero lay between them." Three distinct beats, with evolving use: solitary tool → object of curiosity → shared axis. The tape's inherited origin and its role in aligning cards to cultural trajectories give it specificity. It charges the final image by literalizing the collaborative shift. Setup, development, and payoff all present; causal pressure moderate (it constrains ritual but does not narrow a hard choice).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Reverse engineering is named and explained ("teasing structure from the scattered data of human desire," "reverse engineering how we believed money could replace meaning") and shapes Mara's project throughout. It is present in multiple beats (card spreads, logging decisions, the final collaborative mapping) and defines the story's method. However, the concept functions more as thematic frame than on-page tactic: it does not create a hard choice or foreclose an option. Setup and development are strong, closure linkage present (the final map is reverse engineering in action), but causal pressure is thematic rather than tactical.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Steadily curious" is mentioned in the opening line and visible in Mara's willingness to invite Jonas and teach him. However, it remains largely label-only; no on-page moment dramatizes a trade-off between curiosity and caution, or shows curiosity enabling a risky choice with cost. The trait is consistent with her actions but does not constrain or complicate a key decision. Setup present, no clear development beat, minimal closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Confide" is signaled when Jonas asks "what do you need to confide that the cards cannot hold?" and Mara responds with her confession about mapping "the stories people tell after faith collapses" and the recursive pattern ("I think it is us"). This beat drives the turn to collaboration and shapes the ending. The confession is dramatized rather than summarized, and Jonas's request to be taught flows from it. Setup via Jonas's question, development in Mara's answer, payoff in the shared mapping. Causal pressure is moderate: the confession enables the ending but does not foreclose an alternate path with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Multiplying paths" is named twice: Mara "calculating by multiplying paths the ways cultures might reassemble" and "I am multiplying paths the old way, by hand, with stories and tape and ink." It defines her method and recurs in the final collaborative act ("sketching futures that wove his choices through hers"). Setup in the first third, thematic development in the confession, lyric reprise at closure. However, the mechanics are never shown in action—no on-page moment demonstrates the calculation or how it alters tactics. The method shapes theme but not a hard choice; it is told rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The rain-beaded skylight loft is established early and sustained: cables, screens, scarred floorboards, candle-smudged focus, the north-facing window anchor. The loft's verticality (three flights) and the skylight's water trajectories supply the metaphor for "analog time between the drips." The measuring tape's alignment with tiles and window integrates micro-setting into ritual. The final image ("in her rain-beaded skylight loft, another map quietly began to form") charges closure by grounding the collaborative turn in the same space. The loft does not constrain a choice but does charge the final image with continuity and intimacy. Setup, development, and payoff all strong; causal pressure moderate.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The cryptocurrency crash is established in the opening ("after the cryptocurrency crashes had gutted its glittering illusions," "emergency power") and provides context for Mara's project and the analog barter economy. It shapes the world-state and motivates the reverse-engineering stake. However, the timeframe does not tighten a decision or alter tactics on the page; the crash is backdrop rather than live clock. Setup strong, thematic presence throughout, but no moment where the post-crash conditions force a tactical choice with cost. Lyric-resonance use; functional but not causal at closure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"To map cultural patterns" is named early, repeated in the confession ("I am mapping the stories people tell after faith collapses"), and drives the ending collaborative map. Mara's desire is dramatized through her nightly ritual and the invitation to Jonas. However, the motivation is not visibly conflicted—no friction between the mapping project and a competing want or fear. The final collaborative turn reweights the project from solo to shared but does not enact a trade-off or forfeiture. Setup, development, and payoff all present; causal pressure moderate because the want is pursued without visible cost or obstacle.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Inherited mystery" is established through the grandmother, the measuring tape, and the loft "thick with the dust of inherited mystery." The tone of patient, ritual-driven inquiry coheres through the card spreads and the confession. It modulates slightly when Jonas enters (shifts to dialogue and shared discovery) but remains consistent. The final image ("patiently unknown") echoes the opening's mystery. Tone charges the ending by sustaining the atmosphere of quiet, collaborative exploration. Setup and payoff strong; development present in the sustained ritual mood. However, the tone is more static than dynamic—no sharp modulation under peak pressure—so it trends mid-band.</comment>
