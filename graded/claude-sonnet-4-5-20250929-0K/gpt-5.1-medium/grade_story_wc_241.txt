<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's interiority is concrete and contradictory—"theoretically rebellious, the kind of coward who questions rules but obeys them" feels earned. Her final micro-choice to write the response note shows character-specific hierarchy of values (mathematical framing meets emotional risk). Father's hand-twitch during sedation and the lantern-note pilgrimage deepen him beyond the gambler archetype. Minor: the surgeon's "after the heart attack" phrase and some reflective blocks threaten to summarize rather than dramatize, but the ending action forecloses evasion with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the narrator's counter-note ("we stay anyway, because staying changes them") reconfigures the premise's odds-versus-safety binary with felt cost—she commits to shared uncertainty. The piece follows an Accumulative lens taught early (layered notes, scrawls, reflections building density) and sustains it through the hospital encounter. Orientation anchors arrive by the second paragraph (library, post-heart-attack timeframe, professor daughter). One meaningful deepening: the subway scrawls reweight her journey from evasion to engagement, and the final exchange crystallizes stance with undeniable pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Rainwashed library, subway car, and hospital room are vividly specific ("wet wool, printer ink, something sweetly green, like crushed clover") and filter through the narrator's probability-professor lens. The candle lantern's mica pane charges the discovery beat, and the subway scrawls function as micro-setting that alters her route and mood. Father's chip-shuffle gesture in sedation and the styrofoam-cup bedside anchor the hospital scene. Minor: some sensory details (stone lions, smeared comets) approach catalog without pressing choice, but the clover-bright final image recharges the opening atmosphere.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether to return to the hospital and what stance to take toward her father's post-crisis life—is signaled early and tightens through the library discovery and subway journey. The narrator's final note-writing is protagonist-driven agency that forecloses evasion and crystallizes a shared-risk ethic. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens: each found message (his note, subway scrawls) deepens the question of whether odds can be "changed" by staying. One visible cost: she abandons professional safety ("grading exams") and theoretical distance to write vulnerability on paper. The father's nod and smile provide a micro-turn that complicates without resolving.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: probability as shared language, lucid contradictions embodied in gambler's library pilgrimages and professor's casino visits, notes hidden in "lucky places" versus "drab corners." The closing line—"The odds are terrible, but we stay anyway, because staying changes them"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing; it reprices risk and responsibility through the narrator's specific expertise. Subtext operates in the father's silence, his frown-then-smile, and the way the city's scrawls feel "arranged for me." Minor: the phrase "lucid contradictions" borders on thesis-statement, but it's filtered through the father's voice and tested via plot rather than asserted.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct and consistent: probability framing ("house edge versus hope," "data set"), selective attention to numeric readouts, and metaphors drawn from gambling and teaching. Psychic distance modulates purposefully—close interior during reflection, wider during transit. The father's dialogue ("my lantern trick," "gambling without cash") carries subtext and character-specific idiom. Minor: some filter verbs ("I watched," "I told them") could sharpen, and the phrase "as if time had split" drifts toward abstraction. Purposeful compression in the subway-scrawl sequence reads as intentional elision that pays off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and sensory specificity is high ("mica pane shimmered between the flames and the dim fluorescent ceiling"). Information density is strong in beats like the note discovery and subway-scrawl accumulation. However, minor paraphrase loops appear: "I was supposed to be grading exams" / "the exams lay facedown" restates inaction, and "compulsive gambler" / "chased impossible odds with manic devotion" risks synonym churn. The final image ("scrubbed but not renewed, a little sad, clover bright") recharges opening motifs cleanly. Template cadence in reflective stretches ("He used it to justify risk; I used it to design safety nets") slightly dulls momentum, warranting −0.6 for patterned-artifact presence, but artifacts do not touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The premise—probability professor daughter of a gambler, post-heart-attack—gains freshness through the "lucid contradictions" frame and the city-wide note experiment. The library pilgrimage and subway scrawls as data-ethnography feel specific and voice-grounded. The final note exchange transforms the father-daughter dynamic via their shared mathematical idiom without retreating into sentiment. Minor: the core gamblers-and-odds territory is well-trod; transformation comes through occupational detail (probability teaching, survival curves) and the quiet stakes rather than radical structural risk. Within-band, the note-as-intervention conceit earns +0.3 for specificity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The character is seeded early (first paragraph) and her choices drive the arc: she delays returning to the hospital, traverses the library and subway, and writes the counter-note that crystallizes stance. Her profession shapes perception (numeric readouts, odds framing) and her reflection on "cautious lecturer" versus casino visits creates internal friction. The final note-writing is a decisive micro-choice that alters the relational dynamic with visible cost (abandoning professional distance). Present across three beats (library, subway, hospital) with causal pressure and closure linkage. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +0.9, closure linkage +1.2, cost +0.4 = ~4.5 base; trait specificity (probability lens, theoretically rebellious) adds +0.6; lyric coherence +0.3. Minor: her profession is more thematic filter than plot constraint, capping upward reach slightly.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The candle lantern with mica pane appears in one key beat (archives reading room discovery) and is vividly described ("shimmered between the flames and the dim fluorescent ceiling, a trembling rectangle of clouded light"). The narrator interacts with it (blows it out, pockets the note beneath it), and it signals the father's secret library visits, reweighting her understanding of him. However, it does not return or constrain later action; no middle development or closure participation. Setup +0.6, one beat +0.4, specificity +0.5 = ~1.5 base; vivid handling +0.4; reweights knowledge +0.6. Missing middle and closure gates cap at ~5.2 per guidance; ornamental after discovery −0.3. Swappable with any lamp or marker −0.2.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Lucid contradictions" is seeded via the father's note in the archives and recurs as his explanation of the city-note experiment ("Pessimistic phrases hidden in lucky places, hopeful ones tucked into drab corners"). It shapes the narrator's journey—her own contradiction between evasion and engagement—and the final note embodies the concept ("The odds are terrible, but we stay anyway"). Present across three beats (discovery, subway reflection, hospital exchange) with thematic and tactical pressure. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure (shapes her interpretive stance) +0.8, closure linkage +1.0, specificity +0.5 = ~4.3 base; thematic charge +0.6; final-image reprise +0.8. Minor: the phrase borders on label-only at first mention, and its mechanics (contradictions as stakes) are more felt than enacted −0.3.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Theoretically rebellious" is introduced early as self-description ("the kind of coward who questions rules but obeys them") and shapes her stance: she visits casinos (minor rebellion) but delays the hospital (obedience to avoidance). The trait constrains her final choice—writing the note is a micro-rebellion that costs her professional safety and theoretical distance. Present in two beats (library reflection, final exchange). Setup +0.6, two beats +0.9, causal pressure (enables risky note-writing) +0.7, closure linkage +0.8, cost +0.4 = ~3.4 base; specificity (probability framing) +0.5; voice integration +0.4. However, the trait is more told than dramatized in action; the note-writing could plausibly occur without this exact framing −0.4. Swappable with "cautious" or "risk-averse" −0.3.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Traverse" structures the entire piece: she traverses library aisles, subway corridors, and finally the hospital. Each traversal narrows options—library to subway to hospital—and the final arrival enables the note exchange that closes the arc. The action is seeded early (wandering stacks), recurs across all major beats, and is causally necessary (she must move through these spaces to encounter the notes and reach the father). Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure (movement enables discovery) +1.1, closure linkage (arrival at hospital) +1.0, irreplaceability +0.6 = ~4.8 base; spatial coherence across settings +0.5; pattern taught and paid off +0.6. Minor: "traverse" as verb choice feels slightly elevated for the action (walking, wandering), but it integrates cleanly across the spatial logic.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The method—interpreting cryptic subway scrawls—is introduced midway and shapes one key beat: the narrator reads two messages ("DO NOT DOUBLE DOWN ON SORROW," "Everything is rigged, but the feelings are real") that guide her mood and route toward the hospital. The scrawls function as data-set ethnography consistent with her character. However, they arrive after the first third, do not constrain middle choices, and do not return at closure. Late arrival (second third) −0.3, one beat +0.4, causal pressure (alters mood/route) +0.7, specificity (data-set idiom) +0.5 = ~1.3 base; voice integration +0.4; thematic link (father's note experiment) +0.5. Missing setup and closure gates cap at ~4.6 per guidance; the method feels auxiliary rather than indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The rainwashed library at midsummer is established in the opening paragraph and provides the discovery site for the candle lantern and the father's note, which reweights the narrator's understanding and propels her toward the hospital. Setting details (wet wool, stone lions, "ship in thick fog") filter through her perception and create atmospheric pressure. Present across two beats (opening/discovery, exit to subway). Early signal +0.8, two beats +0.9, causal pressure (note discovery shapes journey) +1.0, specificity (midsummer, clover scent, archives room) +0.7 = ~3.4 base; micro-setting (lantern, desk) +0.5; final-image echo (clover bright) +0.6. The setting does not constrain tactics beyond providing the discovery site, capping upward reach slightly −0.2.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The timeframe—"after the heart attack"—is signaled in the opening line and structures all choices: the father lies sedated, the narrator delays returning, and the surgeon's phrase ("after the heart attack") creates a before/after split that the ending attempts to reconcile. The timeframe tightens decisions (brother's texts, pulse/pressure readouts) and charges the closure (father's first words post-sedation). Present across three beats (opening, transit, hospital). Early signal +0.8, three beats +1.4, causal pressure (urgency, delay, arrival) +1.0, closure linkage (father wakes) +0.9 = ~4.1 base; thematic weight (time splitting) +0.5; cost connection (delay = avoidance with price) +0.4. However, the timeframe is more frame than live clock; no moment-to-moment pressure from elapsed time −0.3.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The motivation—"to widen perspectives responsibly"—is articulated early ("I wanted to widen perspectives responsibly, his and mine both, without giving either of us permission to escape consequences") and informs her teaching method and her approach to the father. The final note embodies this: she offers a perspective shift ("staying changes them") that neither escapes consequences nor doubles down on sorrow. Present in two beats (library reflection, hospital note-writing). Setup +0.6, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.9, cost (abandons safety for vulnerability) +0.4 = ~2.8 base; thematic coherence +0.5; voice integration (probability idiom) +0.5. However, the phrasing is abstract and told rather than dramatized in choices until the ending −0.5; the motivation could be inferred without the explicit statement −0.3.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Clover melancholy" is established through sensory detail ("something sweetly green, like crushed clover") in the opening and returns in the final image ("a little sad, clover bright"), framing the entire arc. Tone modulates purposefully: stunned gray at the start, whispering corridors in transit, humming monitors at the hospital, then "scrubbed but not renewed" at closure. The sweetness-and-sadness blend coheres across beats without flattening into single static mood. Early signal +0.8, three beats (library, subway, hospital) +1.4, closure charge +1.3, specificity (clover as scent/color) +0.7 = ~4.2 base; rhythmic control under pressure +0.6; final-image reprise reweights opening +0.9. The tone is indispensable to the piece's emotional logic and charges the ending without obscuring clarity.</comment>
