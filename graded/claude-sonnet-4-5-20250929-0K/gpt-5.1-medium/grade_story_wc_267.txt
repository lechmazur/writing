<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's interiority is specific and embodied throughout—"nerves knitting," "curiosity had already loosened the vow inside me," ribs "bending like bad questions." Internal contradictions drive the protagonist's arc: sworn silence versus the need to understand cost, obedience versus emerging agency. The final choice to speak ("Enough") is earned by the accumulated realizations on the staircase and forecloses the path of complicity with visible cost (bones shattering, nerves screaming). Minor deduction for the woman's backstory ("I died on your stairs") which introduces complexity but does not fully dramatize her role in the narrator's memory until the wall-touch moment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands on the page as Decisive Change: the narrator speaks, fortress cracks, snow roars in, and safety is renounced with immediate physical cost ("bones shattered again, as nerves screamed awake"). The piece teaches its lens early—Causal with lyric density—and holds it: bolt discovery → staircase descent → memory trigger → decision → consequence. Orientation anchors (who: bellhop; where: lobby/staircase; when: during regeneration) arrive within the first ~100 words. One micro turn (woman's revelation) deepens the dominant stake (understanding cost of safety) without fragmenting pressure. The final image reweights the premise: "safety had never been the fortress at all, but the courage to leave it."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The cobalt fortress, revolving lobby, spiral staircase, and snow function as active setting elements that constrain and charge the narrative. The bolt "chillingly cold, etched with a tiny engraving of a spiral staircase" pulls the protagonist toward the forbidden descent. The bruise-purple discoloration on the staircase wall triggers embodied memory ("ice give way, stone rush upward, ribs bending"). The spatial choreography is clean: lobby → service corridor → spiral staircase → wall mark, with snow breaking in at closure. The fortress architecture (no doors, echoes, soundproofing) directly shapes the central conflict (silence as sentence). Minor deduction: "cobalt" and specific visual detail could be more causally leveraged in the middle beats.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—understanding the cost of safety and the price of silence—is signaled early and tightens through one decisive turn: the protagonist leads the woman to the forbidden staircase, risking the vow. Pressure escalates via agency: picking up the bolt, choosing to tilt head in question, descending despite regulations, touching the wall, and finally speaking. The woman's challenge ("If you speak, storms will know this place") forces a live trade-off between complicity and destruction. The final act (speaking "Enough") is protagonist-driven, forecloses safety, and delivers immediate visible cost: "bones shattered again, as nerves screamed awake." No coincidence resolves the conflict; the fortress's response to the broken vow is causally prepared.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme—the cost of safety, voice versus silence, complicity versus liberation—emerges through specific images: the missing piano music, the choir of bellhops rewritten as furniture, the cauterized nerves. The bolt engraved with a spiral staircase functions as a charged recurring object. The protagonist's insight ("safety had never been the fortress at all, but the courage to leave it") is earned by the staircase memory and the woman's challenge, avoiding sermonizing. Subtext operates in the woman's understated delivery ("So they chained the music too") and the fortress's physical reactions (lights dimming, chandelier chiming). Minor deduction: the phrase "seraphically mundane" appears twice as a descriptive flourish but does not accumulate pressure across uses.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with tight focalization; no head-hopping. The narrator's perceptual signature is distinct: "ribs bending like bad questions," "curiosity had already loosened the vow inside me," "frostbitten hope prickled my fingertips." Voice modulates under pressure—short, declarative syntax at the climax ("Enough") after longer, lyric sentences earlier. The woman's dialogue carries distinct idiom: clipped, knowing, unsentimental. Purposeful compression in the opening (travelers as "shivers in the air") is taught and legible. Minor deduction: filter verbs cluster in a few beats ("I felt ice give way," "I thought of the guests") without always serving voice, slightly dulling immediacy in mid-section reflective passages.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong figurative density ("ribs bending like bad questions," "words feathering the air," "snow falling in a steel drum") charges the lyric register without obscuring causality. Information density is high; most lines advance multiple layers (world, character, pressure). Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, accelerating at closure. Minor deductions: a few paraphrase loops in the middle third—"My training screamed to escort her in silence, but curiosity had already loosened the vow inside me" restates the conflict already shown through the head-tilt gesture. "Seraphically mundane" recurs without functional reweighting. Template cadence appears in "I thought of the guests… I thought of the piano," creating slight scaffold drag. These issues do not touch the closure beat but accumulate to −0.4 to −0.6 within Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of enforced institutional silence, phantom consciousness during bodily regeneration, and the fortress as complicit architecture offers a fresh angle on safety-versus-freedom material. The piano bolt engraved with a spiral staircase is a specific, non-obvious detail that drives discovery. The woman as returning ghost/memory hybrid avoids stock haunting tropes through her matter-of-fact delivery. The ending risks destruction as cure, committing fully to the premise's implications. Transformation test: the emotional arc and world logic are specific to this fortress's rules and cannot be swapped wholesale into a generic dystopia without loss. Minor deduction: the "silent-choir bellhop" and nerve regeneration frame, while evocative, remain slightly under-exploited in middle beats; more tactical constraint from the dual-consciousness state would elevate ingenuity further.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The silent-choir bellhop drives three key beats: picking up the bolt (defying training to investigate), leading the woman to the staircase (violating regulations), and speaking "Enough" (breaking the vow that keeps the fortress safe). The final choice forecloses the protagonist's role as complicit bellhop and triggers the fortress collapse with immediate cost (bones shattering, nerves screaming). The character's dual state (mind working shifts while body regenerates) shapes perception and stakes throughout. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage place this in the 7.0–8.4 band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The piano bench bolt appears in three distinct beats: rolls across the floor and protagonist picks it up (lobby), its engraving of a spiral staircase pulls the protagonist toward the service corridor, and it "grew heavier, dragging my arm toward the service corridor" (middle). The bolt's absence signals chained music and triggers the quest to understand cost. However, the bolt does not appear in or directly shape the final image; once the staircase is descended, it recedes from view. Strong setup and middle development, but no closure payoff limits the score to mid-7s.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Unpardonable silence" is the story's engine: the vow that keeps the fortress invisible, the price paid for safety, and the constraint the protagonist must break to achieve understanding. It shapes tactics (the protagonist's silence in the lobby, the risk of leading the woman), escalates at the staircase revelation ("My unpardonable silence had not been voluntary; it had been payment"), and drives the climax when the protagonist speaks and breaks the fortress's protection. The concept operates as both rule and theme, with visible cost at closure. Strong integration across all three gates.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Seraphically mundane" appears twice: to describe the woman's smile ("something seraphically mundane… the smile of someone who had made tea during artillery fire") and the protagonist's first word ("small, seraphically mundane, and louder than any alarm"). The trait signals calm-under-crisis and the power of ordinary acts in extraordinary contexts, but it does not constrain or enable a distinct on-page action with measurable cost. The attribute enriches tone and characterization yet remains closer to thematic accent than causal lever. Setup and thematic reprise present, but limited middle development and no direct tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Remain" (as in staying silent, remaining complicit) is the central tension the protagonist must overcome. The woman's challenge explicitly frames it: "If you remain quiet, they keep their heaven of locked doors." The protagonist's decision to not remain—to speak—is the story's decisive change and triggers all consequences at closure. The action also operates in the background throughout: the bellhops who remain are "rewritten as furniture," and the protagonist's body remains downstairs while the mind works shifts. The inversion (choosing not to remain) drives the ending. Strong causal necessity and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The "slightest discoloration on a dusty spiral staircase" is signaled early (the bolt's engraving teaches the staircase's importance), shapes the middle turn (woman touches the wall "where the slightest discoloration… darkened into bruise-purple," triggering the memory), and directly enables the climax: "Cracks spidered from the staircase bruise, racing upward through the cobalt stone." The method's mechanics matter—touch reveals memory, memory justifies choice, choice fractures the fortress from that exact spot. The method's specificity (discoloration as record of past violence and seed of destruction) is irreplaceable. All three gates present with strong causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The cobalt fortress under snow is introduced in the opening line, supplies the central constraint (invisibility to storms requires silence), and is destroyed at closure when the protagonist speaks and "snow roared in… each flake a lost syllable returning home." The fortress architecture (no doors, revolving lobby, forbidden staircase, infirmary where the body regenerates) pressures every choice. Snow as antagonist/chorus reappears throughout, from "what snow made against stone" to the woman's "frost in her eyelashes" to the avalanche attack that injured the protagonist. The setting is indispensable: remove the fortress rules and the story collapses.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"During nerve regeneration" anchors the dual-consciousness premise (body in infirmary, mind working shifts) and is signaled early. The timeframe shapes perception—"my physical nerves twitched on their cots, trying to regrow pathways the fortress had cauterized"—and connects to the climax when "nerves screamed awake" as the protagonist's choice reunites consciousness and body. However, the regeneration does not function as a live ticking clock that tightens decisions beat-by-beat; it operates more as situational constraint and thematic mirror (regeneration versus breaking). Setup and closure linkage present; middle urgency is moderate. Solid mid-range integration.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The motivation "to understand the cost of safety" is dramatized through the protagonist's choices: picking up the bolt despite training, questioning silently, leading the woman to the staircase, and ultimately speaking to break the fortress despite knowing the physical price. The woman's challenge explicitly stakes this motivation: "If you remain quiet, they keep their heaven… If you speak, storms will know this place." The protagonist's realization—"I needed to understand the cost of safety"—precedes and justifies the climactic choice. The motivation is conflicted (fear of storms versus need for truth) and drives the ending with visible cost (bones shattering, safety destroyed). Indispensable across all beats.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Frostbitten hope" as tone is coherent throughout: the setting is cold and deadly (snow, frost, avalanche), yet small gestures of defiance and connection persist (the bolt, the woman's return, the protagonist's tilt-head question, "perhaps destruction could be another kind of cure"). The tone modulates with pressure: lyric and contemplative in the lobby/staircase descent, accelerating and declarative at the climax ("Enough"). The final image charges the tone: "frostbitten hope prickled my fingertips, a painful, tingling belief that perhaps destruction could be another kind of cure" directly precedes the ending, and the painful hope is realized when snow roars in as chorus rather than enemy. Strong tonal control with thematic payoff.</comment>
