<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's interior voice is consistent and specific—sensory memories triggered by the vial (citrus soap, smoke, ocean) anchor present perception through embodied detail. The protagonist's choice to "surrender to the vial's slow intake" reads as earned by the established isolation and professional stance, though the shift from scientist to archive lacks a visible on-page micro-choice that reveals competing impulses. The final stance—"becoming its final, solitary archive"—forecloses survival with felt cost, meeting Earned Stasis criteria. Minor deduction: the moment of decision compresses instinct and override without dramatizing internal friction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): the protagonist becomes the archive with visible cost—shutting down circuits, locking hatches, surrendering agency. The accumulative lens is taught early (silence as weight, gathered hush) and held through the temple discovery to the final surrender. Orientation anchors (control sphere, Station Pelagia, post-burn world) arrive within the first 120 words. One meaningful tightening: the distress signal leads to the vial, which reframes the mission from study to preservation. Cost is legible in the final image: isolation becomes permanence, observer becomes artifact.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The underwater temple constrains the drone's approach and charges the final image—pillars, thermal haze, collapsed archway all pressure the retrieval. The control sphere's "gathered hush," dim lights, and board states ground orientation and reflect isolation. The crystal vial functions as micro-setting, its pulse and geometry triggering olfactory memory (citrus, smoke, ocean) that alters the protagonist's stance from observer to archive. The temple's "lonesome splendor" and perfumed water anchor tone and recur at closure, reweighting the protagonist's solitude as curated rather than accidental.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve the ephemeral—signals early ("harness the ephemeral fluctuations") and tightens when the vial drinks memory. The protagonist's agency drives escalation: overriding protocol, launching the drone, forcing the hatch, then choosing to become the archive. The final choice forecloses survival with visible cost (shutting circuits, locking hatches) and transforms isolation into purpose. The tightening is causal: the distress signal that "did not sound mechanical" compels action, and the vial's geometry and scent pull the protagonist into its preservation logic. One reversal (signal cuts off when touched) deepens stakes without requiring multiple turns.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—what we preserve of vanished civilizations—emerges through the vial as vessel for "days and breath" rather than stone, and the protagonist's shift from observer to archive enacts the thematic question without stating it. The recurring phrase "gathered hush" and "lonesome splendor" charge the closure by reweighting isolation as curatorial act. The final line ("being remembered by what I remembered") reframes the entire mission as reciprocal preservation, a non-literal answer to the ephemeral-versus-eternal question. No moralizing; the temple's perfumed water, coral-scabbed pillars, and dizzy script build a world where memory is technology, and the protagonist's surrender completes that pattern.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature throughout: "silence in the deep is different; it feels like weight on the ribs" and the olfactory cascade (citrus, smoke, ocean) anchor voice in sensory particularity. Psychic distance remains stable; the narrator infers temple mythology but never claims certainty beyond the feed. Diction stays consistent under pressure—"unsnarl the tether drones," "the board spat out coordinates"—with technical idiom that fits the role. The phrase "my title, twisted into a name" uses purposeful compression to land the shift from function to identity. No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks in peak beats, and the final image sustains the established rhythm without drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Information density is high: most lines advance setting, stakes, or recalibrate the vial's function. Rhythm varies purposefully—short declaratives at the discovery ("There was no body, no data drive") contrast with longer accumulative sentences in the memory sequence. Minor scaffold detected: "The world inside the control sphere changed; the lighting did not shift, yet every shadow seemed to deepen" restates the same content across the semicolon without new pressure (−0.2). One near-loop: "lonesome splendor" appears twice with slight variation, but the reprise charges the final line and reads purposeful. No metaphor muddle, no template cadence runs, and the final beat ("I felt the lonesome splendor of being remembered by what I remembered") integrates prior motifs with clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The premise—distress signal as bait for a memory-harvesting archive—transforms the familiar underwater-ruin trope through the vial's inversion: the protagonist becomes the preserved rather than the preserver. The spiral-within-spiral sigil and perfumed geometry feel specific to this world's logic. The choice to surrender agency rather than survive is bold and grows organically from the established isolation and professional mission. The phrase "distress signal sender" as twisted title, the vial drinking recollections, and the final reciprocal remembering all read fresh. Risk: the ending commits fully to stasis without hedging, and the accumulative structure heightens rather than obscures the stakes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The distress signal sender role appears in the opening line, frames all choices (logging the ping, launching the drone, forcing the hatch), and is explicitly reweighted at closure ("my title, twisted into a name"). The protagonist's decision to override protocol and later to "surrender to the vial's slow intake" are two distinct beats driven by this identity. The final image—becoming archive—depends on the sender role's transformation from active to receptive. Cost is visible: circuits shut, hatches locked, solitude becomes permanence.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The crystal perfume vial appears in the mid-discovery beat, is handled by the drone's gripper (signal cuts on touch), pulses with the protagonist's recollections, and charges the final surrender. Three distinct beats: retrieval, sensory drinking, and closure choice. Its spiral sigil ties to the temple ceilings, and its resin stopper and perfumed geometry make it irreplaceable—no generic device could harvest memory through scent and pattern. The vial's mechanics (inhaling recollections, exhaling pressure) constrain the protagonist's final choice and reweight isolation as curation. Closure participation is causal and indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Gathered hush" is introduced early ("a gathered hush that keeps secrets"), recurs in the temple approach, and returns at closure to frame the protagonist's final stance ("the gathered hush around the temple felt older than catastrophe"). It shapes the tone and reweights silence from absence to presence, but does not directly alter on-page tactics—the protagonist's choices trace to the signal and vial rather than the hush itself. The concept charges the final image by making stillness a curatorial act, lifting it past ornamental mention into lyric-resonance territory.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Touches memories" first appears when the vial's geometry triggers olfactory recall (citrus soap, smoke, ocean), a beat that shifts the protagonist's stance from retrieval to recognition. The attribute constrains the protagonist's choice by making memory the medium of preservation—without the memory-touch, the vial remains inert artifact. The final surrender ("becoming its final, solitary archive") depends on this trait's mechanics: the vial encodes "every story, every joy and terror" as sensation, and the protagonist supplies the final archive. Cost is conceptual and visible: selfhood becomes data. Two beats (memory cascade, final intake) and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Unsnarl" appears at the pivot beat where the protagonist overrides protocol and commits to retrieval ("unsnarl the tether drones, reconfigure the guidance, flood the launch bay"). It signals technical agency and contrasts with the later "surrender," bookending the arc from action to stasis. The action enables the discovery sequence and is swappable only with loss of the specific idiom that charges the character's professional voice. It does not reappear at closure, capping upper range, but it drives the middle turn and primes the final reversal.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"By overriding instinct" is signaled when the protagonist overrides "every caution by overriding instinct" to launch the drone, a method that shapes the decision beat. It does not recur or constrain later choices—the final surrender reads as acceptance rather than override. The phrase touches one key turn (retrieval) but remains absent from the closure, limiting integration. The method is dramatized in choice rather than told-only, and it contrasts with the ending's yielding stance, creating a mild thematic bracket.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The forgotten underwater temple is introduced early (mythic/geothermal duality), pressures the drone's approach (pillars, thermal haze, collapsed archway), and supplies the vial with context (spiral sigils, coral, luminous algae). The temple's hum "on no fuel we could measure" and perfumed exhalations establish its rule-set, and the protagonist's final realization that the pod "had never held a person" depends on the temple's mythology. Three beats (discovery, drone navigation, closure recognition) and closure linkage. The setting's "lonesome splendor" charges the final image, making it indispensable to the story's logic and tone.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"As time runs short" appears once in the vial's overlay text ("time runs short"), signaling urgency but not tracked thereafter. The protagonist's final choice to shut down circuits nods to "dwindling power," linking time pressure obliquely to closure. The timeframe does not visibly tighten mid-scene choices—the protagonist overrides protocol and launches the drone without time-driven cost. The phrase charges the closure moment by making the vial's claim immediate, but the clock itself does not shape tactics across beats. Early setup, closure mention, but minimal middle development caps the score in mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"To harness the ephemeral" is stated early as the mission ("harness the ephemeral fluctuations in its output") and reweighted at closure when the protagonist becomes the vessel for ephemeral impressions. The motivation drives the retrieval choice and the final surrender, appearing in two distinct beats. Friction is implicit: the mission sought to harness for grants, but the vial demands personal cost (becoming archive). The desire is dramatized through action (drone launch, hatch forcing) rather than told-only, and the closure reconfigures harnessing as reciprocal preservation. Cost is visible in the final stasis.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"Lonesome splendor" appears twice: once mid-discovery ("the temple filled the screens in lonesome splendor") and again in the final line ("I felt the lonesome splendor of being remembered by what I remembered"). The tone modulates with pressure—initial awe shifts to acceptance—and charges the closure by reweighting isolation as aesthetic and curatorial rather than mere abandonment. The phrase integrates with "gathered hush," perfumed water, and the temple's visual details to sustain a coherent atmospheric texture. The reprise transforms descriptor into thematic closure, making tone indispensable to the ending's resonance.</comment>
