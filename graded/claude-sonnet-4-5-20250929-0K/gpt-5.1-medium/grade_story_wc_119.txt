<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's contradictory stance as both translator and fortune-writer who fears then embraces prophetic power is well-drawn through embodied choices. The internal tension between weary routine and the urge to "transpose life into a new key" drives concrete micro-choices—leading Parker up the lighthouse stairs, rewriting the sequence. Parker's presence adds pressure without muddying the narrator's agency. Minor: the narrator's emotional arc could degrade more visibly under stress; the final self-aware reflection risks flattening immediacy.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story follows a causal lens with motivational coherence: prophecies accumulate, Parker's arrival complicates, narrator climbs lighthouse and rewrites the signal. Closure is Earned Stasis/Charged Poise—the narrator accepts complicity and will "listen to the sea read back my fortunes," foreclosing the innocent bystander path with visible cost. Orientation anchors are present (island bar, after last orders, lighthouse). However, the climactic rewrite of the outgoing sequence is narrated with compression that slightly obscures the mechanics of how the reversal happens and what immediate cost lands on the page; the final image's cost is conceptual but legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The lighthouse on black rocks, the bar's bottle-glass that reflects Morse, and the rotating lens inside constrain choices and charge the final beats. Spatial choreography is clear: bar to storm steps to panel. Sensory detail—"dust floated in columns of stray light," "rotating lens groaned like an old musician"—is vivid and filtered through the narrator's professional fatigue. The Golden Dragon Takeaway and soy sauce packets as microdot disguises ground the island's "open secret" economy in tactile specificity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: whether the narrator remains passive translator or actively steers intelligence flow. The escalation is causal—accidental prophecy leads to Parker's arrival, Parker sees the bottle-reflection message, narrator must choose complicity. The lighthouse rewrite forecloses the innocent stance with visible action. However, the peak turn (rewriting the sequence) is compressed and the immediate consequence is deferred to "tomorrow's customers" rather than landing in present tense; cost is conceptual and projected rather than paid on the page in the climactic beat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of open secrets and the burden of agency emerges through concrete particulars: fortune slips that turn prophetic, spycraft hidden in takeout packets, a lighthouse "whispering" through light. The metaphor of "sheet music" and transposing keys integrates without overt moralizing. The ending offers a resonant answer—narrator as complicit conductor rather than passive medium—without stating a thesis. The final image of the sea "read[ing] back my fortunes like a familiar enigma finally humming along" charges prior material with earned irony.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>First-person voice is distinct, wry, and controlled: "Parker, which is a name people choose when they want to be mistaken for stationery." Diction stays in character—"some flavor of watcher," "cheap whiskey"—and modulates under pressure without breaking register. Dialogue is sparse but subtext-rich: Parker's "Help me" reads as complicity plea. Distance is stable; no head-hopping. Minor: a few figurative turns ("confession booth and found the priest begging forgiveness") slightly elevate register but remain voice-plausible.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high. No paraphrase loops or scaffold detected. Figurative language—"orchestrating each fortune by directing flow, not force"—recurs with intent and pays off at closure. However, three instances of mid-pressure template cadence ("I realized then," "That is the thing about," "Down in the village, tomorrow's customers would") slightly dull propulsion. The phrase "familiar enigma" appears three times; while thematic, the repetition risks churn. Clarity and concision are otherwise strong.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of fortune-cookie writer, spycraft microdot, and accidentally prophetic text is specific and non-obvious. The "open secret" conceit grounds the premise in island logic rather than forcing mystery. The narrator's agency turn—from passive translator to active orchestrator—feels earned rather than template-imposed. Risk: the lyric register and compressed climax prioritize resonance over causal visibility, which heightens thematic charge but slightly obscures immediate stakes. The piece commits fully to its voice and premise without hedging.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The cryptic fortune cookie writer is present throughout and drives the climactic rewrite choice at the lighthouse panel. The character's prophetic accident triggers Parker's arrival and the final act of orchestration. Setup early, middle pressure via Parker's reading of slips, payoff in lighthouse rewrite. Cost is conceptual (complicity) but legible. Scores mid-6s: causal across beats and closure-linked, but the final turn is compressed and the immediate consequence deferred.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Microdot film specs appear in multiple beats: mentioned as disguised soy sauce packets, Parker asks about them, the bottle-reflection spells reroute order, narrator rewrites sequence. Setup early, middle complication, closure participation via the panel rewrite. However, the specs themselves remain abstracted—never handled or opened on the page—and the mechanics of their rerouting are told rather than shown. Functional causal work but lacks tactile presence.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Open secrets" shapes stakes directly: the island's spycraft survives because "no one bothered to shut us down," and Parker's presence tests whether the narrator will maintain or disrupt that equilibrium. The concept drives tactics (letting Parker "blend in like cheap whiskey") and charges the ending when the narrator chooses to "orchestrate" rather than passively decode. Setup early, middle pressure, closure participation. Strong integration; removing the concept would collapse the premise.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>"Accidentally prophetic" triggers escalation: ferry folds after "YOU WILL CROSS WATER WITHOUT MOVING," inspector's heart attack after "A LIGHTHOUSE WILL CHANGE HANDS." This compels the narrator to realize agency and attracts Parker. Setup in first third, middle pressure via Parker's observation, closure when narrator accepts the power and rewrites the signal. The trait enables the climax but the final prophecy's content and immediate cost are deferred off-page, limiting its closure charge.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Orchestrate" is signaled early ("orchestrating each fortune by directing flow, not force") and becomes literal action at climax: narrator climbs to the panel and "rewrote the outgoing sequence." The method defines the turn from passive translation to active control. However, the rewrite itself is compressed—"I climbed to the panel, fingers shaking, and rewrote"—without showing the physical or tactical steps. Strong thematic and causal presence, but the peak execution is told rather than dramatized in granular action.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"By directing flow" is the narrator's stated method ("by directing flow, not force") and becomes the mechanism of closure: rerouting specs rather than seizing them. Setup early as mantra, payoff when narrator "rewrote the outgoing sequence so the specs would cycle back to us." The method shapes the narrator's tactical choice and contrasts with crude force. Lyric reprise reweights the stake, but the mechanics of "directing flow" remain abstract rather than procedurally dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The lighthouse provides spatial constraint and symbolic charge throughout: "Its lantern room shuttered like a half-closed eye," the storm steps narrator climbs, the panel where the rewrite occurs. It supplies the beam that spills Morse across bottle-glass and houses the sequence controls. Setup early, middle participation (beam reveals Parker's complicity), closure scene set inside it. The setting's mechanics (rotating lens, signal panel) enable the climax and the final image of the beam "sweep[ing] the horizon."</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>"After last orders" frames the timeframe and recurs: "The lighthouse always began speaking after last orders," "After last orders at the bar, my real shift began," Parker shows up "after last orders." The timing creates the conditions for secrecy and the narrator's dual role. However, the time constraint does not tighten decisions at climax—no countdown or urgency visible in the lighthouse scene—and elapsed time is vague. Functional setup and thematic marker, but does not drive escalation.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The desire "to transpose life into a new key" is stated explicitly ("then maybe a chance to transpose life into a new key") and drives the narrator's climb: "If life was sheet music, I was nudging the notes." The motive converts from passive fatigue to active orchestration. However, the desire is articulated rather than dramatized through contradictory wants; the narrator's internal friction between safety and risk is compressed. Strong thematic presence and closure linkage, but less embodied struggle than the rubric rewards for high 7s.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Familiar enigma" is named three times and defines the tone: the island's spycraft "familiar enigma... where secrets were safest when everyone knew not to take them seriously," and the ending "like a familiar enigma finally humming along." Tone remains consistent—wry, slightly detached, suffused with salt and fatigue—and modulates under pressure without breaking. The closing line charges the phrase with acceptance rather than irony. Strong tonal coherence and purposeful reprise that reweights the stake at closure.</comment>
