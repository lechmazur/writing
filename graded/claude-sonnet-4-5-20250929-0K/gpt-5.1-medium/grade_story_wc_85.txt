<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The protagonist's interiority is specific and voice-consistent, rooted in guilt and professional paradox. The choice to gather the carvings rather than destroy or expose them emerges from sustained internal conflict between protection and truth-telling. Embodied emotion is present ("the realization snaps something that has ached wordlessly for years"), though some therapeutic phrasing ("tempered regret," "withheld truth") edges toward diagnostic self-awareness. The final agency—studying the marks instead of manufacturing comfort—feels earned by the accumulation of contradictory impulses: continuing the father's work while undoing one's own cruelty.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who (genealogist), where (terrace/shore), and when (dusk/now) clearly within the opening paragraph. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the protagonist moves through layers of reflection, discovery, and symbolic material, with pressure building through density rather than causal reversals. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): the decision to "study these marks until I can read the truth they hold" forecloses the path of continued forgery with visible cost—accepting the burden of the father's legacy and the guilt of his own trade. The cost is legible in the shift from manufacturing comfort to confronting unsoftened truth, and the lens holds without contradiction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The cobalt terrace, sea, and driftwood carvings are vivid and purposeful, with sensory selection filtered through the genealogist's professional eye ("patterns are not letters I know, yet something in them pricks like half-remembered handwriting"). The watch and carved symbols function as micro-setting elements that constrain the final choice: without the forked emblem on both watch and wood, the decision to gather and study lacks its causal anchor. Spatial choreography from terrace to shore is clean, and the forgotten shore directly charges the closure image by supplying the archive of erased names.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether to face or continue evading the father's truth—is signaled early and tightens through the discovery of the forked emblem that links personal artifact to buried network. The kneeling search and recognition ("the realization snaps something") constitutes one meaningful deepening that narrows options: the protagonist can no longer pretend ignorance. The choice to gather carvings rather than walk away or expose them forecloses the path of manufactured comfort with felt cost. Agency is clear in the decision to study rather than sell or destroy, though the escalation is more a single tightening than multiple reversals.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete parallel between father's carvings (protecting the living) and protagonist's forgeries (comforting them), both trafficking in hidden genealogies. The final image—gathering carvings to "read the truth they hold"—offers a resonant answer to the question of whether to continue the lineage of silence, without stating a moral. The watch hand's absence and the driftwood index are particular rather than generic symbols, and the story resists tidy resolution: the protagonist's new path accepts the burden of unsoftened truth while continuing the trade. One minor slip: "tempered regret of two lives crossing" edges toward stated theme, though it remains rooted in the scene's particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The voice is consistent, literary, and voice-particular, with controlled diction ("sieved hush," "index of the erased," "fragile bones in my satchel") that remains coherent under pressure. POV is stable first-person with no head-hopping; psychic distance modulates appropriately between reflection and present action. Perceptual signature is selective and profession-specific: the genealogist reads carvings as "half-remembered handwriting" and sees clients as "scars." Minor register drift appears in phrases like "tempered regret" and "withheld truth," which feel slightly elevated compared to the surrounding texture, but they do not break voice or obscure clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Information density is high, with lines often doing double work (e.g., "I forged documents that severed me from my blood, erasing a name that tasted of iron" advances backstory, guilt, and stakes simultaneously). Rhythm varies purposefully, and no paraphrase loops are present. Minor overwriting appears in stacked metaphors: "silence feels like a sieved hush, as if the world has strained every sound except this question" mixes auditory filtering with abstract straining in a way that slightly muddies the vehicle. The figurative density in the middle third (watch hand as "pulse with no beat," corridors of "unwritten file," symbols that "prick like half-remembered handwriting") accumulates without obscuring causality, but three metaphors in close succession test coherence. Propulsion remains strong through the shore sequence, and the final image is concrete.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of black-market genealogist and smuggled-records network is specific and non-obvious, with the protagonist unknowingly echoing the father's work creating fresh dramatic irony. The driftwood-carving archive as a physical genealogy of the erased transforms the familiar "hidden past" premise into something tactile and grounded. The choice to study rather than expose or continue forging avoids the safety middle and commits to a third path that accepts both legacies' costs. The transformation is earned in hindsight through the forked emblem linking watch and carvings, making the final turn feel inevitable rather than imposed.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The guilt-ridden black-market genealogist drives setup (tools "like accusations," years of false memories), middle development (recognizing the forged severance from blood, discovering the file), and closure (choosing to study carvings rather than manufacture comfort). The character's profession directly enables the central conflict and final choice, and the guilt shapes every beat from the opening "scars itch" through the decision to accept "the burden of unsoftened truth." Removing this exact character collapses the thematic parallel with the father's work and the story's moral calculus.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The watch hand appears in three beats: terrace opening (gap "like a tooth pulled from time"), midpoint note ("Ask the shore"), and shore discovery (forked emblem beneath the missing hand). The missing hand's symbolic function—absence marking erasure—charges the recognition scene when the emblem links artifact to carvings. However, the watch itself is more active than the hand specifically; the hand's absence is described but does not constrain a choice beyond serving as a visual echo of the forked symbol. Swapping "missing hand" for "damaged face" would preserve most narrative function.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The phrase "sieved hush" appears twice: "a sieved hush, as if the world has strained every sound except this question" (midpoint reflection) and "the sound a sieved hush passing through generations of regret" (shore sequence). It operates as thematic accent—filtered silence around hidden truths—but does not shape stakes or alter tactics on the page. The genealogist's actions (searching carvings, deciding to study) proceed independently of this auditory metaphor. Present and coherent with tone, but ornamental rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Manufactures false memories" frames the protagonist's trade in the opening third ("For years I have manufactured false memories for those willing to pay") and returns at closure ("I will not manufacture false memories; I will study these marks"). This attribute enables the central conflict (guilt over softening history), motivates the backstory (forging his own severance), and makes the final renunciation costly: abandoning the lucrative trade for uncertain study. The trait is specific and indispensable; without it, the parallel to the father's protective smuggling collapses.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Quell" appears explicitly ("quelling pain that history refused to forget," "one story I have never dared to quell") and implicitly in the protagonist's trade of softening the past. It shapes the dominant stake: whether to continue quelling uncomfortable truths or face them. The shore decision partially inverts it—choosing to study rather than quell—but the action itself is more thematic frame than a discrete tactical move. Swapping "quell" for "erase" or "soothe" would preserve most narrative function, suggesting mid-level integration.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The method is signaled early ("They once said shipments were arranged by sifting through driftwood carvings along a forgotten shore"), dramatized in the shore sequence where the protagonist kneels and traces grooves, and directly produces the closure choice when the forked emblem is recognized. The mechanics matter: the carvings are "half buried," "edges softened by years," and the protagonist's professional skill at reading genealogies enables the pattern recognition. Removing this exact method—driftwood carvings on a shore—would break the physical link between father's smuggling and protagonist's discovery, collapsing the story's causal spine.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The cobalt terrace at dusk frames the opening third, anchoring mood and the protagonist's ritual of laying out tools. Dusk modulates into "bruised purple" during the descent, charging the transition. However, the terrace does not constrain the protagonist's choices or supply resources that affect outcome; the shore (not prompt-required) does that work. The terrace functions as atmospheric stage rather than active pressure. A purposeful early–final reprise (terrace to shore to implied return) reweights the journey but does not make the terrace indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Under the weight of unspoken words" appears in the opening ("The air around me hangs thick under the weight of unspoken words") as mood-setting rather than a ticking clock. Time is vague: "For years," "tonight," "After a while." No urgency compresses decisions; the protagonist's reflection and shore search proceed at contemplative pace. The phrase recurs thematically ("generations of regret") but does not tighten tactics or impose a deadline. Present as tone, but does not function as a timeframe that alters moves.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The motivation "to discover the weight of a withheld truth" is stated explicitly in the opening third ("tonight I am here to discover the weight of a withheld truth") and dramatized throughout: the protagonist examines the watch, recalls the file's note, searches the carvings, and ultimately chooses study over continued forgery. The desire conflicts with the safer path of continued silence, creating friction. The shore discovery makes the withheld truth concrete (father's network), and the final choice accepts its weight by committing to decipher it. The motivation drives setup, middle search, and closure renunciation with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Tempered regret" is named once explicitly ("the tempered regret of two lives crossing") but permeates the narration: guilt that "finally decided to name," the "ached wordlessly for years," the recognition of "quieter cruelty" in the protagonist's comfort-trade. Tone modulates from brittle self-accusation (tools "like accusations") to wistful recognition (father's protective smuggling) to resolute acceptance (gathering carvings "like fragile bones"). The final image—studying marks to read hidden truth—charges the regret with purpose rather than paralysis, and the tone remains coherent through turns without flattening into static melancholy.</comment>
