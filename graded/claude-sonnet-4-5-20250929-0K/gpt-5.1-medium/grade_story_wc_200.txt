<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is grounded in her brother's death and manifests through concrete choices—descending the gorge, biting the tooth ritual, coaxing spectral confessions toward absurdity. Her interiority is specific ("modestly fearless," the tooth as persuasion metaphor) and her task of teaching the dead to laugh creates embodied pressure. Minor limitation: the spectral voices feel more like choral device than individual pressures testing her method; their quick compliance flattens potential resistance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the gorge's discord slides toward "rough, unlikely harmony" when Mara nudges confessions toward their absurd edges, and laughter stitches through the music "like gold mending a broken bowl." The felt cost is her solo descent and ritual exposure; the world "tilts, just slightly, toward healing" with legible before/after. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural—density of spectral voices and the harp's misalignment build until the cadence shift at "giggles up the stone." One micro turn (wind falters, first confession breaks free) sets up the cascade without violating the coherent pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Echo gorge functions as active constraint: the narrow spiraling path, the harp jutted from stone, and the ledge where Mara stops all shape her descent and ritual positioning. The crocodile's tooth (micro-object-as-setting) anchors her method through tactile ritual. Sensory hierarchy is strong—"thin melodic scraping," "breath on glass" faces, wind arranging her hair—and filtered through her myth-collector lens. The harp's physical misalignment directly charges the closure image when its strings tighten with laughter.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: restore the village children's stolen joy by rebalancing the gorge's music. One meaningful tightening occurs when the wind falters and the first confession breaks free, narrowing Mara's tactic from general coaxing to specific nudging toward absurdity. Each spectral confession she reframes is a micro-escalation under the Accumulative lens. Agency is her decision to teach laughter rather than ferry souls, and the visible cost is her solo ritual exposure. The coincidental timing (children's laughter stopped recently) complicates but does not resolve; Mara's method resolves it.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—grief can ferment into saving humor—emerges organically through Mara's brother-promise, the gorge hoarding joy, and her tactical pivot from wailing to absurdity. The crocodile's tooth as "jaws built for ending could be persuaded to open" functions as embedded metaphor without stating thesis. Spectral confessions (dentures, fake haunting, river-monster legend) render the theme through particular pratfalls rather than abstraction. The final image—"world tilt, just slightly, toward healing"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The luminous-ache tone (pain threaded with play) sustains thematic complexity to closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Mara; distance modulates purposefully (close at the tooth-bite ritual, zoomed slightly for the spectral chorus). Perceptual signature is distinct: "shadows seemed to listen harder than the living," "intentions, the first drafts of haunting." Diction remains character-bound ("modestly fearless," "drunk acrobat" for the harp's tilt). The spectral dialogue feels goal-driven and carries subtext (shame/yearning); each voice pursues confession as self-justification. Purposeful compression in the final paragraph ("sunrise had fully found the gorge") accelerates closure without opacity. No head-hopping; focalization clean throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Line-level craft is strong: rhythm varies ("To the villagers she was a myth" / "To herself she was only a woman"), information density high (most lines advance image and pressure), figurative language controlled ("laughter caught in rusted wire fence," "gold mending a broken bowl"). Minor scaffold detected: "The sound came through" and "From its depths drifted" are near-synonymous openers in adjacent early paragraphs, and "one by one" / "each story surfaced" / "as each story" form a template run mid-closure that slightly dulls propulsion. These artifacts do not obscure causality but cost precision. Deduction: −0.6 in Q7 for paraphrase-loop and template cadence; artifacts do not touch the final image directly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of soul-collector + teaching-the-dead-to-laugh + misaligned-harp-as-therapy is specific and feels earned rather than gimmicky. The crocodile's tooth backstory (circus beast, drowning boy) is an original detail that anchors her method. Trope transformation is present: the psychopomp becomes comedy coach. Minor limitation: the village-children framing (joy stolen by gorge) leans toward familiar "restore balance" structure without deep personalization of the children themselves; the stake remains somewhat abstract. Freshness is carried by voice and tonal control rather than premise alone.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara as "lost soul collector" is present early, frames her expertise, and her decision to "pursue a different kind of rescue" drives the descent and the tactical shift to teaching laughter. She appears in setup, middle coaxing beats, and the closure climb. Her choices (bite the tooth, speak playfully into the chord, nudge confessions toward absurdity) create the key turn when the wind falters and confessions cascade. Cost is her solo ritual exposure and the promise-weight from her brother. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The crocodile's tooth appears in two beats: Mara adjusts the thong early (setup), and later bites it as ritual anchor before speaking ("a ritual to remember not to flinch"). It carries thematic charge (jaws persuaded to open = her method), but its mechanical role is modest—it primes her stance rather than constraining a choice under pressure. The tooth does not reappear in the closure image or visibly alter tactics when the spectral confessions begin. Functional but not indispensable; swappable with another talismanic anchor.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>"Spectral confessions" is the story's engine: the gorge's hoarded voices create the imbalance, Mara's goal is to reframe them, and the cascade of confessions (dentures, fake haunting, river-monster legend) drives the middle escalation and closure. The concept shapes stakes (restore laughter), tactics (coax toward absurdity), and the ending image (laughter stitching through music). Cost is Mara's solo exposure and the risk that the dead won't respond. Indispensable; removing it collapses the plot and thematic resolution.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Modestly fearless" is labeled early ("stood at the brink, modestly fearless") and echoed in her willingness to descend alone, but it does not constrain a choice with visible cost. The trait feels descriptive rather than dramatized through a tradeoff (e.g., fearlessness tempting recklessness vs. modesty pulling back). It colors her stance but could be swapped for "cautiously bold" without structural change. Present in setup and implicit in her descent, but no middle beat tests it as a friction.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Pursue" is signaled explicitly ("come to echo gorge not merely to ferry another soul, but to pursue a different kind of rescue") and drives the plot: her descent, her method of coaxing confessions, and the ending's success all trace to this pursuit. It redefines her usual task (soul-ferrying) and shapes the dominant stake. The action is irreplaceable—changing it to "investigate" or "observe" would flatten her agency. Present in setup, middle beats (speaking into the chord, nudging confessions), and closure (climbing back as giggles rise). Strong causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The "misaligned harp" is introduced early ("hammered into the cliff face generations ago"), its distorted notes create the imbalance Mara must address, and its strings tightening with laughter is the physical image of closure. The method (wind-played confessions through warped chords) shapes her tactic—she speaks "into the rising chord" and nudges the music toward harmony. The harp's mechanics (riverweed/funeral thread strings, jutting from stone ledge) are dramatized across beats and charge the final image. Indispensable; removing it would erase the story's sensory and causal spine.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Echo gorge supplies spatial constraint (narrow spiraling path, ledge, depths that muffle/amplify), the harp embedded in its cliff face, and the acoustic properties that enable spectral voices. Mara's descent and positioning at the ledge are dictated by the gorge's layout. The setting's "low throat of wind and water" and its rehearsing of "unfinished goodbyes" create the problem and the medium for resolution. The gorge's acoustics charge the closure image (giggles echoing up stone). Strong causal pressure, present setup-to-end, irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"In the hush of a hidden sunrise" anchors the opening and returns subtly at closure ("sunrise had fully found the gorge"), bracketing the ritual. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions or constrain tactics; the action unfolds in a single continuous descent without time pressure. The sunrise functions as atmospheric marker rather than live clock. Lyric reprise reweights the mood (hidden → found mirrors discord → harmony), earning mid-band credit, but no escalation tied to elapsed time.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Mara's motivation "to integrate laughter into healing" is dramatized through her brother-promise ("kneeling once beside her brother's fevered bed"), her diagnosis of the gorge's problem (grief souring vs. fermenting into humor), and her tactical choices (coaxing confessions toward absurdity, barking a laugh to surprise the gorge). The motivation faces friction when the wind falters and she must risk vulnerability ("I know you miss being ridiculous"). It drives setup, middle coaxing beats, and the closure image (laughter mending the music). Cost is her solo exposure and the emotional labor of the ritual. Strong causal and thematic integration.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Luminous ache" is established early ("her tone a luminous ache threaded with something almost playful") and sustained through imagery that balances pain and mirth: "sobbing and mirth like a drunk acrobat," "bruised harmonies," "warped and shaky" laughter that "stitched itself through the music like gold mending a broken bowl." The tone modulates with pressure (hush → muttering gorge → cacophony → rough harmony) and charges the final image ("world tilt, just slightly, toward healing"). Coherent across beats, irreplaceable for thematic resonance.</comment>
