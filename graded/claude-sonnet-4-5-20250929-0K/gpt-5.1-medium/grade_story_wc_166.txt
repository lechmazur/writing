<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mareh's motivation to inscribe forbidden memory is clear and her trade-off—losing her brother's face to give the stranger a map—lands with embodied cost. The stranger remains functional but thin, present only to receive the verse. Interior contradiction appears ("elective exile trembles") but doesn't act simultaneously in scene; the decision to proceed feels linear rather than torn. The final cost is concrete and poignant, lifting the closure moment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece infers an Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through lyric patterning, the moonstone ritual sequence, and the final memory-trade that reweights exile as "quiet rebellion." Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. Closure lands on-page as Conceptual Repricing—Mareh's exile shifts from sanctuary to resistance—with visible cost (brother's face unmoors). One meaningful deepening (the price paid after inscription) is sufficient for this length, and the lens holds without contradiction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The twilight garden floating on the lagoon is vivid and purposeful: lantern-moths, black glass roots, mirrored paths all constrain Mareh's ritual choreography. The moonstone dust speck in her tooth and the water itself function as micro-setting that enables the climactic act. Spatial blocking is clear (skiff approach, lagoon edge, arm mapping). The garden recurs in the final line to charge closure ("quiet rebellion still learning to breathe"), satisfying the 9+ gate for constraint and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—inscribing forbidden memory without detection—is signaled early and tightens when Mareh notes "their skin becomes a lighthouse" and authorities "have grown adept at reading new lights." The decision to proceed despite risk is agency under pressure, and the cost (loss of brother's memory) narrows future capacity. One meaningful escalation (gaps align, stranger arrives, Mareh acts) is sufficient. The price is unmistakable on the page and forecloses a path, meeting the high-band standard.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme—memory as resistance under authoritarian erasure—emerges through the nostalgia ban, the stranger's "empty skin," and the cosmic verse as hidden archive. The ending offers a resonant answer: exile becomes rebellion, and personal cost (brother's face) seeds collective memory. No overt moralizing; the final image ("quiet rebellion still learning to breathe") reweights prior material without stating a thesis. Subtext operates in the gap-watching method and the dermal constellation metaphor, avoiding prompt-echo language.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Single-POV third limited with a distinct lyric register: "bruised violet bowl," "obsidian grace," "fledge." Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping. Diction occasionally drifts toward elevated abstraction ("dermal constellations," "unspoken ache") that flirts with over-ornamentation but remains voice-consistent. Dialogue is spare, natural, and goal-driven ("I want a story that the ban cannot burn"). The perceptual signature—observing gaps, reading water—is character-specific and sustained under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is high in the ritual sequence. However, figurative language appears in most sentences of key beats without always earning its weight: "spontaneously anchored," "fledge," "dermal constellations," "tide returning to a forsaken cove" risk density overload. Minor paraphrase loop: "elective exile" repeated across two paragraphs without added pressure. No template cadence or filter-verb stacks. Propulsion is generally strong, but the cumulative ornamental load in the middle third trims momentum slightly. Closure image is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The premise—tattoo-as-memory-smuggling under a nostalgia ban—offers a fresh synthesis of body-art resistance and speculative authoritarianism. The tide-dancer profession and moonstone-tooth contraband add specificity. The emotional core (trading personal memory to inscribe communal archive) feels earned rather than generic. Risk-taking in the lyric density and gap-observation method heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The piece avoids template dystopia by grounding the ban's consequences in sensory particulars (lantern-moths, black glass roots, water-writing).</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mareh's tide-dancer skill is seeded early, demonstrated in the ritual ("every gesture a verb, every spin a clause"), and directly enables the climactic inscription. The skill constrains her method (water-writing, gap-observation) and appears in at least three beats (practice, moonstone release, guiding the verse down). Removing this exact skill would break the story's logic; no generic "artist" could replace the water-choreography mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The moonstone cabochon dust speck is introduced early (guarded "in a hollow of my tooth"), used dramatically at the turn (bitten free, cast into the lagoon), and its glow becomes the ink that writes the verse. It appears in three distinct beats (mention, release, blossom into script) and is irreplaceable—no other substance carries the contraband/moonlight fusion that charges the final act. Closure depends on this exact object.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Elective exile" is named in paragraph three, frames Mareh's initial stance (sanctuary vs. amnesia), and shifts meaning at closure ("less like my exile and more like a quiet rebellion"). It constrains her isolation and enables the garden's secrecy. Present in setup and ending, it reweights but does not drive middle beats; the stranger's arrival and the inscription itself could proceed without the "elective" qualifier. Solid lyric reprise with thematic cost, reaching mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Spontaneously anchored" describes the garden's roots in paragraph five but does not constrain an on-page action or choice. It adds flavor to the setting's otherworldliness but remains ornamental; the garden could float by ordinary anchor without altering Mareh's tactics or the stranger's approach. Present in setup only, no middle or closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Fledge" is seeded early ("teach memories to fledge"), becomes the verb for the verse's emergence ("begins to fledge from the water"), and recurs in the climactic inscription as the water-script takes flight and sinks into skin. It appears in three beats (rumor, emergence, final mapping) and its avian/emergence connotation is irreplaceable—"inscribe" or "write" would flatten the story's core metaphor. Closure turns on this exact action.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"By observing gaps" is introduced as Mareh's method ("learned to dance the currents of law and absence by observing gaps"), demonstrated when she listens for drones and notes the aligned gaps, and implicitly used in the middle beat ("the gaps I have studied for years yawn open tonight"). It shapes her decision to act and her tactical safety. Present in three beats (learning, tonight's alignment, implicit scan) and causally necessary; without gap-observation, the risk calculus collapses.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The twilight garden provides the isolated stage, the lagoon supplies the medium (water for tide-writing), and the lantern-moths/black glass roots create atmosphere that justifies Mareh's sanctuary and ritual choreography. It appears in opening, middle (mirrored paths, lagoon edge), and closing line ("the twilight garden under stars feels less like my exile"). The setting enables the climactic act and charges the final image, meeting high integration.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"After the nostalgia ban" is established early ("ten years since"), frames the stakes (forbidden memory), and tightens the risk when Mareh notes authorities' detection skill. It constrains what can be remembered openly and why the inscription is contraband. Present in setup and implicit throughout, it does not create a ticking clock but does shape every tactical choice. Solid causal presence across the arc, mid-to-high 6s.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Mareh's desire "to pen a cosmic verse on mortal skin" is declared early, tested when she hesitates ("my elective exile trembles"), and fulfilled in the climactic ritual. The friction between want (preserve memory) and cost (lose her own) is dramatized on the page. The motivation drives at least three beats (declaration, hesitation, execution) and the ending hinges on its fulfillment. Removing this exact motive would erase the story's engine.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Obsidian grace" appears twice: as Mareh's movement quality ("I practice my steps with obsidian grace") and implicitly in the ritual's controlled choreography ("With obsidian grace I guide each line down"). The tone—precise, dark, elegant—modulates from initial practice to high-stakes execution and carries into the final image's "quiet rebellion." Coherent through turns and charges the ending, but the phrase itself remains slightly ornamental; the story's tone would survive without this exact label.</comment>
