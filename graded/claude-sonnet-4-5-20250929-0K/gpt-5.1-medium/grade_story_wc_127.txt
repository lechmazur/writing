<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Eve's motivation is concrete—her static sense has become unreliable, threatening her professional competence—and her interiority is embodied through the sensation of "static crawling up my fingers." The final shift is earned: she gains calibrated empathy without losing boundaries, a change grounded in prior causality. Internal contradiction appears when she was "raised to hate half truths" yet now her "own clarity felt authoritarian and thin," driving the choice to seek counterfeit emotions. Minor deduction: the dealer reads more as oracle than character with genuine wants; his kindness is "borrowed," flattening agency.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Orientation is anchored by ~100 words (Eve, auditor role, amber grotto, dusk, unreliable feelings). The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: density increases through layered sensory details and motifs (static, copper, amber, blotter petal), culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where Eve's static sense "arranged itself, assembling patterns the way constellations emerge from scattered stars." Closure lands with conceptual cost: "my certainties will be subsumed into questions" and "you may not like the person who walks back out." One meaningful deepening occurs when the ampoule is pressed into her palm and borrowed feelings thread through her nerves, reweighting her relationship to half-truths from enemies to scaffolds. The cost is felt on the page in her acceptance of uncertainty.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The amber grotto is vividly rendered—"Light from fossilized resin seeped through the stone ribs overhead, staining every face with a syrupy, honeyed sorrow"—and micro-setting elements (the ampoule, blotter petal, shelves "like ribs") constrain the dealer's ritual and charge the final beat. Sensory hierarchy reflects Eve's professional filter: she notices the copper filaments, the "ghost of burnt sugar," the static deepening as they walk. The environment pressures choice: deeper into the grotto, the static intensifies, her "hair lifting," pulling her toward the ampoule. Minor slip: spatial choreography is occasionally impressionistic (the transition from "crate of bottled moods" to walking among shelves is smooth but vague on exact movement).</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: Eve's unreliable feelings threaten her role as memory auditor, requiring "clarity" and "professional thoroughness." The tightening occurs when the dealer offers the ampoule with a clear price: "your certainties will be subsumed into questions," and "you may not like the person who walks back out." Eve's agency drives the turn—she reaches "hungrily" despite the warning, foreclosing her former authoritarian clarity. The cost is visible: she must accept permanent uncertainty and self-estrangement to gain calibrated empathy. Escalation under the Accumulative lens is achieved through intensifying sensory density (static deepening, copper arcing, ampoule breaking) rather than reversals.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: the story asks whether insight and empathy can coexist without one devouring the other, and whether half-truths are scaffolds or betrayals. The blotter petal, static electricity, and copper filaments recur with shifting valence, culminating in Eve's realization that "half truths glimmered before me, no longer enemies to be crushed, but scaffolds to climb toward a clearer, kinder vantage." This is a non-literal answer that reweights prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates in the dealer's "borrowed" smile and "affectionate detachment," and in Eve's hunger despite the stated cost. No diagnostic intrusions mar the ending.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited, anchored in Eve's professional lexicon ("memory auditor," "evidence spools," "psychological forgery") and perceptual signature (static as taste and texture). Psychic distance modulates purposefully: close during the ampoule application ("soft storm of borrowed feeling rose, threading itself through my nerves like silver roots"), wider during the grotto walk. The dealer's dialogue carries subtext—"people do not come to me for purity, they come for usable narratives"—and his movements are filtered through Eve's professional assessment ("practiced hand," "reverent as a surgeon"). Minor density note: a few filter verbs ("I noticed," "I felt") could tighten without voice loss, but they remain within Eve's observational stance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings shift between subject-verb, participial, and subordinate clauses. Information density is high: most lines do double work (e.g., "His smile was kind without belonging to him, as if borrowed for the evening from a warmer, braver man" conveys both appearance and thematic resonance). Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent ("syrupy, honeyed sorrow," "mud, rain, and shifting footsteps"). Minor deduction for two instances of slight overwriting: "threading itself through my nerves like silver roots" followed immediately by layered metaphors risks density fatigue, and "tasting of weak tea" + "sharp as bitten glass" in close succession creates minor metaphor crowding. No loops or scaffold detected; propulsion is sustained.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The premise—counterfeit emotions as therapeutic technology—is non-obvious and the amber grotto setting is specific, avoiding generic "dark room" or "back alley" defaults. The synthesis of memory auditing + sensory synesthesia (static electricity as taste/touch) + calibrated empathy feels fresh. Emotional complexity is genuine: Eve's hunger for the ampoule coexists with awareness of its cost, and the dealer's borrowed kindness undercuts easy villainy or heroism. The turn from "half truths" as enemies to scaffolds is earned rather than declared. Minor reservation: the dealer as guide-figure leans toward archetype (wise hermit, ferryman); his lack of personal stake keeps the piece one step from full originality.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The dealer is introduced early (~15% in), appears across multiple beats (listening, selecting the ampoule, breaking it over the blotter, pressing it into Eve's palm), and enables the closure by administering the counterfeit emotion. His choice to offer "calibrated empathy without surrender" directly alters Eve's options and foreclosures her former clarity. Cost is tied to his action: he warns of permanent uncertainty and self-estrangement. However, he functions more as catalyst than agent with his own stakes; his choices advance Eve's arc without dramatizing internal conflict of his own. Setup + development + payoff gates are met, with moderate causal pressure and closure linkage. Swappability is low (the specific copper filaments, blotter petal ritual, and "borrowed" smile are unique), but lack of personal stakes caps the score.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The blotter petal appears at ~12% ("fragrance chemist's blotter petal tucked behind his ear, stained a deep umber, exhaling a ghost of burnt sugar"), returns when the dealer taps it against his lip while explaining the scaffold of feelings (~50%), and is used decisively when he breaks the ampoule over it and presses it into Eve's palm (~85%). It constrains the ritual—liquid must be absorbed by the petal before transfer—and its sensory signature (burnt sugar, umber stain) threads through the grotto's atmosphere. The petal is not generic; its fragrance-chemist origin ties to calibrated scent/emotion and its texture ("drank the liquid with a hushed, thirsty sound") is specific. Setup + development + payoff gates met; two distinct beats plus closure participation. Minor cap: while essential to the ritual, the mechanics could theoretically allow a different absorbent object with edits, slightly reducing irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Half truths" is introduced early (~20%: "Half truths spend easier than whole ones") and shapes Eve's dominant stake: her profession demands granite verdicts, but minds are "mud, rain, and shifting footsteps." The concept recurs when Eve explains her question—can borrowed emotions help her balance insight and empathy?—and constrains the dealer's offer: "a counterfeit that admits itself a counterfeit, a half truth that glows in the dark." At closure, the concept is decisively reweighted: "half truths glimmered before me, no longer enemies to be crushed, but scaffolds to climb toward a clearer, kinder vantage." This repricing is undeniable and carries conceptual cost (Eve must abandon authoritarian clarity). Setup + development + payoff gates met with strong causal pressure and closure centrality. The concept is irreplaceable; the entire arc hinges on this exact tension.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Professionally thorough" is invoked twice: once as an expectation placed on Eve (~8%: "expected to be professionally thorough, surgically precise, and utterly unshakeable") and once mirrored in the dealer's ritual (~65%: "selected a small ampoule with a practiced hand, his movements professionally thorough, reverent as a surgeon"). The trait is more label than enacted constraint—Eve's thoroughness is told but not tested on the page by a choice where it costs her something (e.g., she does not refuse a shortcut or sacrifice speed for precision). The mirroring with the dealer signals thematic resonance but remains observational. Setup gate met; development gate weak (no middle choice forced by this trait); payoff gate absent (closure turns on accepting uncertainty, not on sustaining thoroughness). Mid-band for functional but replaceable presence.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Subsume" appears in the dealer's warning (~75%: "for a time, your certainties will be subsumed into questions") and is enacted at closure when borrowed feelings "layered beneath my own emotions instead of replacing them, like subtitles under an image." The action defines the transformation: Eve's self is not erased but overlaid, a specific mechanics that differentiates this from erasure or merging. The verb choice matters—"subsumed" conveys subordination without annihilation—and the closure image pays it off with the "subtitles" metaphor. Setup in second half (late but clearly signaled); development implicit (the ampoule mechanism depends on subsumption); payoff strong (the final state is described using this exact logic). Causal pressure moderate; irreplaceability high (swap "subsumed" for "blended" or "merged" and the closure's precision weakens). Minor late-arrival penalty but strong closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Static electricity as sensory method is introduced early (~10%: "static crawled up my fingers and whispered feelings that were not mine. That was how I sensed now, through static electricity, tasting other people's terrors and hopes in faint, crackling halos") and recurs across beats: static deepens as they walk (~55%: "I felt the static deepen as we walked, my hair lifting"), static reaches for the ampoule (~70%), and at closure the static "arranged itself, assembling patterns the way constellations emerge from scattered stars." The method shapes attempts—Eve's unreliable static is the problem driving her to the dealer—and the resolution reframes it as useful when scaffolded by counterfeit emotions. Setup + development + payoff gates met with strong causal pressure. The mechanics are specific (tactile, gustatory synesthesia) and irreplaceable; remove static and the closure metaphor ("patterns...like constellations") loses anchor. Cost is tied to the method: her former unmediated static is permanently altered.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The amber grotto is introduced immediately (title beat: "The first time I met the counterfeit emotion dealer, the amber grotto at dusk hummed like a low, patient heart") and recurs as they move deeper (~50%: "deeper into the grotto, where the amber walls thickened, catching dust and echoes in their golden trap"). At closure, "the grotto dimmed" as the ampoule breaks, a spatial cue that marks the transformation. The setting supplies atmospheric pressure—honeyed light, stone ribs, syrupy sorrow—and the deepening into the grotto spatially enacts escalation. However, the grotto does not constrain a specific choice (Eve could refuse the ampoule here or elsewhere) nor does its removal break story logic. Setup + development + payoff gates met; two beats plus closure presence. Causal pressure moderate (atmospheric more than tactical); closure linkage present but not decisive. Mid-high band for strong atmospheric integration without mechanical necessity.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"As the transformation completes" appears only in the dealer's warning (~78%: "As the transformation completes, you may not like the person who walks back out of this grotto wearing your name"). The phrase signals futurity—the transformation is underway but not yet complete—creating mild anticipatory pressure. However, the timeframe is not tracked on the page: we do not see Eve mid-transformation or measure duration. At closure, the ampoule is applied and effects begin immediately, but "completes" is not revisited. Setup gate weak (introduced late, in second half); development gate absent (no middle tactic altered by transformation timing); payoff gate absent (closure describes the start of effects, not completion). The phrase functions as thematic color rather than plot clock. Swappable with "when the transformation is done" or similar without structural loss. Mid-low band for minimal integration.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Eve's motivation—to fuse insight with empathy—is stated explicitly (~40%: "could borrowed emotions help me fuse insight with empathy instead of sacrificing one for the other?") and dramatized in her choice to accept the ampoule despite the cost. The desire is conflicted: she was "raised to hate half truths" yet "my own clarity felt authoritarian and thin," creating internal friction. The dealer summarizes her want (~48%: "You wish to feel what your subjects feel, without becoming them...to distinguish fact from the emotions that obscure it") and warns of the price, testing her commitment. At closure, the motivation is fulfilled: "I could feel where each story lied...by the cool absence where true pain should have burned. Half truths glimmered...as scaffolds to climb toward a clearer, kinder vantage." Setup + development + payoff gates met with strong causal pressure and visible cost (certainty sacrificed for calibrated perception). The motivation is irreplaceable—swap for "find truth" or "understand clients" and the closure's specific repricing of half-truths loses anchor.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Affectionate detachment is embodied in the dealer's "smile...kind without belonging to him, as if borrowed for the evening from a warmer, braver man" and his shrug "with affectionate detachment, as though the accusation were a small, familiar dog tugging at his trousers." The tone threads through his dialogue—patient, clinical, gently ironic—and modulates slightly under pressure (reverent when selecting the ampoule, direct when warning of cost). At closure, tone shifts to Eve's sensory immersion, but the dealer's affectionate detachment has primed the reader for borrowed, scaffolded emotion, charging the final image's theme. Setup + development gates met; payoff indirect (tone shapes thematic context rather than appearing in the final lines). Two beats with moderate closure linkage. Causal pressure low (tone colors but does not constrain choices); irreplaceability moderate (other tones could serve, though this one fits the counterfeit-emotion premise). Mid-band for coherent, purposeful tone that supports but does not drive closure.</comment>
