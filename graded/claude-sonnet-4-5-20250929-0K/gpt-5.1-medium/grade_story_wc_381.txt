<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Ilen's interior is concrete and consistent—the "tranquil blaze" metaphor gives texture to his resolve without label-speak. His micro-choices (placing the crane, shaping breath, choosing this valley) emerge from established motive and culminate in a renunciation with visible cost: "each erasure as a weight added to his bones." The stance shift from preparation to completion is earned. Minor: secondary characters are absent, so relational pressure is untested; the protagonist's competence could face one more visceral obstacle to deepen contradiction under stress.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure lands on-page as Charged Poise—the prophecy is hushed, the valley relaxes, and the cost ("weight added to his bones") is legible in the final breath. Orientation anchors early (valley, brook, Ilen). The piece accumulates density through interleaved image and action (crane placement, chant, faraway visions, erasure) and the final image reweights prior material with undeniable pressure. One meaningful tightening: the coded threat loses its tongue. Cost is visible and closure is coherent under the chosen lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The brook, reeds, fireflies, and stone anchor space and sensory hierarchy; the crane's wing and flat stone constrain the ritual action concretely. The valley's pre-existing "half remembered silence" motivates Ilen's site choice and charges the final image when "the night relaxed." Spatial choreography is clean (grass, water, stone). The micro-setting (body, crane, stone) functions as setting here and constrains choice, satisfying the 9+ gate requirement. Minor: occupational mechanics of summoning remain slightly abstract, though the textures are vivid.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (hush the prophecy before fear recruits kingdoms) is signaled early and drives all moves. One meaningful tightening: Ilen's chant narrows options from preparation to erasure, and the cost (weight in bones, lightness in air) is visible on-page. Agency is renunciation with visible price. The visions of taverns, barracks, children create concrete pressure and the dissolution of each thread compounds cost. Under Accumulative lens, the deepening reweights stakes with felt cost. Coincidence does not resolve; Ilen's sustained effort does.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme (silence as intervention, compassion deepening stillness) emerges from concrete action: the crane ritual, the visions of ordinary people unwittingly spreading ruin, the choice to "still the sound long enough for wiser paths." The final image—fireflies in new orbits, "futures not yet fixed, only possible"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in the metaphor of "smoothed hush" and "terrestrially cosmic" fireflies. No thematic echo or label-speak in the ending. Conceptual integrity holds; the story commits fully to its premise and follows implications without retreat.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited with stable distance; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is distinct: Ilen notices silence, intervals, gaps between ink. Diction ("nocturnal haven," "terrestrially cosmic," "nested rooms of quiet") is elevated but voice-motivated and consistent. Purposeful compression in the chant ("without words") and the visions sequence is taught and legible. Psychic distance modulates intentionally (close during the ritual, wider for the valley's relaxation). No dialogue to evaluate. Prose rhythm reflects the focalizer's deliberate, meditative state and compresses cleanly under peak pressure without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Information density is high; nearly every sentence advances ritual, image, or pressure. Rhythm varies: long, layered sentences in setup compress to shorter beats at peak ("One by one…and then unraveled"). No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Minor figurative density in early paragraphs ("shadow among many," "brief constellations," "terrestrially cosmic") edges toward overwriting but remains coherent and voice-motivated. The metaphor of "tranquil blaze" recurs without muddle. Closure image is clean. A few stock phrases ("cloak spread like another shadow") and one near-repetition ("smoothed hush" / "hush thickened") nudge the score slightly below 8.5.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The premise (summoner hushing a prophecy via mapped silence and origami crane) is specific and non-obvious. The transformation of a familiar trope (magic ritual) through concrete, grounded detail (ink constellations, breath intervals, faraway visions) creates freshness. The moral calculus—erasing memory to prevent fear-driven collapse—is not superficial; the cost (weight in bones, futures made possible) is earned. The final image (fireflies in new orbits) synthesizes setup particulars into a resonant, inevitable close. Risk-taking in the lyric-accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. No close echoes of famous work detected.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Ilen's choices drive all key turns: selecting the valley, placing the crane, shaping the chant, laying smoothed hush over each thread, lifting his fingers to end the ritual. Setup in first paragraph, development across the ritual beats, payoff in the final breath. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage. Irreplaceable: the story's logic depends on his sustained agency.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The crane appears in setup (paragraph 15), is placed and touched (ritual action), its wing lifts and glows at peak, and the glow pours over water to resolve the prophecy. Three distinct beats; causal pressure (the wing's loose edge and ink constellations enable the ritual); closure linkage (the glow is the mechanism of erasure). Irreplaceable: removing the crane collapses the ritual's specificity and the final image's charge.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The concept shapes stakes (the prophecy must be hushed without shattering fate) and tactics (Ilen chants in "nested rooms of quiet," lays "smoothed hush" over each thread). Setup in paragraph 3, development across ritual beats, payoff in the valley's relaxation and the "companionable murmur." Causal pressure throughout; the hush is the method and the outcome. Irreplaceable: the story's premise and closure depend on this exact concept.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The attribute appears twice with functional meaning: fireflies as "terrestrially cosmic" (paragraph 4) primes the image of stars stooping to earth, and the crane's glow as "terrestrially cosmic shimmer" (paragraph 34) links the ritual's effect to the fireflies' new orbits at closure. Setup, closure linkage, and conceptual cost (the shift from threat to possibility) are present. Swappability: another elevated descriptor could serve with minor edits, though this one carries thematic weight. Two beats, closure participation, moderate irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>"Flow" operates as the brook's literal flow, the flow of the prophecy across cities, and the crane wing's channeling of silence into the water. Setup (paragraph 1, brook's "unsteady music"), development (paragraph 20, "letting its water flow into the lattice of stillness"), payoff (paragraph 34–35, glow pours over water and the brook smooths its chatter). Three beats; causal pressure (the flow is the transmission mechanism); closure linkage (the brook accepts the light and completes the hush). Irreplaceable: removing "flow" collapses the ritual's logic and the resolution.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The method is signaled in paragraph 18 ("years learning to read it…by mapping silence around them"), enacted in the chant (paragraph 22–23, "shaping the intervals…into nested rooms of quiet"), and fulfilled in the erasure (paragraphs 27–30, threads unravel and smoothed hush is laid). Setup, development across multiple beats, payoff at closure. Causal pressure: the method is the how of the ritual and constrains Ilen's tactics. Strong irreplaceability: no other method would preserve the story's specific logic.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The valley and brook are present in setup (paragraph 1–6, chosen because "the world already half remembered silence here"), constrain ritual tactics (the brook's flow is channeled into the crane's lattice), and charge the final image (the valley relaxes, the brook murmurs companionably, fireflies drift in new patterns). Three beats; causal pressure (the site's pre-existing silence eases the work); closure linkage (the valley's state change is the proof of success). Strong irreplaceability: the setting is not postcard but functional constraint and outcome.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Amid whispered secrets" appears in the reeds' gossip (paragraph 7) and recurs in the final line ("amid whispered secrets of water and grass"). The phrase frames expectation and charges the ending image, but does not tighten decisions or alter tactics mid-ritual; time remains vague (one night, no clock pressure). Two gates (setup, payoff via lyric reprise); no middle development. Moderate thematic reweighting at closure. Swappable with another ambient descriptor; irreplaceability is low. Score reflects lyric allowance but cap at mid-6s for lack of tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The motivation is dramatized in paragraphs 10–13 (the prophecy's coded spread, the promise of collapse, the recruitment of fear) and drives all choices. Setup early, development across ritual beats (visions of tavern, barracks, children), payoff in the erasure and the final grateful breath. Strong causal pressure: the desire to "still the sound long enough for wiser paths" shapes every tactic. Friction between compassion and the weight of erasure is visible ("chest tightened…held the tranquil blaze steady"). Closure linkage and irreplaceability are high; cost is legible.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The tone is established in paragraph 9 ("tranquil blaze, bright but contained, fierce yet resolved not to scorch") and modulates under pressure: calm preparation, rising intensity during the chant and visions, compression at erasure, and release in the final breath. Coherent through turns; the oxymoron charges the closure image (weight in bones, lightness in air). Three beats; closure linkage strong. The tone is not static but calibrated to pressure and integral to thematic resonance. High irreplaceability: removing "tranquil blaze" flattens the story's emotional and conceptual texture.</comment>
