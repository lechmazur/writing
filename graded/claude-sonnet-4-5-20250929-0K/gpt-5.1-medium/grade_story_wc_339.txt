<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's interiority is concrete and distinctly rendered—"quietly analytic, the sort of person who measures panic in heartbeats per minute and grief in the weight of unspoken words"—and the physicist's letter creates genuine mirroring pressure. The final choice carries visible cost: salvaging everything would "smother the very uncertainty" the physicist entrusted to the sea, yet leaving it all risks incompleteness. Minor slip: the skeleton's "mid-sentence" jaw and the narrator's parallel obsession feel slightly over-articulated, nudging toward thematic convenience rather than fully embodied contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors quickly (diver, coordinates, wreck site) and the accumulative lens holds: discovery of library → snow globes → skeleton → cylinder → decompression chamber → choice. Closure is Charged Poise with conceptual cost legible on the page: "a compromise that felt like mourning" directly names the foreclosed paths (raising only the cylinder vs. salvaging everything) and the undeniable pressure of honoring the physicist's experiment. The cost is felt even though the exact action is withheld, meeting RR standards. One micro-deduction: the Amelia Earhart frame bookends neatly but doesn't constrain the middle beats as tightly as the snow-globe logic does.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The sunken library is vividly particular—"letters detached and drifted upward like startled fish," snow globes tethered to a collapsed chandelier—and the decompression chamber's claustrophobic intimacy ("the cylinder lay between us like a found heartbeat") charges the decision beat. The wreck's spatial choreography remains clear across moves. Micro-setting (the cylinder, the globes) constrains the narrator's final choice, meeting the 9+ gate in principle, but the Earhart hangar at the end feels more symbolic than spatially active, preventing full high-band entry.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (whether to salvage or honor the experiment's uncertainty) is signaled early via the physicist's note and tightens in the decompression chamber when colleagues shift toward "catalog numbers and news crews." The narrator's agency—choosing "a compromise that felt like mourning"—forecloses paths with felt cost. The escalation is driven by protagonist reflection under accumulative pressure rather than causal reversals, which fits the lens, but the middle section (reading the note) is more expository than dramatized, slightly softening the tightening effect.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme (the physics of letting go) emerges organically from the library experiment, the narrator's diving practice, and the final choice, never stated as a moral. The snow globes' buoyancy test and the narrator's mirroring obsession create layered subtext. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: the compromise itself enacts partial release with undeniable mourning, reweighting all prior material. No thematic echo or explicit philosophizing mars the closure beat.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and controlled—"You learn, when you are on a first name basis with death, that respect is not the same thing as refusal"—with a perceptual signature (analytic detachment under pressure) consistent throughout. Psychic distance tightens smoothly from wreck observation to interior choice. Minor register drift: "untangling threads between weight and meaning" and "allegiance to gravity" occasionally elevate diction beyond the narrator's established plain precision, but the effect remains legible and voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high—"letters detached and drifted upward like startled fish" does multiple jobs. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Two micro-issues: "I felt the familiar tightening in my chest, the sense that time was folding over" layers metaphor densely in a peak beat without full payoff, and "the physics of letting go" recurs identically across narrator and physicist, risking synonym fatigue. Clarity and propulsion otherwise remain strong.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The library-as-experiment premise is fresh and the buoyancy conceit (emotions altering material weight) offers a non-obvious synthesis. The mirroring between narrator and physicist feels earned rather than forced. Risk is present: the open ending and lyric accumulation heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. Slight deduction: the Amelia Earhart frame, while thematically apt, is a familiar contemporary touchstone that leans on external cultural weight rather than purely internal invention.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character (first name basis with death) frames expectation in the opening line and constrains the narrator's stance throughout—"respect is not the same thing as refusal" directly enables the choice to pry the cylinder loose. It seeds the ending's mourning posture. Not indispensable (a different diving rationale could work), but it shapes two beats (cylinder retrieval, final compromise) and participates in closure by coloring the mourning tone.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The snow globes appear at discovery, enable the note's buoyancy hypothesis, and reappear in the final choice ("if we salvaged everything... turned each snow globe... into a museum exhibit, we would smother the very uncertainty"). They constrain the decision with specific cost and charge the closure image. Three beats, clear irreplaceability via their floating mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Last transmission" is named in the note and shapes the entire stake: the physicist's experiment *is* his transmission, and the narrator must decide whether to honor or archive it. It drives the middle exposition and the ending's mourning logic. The phrase recurs with reweighted meaning at closure ("his last transmission to a future that might never listen"), meeting high integration.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Quietly analytic" is shown on the page—"measures panic in heartbeats per minute and grief in the weight of unspoken words"—and enables the narrator's methodical retrieval and reflective choice. It constrains voice and approach but doesn't create a visible tradeoff or cost in the peak beats; the trait supports rather than complicates. Present in setup and closure coloring, moderate causal role.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The note (cylinder) discovery is the inciting action and its contents drive the middle section and the ending's choice. However, the note itself is a passive vessel; the major turn could function with a different discovery object (a log, a manifesto). It appears in three beats but lacks unique irreplaceability beyond "message from the past."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"By untangling threads" is mentioned once in the physicist's description of his method but does not shape on-page tactics or attempts. The narrator doesn't employ untangling as a dramatized means; the phrase remains abstract and ornamental within the note exposition. Present but not causally active.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The forgotten sunken ship library provides all material stakes: books, globes, cylinder, skeleton, and the space that enables the buoyancy experiment. It pressures the narrator's choice (salvage vs. leave) and supplies the closure image's weight. The setting is indispensable across all three gates and deeply integrated into causality and theme.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The Earhart timeframe anchors the opening and closing but does not tighten decisions or tactics in the middle. It provides cultural resonance (one mystery solved, another disturbed) but functions as thematic bookend rather than causal pressure. Present in setup and closure mention, minimal development.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The motivation "to understand the physics of letting go" is dramatized in both the narrator's diving habit and the physicist's experiment, creating mirroring pressure. It drives the choice at the end with visible cost ("a compromise that felt like mourning"). The motivation is conflicted—understanding requires both salvage and release—and shapes two key beats plus closure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sophisticated melancholy suffuses the voice ("the sense that time was folding over," "a compromise that felt like mourning") and modulates coherently through discovery, reflection, and choice without flattening into single-note sadness. The tone charges the final image and integrates with the physics-of-letting-go theme. Rhythm and diction maintain tonal control under accumulative pressure.</comment>
