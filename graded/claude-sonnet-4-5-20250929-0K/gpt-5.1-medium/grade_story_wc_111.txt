<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias is embodied through physical degradation ("fingers turning first to pain and then to numb wood," "knuckles knotting, skin roughening into barklike whorls") and his choices are motivated by a clear stance against measured luck. His "wisely pragmatic" trait drives the pruning-shears decision and the private ledger system. Internal contradiction appears in his simultaneous acceptance of death ("when my luck runs out") and his determined cultivation of legacy, though the peak choice to polish marbles and plant commemorative objects feels more thematic than urgently pressured by competing impulses.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through repeated motifs (marbles, luck metrics, blooming/withering) and the final image reweights the opening question about measured luck. Orientation is clean by line three. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (the maze answering him, "blooming and withering in time with his slowing pulse") with conceptual cost legible in the merging of gardener and garden, though the final beat lacks a sharp decisive moment that forecloses an option with visible friction. The lens holds, but the ending drifts into lyricism without a last tightening that makes the cost undeniable on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The maze functions as setting and constraint: hedges "slowly turning toward him," visitors returning in "lunchtime tides," the arbor and tool shed anchoring spatial logic. Micro-setting details (the cracked bowl, flagstones, keys as wind chimes) charge the final image and constrain Elias's commemorative system. The garden's spatial choreography remains clear across multiple beats, and the setting mirrors his bodily decline without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: proving that measured luck does not own the whole story, signaled early via the hospital prognosis and Elias's choice of shears over rest. One meaningful tightening occurs when visitors return and engage the marbles, validating his system. The rolling-marble divination and the planted commemorations show agency, yet the escalation feels more like accumulation than a narrowing choice with visible trade-off. Cost is conceptual (his body becoming wood) but the ending does not foreclose a live alternative with friction on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme—luck as human touch versus algorithmic certainty—emerges through concrete particulars: the eleven-point-three rating, polished marbles, wind chimes, dusk flowers. The final image ("maze curved around him like a question mark slowly learning to become a sentence") offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in the gap between visitors' nudged scores and Elias's private ledger, and the mended-deception motif reweights the opening without stating a thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV distance is stable, focalized tightly through Elias's perceptual signature: he tastes soil, tests marbles "the way he might test ripeness in fruit," and mutters to the soil. Diction fits his voice ("a short bark that hurt his chest," "stubborn class") with consistent register. No head-hopping. The phrase "when nobody yet knew how to graph a persons odds of joy" dips into omniscient historical summary without clear anchoring in Elias's present reflection, causing a brief distance wobble mid-story.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high ("hedges slumped like tired bureaucrats, gaps yawning where children had torn shortcuts"). Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent. Minor loop: "The maze had once been a civic wonder" is followed two sentences later by restating the hedges' decline; the two beats paraphrase without advancing pressure. Template cadence appears in the commemorative catalog ("If a child had laughed… he would hang… If an office worker paused… he planted"), applying −0.4 for the pattern. No clarity break at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of measured-luck dystopia and tactile gardening offers a fresh angle, and the marbles-as-tokens conceit avoids stock symbolism by grounding them in polish-and-roll action. The timeframe ("after luck becomes measurable") and the slow bodily merging with the maze feel specific rather than generic. Risk-taking is moderate: the accumulative structure and quiet ending heighten stakes without obscuring clarity, earning +0.3 within band. However, the "gardener becomes garden" closure image echoes familiar pastoral transformation arcs without a final twist that makes it undeniable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's choices—hiring himself, polishing marbles, planting commemorative objects, rolling marbles as divination—create multiple beats. His decisions alter tactics (visitors return, maze blooms) and the final image hinges on his merging with the garden. However, the peak choice is more thematic stance than a single high-cost decision that narrows options under friction.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The marbles are discovered, polished in the tool shed, placed in the bowl for visitors, and rolled as divination—four distinct beats. They reappear in the final paragraph ("In the mirror of a marble held to his eye") with reweighted meaning. Their cracked state and color threads constrain the polishing action and enable the proof-of-luck system, making removal damaging to story logic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Mended deception" is signaled early ("as if destiny were spare change," "a mended deception") and shapes Elias's tactic: he polishes the marbles to restore their beauty, knowing the luck-raising promise is false yet valuable. It constrains his commemorative system and appears in the ending via the marbles' reflective proof. However, the concept is more thematic frame than an option-narrowing pressure; swapping it for "restored illusion" would require minimal edits.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Wisely pragmatic" drives the inciting choice (shears over rest) and the decision to hire himself, each with cost (body degradation, solitary labor). It reappears implicitly in his quiet ledger and muttering instruction to the soil. The trait constrains romantic or passive responses, but after the opening beat it operates more as consistent voice than a live friction that alters later tactics.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Polishing is the central transformative act: Elias takes the dull marbles, oils and rubs them until "their threads of color brightened," enabling their function as tokens of beauty and his proof system. It occupies a dedicated beat, recurs when visitors find the bowl, and the polished marbles' reflections charge the ending image. Removing the polish action would collapse the mended-deception logic and the visitors' smiles.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The method is signaled ("he commemorated small victories elaborately") and demonstrated through wind chimes and dusk flowers, each tied to a visitor's response. It shapes his nightly routine and the maze's evolution. However, the commemorations are more illustrative than causal; they don't alter the visitor influx or force a tactical trade-off, and the final image does not hinge on them.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The maze structures every beat: it isolates Elias, its hedges "turn toward him," its neglected state prompts his hiring, its refreshed paths draw visitors, and its center houses the marbles. The maze's spatial logic (corridors, arbor, tool shed, flagstones) constrains his movements and the rolling-marble divination. The final image—maze as question mark—depends on this exact setting; a generic garden would break the story's pressure and closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The timeframe ("after luck becomes measurable") anchors the opening, motivates the prognosis on a public screen, and justifies visitors checking wrist scores. It shapes Elias's rebellion and the marbles' original purpose. The ending invokes it via the contrast between algorithmic luck and his tactile proof. However, the timeframe is more world-rule than live ticking clock; removing the measurability frame would require restructuring but the garden restoration arc could proceed on similar emotional terrain.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The desire to prove gardens remember gardeners drives the muttering-to-soil beat and the commemorative system, and it surfaces in the ending ("gardens know their gardeners"). It motivates his nightly marble rolls as proof-gathering. Yet the motivation is more articulated theme than dramatized friction; the story does not stage a moment where this belief costs him an alternative path or forces a choice between competing wants.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The tone oscillates between withering (hospital prognosis, "veins on a public screen," "tired bureaucrats," bodily decay) and blooming (polished marbles, returning visitors, planted flowers, maze answering him) across every major beat. The final image fuses both: "blooming and withering in time with his slowing pulse." The modulation charges the closure and remains coherent under pressure, with no tonal collapse into pure sentiment or despair.</comment>
