<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's identity as a "crisis actor real crisis survivor" provides strong internal contradiction and motivates the choice to work at the gallery. The walking circuits that spell words demonstrate embodied processing of trauma through concrete action. The custodian's phantom chess games and tea ritual add texture, though his characterization remains somewhat thin. The final choice to "unbind my archive from paper" and write stories into the floor feels earned by the accumulating pressure of the interregnum and the threatened closure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens. The piece builds density through layered fragments (the crisis actor past, the gallery's acoustic function, the pawnless chessboard exhibit, the interregnum context) that converge at closure. The final act—deciding to inscribe the archive into the floor before eviction—constitutes a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the narrator crystallizes a stance of preservation through embodied action, foreclosing retreat with visible cost (the gallery "kept whispering" after closure, a nomadic repository). Cost is legible in the renunciation of paper permanence and the commitment to an ephemeral, bodily archive. One meaningful deepening occurs when the boy recites the narrator's own disaster report and the parents dismiss it as staged, forcing the narrator to choose silence over correction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The whispering gallery's acoustics constrain multiple choices: the narrator logs gestures by their sonic signatures, the woman and man negotiate divorce through stone-mediated whispers, and the dome itself becomes the archive medium. The custodian's glass-cased chessboard and the narrator's walking circuits use micro-setting (body and object) to charge the final image. The interregnum context colors every interaction—"everyone walking careful circles around power that was not there"—making the setting inseparable from theme. The gallery's threatened closure by the next regime tightens the final decision.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake: preserving an archive of "small gestures" in a political void where ordinary voices may soon be silenced. The pressure deepens when rumors arrive that the new ruler will close the gallery, forcing the narrator from passive cataloging to active inscription. The boy's recitation of the narrator's own disaster—dismissed by his parents as staged—creates a secondary tightening: the narrator must choose silence, crystallizing the role of "historian" over "witness." The cost of the final decision (walking every story into the floor before eviction) is visible: the archive becomes embodied, ephemeral, and dependent on the narrator's physical endurance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of expendability and leaderless systems emerges organically through the pawnless chessboard, the narrator's self-identification as "a pawn who had walked off the board," and the interregnum's "subjects of nothing." The final image—"routes of words only my feet could have written"—reweights the entire archive project as both preservation and erasure, a "luminous absence" that resists the next regime without shouting. The question "what does a pawn become when it refuses promotion" reverberates through the closure without a stated answer. No thematic intrusion or moralizing; the particulars (the divorce whispered through stone, Gesture 187, the boy's recitation) embody the inquiry.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinct narrative voice with a tendency toward elevated, lyrical diction that occasionally drifts ("nomadic penumbra," "luminous absence") but remains internally consistent and voice-motivated. The narrator's perceptual signature—annotating pauses, translating gestures into sounds, spelling apologies with footsteps—is character-specific and sustained under pressure. Free indirect style is clean. The woman's divorce request and the man's three-beat "I will" demonstrate dialogue as compressed action with subtext. Minor register drift in phrases like "Acoustic Integrity Liaison" and "a morgue drawer for expendability" reads as the narrator's ironic distance rather than voice leakage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong propulsion and information density through most of the piece. Figurative language ("luminous absence," "nomadic penumbra," "morgue drawer for expendability") occasionally clusters without clear payoff, approaching overwriting in the middle third. A paraphrase loop appears: "what does a pawn become when it refuses promotion" is spelled with footsteps, then immediately answered by the dome's draft, then restated conceptually in the next paragraph—three adjacent moves circling the same idea. The final image—"routes of words only my feet could have written"—lands cleanly. No major scaffold or syntax monotony, but the figurative density in non-peak beats merits a modest deduction.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of whispering gallery, pawnless chessboard, interregnum, and crisis-actor-survivor identity feels specific and non-obvious. The walking pattern that spells words into stone is a fresh inflection on archive and embodiment. The piece commits fully to its lyric-accumulative premise without retreat. Minor proximity concern: the "luminous absence" phrasing and the image of voices traveling through stone echo established literary tropes (Calvino, Borges), though the execution is personalized through the narrator's occupation and trauma. Risk-taking in structure (mosaic fragments, heavy reflection, conceptual density) succeeds without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Present throughout; frames the narrator's motivation and perceptual filter. The identity surfaces in two key beats: the recollection of the staged-then-real emergency (mid-story) and the boy's recitation of the disaster report (late), where the narrator chooses silence over correction. This choice alters tactics—shifting from spoken witness to inscribed archive. The dual identity makes the final act (walking stories into the floor) legible as both preservation and self-erasure. Reaches two gates (setup, payoff) and shapes one middle choice.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Introduced at ~one-third; the custodian sets it out and explains it as "an exhibit about leaderless systems." It generates the narrator's reflection ("a pawn who had walked off the board") and anchors the phantom chess games with the custodian. The board returns conceptually in the question spelled with footsteps: "what does a pawn become when it refuses promotion." The missing pawns charge the closure image (the narrator as expendable piece practicing "new openings"). Three gates met; causal pressure on theme and closure participation, though the object itself is not physically handled after the initial scene.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The phrase "nomadic penumbra" appears once in the middle third as a metaphor for the draft in the dome ("a traveling shadow searching for another body"). It evokes the interregnum's condition—everyone orbiting absent power—but does not constrain a choice or return to charge the closure. The concept resonates thematically but remains ornamental in execution. Lyric seed without payoff; setup and closure participation are weak.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Applied to the custodian: "benevolently ruthless in his play, sacrificing everything for position, then offering me tea when I inevitably lost." The trait colors one interaction (the phantom chess games) but does not constrain an on-page action or generate visible cost. The custodian's dialogue about the pawns "practicing new openings" reflects the attribute but does not test it under pressure. Present in the middle third; development and payoff gates are weak.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Core action. The narrator begins by walking circuits to spell "apologies I owed, names I had forgotten, headlines I had once pretended to survive." Late in the story, this escalates to the decision to "unbind my archive from paper, teaching the floor itself to remember by walking every story into its circumference." The action defines the closure: after eviction, "the gallery kept whispering, a luminous absence filled with routes of words only my feet could have written." Three gates; causal pressure and closure shaping are strong. The specificity (spelling vs. other archive methods) makes it difficult to swap.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Introduced early (first third) and used across beats: the narrator spells apologies and names during circuits, then escalates to spelling the boy's sentence "until the stone remembered it better than they did," and finally commits to walking "every story into its circumference" before eviction. The method shapes the closure image ("routes of words only my feet could have written") and the archive's persistence. Three gates; causal involvement across multiple beats; the mechanics (footsteps as inscription) are specific and irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The whispering gallery is indispensable. Its acoustics enable the divorce negotiation, the boy's recitation, and the narrator's cataloging of gestures by sound. The dome's structure (curved wall, distance effects) constrains every interaction and choice. The setting generates the archive method (walking circuits) and the final image (the gallery "kept whispering" after closure). The threatened closure by the next regime tightens the decision to inscribe stories into the floor. Three gates; pervasive causal pressure; removal would collapse the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The interregnum frames every interaction and supplies the piece's central metaphor ("everyone walking careful circles around power that was not there"). It motivates the ministers' televised arguments, the citizens' rehearsals of subjecthood, and the rumor that the next ruler will close the gallery. The timeframe tightens the narrator's decision to inscribe the archive before "the locks finally changed." Three gates met; causal involvement in the ending. The cost (urgency, impending eviction) is legible but could be supplied by other political transitions with modest edits.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stated early: "Unofficially, I was gathering material to become the historian of small gestures." The desire shapes the narrator's work (logging "Gesture 187: consent without eye contact"), the walking circuits that spell stories, and the final decision to unbind the archive from paper. Friction appears when the boy's parents dismiss the narrator's disaster as staged, forcing a choice between correction (asserting witness) and silence (preserving the archive's quiet authority). Three gates; causal pressure on multiple beats; the motivation is tested and drives the closure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The phrase "luminous absence" appears twice: in the opening third ("whispers arrived stripped of faces, turning into a kind of luminous absence") and in the final line ("a luminous absence filled with routes of words only my feet could have written"). The tone—hushed, elegiac, meditative—coheres across beats and modulates with pressure (the boy's recitation, the custodian's quiet dialogue, the final commitment). The reprise charges the closure by reweighting the archive as both presence and void. Lyric reprise with cost; all three gates met; tone as structural element rather than static mood.</comment>
