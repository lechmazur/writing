<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The protagonist's interiority is concrete and specific—"the ache behind my ribs where a heart might have existed" anchors the character's exile in embodied sensation. Internal contradiction operates across the piece: tending the garden to escape burning yet recognizing the familiar patterns reappearing. The grandmother's candle-pinching lesson grounds the abstract tending impulse in a specific, contradictory memory that charges the final choice. However, the renunciation at closure—continuing to prune while questioning whether it breaks old equations—feels somewhat asserted rather than dramatized through a visible on-page micro-choice with immediate cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density increases through layered images (wilting stars, falling petals, budding suns), with a clear cadence shift in the final paragraph where the protagonist moves from observation to active intervention ("closing luminous filaments," "spreading dim warmth"). Closure is Charged Poise—the final image crystallizes the protagonist's stance ("tender and troubled, quiet and unafraid") and reconfigures the opening despair into purposeful action, with conceptual cost visible in the conditional "perhaps" that admits uncertainty. Orientation anchors who (otherworldly sentimentalist), where (nebula garden), and what (tending stars) by the second paragraph. The piece teaches its reflective pattern early and sustains coherent pressure through the recurring question of whether exile merely extends or breaks generational harm.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The nebula garden functions as micro-setting throughout: ionized dust petals, hydrogen veils, and luminous filaments constrain the protagonist's pruning actions and charge the final image of "closing luminous filaments before they flare to cruelty." The calculating gear operates as tactile anchor—"ticking softly," pressed between fingers with teeth biting skin—grounding reflection in physical sensation. Sensory selection reflects the protagonist's priorities: colors "tuned to frequencies that would rattle bone" and "sonar pinging through the luminous fog" create a consistent synesthetic filter. Spatial choreography remains coherent across drifting, tending, and reaching gestures.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: whether tending light without fire can break generational patterns of burning. One meaningful deepening occurs when the protagonist glimpses "familiar constellations forming in the distance"—patterns of cruelty repeating—which raises the cost of continued exile by making success uncertain. The final choice to keep "teaching each newborn sun that shining is not the same as burning" narrows options (commits to the work despite doubt) with felt cost visible in the conditional "perhaps" that admits the pattern may not shift. Agency is endurance with visible friction: the protagonist actively prunes while questioning effectiveness, a stance that forecloses retreat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the contrast between burning (traditions as brands pressed into the mind) and slow-growing light diffused through hydrogen veils. The grandmother's candle-pinching lesson—"some lights must be touched if they are to be trusted"—seeds the protagonist's hands-on tending without stating a moral. Subtext operates in the recurring gear-ticking and sonar-pinging, which accumulate pressure through sound and echo rather than declaration. The ending offers a resonant answer to the central question (can light arrive without wounds?) through the final image of pruning "tender and troubled," which reweights the opening wilting stars without resolving into a tidy binary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV distance is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature: the protagonist filters sensory input through the lens of light and harm ("radiance approximates infinity," "colors wrong for human eyes"). Diction remains within the focalizer's cosmological register without unmotivated shifts; vocabulary like "ion fire" and "hydrogen veils" feels earned by the caretaker role. Psychic distance modulates purposefully: reflection on the burning houses pulls back to establish motive, then returns to immediate tending. One minor slip: "approximates infinity yet never quite arrives" risks elevated phrasing in early setup, but the voice recovers through embodied detail (the gear's teeth biting skin).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Information density is high: most sentences do multiple jobs (e.g., "Each tick is a sonar pinging through the luminous fog, echoing off unseen futures and returning with possibilities slippery as light" advances both setting and the protagonist's uncertainty). Rhythm varies naturally with longer reflective sentences giving way to shorter actions in the final paragraph. Minor overwriting in the middle: "troubling serenity pools in the shadows" and "invisible hands" lean toward stock metaphor without full transformation. One paraphrase loop: "I wonder whether tending this place is enough" followed by "Perhaps, if I do this long enough" restates the same doubt without added pressure. No artifacts touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of gardening cosmology with generational trauma feels specific rather than generic; the nebula garden as exile destination transforms the familiar "fleeing harm" premise through the protagonist's active cultivation role. The grandmother's candle-pinching detail particularizes the backstory beyond stock "burning traditions." Risk-taking in the reflective mode (high reflection percentage, lyric structure) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; the piece commits fully to its premise. One proximity note: "troubling serenity" as descriptor risks abstraction, though it recurs purposefully.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character is signaled in paragraph three, shapes middle reflection (recognizing familiar constellations), and drives the ending choice to continue pruning. The protagonist's decisions alter tactics: moving from passive watching to active closing of filaments. Two distinct beats involve character work: the memory trigger and the final commitment. Cost is visible in the conditional "perhaps."</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Object appears early (paragraph eleven), recurs when pressed between fingers (paragraph twenty-four), and ticks through multiple beats to mark cycle closures. The gear's teeth biting skin in the penultimate beat charges the final image by grounding reflection in embodied sensation. Used in at least three distinct beats with evolving pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Concept is introduced early ("generational patterns"), shapes the protagonist's motive for exile, and directly alters tactics when familiar patterns reappear in the nebula. The protagonist's fear that "I am merely extending them into a quieter register" narrows options at closure. The concept constrains the final choice: the protagonist must actively teach newborn suns to avoid repeating the cycle. Present in setup, middle reflection, and closure with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Attribute appears in the opening paragraph and recurs in the penultimate paragraph ("their total number approximates infinity"). It establishes scale but does not constrain a specific on-page action with visible cost. The infinity framing colors the protagonist's endurance stance but remains more thematic accent than tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Action is mentioned in the opening ("the first time I drifted into the nebula garden") and implied as ongoing, but no major turn traces specifically to the act of transit. The protagonist is already in the garden for the entire piece; the initial drift is backstory setup rather than a live choice that redefines options.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Method appears in paragraph twelve ("sonar pinging through the luminous fog") and recurs in the final paragraphs ("the echoes of my own sonar pinging through the nebula garden"). The sonar shapes the protagonist's listening stance and charges the closure image, but its mechanics are more metaphorical than tactical; it does not visibly alter a middle beat's options.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Setting is established early, pressures every choice (the protagonist prunes trajectories, coaxes eruptions, closes filaments), and charges the final image ("drift among the falling petals"). The nebula's properties—slow-growing light, hydrogen veils, ion fire—constrain the protagonist's methods and distinguish this tending from the burning traditions. Present across setup, middle, and closure with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Timeframe phrase appears in paragraph seven and recurs as "falling petals" throughout. Time "moves differently, not in hours but in patterns" establishes the piece's accumulative lens and the long patience required. The gear's ticking marks cycle closures, creating a loose clock. The timeframe does not tighten a single decision but shapes the protagonist's endurance stance across the piece.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation is dramatized early (paragraph sixteen: "someone whose motivation was to share light without using fire") and drives the protagonist's choices throughout: guiding stars into stable dances, closing filaments before they flare, teaching that "shining is not the same as burning." Friction between the want (break old patterns) and cost (uncertainty, isolation) is visible in the conditional "perhaps" at closure. Present in setup, middle tactics, and final commitment.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Tone is signaled in paragraph six ("troubling serenity") and sustained through the piece's contradiction between calm pruning and underlying doubt. The tone modulates under pressure: reflection on burning traditions introduces urgency, then the prose returns to the diffused, patient register. The final image—"tender and troubled, quiet and unafraid"—crystallizes the tone's dual nature and charges the closure without resolving the tension.</comment>
