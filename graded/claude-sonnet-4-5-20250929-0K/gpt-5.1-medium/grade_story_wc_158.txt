<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The poet's motivation to "photosynthesize pain into beauty" is established early and drives the action through the moon's absence. His interior logic—singing a lullaby to negotiate with the sea—reads as character-specific and rooted in grandmother's instruction. However, the coral blooming and moon's return feel externally granted rather than won by his contradiction or cost; his choice to sing carries emotional weight but not a visible forfeiture that tests competing impulses. The final rest feels like reward rather than renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: the poet's song, postcard, and coral path converge to restore the moon, and the final image—"ensconcing the night in patient verse"—reweights his insomnia as productive vigil. The orientation is clear by the opening lines (who, where, when). One meaningful deepening occurs when the coral blooms in response to his song, narrowing his stance from passive observation to active negotiation. Cost is implied—he "finally lay down"—but the price reads more as resolution than forfeiture, keeping the closure in the RR/CR zone rather than decisive change.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The gargantuan shell is vivid and purposeful: spiral corridors, barnacles, jellyfish-bright lanterns, and reef-shadow interplay ground every beat. The galaxy postcard functions as micro-setting, glowing and guiding action at the threshold. The coral path emerges as both atmosphere and constraint, forming a negotiation space that the poet must address. The sensory hierarchy—water-light, pulsing barnacles, shimmering curtain—reflects the poet's nocturnal attention and charges the final image of the restored city.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—restoring the moon to ease insomnia and the city's tides—is signaled early and coheres throughout. Pressure tightens when the poet moves from observation to song, then when the coral responds and the moon's hiding is revealed as sulking clouds. However, the resolution arrives through the sea's cooperation rather than the poet's sacrifice or trade-off; the treaty is proposed and granted without testing what he must give up. One meaningful deepening (song → coral → moon) is present, but agency at closure leans passive.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The blossom armistice—beauty and sorrow coexisting—emerges organically from the poet's vocation and grandmother's instruction, culminating in his negotiation with the moon. The final image of "reef-shadow joy" and "cradled by reef-shadow joy" reprises the opening's duality without stating a moral. Subtext operates in the coral's response and the moon's "gentle astonishment," suggesting mutual need rather than command. The theme resists tidy resolution; the poet remains an insomniac, now at peace with his sleeplessness.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The voice is lush and consistent, with figurative density ("hammock of woven kelp and listening ink," "water rose like a curtain") anchored in the poet's lyric sensibility. Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping. However, elevated diction occasionally drifts into decorative register ("gargantuan," "ensconcing") that reads more authorial than character-particular under peak pressure. The phrase "shyly unstoppable" recurs as a label without syntactic variation. Free indirect style is clean, and the perceptual signature—nocturnal, attentive to light and sound—remains coherent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Figurative language is dense and often vivid ("hammock of woven kelp and listening ink"), but several beats stack metaphors without causal advance: "reef-shadow joy" is repeated across paragraphs with minimal reweighting, and "shyly unstoppable" appears twice identically. Template cadence is present in runs like "He gathered… The postcard was… On its bent surface… On the back…" and "If you return… Shine on… Drench us…". Paraphrase loops occur: "The moon should have lain there… Instead, the horizon yawned blank" restates absence without adding pressure. These artifacts lower momentum in mid-beats, though the closure image itself remains clear.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of undersea city, insomniac poet, and moon negotiation via sung lullaby is specific and non-obvious. The blossom armistice legend is transformed into active diplomacy rather than backstory. However, the emotional arc—lonely artist restores cosmic balance through song—echoes familiar mythic templates without a sharp moral calculus or visible personal cost that would deepen the stakes. The coral-as-witness and postcard-as-alternate-sky are fresh touches, but the resolution leans toward wish-fulfillment rather than hard-won transformation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The insomniac poet drives setup (wakes, gathers tools), middle (sings to the sea), and closure (writes until dawn, finally rests). His choice to sing is purposeful and rooted in grandmother's instruction. However, the coral's bloom and moon's return are externally triggered rather than won by his internal contradiction or sacrifice; he observes more than decides at the turn. His occupation as poet shapes every beat, but agency at closure leans passive—he proposes, the world grants.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The galaxy postcard appears in three beats: gathering (setup), threshold placement where it glows (middle), and lifted as "alternate sky" during negotiation (closure). Its function evolves from heirloom to map to bargaining token, and its glow reacts to starlight, giving it active presence. However, the postcard's role in the final turn is declarative rather than mechanically decisive; the moon responds to the poet's words, not the card's properties. Integration is strong but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The blossom armistice is introduced as reef legend (setup), explicitly invoked as the poet seeks "a similar treaty between shell and sky" (middle), and enacted in his negotiation ("accept your phases," "keep our shadows"). It shapes the stakes—coexistence of beauty and sorrow—and constrains his approach: he offers mutual terms rather than demanding return. The concept charges the closure image ("reef-shadow joy") and would be difficult to replace without altering the story's thematic logic.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Shyly unstoppable" is used twice as a label to describe the poet's midnight wanderings and his singing voice. It does not constrain a choice or force a visible tradeoff; the poet proceeds without hesitation or cost in either instance. The attribute gestures at characterization but remains ornamental—removing it would not alter any beat's outcome or the closure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Ensconce" appears twice: clouds "tried to ensconce" the moon (middle explanation) and the poet "ensconcing the night in patient verse" (closure image). The first use explains the moon's absence but does not drive a turn; the second charges the final line but arrives as metaphor rather than enacted choice. The action is thematically resonant and signals early, but swapping it for "shelter" or "cradle" would leave structure intact.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The method is signaled when the poet hums the grandmother's lullaby (setup), sung "imperfect, wandering, carried via half-sung lullabies carried on an off-key wind" (middle), and credited when the coral blooms in response and the moon returns (closure). The imperfection—off-key, half-sung—is mechanically essential; perfect song would violate the blossom armistice's logic of flawed beauty. The method shapes the middle attempt and enables the resolution with specific, irreplaceable properties.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The gargantuan shell anchors every beat: the poet lives within it, moves through spiral streets, reaches the outermost chamber at the threshold, and returns to his room. Barnacles pulse, jellyfish lanterns mark doorways, and the shell's structure organizes the poet's journey. At closure, moonlight transforms the shell ("turning barnacles to coins and windows to halos"), charging the final image. The setting provides spatial logic and atmosphere, though it does not constrain a difficult choice—the poet's path is open throughout.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Across centuries of longing" appears once in the poet's whispered negotiation to the moon, referencing the galaxy postcard's stars. It frames thematic patience but does not tighten a decision or create a deadline. The poet's actions unfold in a single night without time pressure; the centuries belong to the stars, not the plot. The timeframe is present and thematically coherent but replaceable with minor edits and does not alter tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The motivation to "photosynthesize pain into beauty" is established early, drives the poet to gather tools and seek the moon, and culminates in his treaty-song and dawn writing. It shapes his method (negotiation rather than demand) and charges the closure ("small treaty," "cradled by reef-shadow joy"). However, the pain—insomnia, the ache of the missing moon—is asserted more than dramatized as a conflicting cost; the poet's path is melancholy but not torn by friction between want and price.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Reef-shadow joy" is introduced in the opening ("casting reef-shadow joy along the walls") as the story's tonal signature, defining the coexistence of beauty and hurt. It recurs at closure ("cradled by reef-shadow joy"), reweighting the poet's insomnia as productive rather than merely painful. The tone modulates—grief at the moon's absence, tentative hope during the song, gentle astonishment at return—while maintaining the duality throughout. The final image is charged by this exact tone; removing it would flatten the thematic resonance.</comment>
