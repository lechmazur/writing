<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's interiority is vivid and embodied—"her satchel whispering with shards" and the final weight vanishing are concrete moments. However, her decision to sing the memories back lacks visible internal conflict; the tug between mercy and restoration is told in backstory rather than dramatized as a contradictory impulse in scene. The ending change feels inevitable from her role rather than earned by on-page struggle. Minor penalty for the absence of a micro-choice that tests her against her own oath before the climax.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density builds through layered imagery (glass roots, pear trees with trapped sunsets, mica window) and the ending shifts cadence as memories "fly home" and dawn unfurls from the people themselves. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration—Charged Poise crystallized in the final image where the realm "shudders under the sudden honesty" with cost visible in that shudder and the vanishing satchel weight. The accumulative pressure is consistent, but the causal link between Mara touching the shard to the window and the subsequent broadcast through fractures could be tighter; the mechanics feel slightly gestural.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The alchemical orchard greenhouse is vividly realized: black mica scales, glass roots chiming beneath soil, pear trees with ashen sunset skins. The mica window at the heart constrains Mara's final action—she must touch the shard to it to send the song. The micro-setting (satchel, shard, window) charges the closure image when the window brightens and memories fly. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Mara's memory-keeper perspective. No occupation-level systems required at this length; the setting earns its place.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—rekindling a dying realm—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates through the Silence Years backstory and the image of people pressed against darkness. The tightening occurs when Mara decides to sing the memories back, narrowing options from continued swaddling to painful awakening. Cost is legible: the realm "shudders" and Mara's satchel empties, foreclosing her role as keeper. However, the escalation mechanism is internal revelation rather than on-page opposition; coincidence (the shard's inherent power) enables the resolution without testing Mara's agency against a resistant force.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: the swaddled memories, woven dawns, and the tension between mercy and honesty. The mica window shifting from drinking starlight to refracting colors is a strong image-based thematic turn. The ending resists neat moralizing—"the realm shuddered under the sudden honesty of its own history" suggests cost without tidy redemption. However, the thematic question (whether memory or forgetfulness sustains community) is slightly over-articulated in the Silence Years passage: "mercy without memory left the realm unable to remember why it deserved to live" edges toward thesis statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Mara; no head-hopping. The perceptual signature is distinctive: "the sky could barely remember light, and so it remembered instead the last songs" reflects her memory-keeper lens. Diction is lyric and consistent—"breathless chapel of trees," "bracelets of fractures"—but occasionally drifts toward elevated register that feels authorial rather than character-rooted ("numb survival and painful awakening"). Free indirect style is clean. The piece teaches a compression pattern early (metaphor-dense, non-standard causality) and holds it, so the lyric mode is acceptable under the experimental allowance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Figurative density is high: "glass ribs," "ceiling of black mica window scales that faintly drank starlight," "earth itself wore bracelets of fractures." In the final third, metaphors cluster without clear pattern payoff—"dawn unfurled...from the people themselves, each heart casting a narrow, stubborn ray" stacks abstraction on abstraction. Mixed vehicle: "dawn unfurled" (fabric) then "casting a ray" (light) blurs coherence. Sentence openings vary, but several paragraphs loop thematic content: "Once, this place had known..." and "They had turned to Mara..." restate backstory without advancing present pressure. Apply −0.6 for density and coherence issues in peak beats, plus −0.3 for paraphrase loops in the backstory section.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The premise—a memory keeper who must return swaddled memories to rekindle a realm—is fresh and committed. The alchemical orchard, mica window, and "woven dawns" are specific to this world. The ending turn (memories flying home through song) feels earned by prior setup. However, the Silence Years backstory and the "communities knitting together through song" motif echo familiar speculative-fiction templates (lost golden age, magic through collective ritual). The piece transforms these through lyric specificity but does not fully escape the template's gravitational pull.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mara is present throughout and makes the key decision to sing memories back through the shard. She appears in the opening, walks the rows (middle development), and acts at the mica window (closure). However, her choice is framed more as fulfilling an inevitable oath than as a contested decision with visible cost to her personally. The "scattered memory keeper" attribute is mentioned but does not constrain her action.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The mica window is handled in multiple beats: Mara reaches it at the greenhouse's heart, sees herself reflected in it, touches the shard to it, and watches it brighten at the end. Its property—reflecting the dying realm and transmitting song—is specific and irreplaceable. The window's transformation (from drinking starlight to refracting colors) charges the closure image. Strong integration across setup, development, and payoff with causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Woven dawns" appear early in backstory ("mornings plaited from many colors") and return obliquely in the ending ("dawn unfurled...from the people themselves"). The concept constrains the realm's past state and the memory keeper's goal but does not directly shape on-page tactics. The woven-dawn image is lyric resonance rather than mechanical plot pressure. Two-gate presence (setup, closure reprise) with thematic weight but limited middle development.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Knits communities together" is mentioned in backstory: "voices had once knitted communities together, trading stories and songs across valleys." It frames Mara's past world but does not constrain an on-page action or force a visible tradeoff. The attribute is summary-only, not dramatized through a specific choice. Label-only trait without cost connection; functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Swaddle" is the verb defining Mara's role: she "swaddled" memories for those who could not bear their weight, and the ending sees "swaddled memories fly home." The action is specific and irreplaceable—removal would break the story's logic. However, the swaddling itself happens off-page in backstory; on-page we see only the un-swaddling (the song releasing them). Present in setup and closure with strong thematic charge, but the key turn (singing) is not itself swaddling.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Through forgotten songs" is the method: Mara sings "not forward into the room, but back through the shard and through the window, sending sound along the fractures of the world." The song follows "old pathways of resonance," waking echoes. The mechanics are signaled and matter—song is the vehicle for memory return. Present in setup (Silence Years, lost songs), middle (Mara draws the oldest shard of song), and closure (she sings, song moves). Drives two beats and shapes the ending.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The "alchemical orchard greenhouse shrouded in endless night" is richly detailed: glass ribs, black mica ceiling, grafted glass roots, pear trees with glowing fruit. The greenhouse's structure (rows of trees, heart with the mica window) organizes Mara's journey. The setting's properties (the mica window, the chiming roots) enable the climax. Present throughout, constrains movement, and charges the final image when the greenhouse brightens. Essential across beats.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"In the mirror world" is mentioned in the opening line and implied by the mica window's reflective properties. However, the timeframe does not create urgency or alter tactics; the "endless night" is static backdrop. No ticking clock or time pressure narrows Mara's options. The mirror-world attribute is present but ornamental—it could be removed or replaced with "dying world" without structural loss. Missing middle development and no escalation tie.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"To rekindle a dying realm" is Mara's stated goal in the opening ("She had come to rekindle a dying realm") and drives the ending action. However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants. No on-page moment where Mara hesitates between rekindling and preserving the status quo. The desire shapes the arc but lacks friction or visible cost to Mara personally. Setup and closure presence with thematic coherence but minimal internal conflict.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Bound release" is legible in the tonal arc: memories "swaddled" (bound) are "unfastened" and "rush back like birds fleeing a cage." The tone modulates from the "breathless chapel" stillness to the shuddering awakening at the end. The phrase "bound release, as if their tightly wrapped grief and joy were being unfastened all at once" makes the tone explicit. Coherent through turns, purposeful in the final image. Lyric reprise reweights the dominant stake with undeniable pressure.</comment>
