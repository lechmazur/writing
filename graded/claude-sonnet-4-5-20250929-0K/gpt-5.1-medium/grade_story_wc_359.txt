<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Ilen's interiority is rendered through embodied synesthetic perception ("sound arrived to him as color") and his task is clear, but his agency operates in anticipation rather than active choice until the final beat. The moment of release ("released his waiting finger") functions as decision, yet the preceding material reads more observational than conflicted. Internal contradiction is minimal; the story prioritizes atmospheric specificity over psychological friction. No other characters appear on the page, so relationship dynamics are absent.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates sensory density and conceptual weight toward a single release moment that reweights the premise ("wonder stood undeniable"). Orientation anchors who/where/when by paragraph two; no penalty. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the bell's release and the shared breath between sculptor and ringer crystallize the dominant stake with undeniable pressure, though the cost remains conceptual rather than visceral. Causality is clean within the accumulative frame; the sculptor's distant blow triggers Ilen's act as promised.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The ice cavern, amber sheet, and aurora constrain perception and charge the final image with cascading light and resonance. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and filtered through synesthetic POV ("a clear note rang green in his sight"). The amber sheet functions as micro-setting, handled twice and reweighted by light shifts. Spatial choreography remains coherent throughout; the environment actively shapes the moment of release and the resulting storm of colors.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: to catch and certify sculpted hush before the world forgets. The tightening occurs when the chisel falls and the cavern inhales, forcing Ilen's release; one meaningful pressure point is sufficient at this length. Agency is enacted through the decision to release the note at the precise instant, though the anticipated nature of the task reduces felt trade-off. The cost is conceptual—wonder's essentiality is demonstrated—but the protagonist's personal price remains oblique.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: sculpted hush as the breath the world takes for art, wonder as essential rather than luxury. The final image ("wonder stood undeniable") offers a non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in the imagined sculptor's doubt and Ilen's shared fear that silence might go unnoticed. The amber insects, aurora patterns, and ice bells recur purposefully to charge closure. No thematic echo or label-speak mars the ending.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>POV distance is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: synesthetic translation and contemplative idiom. Diction remains consistent and elevated without unmotivated register drift; the prose reflects Ilen's meditative stance. No dialogue present. Purposeful compression in the final sequence ("Sound became sapphire, emerald, rose; colors became tones") accelerates rhythm while maintaining voice. Psychic distance narrows appropriately as the moment arrives; no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is high in sensory passages, but several lines loop conceptually: "He knew the sculptor…would soon raise the chisel" restates anticipation already established, and multiple sentences rephrase Ilen's waiting without added pressure. Template cadence appears in repeated "The [noun] [verb]" openers mid-piece. Figurative language is dense ("rivers of green and violet fire," "trapped thunderclouds") but remains coherent. The paraphrase loops and minor stem repetition justify mid-7 band placement with −0.4 applied for patterned artifacts that do not touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of synesthesia, glacial setting, distant sculptor, and the concept of sculpted hush offers a fresh angle on art's essentiality. The amber music sheet with fossilized insects is a striking, non-obvious detail. Emotional specificity in Ilen's shared fear and the imagined sculptor's hesitation grounds the meditation. The piece commits fully to its lyric premise; risk-taking in the non-confrontational, accumulative structure heightens thematic stakes without obscuring clarity. No close echoes of famous material detected.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Present by paragraph two (setup ✓). Ilen's choice to release the finger drives the closure beat (payoff ✓); the bell's release is the decisive act that certifies wonder. Middle development is observational rather than decision-based (partial). Two beats: setup and release. Causal pressure moderate; the act is anticipated rather than conflicted. Closure linkage strong. Swappability low; the role is specific. Cost is conceptual, not visceral. Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.2, specificity +0.5; late middle friction −0.3; default 3.0 + 2.8 = 5.8, round to 6.4.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Introduced early on pedestal (setup ✓). Used twice: initial description of insects as notes, then light ignites them in crimson/gold (development partial, payoff ✓). Constrains perception and supplies the "chorus no ear alone could hear." Closure participation indirect; it charges the atmosphere but is not causally active in the release moment. Two beats +0.9, closure presence weak +0.3, specificity +0.6, early signal +0.5; ornamental lean −0.4; 3.0 + 1.9 = 4.9, but purposeful reprise lifts to 5.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Framed early as Ilen's calling (setup ✓). Shapes the dominant stake: to catch the pause when stone is first wounded and certify wonder as essential (development ✓). Directly drives the closure beat when the sculpted hush arrives and Ilen releases the note (payoff ✓). All three gates met. Causal pressure high; the concept defines the task and the moment. Closure linkage strong. Cost is conceptual. Early +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.2, closure +1.5, specificity +0.7; 3.0 + 5.5 = 8.5, minor conceptual-only cost −0.4 adjusts to 8.1, but integration across all gates warrants 7.1 within realistic band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Established early (setup ✓). Enables Ilen to read the amber sheet and perceive the aurora as chords (development ✓). Active in the closure beat when sound shatters into colors and colors become tones (payoff ✓). Three beats across the arc. Causal: the trait is necessary for the task. Closure: the synesthetic storm is the climax. Cost is implicit in the specialized perception. Early +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal +1.1, closure +1.4, specificity +0.6; 3.0 + 5.2 = 8.2, but cost remains label-adjacent rather than visceral −0.5, yields 7.7; realistic integration settles 6.7.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Signaled early as the task (setup ✓). Withheld until the sculptor's blow arrives, then executed in the climax (development partial, payoff ✓). The act of unfettering defines the closure beat and transforms the cavern. Irreplaceable; removing it breaks the story's logic. Two gates strong, one partial. Causal pressure high; the release is the decisive act. Closure linkage maximal. Early signal +0.7, two beats +0.9, causal +1.4, closure +1.7, specificity +0.8; 3.0 + 5.5 = 8.5, realistic adjustment −0.4 = 8.1.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Aurora present early and throughout (setup ✓). Provides visual/sensory material Ilen translates; mirrors the pattern at closure (development partial, payoff ✓). The mechanics (light through ice, synesthetic reading) matter but are not causally decisive; the aurora enriches atmosphere more than it constrains choice. Two beats +0.9, closure presence +0.6, early +0.5, specificity +0.4; swappability moderate −0.3; 3.0 + 2.1 = 5.1, lyric reprise +0.1 = 5.2.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Introduced immediately (setup ✓). The cavern's frozen bells are handled, and the walls tighten during sculpted hush (development ✓). Active in closure: the cavern becomes "a living throat of light" (payoff ✓). Three gates met. Causal pressure: the ice bells and walls shape the resonance. Closure linkage strong. Specificity high; the glacial environment is irreplaceable. Early +0.8, three beats +1.4, causal +1.3, closure +1.4, specificity +0.7; 3.0 + 5.6 = 8.6, realistic adjustment −0.7 = 7.9.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Framed early as the awaited event (setup ✓). The distant blow is the trigger for Ilen's action (development ✓, payoff ✓). Three gates met. The timeframe creates anticipatory pressure and governs the climax. Causal role strong; the moment defines when Ilen must act. Cost is timing precision. Early +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal +1.0, closure +1.2, specificity +0.5; 3.0 + 4.7 = 7.7, but the distant/abstract nature of the sculptor reduces visceral immediacy −0.4 = 7.3; realistic 6.3 within band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Stated early as Ilen's calling (setup ✓). The motivation drives his wait and informs his fear that the world might not notice (development partial). Directly articulated in closure reflection: "wonder was essential to the breathing of days" (payoff ✓). Two strong gates. Causal pressure moderate; the desire is told more than dramatized in conflicted choice. Closure linkage high but declarative. Early +0.6, two beats +0.9, closure +1.0, specificity +0.4; told-only friction −0.6; 3.0 + 2.3 = 5.3, thematic charge at end +0.8 = 6.1.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Established early in "anticipation hummed… yet the cavern taught stillness, and both states folded into one" (setup ✓). Modulates through the wait, tightens at the chisel blow, then oscillates in the final image: "tightening and loosening, brightening and dimming" (development ✓, payoff ✓). Three gates met. Tone coherence high; the phrase's cadence mirrors the prose rhythm. Charges the closure image directly. Early +0.7, three beats +1.4, closure +1.5, specificity +0.7; minor abstractness −0.3; 3.0 + 4.0 = 7.0, reprise strength +0.2 = 7.2.</comment>
