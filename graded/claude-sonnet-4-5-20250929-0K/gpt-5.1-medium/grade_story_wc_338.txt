<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's interiority is concrete and particular—his "guardedness flex[ing], a kind of shielded openness" embodied through micro-choices like measuring twice and "lay[ing] awake wondering what lived inside the millimeter." The woman in the wool cap is vivid in her silent gesture (fingers to lips, shaking her head), and her aged reprise adds weight. The final choice to reopen "only as a place to listen" feels earned by the pattern of his interrogation of absences, though the lack of visible cost at closure (no foreclosed path, no trade-off) keeps this from the high band. Minor slip: Mara's trust in his "empathy" is told rather than dramatized through prior action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density increases through layered imagery (map tear, video reels, frescoes, the woman's aging) and the closure reconfigures Elias's stance from interrogator to advocate for listening. Orientation anchors (museum basement, viewing room, video footage) arrive promptly. The cost, however, is conceptual and oblique—Elias recommends reopening but we do not see what he risks or forecloses by that choice. The closure image ("only as a place to listen") reweights prior material but lacks the felt price or trade-off that would lift this into the 8+ band under the chosen lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The rain-scoured fresco vault constrains perception (saints "almost erased," fragments on the floor the team avoids touching) and charges the final image by accumulating damage as a form of broken trust. The museum basement's "dust, raincoats, and magnetized tape" anchors sensory memory without catalogue bloat. The ancient henge appears vividly in the first reel but remains scenery; its stones do not constrain a choice. Spatial choreography is clean (viewing room, monitor, descent through sinkhole, vault) and the vault's evolving state across reels—more damaged in the second—alters what Elias reads in the woman's posture.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—how to interpret the chapel's silence and whether to reopen—is signaled early and deepens when Mara asks for "someone who might try to interpret silence with empathy." The woman's gestures across reels tighten pressure (reverence in the first, apology in the second), and Elias's final recommendation narrows options by reframing the site's purpose. However, the escalation is largely observational; Elias makes no on-page sacrifice, and the cost of his choice (recommending reopening "only as a place to listen") remains conceptual rather than viscerally felt. One meaningful deepening is present but the final beat lacks a visible price that would push this higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars: the map's torn margin, the woman's aging silence, the fresco vault as "a body of stone trained over centuries to hold unspoken confessions." The final image—"only as a place to listen"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the question of how memory and omission coexist without stating a moral. The concept of the whispered chapel integrates fully, shaping stakes and the resolution. Minor slip: "the damage on the walls was less an act of malice than an accidental breaking of that trust" edges toward thematic statement where image alone would have sufficed.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The perceptual signature is vivid and character-particular: Elias reads "edges and absences," sees "the millimeter he had removed" widen into a road, and interprets the woman's lip movements "to feel the rhythm of her speech." Psychic distance remains stable; the prose modulates purposefully from careful observation ("methodically curious") to lyric accumulation at closure. Free indirect style is clean. One minor slip: "almost as an afterthought" tells Mara's manner rather than dramatizing it through speech rhythm or gesture. No dialogue appears, so those bullets are not tested.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Sentences vary in rhythm and opening; figurative language is controlled and voice-motivated ("a nostalgia for weather and recording," "the millimeter...widen[ed] into a road"). Information density is high; nearly every line advances character or atmosphere. Minor loop: "the map itself tore" and "the tear was not just in paper but in memory" revisit the same metaphor without added pressure. The final line ("only as a place to listen") lands cleanly. No filter-verb stacks, no template cadence, and no pronoun drift. Clarity and propulsion are strong throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of map-framing, silent video, and the whispered chapel feels specific and non-obvious; the woman's aging across reels and the fresco vault as listener transform familiar archive-mystery material. The torn map margin as literal and metaphorical divide is purposeful. The final turn—reopen "only as a place to listen"—grows from prior particulars and resists tidy closure. Minor derivative shadow: the "lost site rediscovered via archive" frame echoes common speculative and literary templates, though the execution through silence and empathy adds fresh inflection. Risk-taking in the accumulative, nearly plotless structure heightens thematic stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias as perceptive map framer is signaled early (first paragraph), shapes his method of reading the video footage (middle beats: "read edges and absences," "feel the rhythm of her speech"), and culminates in his decision to recommend reopening with a specific constraint ("only as a place to listen"). His trait of interrogating omissions enables the closure choice. Present in setup, development, and payoff; causal pressure and closure linkage are strong. Swappability is low—his craft and perceptual habit are indispensable to the ending. Small deduction: the final choice, while character-driven, lacks a visible cost or trade-off that would lift this into the 7+ band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The ancient henge appears in the first reel ("the camera prowled through the rain-dark stones...men joking silently as they measured each monolith") and provides spatial context for the sinkhole descent. It is present in setup and middle, but its role is scenic rather than causal—it does not constrain a choice or return with reweighted meaning at closure. The fresco vault, not the henge, drives the emotional and thematic work. Functional but replaceable; any landmark could anchor the dig site.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The whispered chapel is signaled early ("people swore that its stones repeated what you did not dare say aloud"), shapes Mara's request for empathy-driven interpretation (middle: "interpret silence with empathy"), and articulates the closure choice ("only as a place to listen"). The concept constrains tactics (Elias reads the footage for what is unspoken) and charges the final image by reframing the chapel as listener rather than monument. Present in setup, development, and payoff; causal pressure and closure linkage are strong. The cost is conceptual (the chapel's purpose is repriced) rather than emotional, keeping this below 8.0.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Methodically curious" is established early ("measured twice, cut once, and then lay awake wondering") and enables his forensic approach to the video footage. It constrains his response to Mara's request (he agrees slowly, with "guardedness...that allowed curiosity but held back certainty") and supports the final recommendation. Present in setup and development; closure participation is indirect (the trait informs the choice but is not explicitly invoked in the final beat). One visible trade-off: his sleeplessness over removed millimeters embodies the cost of his precision. Functional and character-specific but not indispensable to the ending's logic.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Reopen" is the action Mara seeks assessment for (middle: "wanted an assessment before the board decided whether to reopen the site") and becomes Elias's final recommendation with a transformative constraint ("should indeed be reopened, but only as a place to listen"). The action redefines the chapel's purpose and resolves the dominant stake. Present in setup (implied in Mara's request), development (shapes the viewing task), and payoff (closure image). Causal pressure and closure linkage are strong; the specificity of "only as a place to listen" makes this irreplaceable. Small deduction: the cost of reopening is conceptual rather than dramatized, and no visible obstacle or sacrifice appears on the page.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The method is signaled early ("Two reels...dated ten years apart") and structures the entire middle (Elias watches both reels, compares the woman's aging, reads tension in postures). It enables the closure insight: the damage and the woman's apology-like speech inform his recommendation. Present in setup, development, and payoff; the mechanics matter (silent footage forces interpretation via gesture and rhythm, not speech). Causal pressure is strong—without the comparison across time, the chapel remains an undifferentiated ruin. Irreplaceability is high; swapping for, say, written reports would collapse the thematic weight of silence.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The rain-scoured fresco vault is established in the first reel and returns in the second, more damaged. It provides the concrete image of the chapel's fragility ("saints whose faces had been almost erased," fragments the team avoids touching) and informs Elias's reading of the site as "a body of stone trained...to hold unspoken confessions." Present in setup, development, and payoff (the vault's state supports the closure insight). The vault constrains the team's behavior (reverence, careful boots) and charges the final image by embodying the chapel's function. Causal pressure and closure linkage are solid; specificity (rain damage, surviving blue fragment) adds irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"At the spot where a map tears, dividing known from unknown" functions as metaphor rather than timeframe. The physical tear is mentioned early ("ragged diagonal rip that ended at the spot where a map tears") and recurs as thematic image ("the tear was not just in paper but in memory"), but it does not tighten decisions or impose a live clock. Present in setup and thematic development but absent from closure beats. Ornamental use; the metaphor enriches tone but does not alter tactics or escalation.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"To interpret silence with empathy" is stated by Mara (middle: "wanted someone who might try to interpret silence with empathy") and dramatized in Elias's approach: he leans closer "not to lip-read, but to feel the rhythm of her speech," imagines "what apology might require such precision." The motivation shapes the closure choice ("only as a place to listen"). Present in setup (implicit in his craft), development (guides his viewing method), and payoff (articulates the ending). Friction between curiosity and guardedness adds cost. Small deduction: the motivation is half-told by Mara rather than fully emergent from Elias's prior choices, and the final cost is conceptual rather than relational or visceral.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Shielded openness" is embodied early ("his guardedness flex[ed], a kind of shielded openness that allowed curiosity but held back certainty") and modulates across beats: careful observation during the reels, lyric accumulation at closure. The tone coheres through turns (reverence for the woman's gestures, the tentative final recommendation) and charges the final image by balancing interpretive generosity with restraint. Present throughout; the tone reflects both Elias's method and the chapel's ethic. Minor slip: the phrase "shielded openness" risks label-only abstraction, though the prose enacts it convincingly via rhythm and diction.</comment>
