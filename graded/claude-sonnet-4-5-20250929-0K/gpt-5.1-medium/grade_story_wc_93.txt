<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Arin's precognitive curse is given concrete texture through the doubled-time perception ("watched himself watch himself") and drives micro-choices at key beats. His motivation to "understand" rather than resist shapes the final action sequence, though the interiority occasionally drifts toward abstraction ("borrowed dawn of courage"). The eels function as a consistent perceptual signature rather than pure ornament. Internal contradiction is present but could be more visceral; the protagonist's stance feels more contemplative than torn.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: the frictionless world accumulates density through images (glassy waves, floating eels, painted rocks) until the star-dust ritual triggers a pattern-lock that returns friction as a "tax collector." Closure arrives as Conceptual Repricing—the final image (aurora drying like ink) reweights the premise with an undeniable conceptual cost: motion requires limits to produce meaning. The stakes (world sliding into stillness) are signaled early, and the rock-placement sequence tightens pressure through mathematical patterning. One persistent constraint (precognitive doubling) shapes tactics at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The tidal bluff and frictionless physics constrain movement choices: eels glide through air, waves fail to break, Arin's knees eventually scrape stone when friction returns. Sensory detail is vivid and purpose-driven (aurora colors "like melted compasses," dust drifting "sideways where no wind moved"). The painted rocks function as micro-setting, their spatial arrangement enabling the ritual. Geography remains stable, though the world-rule exposition could be more concretely anchored in observed cause-effect.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding the sacred equation to regulate motion's debt—is signaled early and maintained. Escalation occurs through the rock-placement sequence: Fibonacci path, twin-prime lattice, then star dust alignment. Arin's precognitive splitting ("one strand of future he stepped back and slipped") forces a visible choice with consequence (pain as proof the tax returned). Agency is present but quiet; the "promise to understand" drives the ritual, and the cost (scraping knees, emotional near-weeping) is legible on the page. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the controlling metaphor: friction as "tax of chaos," motion as debt, limits as enablers of meaning ("a story needed limits, so that meaning could grip and climb"). The painted rocks and aurora function as recurring motifs that shift meaning at closure. The final image (aurora dimming "like ink drying on proof") offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in silence and image; the "borrowed dawn of courage" risks abstraction but the closing insight feels earned by the ritual sequence rather than asserted.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with a distinct perceptual signature: mathematical terms ("Fibonacci," "twin primes"), precognitive doubling, sensory specificity filtered through Arin's attentiveness. Diction occasionally elevates beyond the POV's grounded baseline ("borrowed dawn of courage," "coordinates drawn in the language of inevitability") without clear anchoring in his mental lexicon. No head-hopping. Elision (the woman of light's identity, the astronomer-priests' proof) is purposeful and charges the world-building. Some filter phrases ("felt heavy as unspoken questions") are acceptable in a contemplative register but accumulate slightly.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Figurative language is dense and mostly coherent ("aurora like melted compasses," "eels ribboning through air like they were carved in water"), though "borrowed dawn of courage" and "fear arriving before he felt it" drift into abstraction without grounding stimulus. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; paragraph structure supports the slow accumulation. Minor template cadence appears in mid-beats ("The elders called them... the astronomer-priests whispered..."). No paraphrase loops. Propulsion is steady but the figurative density in the ritual sequence risks slowing momentum slightly; some lines do double duty, others linger for atmosphere.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The frictionless-world premise is executed with specificity: eels gliding through air, waves refusing to break, fires not catching. The mathematical-ritual approach (Fibonacci, twin primes, collapsed star dust) transforms the abstract stake into concrete choreography. The precognitive-curse trait adds a non-obvious constraint (choosing futures already seen). Tone and imagery cohere without falling into stock apocalypse tropes. The closure insight ("friction was the tax of chaos") risks abstraction but is embodied through the scrape of stone and the aurora's withdrawal. Risk-taking in the dense, lyric register heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Arin's identity as eel herder frames the opening and provides the observational stance (eels as "silver thoughts"), but his key choices center on the ritual: selecting painted-rock sequences, choosing which precognitive strand to follow, and kneeling to complete the pattern. His decision to "stay, knees pressed to stone" rather than slip alters the outcome. The herder role itself is more atmospheric than causal in the closure beat, though it establishes his elusive, observant nature early.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The collapsed star dust appears in three distinct beats: introduction with backstory anchor, uncorking and release during the ritual, and its alignment along "invisible vectors between the stones" that triggers friction's return. The dust's unique property (burned in "forgotten arithmetic") matters: it completes the mathematical pattern. Its use is active and evolving, not static description. The closure effect depends on the dust finding "every gap between numbers."</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The "lingering promise" is named early ("promised back... that he would understand") and recurs at closure ("His lingering promise had never been to prevent stillness, only to witness the equation"). It shapes Arin's refusal to resist or bargain, guiding his choice to complete the ritual. However, the promise itself remains abstract; we see him enact understanding but the promise functions more as thematic echo than on-page constraint with visible cost. It reweights meaning but does not narrow a tactical choice mid-scene.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The precognitive curse constrains multiple beats: Arin "walks two heartbeats ahead," sees the star die before telescopes exist, and at the climax splits into futures ("watched himself watch himself"). The curse enables the ritual (he already knows the pattern) but also imposes cost: "choosing felt false when he could see desire arriving before he felt it." The trait is active, not label-only, and the tradeoff (knowledge without genuine surprise or agency) is legible.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Harness" appears in the ritual beat: "the only way he knew to harness the curse that dragged his mind forward." The action of harnessing the precognitive doubling drives the rock-placement and dust-release sequence. However, "harness" as a verb is more implied than dramatized; Arin arranges patterns and chooses a future strand, but the mechanics of how the curse is harnessed remain abstract. The concept shapes the turn but is not irreplaceable; "focus" or "channel" could substitute with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The mathematical-sequence placement is signaled early ("symbols that had visited his dreams"), executed on-page in two waves (Fibonacci path, twin-prime lattice), and directly triggers closure: "the patterns clicked into place" and "The stones began to hum." The method is specific (mathematical arrangement) and irreplaceable; random rock-throwing would not work. The sequence constrains Arin's choices under pressure and the final hum/alignment is the pivot that returns friction. Every beat of the ritual depends on this exact method.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The tidal bluff provides spatial constraint (cliff's lip, rock meeting swell) and atmospheric pressure (aurora above, stilled waves below). The setting enables the ritual: Arin kneels "where the rock met the stilled swell" and arranges stones along the bluff's edge. The frictionless physics of the setting shapes tactics (eels glide, dust drifts sideways). The aurora modulates with the ritual ("shifted, colors clicking") and dims at closure. The setting is more than backdrop; it participates in the ending image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The timeframe "after friction vanishes" is established in the opening line and recurs through cumulative images (waves sliding, eels gliding, engines halting). The frictionless state frames every choice. Friction's return at closure ("friction came back in a thin, uncertain layer") marks a before/after shift. However, the timeframe itself does not tighten a decision clock; it supplies the condition rather than urgency. The ending reweights the timeframe conceptually (as tax/debt metaphor) but the frame is static during the ritual sequence.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The desire to "understand sacred patterns" is stated early, drives Arin to the bluff, and shapes his refusal to resist or bargain. The motivation is tested on-page: he must choose between slipping forever or completing the ritual. The final realization ("understood then that the sacred was not in ending motion but in regulating its debts") fulfills the motivation with a conceptual cost (acceptance of limits as necessary). The want is clear, though the internal friction between understanding and intervening could be more dramatized mid-scene.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Borrowed dawn of courage" appears once, mid-ritual, as Arin's internal frame: "This bravery did not feel like his; it felt loaned from some future self who had already survived." The phrase coheres with the precognitive-curse logic (courage experienced in advance) and modulates the stakes slightly. However, it does not recur or charge the final image; the closure tone (quiet, ink-drying proof) shifts away from bravery toward acceptance. The tone marker is present and voice-consistent but not integral to the ending's effect.</comment>
