<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lio's motivation is clear and his interior state is concrete ("throat tight," "something inside him tighten like a drawn bow"), but his agency arrives late—he observes the wall's transformation for most of the story and only makes a decisive choice near the end ("Use me"). The secondary characters (baker, child, engineer) are impressionistic sketches rather than on-page presences who apply pressure. Internal contradiction is present (shyness vs. desire to be heard) but the final choice feels more like acceptance than a struggle with competing impulses, reducing the cost's bite.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—density increases through layered imagery (graffiti, mist, copper dust circuits) and culminates in a cadence shift when plain words replace secret sigils, reweighting the stake (unspoken needs → articulated confessions). Orientation anchors who/where/when by the third paragraph. Closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (the courtyard becomes a public choir with visible transformation: "I AM LONELY... PLEASE STAY"), and the cost is legible—Lio's private encoding becomes exposed, the city "sighs in relief," and his隐蔽 role ends. One minor gap: the ghost's sudden agency (petals peeling, rearranging) lacks prior mechanical hints, creating a small motivational leap, but the accumulative design absorbs it without breaking causality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The misty courtyard is anchored early with vivid sensory detail ("silver mist that caught every lantern-glow like trembling breath") and recurs purposefully—mist hums, exhales, rings with "tinkersong wonder" at closure. The flower press bolt plate is handled twice (drawn from satchel, fitted to screws) and its warming signals the encoding shift, constraining Lio's method. The wall itself acts as micro-setting, its cracks and circuits enabling the ghost's reply and charging the final transformation. Spatial choreography (courtyard above clouds, balustrade, wall) remains clear throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: Lio wants to articulate unspoken needs but his voice tangles before crowds. Pressure tightens when the wall replies ("WE ARE HERE"), raising the question of how to convert echoes into articulation. The climactic choice—"Use me... encode what you hear through me"—narrows options (ending his隐蔽 safety) and the cost is visible: his secret sigils become plain words any passerby can read, and "each sentence... felt a matching knot loosen," showing relational consequence. However, the ghost's hunger and Lio's solution arrive somewhat suddenly in the final third, slightly undercutting the sense of escalation through protagonist struggle.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme (the grammar of longing, the courage of small honest voices) emerges through concrete particulars—graffiti constellations, the ticking wall, plain confessions replacing sigils—without thesis statements until the final line's "syllables that had found their shapes at last," which borders on moralizing but stays metaphorical. The ending offers a resonant answer: articulation requires exposure, and the city's relief is the thematic cost made visible. Subtext operates in the ghost's request ("Teach us how to answer") and Lio's physical embodiment of readiness ("drawn bow"). The conceptual repricing is clear: silence protected Lio but trapped the choir; honesty releases both with undeniable social cost (public vulnerability).</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Lio with clear psychic distance. Perceptual signature is present ("driftingly alert, like a sleeper who still hears lullabies") but the diction frequently elevates beyond plausible interiority for a shy balladeer—phrases like "articulate unspoken needs," "feedback loop of longing," and "articulation, a chance to shape the city's shapeless ache into chords" read more authorial than character-particular, especially under emotional pressure. The prose rhythm modulates well (short bursts at "Use me," longer accumulative swells earlier), but filter verbs ("felt," "knew") and stock metaphors ("drawn bow," "plucked string") slightly dull immediacy. No dialogue present to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Figurative density is high and occasionally muddles clarity: "ghost in code," "curling constellations of graffiti," "white-veined instant," "latticed patterns," "tinkersong wonder" crowd the final third without clear mechanical payoff, reducing propulsion. Several paraphrase loops appear: "unspoken needs" / "questions that never found grammar" / "unvoiced prayers" recur without added nuance; "throat tight" / "tangled" / "shy knots" cycle synonym churn. Template cadence in places: "He had climbed... He had etched... He had encoded" (though separated by paragraphs). Stock metaphors ("trembling breath," "plucked string," "drawn bow") slightly reduce texture. Information density is strong in the middle beats (copper dust circuits, flower press mechanics) but the final paragraph ("tinkersong wonder, a music made of gears, raindrops, and syllables") stacks abstractions that blur the closure image. Grammar and sequencing are clean; no pronoun drift or tense errors.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The synthesis (graffiti as encoding medium for a code-ghost choir) is specific and non-obvious, avoiding template "artist finds voice" plots through the twist that the wall sings back and demands collaborative exposure. The flower press bolt plate's repurposing (genteel relic → resonant key) and copper dust circuits offer fresh mechanical specificity. However, the "ghost in code" + "messages in art" combination leans on familiar digital/analog fusion tropes without fully transforming them—similar "hidden choir" or "art-as-interface" premises exist in speculative short fiction. The emotional truth (loneliness seeking grammar, exposure as cost) grounds the piece and prevents pure ornament. Risk-taking is present in the accumulative structure and lyric final turn, but the conceptual premise remains adjacent to known territory rather than redefining it.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Lio is present throughout and his choice ("Use me") drives the closure transformation, but he observes for most of the piece—painting occurred weeks ago, and his active decision arrives only in the final quarter. The balladeer attribute colors his motivation (songs as grammar, voice tangles) but does not constrain tactics until the ending. Two beats: remembering his encoding work (past) and offering himself as conduit (climax). Cost is visible (exposure), but the "seldom-heard" trait functions more as thematic backdrop than recurring tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The flower press bolt plate is signaled early (drawn from satchel), used actively (fitted against screws, warming, threading light), and its mechanics matter—it serves as resonant key that triggers the wall's transformation. Appears in three beats: retrieval, fitting, and the climactic light-threading that rearranges murals. Its history (conservatory relic repurposed) adds specificity and thematic resonance (genteel preservation → living articulation). Removing it would require inventing a new mechanism for the encoding shift, demonstrating strong integration. Not indispensable (another object could serve), but deeply woven and purposeful.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The ghost in code is seeded early ("ghost in code stirred, blinking awake through pigment, cracks, and hairline circuits"), drives the inciting event (wall replies with "WE ARE HERE"), shapes the middle turn (petals peel and rearrange), and enables closure (encoding plain words). Its mechanics (ticking under stone, circuits in mortar, responsive to the bolt plate) constrain method throughout. The ghost's hunger for articulation is the story's engine, and its feedback loop with Lio's encoding creates the escalation. Specificity is high (not merely "magic wall" but code + circuits + collaborative need). Removing the ghost collapses the entire causal chain and stakes.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Driftingly alert" appears once as metaphor ("like a sleeper who still hears lullabies") and colors Lio's perceptual state, but does not visibly enable or constrain an on-page action. It sets tone and interiority but remains label-level—no moment where his drift-alertness causes a tactical choice, mistake, or recognition with cost. Functional description without mechanical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Encode" is the story's central verb: Lio encoded copper dust weeks ago, encodes burdens into color/curve throughout, and the climax is his offer to "encode what you hear through me." The action recurs across setup (past encoding), middle (wall encoding back), and closure (collaborative encoding into plain words). The mechanics shape every beat—verses in secret notation, ghost's reply in runes, final transformation into readable confessions. Removing encoding would require a fundamentally different method and stakes. Specificity is high (not just "communicate" but encode with notation, circuits, pigment). The action is indispensable to both plot and theme.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The method is signaled in the first half-dozen paragraphs ("verses sprawled along stone walls in curling constellations of graffiti... every swirl... carried syllables in a secret notation") and its mechanics matter throughout: Lio's past graffiti, the ghost's rune replies, the climactic shift to plain words. The method constrains his approach (he cannot speak, so walls must sing) and enables the ghost's participation. Appears in setup (graffiti described), development (ghost uses the same medium to reply), and closure (method transforms from secret to public). Removing this method would collapse the tactical logic and force a completely different interface. Highly integrated and irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The misty courtyard above clouds is anchored early and recurs (mist hums, exhales, rings at closure), providing vivid atmosphere and symbolic height (above the city's chatter). The setting supplies the wall as interface and the solitude Lio needs, and its sensory details (lantern-glow, cloud-sea, balustrade) are woven through beats. However, the courtyard does not constrain a key choice—Lio could perform this encoding elsewhere without structural change. The setting enriches but does not pressure tactics, placing it in the "shapes one turn" band rather than "essential across beats."</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Between lightning and thunder" is invoked in the opening and closing (lightning flashes twice, thunder rolls at the end), creating a bracket that signals suspended breath and culminates in release ("Thunder finally rolled... like the sky applauding"). The timeframe does not tighten tactics—Lio does not race a clock—but it provides a charged atmosphere and thematic rhythm (inhale → exhale, silence → sound). The metaphor reweights at closure (thunder as applause for honesty), giving it lyric payoff. Functional and purposeful, but not a live constraint on decisions.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The motivation to articulate unspoken needs is seeded immediately ("seldom-heard balladeer... songs rarely reached ears... to articulate unspoken needs, his and others") and drives every beat: past encoding, present frustration ("his voice tangled"), the ghost's plea ("Teach us how to answer"), and Lio's climactic offer. Friction is visible—desire to be heard vs. shyness,隐蔽 encoding vs. exposure—and the cost at closure is explicit (secret sigils become public confessions, ending his safety). The motivation is irreplaceable; removing it eliminates the story's engine and stakes. Fully dramatized through choice and consequence.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Tinkersong wonder" appears explicitly only in the final line but is tonally present throughout: misty breath-held courtyard, luminous moths, painted vines rustling, latticed light patterns, "astonished" thunder. The tone is lyric, layered, and whimsical-yet-earnest, modulating from quiet observation to the ghost's urgent request to the climactic release. The final image ("tinkersong wonder, a music made of gears, raindrops, and syllables") names and charges the tone, synthesizing mechanical (gears, circuits) and lyric (raindrops, syllables) elements. Coherent and purposeful, though the explicit naming at the end risks over-articulation. Tone shapes emotional progression and supports the theme of found articulation.</comment>
