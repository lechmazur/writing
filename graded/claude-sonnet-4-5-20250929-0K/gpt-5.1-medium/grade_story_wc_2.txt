<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Eli's interiority is concrete and voice-particular ("coincidence becomes pattern," the habit of listening rather than repairing). His micro-choices—lifting floorboards, touching the compass, deciding to improvise—accumulate and earn the final turn toward befriending uncertainty. Internal contradiction operates well: he spent a life banishing Perhaps yet now allows it as direction. Minor slip: the epiphany about time and improvisation edges toward summary ("he considered that planning did not need to be…") rather than full embodiment at the peak beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: density of motif (clocks, directions, Perhaps) builds to a cadence shift where Eli begins attaching hands that hesitate—a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation anchors cleanly by ~100 words (who, where, when). The transition from depot to cavern to greenhouse reads legibly, pattern taught early. Cost is felt in the renunciation of certainty and the choice to leave clock faces open. One meaningful deepening (compass rose reweights "Perhaps" from threat to direction) suffices at this length and charges the ending image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Sensory detail is vivid and selective: "veils of spray," "mineral salt," "warped door furred with moss." The subterranean waterfall and greenhouse constrain Eli's path and supply the compass rose, which charges the final choice. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly across three distinct zones. Minor density: the nautical charts and unnamed instruments clutter the cavern beat without altering tactics, trending decorative. The compass rose (micro-object-as-setting) constrains the final image and qualifies for the 9+ gate, lifting the score.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (Eli's relationship to certainty/time) is signaled early and tightens once: the compass shifts "Perhaps" from threat to viable direction, narrowing his posture from avoidance to acceptance. The final act—attaching hands that hesitate—arises from his agency and forecloses the old habit with visible cost (abandoning precision). Escalation under Accumulative lens reads as a single decisive intensification rather than multiple reversals, which suffices here. The cost is conceptual but legible: he opts for wandering minutes over trapped time.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme (befriending uncertainty, time as companionship not trap) emerges from concrete particulars: stopped clocks, compass petals engraved with Someday/If, hands that hesitate. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—Eli's choice to walk beside time rather than trap it—without stating a moral. The compass motif recurs with reweighted meaning (Perhaps shifts from banished to direction, Now points forward). Subtext operates in image and gesture; no overt thematic statement intrudes. One slip: "change was the only promise it kept" edges toward abstraction but recovers quickly in the final image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited; perceptual signature is character-specific (clocks "ticking faintly in his memory like distant gulls"). Diction reflects Eli's expertise ("stubborn casings," "align the gears") without pedantry. No dialogue; interiority is rhythmic and modulates with discovery. Psychic distance tightens appropriately at the compass touch and final choice. Minor template note: several beats open with "Eli [verb]" in sequence, creating mild cadence monotony mid-story, though it does not obscure clarity or harm closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs (setting, mood, motive). Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, accelerating in the descent and breathing in the greenhouse. Zero major loops. Minor friction: "uncertainly certain" appears twice in close proximity without added pressure; "the compass rose" is repeated as subject across multiple adjacent sentences in the cavern beat, creating mild template cadence. Figurative language ("vertical river of glass," "ribs") is precise and voice-coherent. The final image is crisp and propulsive. No artifacts touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The admiral's compass rose that points to possibilities (Someday, Otherwise, Perhaps) offers a fresh synthesis of object and theme. The emotional truth—an aging tinkerer learning to improvise—grounds the fantastical premise in specificity. The transformation test passes: plot and arc depend on these exact particulars (broken clocks, subterranean waterfall, hands that hesitate). The ending resists easy moral and commits fully to its premise. Minor derivative echo: "waterfall under his life" and "befriending uncertainty" brush close to workshop-speak but remain integrated enough to avoid heavy penalty.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Eli's role as broken-clock tinkerer is established early, frames his expertise (lifting floorboards, understanding gears), and drives the ending choice (attaching hands that hesitate vs. precise hands). His occupational lens filters perception throughout. Setup, development (he follows sound, touches compass), and payoff (final act of attaching hesitant hands) are all present. Causal pressure: his habit of listening enables discovery; his skill enables the final improvisation. Visible cost: he abandons the precision clients wanted. Closure linkage is strong. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage +1.5, specificity +0.6; late first physical workshop action −0.2, some label overlap −0.3 = ~6.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The compass rose is handled in three beats: discovered on pedestal, touched (warmth pulses, petals shift to Perhaps), lifted and carried, then placed on clock face at ending. It enables the final choice by reweighting "Perhaps" from threat to direction and pointing "Now" forward. Irreplaceability is high: its engraved directions (Someday, If, Otherwise, Perhaps, Now, Again, Maybe, Begin) are unique and specific. Setup mid-story (~40%), development (shifts alignment twice), payoff (placed on clock, enabling the improvised hands). Early signal +0.5, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.4, closure linkage +1.6, specificity +0.7, cost connection +0.5; introduced after first third −0.4 = ~7.9. Rounding: 7.9.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Beneath the ashes" shapes initial discovery (trapdoor under coal dust and tickets) and recurs in the greenhouse entrance ("swirling leaves," earth and experiments). The concept threads the descent-and-emergence structure and alters tactics (Eli must dig/lift to access the cavern). Setup (ashes/tickets), development (descent under old depot), payoff (stepping through to greenhouse, "forgotten experiments" echo the buried theme). Cost: he must leave the surface certainty. Early signal +0.7, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +0.9, closure linkage +0.8, specificity +0.5; some metaphorical rather than literal pressure −0.5, swappability (could be "under the ruin" with minor edits) −0.5 = ~5.8.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Uncertainly certain" is label-stated twice: once in narration ("feel briefly, uncertainly certain"), once at the climax ("uneasy desire to befriend uncertainty" + "uncertainly certain that change"). The attribute constrains his final choice (he opts for hesitant hands rather than precision). Setup (established as his mode), development (he decides to improvise despite no plan), payoff (attaching hands that hesitate embodies the trait). Visible trade-off: he abandons client expectations for wandering minutes. Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +1.2, cost connection +0.5; label-only in first mention −0.3, some redundancy −0.5 = ~6.4.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Improvise" is named explicitly ("he decided to improvise") and drives the ending action (attaching hands that hesitate vs. precise mechanism). The choice redefines his relationship to time and uncertainty. Setup (told never to improvise with time), development (decision to improvise at threshold), payoff (final improvisational act). Irreplaceability: swapping "improvise" for "experiment" or "try" would weaken thematic link to jazz/uncertainty. Early setup +0.6, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.3, closure linkage +1.5, specificity +0.6, cost connection +0.5; explicit label in dialogue with self −0.3, slight tell-heaviness −0.2 = ~7.2. Rounding: 7.2.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Through the swirling leaves in a neglected greenhouse" is the method of final transition and discovery. The greenhouse supplies the clock-face stems that Eli will alter, making it essential to closure. Setup none (greenhouse appears only in final third), development weak (he pushes door, steps through—minimal mechanics), payoff strong (clock faces on stems await him there). The means matters structurally but is not signaled or prepared. Two gates only (development + payoff, missing setup) cap at ~6.0 per guidance. One beat +0.4, closure linkage +1.2; late introduction (final third) −0.8, ornamental arrival −0.6, no early signal −0.6, summary transition −0.4 = ~4.1. Rounding: 4.1.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The subterranean waterfall is discovered early, supplies the cavern and compass rose, and recurs in sensory detail (hiss, roar, spray). It pressures Eli's descent and frames the mystical discovery. Setup (heard early, trapdoor opened), development (he descends into it, finds compass on pedestal in cavern), payoff (its presence underwrites the entire underground arc and the final transformation). It does not directly constrain the final greenhouse choice but charges the atmosphere and supplies the pedestal/compass. Early signal +0.7, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +0.8, closure linkage indirect +0.4, specificity +0.6; payoff participation is atmospheric rather than tactical −0.5, some postcard description −0.2 = ~6.7.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"When coincidence becomes pattern" is named explicitly and structures Eli's arc: the waterfall sound coincides with his last clock stopping at 11:11; he reaches "the age when coincidence becomes pattern." The timeframe reframes his perception and justifies the quest. Setup (stated early), development (pattern recognition drives descent and choices), payoff (the compass rose's shifting petals literalize pattern as direction). Causal pressure: this insight propels him to follow the sound and accept Perhaps. Cost: he abandons rational dismissal. Early signal +0.7, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.3, closure linkage +1.0, specificity +0.5, cost connection +0.4; some label-tell −0.3, slight abstraction −0.2 = ~7.6. Rounding: 7.6.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"To befriend uncertainty in planning" is stated explicitly ("new, uneasy desire to befriend uncertainty in planning") and drives the ending action (attaching hands that hesitate). Setup (his life banishing Perhaps), development (compass reweights Perhaps as direction, he decides to improvise), payoff (final choice embodies befriending uncertainty). The desire is told rather than fully shown in conflicted micro-beats, lowering score slightly. Friction between old habit and new desire is present but soft. Early setup +0.6, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.1, closure linkage +1.4, cost connection +0.5; label-tell in climax −0.4, slight conflict underplay −0.3 = ~7.4. Rounding: 7.4.</comment>
