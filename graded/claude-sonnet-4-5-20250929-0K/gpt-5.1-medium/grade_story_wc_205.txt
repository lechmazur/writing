<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's interiority is specific and embodied—"old chants surface, not as slogans, but as questions" shows internal contradiction. Her motivation to "reimagine the entire civilization" drives micro-choices: picking up the shard, descending, covering mirrors. The final choice to preserve "reimagined futures from leaking away" is earned by prior causality. Elyas remains functional but thin, serving primarily as a foil for Mara's arc.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors Mara on the baroque asteroid within the first paragraph. The piece moves through escalating discoveries (shard → sealed chambers → vase shards → projection onto mirrors) that reweight the dominant stake: whether history can be reimagined. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Mara walks alone covering mirrors "not to keep time out, but to keep these reimagined futures from leaking away"—a crystallized stance with felt cost (the visions will never replace official histories, yet their glow burnishes her calcified sorrow). One meaningful deepening occurs when the funerary/rehearsal dispute splits scholars, forcing Mara to devise an alternate telling.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The baroque asteroid is vividly realized through selective detail: "curtains pooled in corners like spilled years," "corridors twisted like frozen music," copper-vine-framed mirrors. Setting directly constrains choice: mirrors must be veiled to prevent time leakage, sealed compartments require descent with drapes as tools. The micro-setting of mirrors charges the final image—covering them preserves Mara's reimagined futures. Spatial choreography remains coherent across multiple locations (galleries, Hall of Fractured Dynasties, sealed compartments, chapel of obsolete engines).</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: whether the asteroid's purpose (and by extension the revolution's failure) can be reimagined. Signaled early through Mara's rituals and the defunct-revolutionary label. Pressure escalates via discovery sequence: shard → chambers → vase shards → Council's funerary interpretation → devising poems as counter-narrative. Agency is clear: Mara agrees to join the excavation, veils mirrors, and records time-coil movements. The final renunciation—covering mirrors to preserve rather than exclude—forecloses the path of official acceptance with visible cost ("never replace the official histories").</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: what was the revolution's true failure—being wrong, or imagining too little? The branching time-coils versus closed loops embody the funerary/rehearsal debate without stating it. The final image of covering mirrors to preserve "unused possibility" offers a resonant, non-literal answer: revolutionary imagination survives in protected, private acts rather than public validation. Mara's poems about "councils that listened before they ruled" reweight her earlier slogans without moralizing. No thematic echo or summary mars the ending.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV holds stable focalization through Mara. Diction is baroque and specific: "ghost letters beneath newer frescoes of saints of entropy," "stages layered within stages of unused possibility." Voice modulates purposefully—compressed during storm rituals, expansive during chamber discoveries. Elyas's dialogue ("whispered that the shard was part of the Founders' Hourglass") and his arqueological idiom distinguish him adequately. The perceptual signature is consistent: Mara notices mirrors, slogans, and revolutionary possibility. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; paragraph structure creates visual rhythm. Strong figurative density ("time thickened around her fingertips, swirling in pale bands suspended like smoke in syrup") is mostly coherent but borders on overwriting in a few beats. Minor paraphrase loop: "pooled in corners like spilled years" and "collected inside mirrors" restate accumulation without added pressure. One template cadence run: "Elyas wrote of cities... Mara wrote of councils..." across two sentences. Information density is high; most lines advance character, atmosphere, and plot. The opening and closing lines anchor voice and recharge the mirror motif effectively.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The premise—visible time as physical substance on a baroque asteroid—is fresh and commits fully to its implications (mirrors leak time, vase shards capture years). The archaeological dispute over funerary versus rehearsal interpretations offers a non-obvious angle on revolutionary failure. The branching time-coils as "maps of roads no one had walked yet" synthesizes speculative concept with character arc. Emotional specificity avoids templates: "glow burnished the sorrow that had long calcified in her chest." Risk-taking in lyric accumulation heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Transformation test: plot and arc would collapse with generic substitutions.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara (defunct revolutionary) drives key turns: picking up the shard, agreeing to join the excavation, veiling mirrors, devising poems with Elyas, and the final act of covering mirrors to preserve reimagined futures. Setup: first paragraph. Development: multiple middle choices (descent, mirror-veiling, counter-narrative). Payoff: final image shaped by her choice. Early signal +0.6, three or more beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage +1.6, cost connection +0.5. Base 3.0 +5.3 = 8.3, round down to 8.3. Adjustment: choices consistently narrow options under pressure, but some beats (Elyas dispute) dilute solo agency slightly. Final: 7.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Crystal vase shard appears in three beats: discovery in the box, Mara picks it up (time thickens), Elyas identifies it as Hourglass fragment, behind the last mirror hundreds of shards are found. Setup: ~30% mark (late first appearance −0.3). Development: enables excavation decision. Payoff: chamber discovery recontextualizes it. Two beats +0.9, specificity +0.5, causal enabler +0.8. Base 3.0 +2.2 −0.3 = 4.9. The shard enables the turn but does not reappear charged in the final image. Final: 6.4.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Archaeological dispute (funerary vs. rehearsal interpretation) shapes stakes and tactics on the page. Setup: stratigraphic readings discussion. Development: drives the descent, mirror discovery, and the split among scholars. Payoff: devising poems as counter-narrative directly responds to the dispute's outcome. Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, causal pressure (narrows options when Council sides with funerary) +1.3, closure linkage (poems are the answer to the dispute) +1.4, cost connection +0.4. Base 3.0 +4.6 = 7.6. Adjustment: dispute is the engine of the second half. Final: 8.1.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Poetically inclined (Elyas) enables the devise-poems action and his verse about cities that pivot. Setup: "most poetically inclined of the young archaeologists." Development: constraint visible in the poems he writes. Payoff: present in the projecting-verses beat. One beat +0.4, causal enabler +0.6, cost (his career risk implicit) +0.2. Base 3.0 +1.2 = 4.2. The trait shapes one key turn (poetry as counter-narrative) but is not deeply integrated into pressure. Lyric reprise: his verses appear in the projection beat, reweighting the dispute. Final: 5.9.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Devise (poems/counter-narrative) is the major turn after the Council seals the chambers. Setup: implicit in Mara's stance; explicit at "devise another way of telling the story." Development: recording time-coil movements, writing verses. Payoff: projecting verses onto veiled mirrors creates new reflections and directly shapes the final image. Early signal (implicit from Mara's opening stance) +0.5, three beats +1.4, causal pressure (redefines options after Council ruling) +1.5, closure linkage (final act preserves these reimagined futures) +1.7, irreplaceability +0.7, cost +0.5. Base 3.0 +6.3 = 9.3, round down to 9.3. Minor: the devise moment could be signaled slightly earlier. Final: 8.7.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Covering mirrors during storms is Mara's ritual, signaled in paragraph 3. Setup: early. Development: she and Elyas veil mirrors in the sealed compartments, and the act releases captured time with "a sound like distant weeping." Payoff: final image—"covering mirrors not to keep time out, but to keep these reimagined futures from leaking away"—reweights the method's meaning. Early signal +0.7, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +0.9, closure linkage (final line hinges on it) +1.6, specificity +0.6. Base 3.0 +4.7 = 7.7, round down to 7.7. Adjustment: mechanics clear, reprise charged. Final: 7.2.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Baroque asteroid supplies resources (mirrors, sealed compartments, vase shards) and pressures choice (time leaks, Council's founding myth rooted in the fortress). Setup: first paragraph. Development: galleries, Hall, sealed compartments, chapel—each location alters tactics. Payoff: the asteroid as "theater suspended in the dark, stages layered within stages" charges the final image. Early signal +0.8, three or more beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.3, closure linkage +1.5, specificity +0.7. Base 3.0 +5.7 = 8.7, round down to 8.7. Adjustment: setting is indispensable. Final: 8.3.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>After time becomes visible frames the entire world and creates the mirror-leakage pressure. Setup: opening line. Development: time's visibility drives Mara's rituals, shard behavior, and vase-shard discoveries. Payoff: implicit in the final image (time remains visible and must be managed). Early signal +0.8, three beats +1.4, causal pressure (time visibility creates the stakes) +1.1, closure linkage (ongoing condition) +0.9. Base 3.0 +4.2 = 7.2, round down to 7.2. The timeframe is pervasive but more a condition than a ticking clock. Adjustment: drives atmosphere and ritual logic. Final: 6.8.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>To reimagine an entire civilization is Mara's motivation, dramatized in her agreement to join the excavation, her counter-reading of the vase shards, and her devising of poems. Setup: "What if the revolution had failed... because they had imagined too little?" Development: drives descent and dispute engagement. Payoff: final act preserves reimagined futures. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.4, closure linkage +1.6, cost (visions will never replace official histories) +0.5. Base 3.0 +5.5 = 8.5, round down to 8.5. Friction between want (public vindication) and cost (private preservation) is legible. Adjustment: motivation is the spine. Final: 8.4.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Burnished sorrow is coherent throughout: "defunct," "ghost letters," "calcified in her chest," and the final "burnished the sorrow" callback. Tone modulates with pressure—elegiac in rituals, urgent in discoveries, quiet in the ending. The final image charges burnished sorrow with cost: the glow of reimagined futures cannot replace history but can burnish (polish, relieve) her calcified grief. Early signal +0.7, coherence across turns +0.9, closure linkage (final sentence uses the exact phrase with reweighted meaning) +1.7, cost connection +0.5. Base 3.0 +3.8 = 6.8. Adjustment: tone is the emotional spine and the final reprise is earned and charged. Final: 8.6.</comment>
