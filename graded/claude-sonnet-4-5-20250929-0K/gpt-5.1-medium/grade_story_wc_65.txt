<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elian's interior life is well-drawn through embodied hesitation (numb fingers, trembling hands) and the layered tension between professional duty and moral weight. His motivation to avoid breaking unseen people creates genuine internal pressure, and the final moment of choosing the feather nib feels earned through the charcoal trial-runs. The renunciation of narrow choices in favor of the breathing-arc solution demonstrates contradictory impulses acting in scene. Minor deduction: the interiority occasionally drifts toward abstraction ("ignorance was both his trade and his prison") without immediate physical grounding.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Causal-Accumulative Hybrid, held cleanly through closure. The piece moves from duty-as-prison through predictive modeling attempts to the discovery of the three-year cycle pattern, culminating in a Charged Poise closure where Elian lowers the nib with visible cost (surrendering the last second of possibility, committing to a flexible plan that demands more of the kingdom). Orientation is swift (who, where, what by line 5). One meaningful tightening occurs when the temperature-chart rhythm crystallizes the leapfrogging solution, narrowing options and raising stakes. Cost is legible: the design "asked more of the kingdom, demanded patience," and Elian's fierce joy signals he's trading certainty for ethics. The final image—nib descending—reconfigures the initial constraint (blank page as decision boundary) with felt weight.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The obsidian spire and frozen lake create a tangible crucible: the tower isolates Elian, and the advancing snows reported in his data constrain the map's options. The kingfisher nib's sensory detail (blues and greens "like a living shard of river water") charges the final choice. Spatial choreography is clean (balcony to chamber, desk to velvet box), and the braziers, vellum spread, and charcoal tracings ground the modeling work. The three-year thaw cycle transforms setting detail (temperature charts) into tactical constraint. Minor gap: the "frozen lake lay mute" at the end is evocative but doesn't mechanically alter the final beat as directly as the nib does.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: map a future that doesn't sacrifice the unseen. Pressure coheres through the king's decree (negotiable before ink, binding after) and escalates when Elian's charcoal scenarios reveal famine-or-abandonment trade-offs. The discovery of the three-year thaw pattern reverses the either-or trap, creating a third path with visible cost (more labor, patience, no conquest). Agency is decision-based: Elian's predictive modeling choices narrow options, and the final act of opening the velvet box and lowering the nib forecloses retreat. The cost is legible on the page ("asked more," "did not require anyone to be buried") and the fierce joy signals a trade-off between certainty and ethics. One tightening suffices for this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—sustaining transformation without conquest—emerges organically from the temperature-chart discovery and the leapfrogging design. The piece resists moralizing; instead, the final image (nib descending toward "the future he had dared to imagine") offers a non-literal answer to the question of how to prevail without breaking people. The kingfisher nib's colors ("like a promise that some futures could be bright without being naive") encode hope constrained by realism. Subtext operates in the king's decree (power disguised as freedom) and in Elian's search for a path that "did not triumph by sacrificing the unseen." No thematic echo or sermon; wisdom is earned through the on-page modeling struggle.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>POV distance is stable (close third, Elian's lens throughout). Perceptual signature is strong: he notices probabilities, margins of error, and the fragile interval "thin as breath on ice." Diction remains consistent and character-particular ("ignorance cartographer," "lines of ink that would move people"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully, tightening as he traces circles and opens the velvet box. The final paragraph's shift to lyric compression ("like sunlight under water") matches the emotional peak without breaking voice. No dialogue, so those bullets don't apply. Minor deduction: "savoring the last second of possibility" is slightly on-the-nose, though it doesn't disrupt the perceptual texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is largely clean and purposeful. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final image ("lowered the nib toward the future he had dared to imagine") resonates. Sentence rhythms vary, and information density is high (e.g., the paragraph introducing the three-year cycle packs mechanism and stakes efficiently). Minor loop: "Charts of possible harbors overlapped with forecasts…each line hedged with probabilities" and the prior paragraph's "fragments into charts" repeat the mapping-as-translation idea without advancing pressure. Small register drift: "sustaining transformation" in the leapfrogging explanation feels slightly elevated relative to Elian's grounded interiority elsewhere. No major artifacts, but these small slips prevent entry to 8.5+.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The core premise—cartographer of the unknown constrained by a "before ink touches vellum" rule—offers a fresh angle on map-as-political-power tropes. The three-year thaw cycle and leapfrogging depots transform the familiar "frontier survival" template through specific environmental logic. The kingfisher nib as a charged object feels particular to this voice and stakes. The combination of predictive modeling, ethical calculus, and constrained freedom coheres organically. Risk-taking is present but not extreme; the piece executes its design cleanly rather than pushing structural or perspectival boundaries. The ending's emotional specificity (fierce joy tempered by trembling hands) avoids generic triumph.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elian's choices drive all key turns: he spreads vellum, layers reports, traces charcoal scenarios, discovers the three-year pattern, designs the leapfrogging system, and lowers the nib. His agency shapes the closure beat directly. Present throughout; causal across multiple beats.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The kingfisher feather quill nib appears in the velvet box mid-story and returns charged at the end ("colors shifting like sunlight under water, like a promise"). It's handled twice (opened, then attached to pen and lowered). The nib's sensory detail and symbolic weight elevate the final beat, but it doesn't constrain a middle choice—Elian's modeling work occurs with charcoal. Lyric reprise with cost, but missing middle development.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Writing the future" shapes the dominant stake: once ink meets vellum, the plan becomes law. The king's decree establishes the constraint ("negotiable before…utterly binding after"), and Elian's predictive modeling attempts test futures. The final act (lowering the nib) is the concept's climax. Present early, drives tactics throughout, and anchors closure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Groundedly imaginative" is dramatized: Elian seeks "innovation within a constraint" and discovers the leapfrogging solution—imaginative yet anchored in the temperature-chart pattern. The trait enables the core choice (reject either-or, find a third path) with visible cost (demands patience, more labor). Label mentioned once, but the behavior is enacted across the modeling sequence and pays off at closure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Prevail" appears explicitly ("he might prevail not over the land, but over the narrowness of the choice") and defines the climax: Elian's leapfrogging design allows him to prevail ethically rather than through conquest. The action redefines the stakes from binary (mines or safety) to adaptive survival. Present in the final third, but the concept shapes the resolution's logic and emotional charge.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Predictive modeling" is signaled early ("paid not to describe the world, but to write the future through predictive modeling") and drives the middle: Elian layers reports, builds a lattice of "if and then," runs scenarios, tests futures until the temperature-chart pattern emerges. The method's mechanics (charcoal tracings, overlapping data) are shown on the page and shape the solution. Causal across multiple beats.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The obsidian spire and frozen lake frame the story and isolate Elian, creating atmosphere. The advancing snows in the reports constrain the map's options indirectly. The spire's circular chamber, desk, vellum, and braziers ground the modeling work. The setting shapes mood and context but doesn't supply a direct tactical resource or choice-altering constraint at the closure beat. Present throughout, but impact is more atmospheric than mechanical.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Before the pen meets the blank page" establishes the timeframe and tightens all decisions: Elian's modeling must finish before he sets nib to vellum. The "fragile interval, thin as breath on ice" is the sole window of freedom. The final beat ("savoring the last second of possibility before decision") makes the clock's closure explicit. Time pressure shapes tactics and charges the ending image.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>"To seed innovation within a constraint" is Elian's explicit motivation and drives his search for a third path. The desire is conflicted (duty to king vs. ethical weight) and tested through the modeling sequence. The leapfrogging solution dramatizes the goal with visible cost (more labor, patience). Friction between wants (certainty, legacy for the king) and costs (sacrifice of unseen people) generates the core tension.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"Sustaining transformation" coheres as tone: the prose balances weight (obsidian, frozen, numb) with hope (kingfisher colors, fierce joy). Modulation is purposeful—reflective gravity in the opening, rising urgency during modeling, lyric charge at closure. The final image ("lines of ink that would move people…along the breathing edges of ice and thaw") embodies the tone's paradox: transformation without conquest. Tone charges the ending and holds through turns.</comment>
