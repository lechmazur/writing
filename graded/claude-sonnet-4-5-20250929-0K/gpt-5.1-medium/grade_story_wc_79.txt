<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Keth's interiority is concrete and consistent: guilt drives his archival obsession, the whistle carries layered meaning (turtle-calling tool, expedition signal, personal burden), and his final choice to blow a new note is earned by accumulated pressure. Internal contradiction operates well—he tells himself he's "done wondering" yet "every map he drew curled subtly toward that unreachable line." Minor deduction: the Council scene briefly shifts to external observation of their eyes drifting, diluting POV control, and the trait "quietly driven" is declared early but shown through action throughout, keeping embodiment strong.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with Situational pressure—shell-pattern fragments accumulate, the rusted gate and silent watchers recur, and Keth's final whistle crystallizes a Charged Poise moment where turning the turtles reconfigures all prior stakes. Orientation anchors by line 2 (Keth, western balcony, harbor city on turtles, day the gate rusted shut). The closure lands on the page with felt cost: Keth defies the Council's refusal, carves a question into the shell, and calls the turtles with a new note—pressure is undeniable, the city's survival hinges on the turn, and the cost (potential disaster, isolation) is implicit but legible in "the sun pressed down like a hand, bright, heavy, and uncaring" giving way to movement. One tightening: broken spirals force Council confrontation; one deepening: Keth's carved question and whistle reweight all prior cartography into live action.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The turtles function as micro-setting and recurring constraint: their ridges are "pattern languages," scars guide storm prediction, broken spirals signal fear and force Keth's Council appeal, and the final shell carving + whistle call charges the closure by making the environment an active agent. Sensory detail is purposeful and POV-filtered: "salt light glazed the roofs," "barnacled continents sighing," rust turns "bruised gold," the pulse through bars. Spatial choreography is clean (balcony → Council table → sealed harbor gate → waterline). The gate itself pressures choice by sealing the city and representing the Council's paralysis. The turtles' turn in the final line completes the environmental arc, making setting indispensable to closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early: survival of the city on cracking turtles, braided with Keth's guilt over the lost expedition. One meaningful tightening: broken shell spirals force Council confrontation; the Council refuses to act, narrowing Keth's options to solo defiance. The final whistle call is protagonist-driven agency that forecloses the path of passive guilt and commits the city to a new course. Cost is visible: Keth acts against Council will, risking his standing and the city's fate. Minor slip: the watchers' silence and the turtles' fear are told more than shown in earlier beats, slightly softening middle escalation, but the ending choice reweights all prior pressure into a single decisive action.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: guilt as paralysis (Keth's endless mapping, the city's drowned silence), the cost of curiosity versus safety (rusted gate vs. open sea), and responsibility to the lost (expedition signals, watchers). The reed whistle recurs with shifted meaning: turtle-caller → expedition lifeline → Keth's new question, charging the final image without stated moral. The broken spirals and rusted gate form a motif that constrains choice and reweights at closure. Subtext operates in Keth's ear pressed to shell, the Council's drifting eyes, and the sun's "bright, heavy, and uncaring" pressure. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: movement in response to a new call, the turtles turning as the city might, leaving the outcome ambiguous but the question unmistakable.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV, stable third-limited with strong perceptual signature: Keth notices shell ridges, spiral grammar, tide-bell silence, and translates environmental tremors into meaning. Diction is controlled and voice-consistent: "ink-sworn lines," "scabbed lace," "mute shine," "grain of sand around which dread kept spinning its own shell." Psychic distance tightens appropriately at closure (whistle to lips, turtles turning). Brief Council dialogue is natural and goal-driven: the Tidewright's line "You want us to open what can no longer open" carries subtext of fear and refusal. Minor slip: one moment of slight head-hopping when "their eyes kept drifting" externalizes the Council's internal state without clear POV justification, though the effect is minimal and quickly returns to Keth's lens.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully: long contemplative sentences ("The turtles did not speak with mouths, but with slow tides of motion…") tighten at closure ("Then the turtles began to turn"). Information density is high—nearly every line advances world logic, guilt, or turtle-pattern stakes. Figurative language is controlled: "fossilized waves," "scabbed lace," "bruised gold" match the sunwashed-dread tone without overwriting. Minor deductions: "the pull sat in his chest like a grain of sand around which dread kept spinning its own shell" stacks two metaphors in one beat; "bright enough to hide its bruises" and "drowned quietly beneath the tide bells" approach purple in adjacent early paragraphs. One paraphrase loop: "quietly driven" is both stated and shown in close succession. No template cadence or scaffold, and the final line delivers clean propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The premise—city on giant turtles, cartographer reading shell-ridges as language, rusted gate sealing them in—synthesizes familiar migration/lost-expedition tropes into a specific, non-obvious world with tactile detail (barnacled continents, spiral grammar, reed whistle). The twist that turtles communicate through growth rings and that Keth can "write" back by carving questions feels earned and transforms the cartographer role from passive to active agent. Emotional truth (guilt without resolution, Council paralysis, the courage of a single note) grounds the fantastical premise. Risk-taking: the ending refuses neat rescue, leaving the turn itself as the closure. Proximity check clean; no close echoes of famous lines. The story commits fully to its shell-language logic without retreat.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Keth (spiral-shell cartographer) appears in paragraph 1, drives the Council confrontation mid-story, and makes the final decision to carve a question and blow the new whistle note that turns the turtles. His choices create all key turns: interpreting broken spirals, bringing findings to Council, defying their refusal, acting alone at the gate. Removing this character collapses the story. Strong setup, middle agency, and closure participation with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Reed whistle introduced early (paragraph 13) with dual function: calls turtles near reefs, was the expedition's signal until silence. Returns at closure when Keth blows a new note—"not one the city used"—that turns the turtles and reweights its prior meaning from passive memory to active question. Two distinct beats: initial description and final use. The whistle's mechanics (calling, signaling, new note) shape the ending's logic. High integration, clear reprise with cost.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lost expedition is seeded early (paragraph 8), shapes Keth's guilt and the city's paralysis throughout, and drives his motivation to "question the silent watchers." The watchers and expedition silence pressure the Council scene and justify Keth's final defiance. The concept constrains tactics (no one will go, gate is shut) and charges the ending by making Keth's new call a direct response to unanswered signals. Three gates met; strong causal role, though the expedition itself remains off-page. Cost tied to Keth's guilt and the city's narrowed survival.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Quietly driven" is stated in paragraph 5 and demonstrated throughout: Keth works alone, never raises his voice, moves "like a ghost," yet brings findings to Council and ultimately defies them. The trait enables his solo action at the gate and constrains his method (no loud protest, just one whistle note). Visible tradeoff: his quietness isolates him, his drive compels the risky final act. Swappable with "determined" or "obsessive" in some beats, but the "quietly" modifier adds specific texture that fits the tone. Mid-high band for consistent embodiment with modest cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Crack" appears as verb and image: "patterns had begun to crack" (paragraph 27), "if we wait, the shells will crack apart" (paragraph 36). The concept of fracture drives Keth's urgency and the Council's fear, shaping the middle escalation. At closure, Keth carves (etches, not cracks) a question, and the turtles turn—crack is thematic pressure but not the final action. Two gates (middle threat, implied at end via shell fragility). Moderate causal role; could be replaced with "break" or "shatter" without major structural loss, but the specific word reinforces the shell-pattern language throughout.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Pattern languages seeded early: "ridges, scars, and pale growth rings were pattern languages" (paragraph 22), Keth "could read when storms were coming" (paragraph 24). Mechanics matter: broken spirals trigger Council scene, Keth carves a question into the shell's outermost ring (paragraph 43), and the new whistle note is "shaped from the fractured shells" (paragraph 44). Method is signaled, used in two distinct beats (interpreting, writing back), and shapes the closure's logic—Keth's ability to "answer" the turtles through pattern is what turns them. Essential across beats and ending.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>City on turtle-shells appears in paragraph 2, provides all spatial logic (balcony above, harbor gate embedded in shell, waterline access), and the turtles' condition (weary, barnacled, afraid) drives the stakes. Setting constrains choice: rusted gate prevents ships, shell-cracks threaten collapse, proximity to waterline enables Keth's carved question. The turtles' turn at closure is the setting acting as agent—removing the turtle-city breaks story logic entirely. Setup, middle (Council debate over gate, shell-reading), and payoff (turtles turn) all depend on this exact setting. Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"After the gate rusts shut" is the opening anchor (paragraph 1) and recurs: gate "froze in place" (paragraph 33), "Life here had narrowed into the shape of survival after the gate rusts shut" (paragraph 34). Timeframe establishes present paralysis and constrains tactics (no ships, no external help). Keth's action at the sealed gate is a direct response to the post-rust condition. The timeframe tightens the decision (city is trapped, turtles cracking), though elapsed time within the story is vague. Three gates met with strong thematic and causal role, but no live ticking clock that alters moves beat-to-beat.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Motivation to "question the silent watchers on the horizon" is stated explicitly (paragraph 35) and dramatized: Keth's maps "curled subtly toward that unreachable line" (paragraph 19), he tells Council "I want to question the silent watchers" (paragraph 35), and his final whistle is a question carved and called toward the horizon. Friction between want (answers, redemption) and cost (Council refusal, risk to city) shapes the ending choice. The watchers are tied to the lost expedition and the turtles' fear, making the motivation causally integrated. Strong closure linkage; Keth's question is the story's final action.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Sunwashed dread" operates throughout: "Salt light glazed the roofs… turning everything bright enough to hide its bruises" (paragraph 4), "the sun pressed down like a hand, bright, heavy, and uncaring" (paragraph 45). Tone modulates with pressure: early contemplative dread ("guilt drowned quietly"), middle static dread (Council's paralyzed gaze, rusted gate as "bruised gold"), final active dread (sun presses, turtles turn—hope or disaster uncertain). Coherent across turns; charges the final image by making the turtles' movement ambiguous (救 salvation or doom under that relentless light). Indispensable to the story's emotional texture and closure effect.</comment>
