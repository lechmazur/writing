<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Eli's interiority is concrete and embodied—he steadies the table with his knee, recognizes the cabinet curve "with a jolt that bypassed thought." Internal contradiction surfaces when facts desert him and memory floods in, driving the final renunciation. The attribute "confidently uncertain" is declared rather than dramatized in micro-choices under pressure. Reflection density is high (~35% of text) but anchored in the present stimulus (the amp) and tilts his stance toward the final decision, meeting BRR exception criteria.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece builds density through interleaved memory and present appraisal until the grille-cloth scrap crystallizes recognition and forces the final reconfiguration. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Eli writes "Provenance uncertain, but history priceless to those who remember" and realizes "to discover purpose after loss was enough"—a stance crystallization that forecloses the purely factual path with felt cost (abandoning objective appraisal for subjective truth). Orientation anchors are present early (quarry trailer, Eli, auction appraisal). Cost is legible in the final choice to privilege personal history over commercial provenance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The quarry as "echo valley" functions thematically and texturally; the trailer's fluorescent buzz and wobbly card table ground Eli's isolation. The amp itself operates as micro-setting: the cabinet lip curve, speaker grille scrap, and transformer placement constrain recognition and charge the closure. Sensory detail is selective—cigarette burns, dust, gaffer-tape singe—and filtered through professional habit. The body (steadying table with knee, fingers recognizing curve) participates in discovery without forced choreography.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: whether Eli can assign value (and implicitly find purpose) in cataloging relics versus drowning in past loss. The discovery of his own amp tightens options—he can lie for market value or honor memory. One meaningful deepening occurs when the grille-cloth scrap bypasses thought and facts desert him, narrowing his appraisal to a personal reckoning. Agency is renunciation with cost: he writes "Provenance uncertain" and forfeits commercial certainty for subjective meaning. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens but the external opposition is minimal; the conflict is primarily internal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme—purpose after public failure and the primacy of personal narrative—emerges from the interplay of appraisal rigor and memory's flood. The final line "to discover purpose after loss was enough, finally" risks abstraction but is earned by the prior particulars: the scrap, the singer's voice, the quiet louder than any crowd. No overt moralizing; the decision to privilege "history priceless to those who remember" reweights the appraisal frame without stating a thesis. Subtext operates in silence (the quarry's echo, the after-applause ringing) and the gap between professional language and lived experience.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice is consistent and carries a distinct perceptual signature: Eli filters through facts as "sandbags against a flood," notices cabinet curves by feel, and frames loss as "misalignment of expectations and reality." Psychic distance modulates purposefully—tightening when the scrap appears, loosening into memory, then compressing again at closure. Free indirect style is clean. Reflection is dense but remains anchored to the present amp and the appraisal task. Minor slip: "confidently uncertain" and the manager's quarterly review feel slightly expository rather than embodied in scene pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Information density is high; sentences layer appraisal detail, memory, and metaphor without major redundancy. Rhythm varies—longer reflective passages contract to short beats at the scrap discovery. Minor template cadence in the backstory paragraphs: several "After…" and "Once…" stems cluster without variation. The phrase "the quiet had been louder than any crowd" borders on stock paradox but serves the theme. No major loops or scaffold, though the reflection-heavy middle risks slight momentum drag. Proofreading is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The ex-roadie-turned-appraiser frame is a fresh synthesis, and the quarry-as-echo-valley setting particularizes the loneliness. The emotional arc—public humiliation to private reclamation—avoids easy redemption; Eli's final assertion is modest and qualified. Risk: the heavy reflection load and the thematic explicitness in the final line ("to discover purpose after loss was enough") pull toward safety rather than bold ambiguity. The core is solid but not startling; transformation of the failed-appraiser trope is present but moderate.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Eli's occupation (ex-roadie, appraiser) frames every beat: he uses the loupe, recognizes cabinet details, and his final appraisal choice—writing "Provenance uncertain, but history priceless"—is the closure decision that privileges memory over market. Early setup, middle constraint (professional suspension forces freelance gig), and closure participation all present with visible cost (forfeiting objective authority).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The grille-cloth scrap appears at setup (trailer context), triggers recognition in the middle beat ("unmistakable" pattern, Milwaukee memory), and decisively shapes closure (Eli realizes "the story mattered more than the signature"). It constrains his appraisal and charges the final decision with personal cost. Three-gate pass; specific and irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"After the applause" is seeded early (dusk silence "felt exactly like after the applause used to feel backstage") and returns implicitly at closure when Eli finds purpose in remembering rather than chasing new applause. It shapes tactics (cataloging as substitute for performance) and the ending stance. Present in setup and payoff with thematic weight, but middle development is oblique. Lyric reprise with felt cost qualifies for mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Confidently uncertain" is named in the manager's review and alluded to in Eli's hedging ("Provenance uncertain"), but it does not constrain an on-page choice under pressure—it is more diagnostic label than enacted trait. Setup present, minimal middle development, closure echo weak. Swappable with "ambivalent" or "tentative" without major loss.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Wrest" appears once: the temp agency "could wrest from odd clients." It explains how Eli arrived at the trailer but does not create a key turn or constrain later choices. Functional logistics, replaceable with "secure" or "scrape together." Single mention, no development or closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Insulating emotionally with facts" is introduced early ("he told himself it felt almost like a stage again… insulating himself emotionally with facts") and recurs: Eli absorbs the foreman's story "like sandbags," recites appraisal details, and frames loss as "misalignment." At closure, facts desert him and memory wins—the method's failure enables the final shift. Setup, middle constraint, payoff with reweighted meaning. Causal role in one major turn.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The quarry office trailer anchors the story spatially and thematically: "echo valley," fluorescent buzz, wobbly card table Eli steadies with his knee. It supplies the isolation that allows memory to surface and frames the appraisal task that triggers the closure decision. Setup, middle embodiment (trailer details), and closure participation (the trailer's "faintly buzzing" light witnesses the final choice). Essential setting for tone and stakes.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"After failing publicly" is established early (livestream suspension, comment section looping) and drives Eli to the freelance gig, but the timeframe does not tighten decisions within the scene—no live clock pressures the appraisal. It motivates the story's start and charges Eli's internal stakes (seeking redemption or purpose), qualifying as causal setup with thematic payoff. Two-gate pass; moderate integration.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Eli's desire to "discover purpose after loss" is dramatized throughout: he catalogs objects seeking meaning, rejects the "quiet" of antiques appraisal, and at closure realizes "to discover purpose after loss was enough." The motivation is conflicted (facts as sandbags versus memory's flood) and shapes the final choice with visible cost (writing subjective provenance). Early signal, middle friction (past versus present), closure participation with felt cost. Strong causal integration.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Echo valley longing" is coherent across the piece: the quarry as "echo valley that swallowed sound and fed it back," the "stunned ringing" after applause, the "quiet… louder than any crowd." Tone modulates from clinical appraisal to memory saturation to quiet resolution without breaking register. The final image ("the trailer buzzing faintly") sustains the echo motif and charges closure. Setup, middle embodiment, and payoff present; tone integral to stakes and ending.</comment>
