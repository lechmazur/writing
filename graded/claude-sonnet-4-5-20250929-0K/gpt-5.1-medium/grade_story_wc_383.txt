<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Neris's skepticism and evolving stance are clearly motivated, and her guilt over her brother's isolation is embodied through specific memory fragments. The caretaker remains somewhat functional rather than fully individuated—his role as exposition vehicle occasionally flattens his presence. The transformation from "skeptic stalking the borders of belief" to someone learning "to listen without running" is earned by the seashell vision and the caretaker's guided instruction, with visible cost in her confrontation with archived guilt.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story establishes a Causal lens with accumulative texture: Neris finds the shell, hears the vision, seeks the caretaker, and receives instruction that reframes her relationship to guilt. The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—she moves from prisoner to archivist, a stance crystallization with felt cost ("did not forgive herself, not yet, but she began to map and archive"). Orientation is clear by the opening paragraph. One meaningful deepening occurs when the caretaker's question forces her to confront what she has been quarantining from herself, narrowing her options and leading to the final learning posture.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The velvet garden is richly anchored with sensory specificity (gray moths, black roses, salt-laced hush, blue glass lantern) and its atmosphere of archived sorrows pressures Neris's choice to return nightly and finally to engage with the caretaker. The stone bench and seashell half function as micro-setting elements that constrain the pivotal moment. The timeframe "when the last star fades into morning light" charges the final image with the garden's shift from eerie sanctuary to working archive, and the cobalt sky transition marks the cost of the night's work.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether Neris can confront her quarantined guilt rather than hide from it—is signaled early and tightens when the seashell vision forces her to choose between dropping it or seeking proof. The caretaker's question "what are you quarantining from yourself" is the key pressure point that narrows options and leads to her decision to "learn to listen without running." Agency is clear: she chooses to study what she has locked away, translating isolation into independence with the visible cost that she does not yet forgive herself but must map the guilt's terrain. One meaningful tightening drives the arc under a Causal lens with accumulative texture.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The theme of quarantined memory versus active archiving emerges through concrete particulars—the seashell, the hospital memory, the garden as repository—without overt statement. The caretaker's line "translate isolation into independence" risks thematic echo but is dramatized immediately in Neris's choice to learn the listening practice, and the cost is embodied in her trembling hands and incomplete forgiveness. The final image of the garden shifting from sanctuary to working archive offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of how to live with unbearable memory. The seashell's function as both cage and study object charges the ending without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The prose maintains a distinct, elevated register consistent with Neris's interior voice ("charmed skeptic," "ghostly resolve," "painfully sharp yet strangely ordered"). Dialogue between Neris and the caretaker carries subtext and advances plot, though the caretaker's exposition occasionally tilts toward helpful-narrator mode ("We store them here through resonance structures, patterns of sound and light"). The psychic distance is stable in third-person limited, and the voice modulates appropriately under pressure. A few stock metaphors ("heart hammering like a fist on a locked door") and slightly formal diction in peak moments prevent higher scoring, but no head-hopping or clarity failures occur.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The prose is generally clear and rhythmically varied, with strong imagery ("syllables shaped like breath on glass," "sunlight on a flooded room"). However, pervasive figurative density in nearly every sentence creates mild overwriting (e.g., "silence fit the shape of her thoughts," "mold in bread," "invisible librarian") without all metaphors earning their keep. A few near-paraphrase loops appear: "quarantined memory" is restated multiple times in close proximity, and the transformation from prisoner to archivist is explained twice in adjacent beats. Template cadence is avoided, but the figurative saturation and minor redundancy prevent entry into the 7.5+ range.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of memory-as-contagion and the garden-as-archive is specific and purposeful, avoiding generic metaphor. The "resonance structures" concept and the notion of translating isolation into independence through archival practice offer a fresh angle on grief and guilt. The seashell half as literal memory container and the hospital isolation ward callback create earned parallels. Risk-taking in the elevated, lyric register and the quiet, stance-crystallization ending heighten coherence. The piece avoids template plotting, though the caretaker's role as guide and the garden-as-therapy frame echo familiar mentor-archetype patterns without fully transforming them.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Neris as "charmed skeptic" is signaled in the opening third and drives two key choices: pressing the shell to her ear despite doubt, and deciding to learn the caretaker's listening method. Her skepticism shapes her initial resistance and her final willingness to "study what you have locked away" rather than hide. The character trait constrains her path and participates in closure when she moves from refusal to investigation. Present across beats with causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The whispering seashell half appears in three distinct beats: discovery, vision, and the final learning session where Neris learns to "cradle the whispering seashell half just so." It is handled on the page, its broken edge and murmurs are specific, and it enables the pivotal vision that forces Neris to confront her guilt. The caretaker's reverent touch and explanation deepen its meaning. It directly shapes the closure when she uses it to archive her memories under his instruction. Essential across beats and ending, with clear causal pressure and specificity.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The "quarantined memory" concept is signaled early ("hospital isolation ward," "quarantined from time itself") and explicitly named at the midpoint, shaping Neris's tactics and the caretaker's explanation of the garden's function. It drives the central question ("what are you quarantining from yourself") and the resolution where she moves from hiding to mapping the quarantined guilt. The concept participates in closure when the garden shifts from sanctuary to "working archive" and she learns to "archive where the guilt lived." Causal pressure, closure linkage, and irreplaceability are all present.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Tragically radiant" appears once as a descriptor of the vision ("clear and tragically radiant, like sunlight on a flooded room") but does not constrain or enable a subsequent action with visible cost. It colors the memory's emotional tone but remains largely ornamental. The attribute is swappable with similar aesthetic descriptors without altering the causal chain. Present and thematically consistent, but no action pressure or closure participation beyond label.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The action "archive" is introduced thematically in the first third ("the garden was an archive for resting sorrows") and becomes operational in the final third when Neris begins to "map and archive where the guilt lived" and the garden shifts to "working archive." It drives the conceptual resolution and the caretaker's instruction. The verb shapes the ending stance and the story's closure image, though it does not create a distinct middle-beat turn. Closure linkage is strong; beat involvement is primarily at setup and ending.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Resonance structures" is named once in the caretaker's exposition ("We store them here through resonance structures, patterns of sound and light") and appears again in the final paragraph's teaching of "how to breathe in time with the murmurs." It provides a conceptual frame for the memory storage but does not constrain Neris's choices or alter her tactics in a visible way. The mechanics are summarized rather than dramatized. Present and logically consistent, but swappable with generic "magical method" and not causally essential.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The velvet garden is anchored in the opening line and revisited across beats: Neris walks there every evening, finds the shell on a stone bench, waits beside it for the caretaker, and remains until dawn when it shifts from "eerie sanctuary to working archive." The garden's silence and atmosphere pressure her return and frame the final transformation. The blue glass lantern, hedges, and stone bench supply specific spatial anchors. The setting participates in closure when the garden's purpose is reweighted, and it constrains her nightly routine. Strong beat involvement, closure linkage, and specificity.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The timeframe "when the last star fades into morning light" appears only in the final sentence, providing a poetic endpoint but not shaping tactics or decisions during the main action. The passage of night is tracked ("Night thinned around them," "lantern's flame paled," "velvet sky loosened into cobalt") and the duration of the learning session is implied, but no live clock tightens choices. The ending image of dawn marks closure and the cost of the night's work, giving it lyric charge. Late first use limits score despite closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The motivation "to translate isolation into independence" is explicitly stated by the caretaker and immediately dramatized when Neris chooses to learn his method: "All right, she said, because doubt had finally brought her to a threshold curiosity would not let her retreat from." The phrase reappears in the final paragraph as she moves "from being prisoner to archivist." It drives her climactic choice and frames the closure stance. The friction between wanting proof and fearing what she'll find creates tension. Signaled at midpoint, drives ending, with visible cost in her incomplete self-forgiveness.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The tone of "ghostly resolve" is embodied in Neris's "trembling hands with a ghostly resolve she did not recognize" at the midpoint and sustained through her decision to learn despite fear. The garden's eerie atmosphere and the whispering shell contribute to the ghostly register, and the resolve crystallizes in her choice to study her guilt. The tone modulates appropriately under pressure and charges the final image when the garden becomes a working archive and she begins mapping her guilt. Coherent through turns, participates in closure, though the exact phrase appears only once.</comment>
