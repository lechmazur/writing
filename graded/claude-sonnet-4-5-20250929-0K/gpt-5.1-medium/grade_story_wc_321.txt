<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Eli's interior life is established through his record-keeping and seven-hundred-ride obsession, and his choice to hum the melody demonstrates agency under pressure. The woman with the hourglass and other passengers remain largely ornamental, lacking interior contradiction. The final choice—"He chose home"—arrives without visible cost or conflicted impulse, reading more as label than earned decision. Embodied emotion is present ("tingling in his teeth," "knuckles ached") but the climactic moment lacks the contradictory pull that would lift it into high bands.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors are established early (deckhand, Harbor Line 7, bay crossing). The piece accumulates pressure through the radio melody, the grotto's appearance, and the overlapping ferries, culminating in "He chose home"—a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where options crystallize. However, the cost remains implicit; we cannot point to an exact line where the price of this choice is legible, only inferred from context. One meaningful deepening is present when the grotto opens and reveals all journeys at once, reweighting the vanishing-ferry premise.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The ferry deck, bay fog, and spectral grotto are rendered with vivid, purpose-driven detail ("wet moonlight," "mapped glow of subway routes, nerve fibers, and constellations overlain"). The grotto constrains the final choice by offering a visible array of alternate crossings, directly charging the closure image. Spatial choreography is clean throughout; the radio, rail, and deck positions track clearly. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency—Eli's focus narrows to the radio dial and the grotto ahead during peak pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: Eli's belief he can "merge parallel timelines" rather than bounce between them. The grotto's appearance is a meaningful tightening that narrows options and forces a stance. However, the final decision—choosing home from the overlapping ferries—lacks visible tradeoff; we do not see what Eli forfeits or what cost attaches to selecting one timeline over others. The passengers forming a "crooked circle" suggests collective action, but their agency and the consequence of this convergence remain vague.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of impermanence and connection emerges organically through the ferry's dissolution, the empty hourglass, and overlapping timelines. The final image—seeing all journeys at once and choosing home—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the question of how scattered lives might land together. Subtext operates effectively in the passengers' averted eyes and Eli's belief that "hope needed practice just as muscles did." The hourglass's "measured void" and "ungrains sliding invisibly" are strong conceptual images that avoid overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Single-POV distance is stable; Eli's perceptual signature (seven-hundred-twelve rides, pattern recognition in static, "hope needed practice") is consistent and character-specific. Diction remains within his plausible lexicon; the elevated lyricism ("stars...trading places like commuters changing seats") feels voice-motivated rather than imposed. No head-hopping. The woman's gesture with the hourglass and the old man's passes are shown through Eli's lens without emotional ventriloquism. Minor: "permanent transient" in the penultimate paragraph risks over-articulating the theme, but it reads as Eli's thought rather than authorial intrusion.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully ("The horn blew, low and ancient, and the city lights drew backward like a curtain"). Information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs. Minor loop: "He stepped out on deck, resiliently positive despite..." and "Even when no one laughed, he kept talking" restate his cheerfulness without added pressure. Figurative language is controlled and legible ("fog...thickening not from water but from unsaid possibilities"). No filter-verb stacks or template cadence in peak beats. Proofreading is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The vanishing commuter ferry premise is familiar from speculative templates, but the piece transforms it through the radio's braided melody, the hourglass keeping time with emptiness, and the grotto revealing all journeys at once. These specifics feel earned rather than ornamental. The final choice—selecting home from overlapping possibilities—avoids the typical rescue-all resolution and commits to a singular stance. Risk-taking in the dense figurative texture and the open question of what "home" means heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Eli's decision to tune the radio and hum the melody drives the grotto's appearance, and his final choice—"He chose home"—is the closure beat. Present in setup (scrubbing deck, record-keeping), middle (humming, tuning radio), and ending. However, the choice itself lacks visible cost or tactical constraint; it reads more as thematic capstone than a decision that forecloses a path. Two distinct beats (radio tuning, final choice) and closure linkage justify mid-6s, but swappability and low cost prevent higher placement.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The empty hourglass appears twice: the woman carries it at the opening, then lifts it during the climax, revealing it "kept perfect time with Eli's humming." This reprise reweights the object's meaning—emptiness as a form of measure. However, the hourglass does not constrain Eli's choices or alter tactics; it functions as a charged image rather than a causal lever. Present in setup (wrapped in velvet), middle (lifted), and ending (timing the ungrains). Lyric resonance and two beats justify ~6.1, but lack of causal pressure caps further ascent.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The vanishing commuter ferry is the story's engine: it shapes Eli's seven-hundred-ride record, his belief he can steer disappearances, and the grotto's appearance as an alternate crossing. The ferry's dissolution "halfway across the bay, scattering its passengers into other mornings" is the problem Eli attempts to solve. Present in setup (Harbor Line 7's routine), middle (fog and stars slipping sideways), and ending (overlapping ferries in the grotto). The concept drives stakes and tactics on every page, with visible cost in Eli's obsessive study and the final choice.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Resiliently positive" is shown through Eli's quiet jokes, his humming under pressure, and his belief that "hope needed practice." However, the attribute does not constrain a choice with visible cost; his positivity enables the melody-humming but does not force a tradeoff or forfeiture. Present in setup (jokes that "fall like coins into a deep well"), middle (humming despite tingling teeth), but only lightly pressured at closure. Demonstrated rather than labeled, but lacks the friction that would lift it above mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The radio is central: Eli hears patterns in the static, tunes the dial to isolate the melody, and later runs to the radio to "aim the note at that absence." The melody triggers the ferry's shift into the grotto. Present in setup (wheelhouse static), middle (tuning and humming), and ending (choosing the single clear note). Two distinct beats and closure participation. The radio's mechanics—braided song, interconnected patterns—shape Eli's tactics and the grotto's opening. High irreplaceability: removing the radio would collapse the story's causal spine.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Via interconnected patterns" is signaled early (radio static as "braided" melody, "patterns of tone and silence") and returns at the climax when Eli tunes "through the statics braided song toward a single clear note." The method matters: the braided melody is the mechanism by which the ferry shifts tracks. Present in setup, middle (melody's description), and ending (tuning to a clear note). However, the mechanics remain somewhat abstract; we see the pattern but not how it functionally alters the ferry's state. Two beats and closure linkage justify mid-6s; vagueness in causal mechanics prevents higher placement.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The spectral grotto appears at the climax, offering "a low arch of rock...where no land had ever been," its walls glowing with "subway routes, nerve fibers, and constellations overlain." Inside, Eli sees overlapping ferries and chooses home. The grotto is the setting where all timelines converge, directly enabling the final choice. Present in middle (opening ahead) and ending (interior with reflections). The grotto's specific properties—overlapping journeys, mapped glow—charge the closure image. Missing from setup but strong closure participation and irreplaceability justify mid-7s.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"When clocks run sideways" bookends the story (opening and midpoint: "This was the moment...when clocks run sideways"), signaling temporal distortion. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions or create a live deadline; it functions more as atmospheric marker than constraint. Present in setup and middle but does not alter tactics or pressure at closure. The phrase is evocative but largely ornamental; removing it would not break the story's logic. Lyric reprise and thematic coherence justify low-5s, but lack of causal pressure caps further ascent.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Eli's desire "to merge parallel timelines instead of merely bouncing between them" is stated midway and drives his final choice in the grotto. The motivation is signaled (his years of study, belief he can steer), tested (humming the melody, tuning the radio), and resolved (choosing home from overlapping ferries). However, the desire is told more than dramatized; we do not see friction between this want and a competing cost or fear. Present in middle (articulated belief) and ending (choice). One strong beat and closure linkage justify low-7s; lack of on-page conflict between wants prevents higher placement.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Permanent transient" is articulated once near the ending ("their lives plaited, permanent transient") and resonates with the story's tension between the ferry's dissolution and Eli's hope for lasting connection. Tone is coherent: lyric, wistful, charged with quiet urgency. The phrase appears late but reweights the dominant stake—impermanence versus home. However, it risks over-articulating theme rather than letting the final image carry it. Present in ending and modulates with pressure (calm opening, intensifying fog, crystallized choice). Closure linkage and thematic charge justify mid-6s; late articulation and slight over-statement prevent higher placement.</comment>
