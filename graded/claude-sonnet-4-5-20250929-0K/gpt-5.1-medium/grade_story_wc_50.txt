<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The locksmith's interiority shows some specificity ("peripherally focused, more attuned to hints and afterimages") but much of the motivation lives in reflective summary rather than embodied choice under pressure. The commissioner's backstory and the locksmith's past are told rather than dramatized through present action. The ending choice to restore the timer reads more as completion of a task than a decision that forecloses a path with visible cost; the locksmith's values and contradictions never sharply collide on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (locksmith, cavern, tonight) arrive early. The piece accumulates detail and cadence around the timer repair, culminating in a moment where the restored device "held echoes and the angles by which to find them again"—a Resonant Reconfiguration that reweights wonder. Cost is oblique: the locksmith's effort and the questions he asks are implied sacrifices, but no sharp before/after in his situation or options is legible on the page. One meaningful deepening is present (the realization that the device was "built to keep wonder close"), satisfying the length expectation, though the final cost could be sharper.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The marble cavern, spiral stairs, mineral veins, and the timer as tool are vividly rendered with sensory specificity (moist air, tang of iron, lantern light fracturing). The mirrors and chalk lines ground the locksmith's process in spatial choreography. The cavern subtly charges the final image: "the silence felt crowded, softly luminous." Micro-setting (the timer mechanism, mirrors, polished floor) constrains the locksmith's method and participates in closure, meeting the 9+ gate threshold.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—restore the timer to store wonder for a wounded season—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure remains coherent but does not meaningfully tighten options; the locksmith proceeds methodically without a live risk of failure or a forced trade-off. The final act (winding the new spring, adding mirrors) feels like completion rather than a choice that narrows paths. Cost at closure is conceptual (the city's thinning memory) but not viscerally felt as a price the locksmith pays on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—wonder arriving sideways, the art of peripheral attention—emerges through the locksmith's process and the recurring idea that "wonder was shy" and "could not bear a stare." The piece resists overt moralizing and invites reflection through image (mirrors, echoes, angles). The final realization that the timer "held echoes and the angles by which to find them again" offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question about storing awe. Minor drag: some reflective passages approach abstraction ("memory passed through its streets without catching") without anchoring in a sharply particular image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Single-POV distance is stable; the locksmith's perceptual signature (peripheral focus, sensing "hints and afterimages") is established and colors the narration. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("geometric hush," "a spiral of glancing awareness") that feels slightly external to a working locksmith's idiom under pressure. No dialogue to evaluate. Free indirect style is clean, and the voice modulates purposefully with the locksmith's shifts in attention, though a few lines read as authorial commentary rather than character-specific perception.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and many lines carry vivid sensory detail, but several beats loop or paraphrase: "He came to the cavern to reverse-engineer not just the timer, but time itself" restates the project's stakes without adding pressure; "Each word struck the stone and bounced, overlapping with the soft ticking" and the subsequent line about hearing "the angles themselves" recycle the same event. Template cadence appears in runs like "He set…then unpacked…He began…First he…" Figurative density is high but occasionally mixed: "a harvest of echoes" competes with "reservoir of sounds" and "droplet of echo," muddling the metaphor vehicle. Apply −0.6 for paraphrase loops and template stems, plus −0.3 for mixed metaphors, totaling −0.9 within the Non-closure Accumulation Cap.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of locksmith-as-restorer-of-wonder with a device that "gathers the sound of moments" is fresh and specific. The peripherally focused locksmith whose art involves sensing "what a door remembered" offers a non-obvious angle on memory and attention. The premise reads slightly derivative of steampunk-adjacent "lost mechanical art" templates but is transformed through the locksmith's particular process (mirrors, reflection angles, peripheral vision). Risk-taking in structure (accumulative design, lyric density) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; +0.3 within band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The reflective locksmith is present throughout, frames the narrative, and makes the choice to restore the timer. He appears in setup (descent into the cavern), development (studying angles, adjusting mirrors), and closure (restoring the device, feeling the "crowded" silence). His trait of peripheral focus informs his method but does not force a visible trade-off or constrain a choice with cost. The restoration proceeds without friction; no moment where his reflective nature forecloses an option or creates a price. Two gates (setup, closure) met; development present but not causal. Band: 5.0–6.9. No strong causal pressure or cost tied to character; score mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The broken timer mechanism is introduced early (carried "like a wounded bird"), handled in multiple beats (unpacking, exposing the broken spring, adding the mirror, winding the new spring), and returns at closure ("the restored timer held echoes"). Its broken state drives the locksmith's goal; its restoration is the resolution. The object shapes at least two beats and contributes to the ending's charge. Band: 7.0–8.4. Strong causal role and closure linkage; +0.9 for two beats, +0.7 for closure linkage, +0.5 for causal pressure. No visible cost tied uniquely to the object itself (the locksmith's effort is general); score high within band but below indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The core concept "harvest of echoes" appears in setup ("a tiny harvest of echoes"), shapes the locksmith's method (capturing echoes via reflection angles), and returns at closure ("the timer held echoes and the angles by which to find them again"). It frames the dominant stake but does not constrain a live on-page choice with cost—the locksmith's process unfolds without friction. Two gates met (setup, closure); causal pressure is moderate. Lyric reprise reweights the stake. Band: 5.0–6.9, upper edge via reprise and thematic charge.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The attribute "peripherally focused" is introduced early ("The locksmith had always been peripherally focused"), informs his approach (trusting "the corners of his vision," avoiding direct stares), and appears at closure ("he kept his gaze askew"). It enables his method but does not force a visible trade-off or constrain a choice with cost on the page. No moment where peripheral focus forecloses an option or creates friction. Two gates (setup, closure); development present but not causal. Band: 5.0–6.9, lower-mid.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The action "reverse-engineer" is stated early ("He had come to the cavern to reverse-engineer not just the timer, but time itself"), guides the locksmith's method (studying reflection angles, mapping echoes), and culminates in the restoration. It shapes the middle beats (adjusting mirrors, exposing the spring) and the ending (winding the new spring, restoring the device). Three gates met. Causal pressure is moderate; the action is essential to the plot but somewhat abstract and could be rephrased as "repair" or "restore" without large structural loss. Band: 5.0–6.9, upper edge for three gates and causal role.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The method "studying reflection angles at different times" is introduced in the first third ("studying reflection angles at different times, marking chalk lines"), guides the locksmith's process (adjusting mirrors, fracturing lantern light), and participates in closure (the mirrors on the wheel catch the lantern, "flinging fragments of light"). It shapes at least two beats. Three gates met. Causal pressure is moderate; the method is specific and not easily swappable, but the mechanics do not force a trade-off or create friction. Band: 5.0–6.9, entry to upper edge.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The marble cavern is introduced early (descent, moist air, mineral veins), provides resources (polished floor, scarred walls that catch echoes), and charges the final image ("the cavern answered with a low resonance"; "the silence felt crowded"). The setting constrains the locksmith's method (he uses the cavern's acoustics and surfaces) and contributes to closure. Three gates met; setting shapes two beats and the ending. Band: 7.0–8.4, lower-mid for clear causal role and closure linkage without indispensability.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The timeframe "across the lull of a wounded season" is mentioned late (well past the 40% mark: "Now, alone beneath the observatory, he understood that the wounded season was not just weather but time itself"). It appears in thematic reflection but does not tighten decisions or tactics on the page; the locksmith's process unfolds in a single continuous scene with no live clock. Missing setup gate; late arrival; cap 4.6. Ornamental use adds −0.3. Band: 3.0–4.9, upper edge.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The motivation "to store wonder in the cellar of reason, for later" is introduced via the commissioner's request ("She needed him to restore the device, to store wonder in the cellar of reason, for later"), guides the locksmith's goal, and participates in closure (the restored timer "held echoes and the angles by which to find them again"). The locksmith's desire is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choice; he proceeds methodically without on-page friction between want and cost. Two gates (setup, closure); development present but not causal. Band: 5.0–6.9, mid.</comment>
