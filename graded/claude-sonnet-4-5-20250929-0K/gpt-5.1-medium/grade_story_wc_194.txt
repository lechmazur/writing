<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Aurel's interiority is grounded in concrete action—turning the crank, adjusting the needle—and his motivation (seeking the hidden truth behind the collapse) drives the scene's choices. The contradictory impulses are present but somewhat muted: his simultaneous custodianship and search for agency appears more in summary than in embodied conflict. Mara exists only in reflection without applying direct pressure, and the queen's voice arrives as discovery rather than antagonist. The final moment where he "pictures standing waves" and "felt the way a tiny crest of possibility could topple a whole, brittle pattern" edges toward abstraction rather than a visceral choice with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors quickly (Aurel, Palatine Library, evening, seeking hidden truth). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density increases through layered memories, Mara's physics, and finally the queen's recorded voice, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing when the ring's placement and standing-wave metaphor reweight the dynasty's collapse. The closure image—"a tiny crest of possibility could topple a whole, brittle pattern"—lands with conceptual cost (the collapse was internal, not external force), though the felt price remains oblique. One meaningful deepening occurs when the voice emerges and recontextualizes all prior material.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The sepia reading room is vividly rendered—dust as "mute constellations," tables "the color of old tea"—and the gramophone on its wheeled cart functions as both tool and spatial anchor. The setting constrains Aurel's method (he smuggles equipment piece by piece, adjusts the needle above bare metal) and charges the final image when the room's acoustic properties become the medium for historical recovery. Evening light and golden shadows modulate with the emerging voice, creating a coherent sensory envelope that tightens rather than decorates.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—uncovering why the dynasty collapsed without violence—is signaled early and drives Aurel's escalating actions: locating the crank, assembling the amplifier, adjusting the needle, letting his body become an antenna. The tightening comes when the queen's voice falls through the noise and reframes the abdication as surrender to "the silence already in their hearts," narrowing Aurel's understanding and foreclosing the myth of external betrayal. The cost is conceptual (his role as executor was symptom, not cause) but the felt price—his custodianship of ghosts now burdened with this knowledge—could be sharper on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the sustained metaphor of sound as persistence: standing waves, the gramophone without a record, voices that linger in wood and stone. The queen's line "lines are drawn by hands that tremble before they break" and the image of the ring concentrating a decision anchor the thematic question—how collapse accumulates invisibly—without moralizing. The final image (standing waves curling along the table, a crest toppling a brittle pattern) reweights the premise by locating agency in micro-gestures rather than grand betrayals, offering a resonant answer rooted in particulars. Mara's equations and the "bridge of intuition" risk abstraction but remain tied to concrete action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Aurel; perceptual signature is strong (he notices acoustic details, physical resistance in the crank, the "trembling air between people"). The prose has distinct texture—"yawn of evening," "metal flower," "eloquently silent"—and diction matches the reflective historian's idiom. The queen's dialogue ("We surrender not to the council…") carries period formality and subtext. Psychic distance tightens appropriately when the voice emerges. One brief filter stack ("he pictured… felt the way") in the final paragraph slightly dulls immediacy at a peak beat, preventing higher scoring.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Information density is high: most sentences advance setting, memory, or action. Rhythm varies purposefully, slowing for reflection and quickening as the voice emerges. The final paragraph risks overwriting with stacked metaphors ("bloomed in his mind… curling along the table… crest of possibility") and slight paraphrase when "concentrate a decision" and "topple a whole, brittle pattern" restate theme. The "bridge of intuition" motif threads through but edges toward abstraction in the closing lines. No major loops or scaffolding, but figurative language clusters in the closure beat without full clarity on the causal mechanism.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The premise—recovering lost sound through standing waves and treating a room as a record—is specific and fresh, avoiding template historical-investigation arcs. The synthesis of physics, historiography, and personal reckoning feels earned. The emotional core (custodian seeking agency) transforms a familiar archetype through the technical constraint and the conceptual turn that collapse was internal. The queen's voice and the ring as focal point offer a non-obvious inflection. Risk-taking in the experimental method (no actual record, body as antenna) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, meriting a within-band lift of +0.3.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Aurel's identity as "dynasty ender" frames expectation early and returns in the closure when he realizes the collapse was internal, reweighting his custodianship. He makes key choices (assembling the device, adjusting the needle, closing his eyes to listen), and the final recognition alters his understanding. Present across setup, middle choice (turning the crank), and ending (picturing the standing waves). The element shapes two beats and charges the closure, though the cost is conceptual rather than visceral on the page. Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, cost connection +0.3; late conceptual rather than embodied cost −0.3. Base 3.0 + 2.4 = 5.4, round down to 5.4; closure reweighting adds +0.4 within band = 5.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The crank handle is touched in two distinct beats: Aurel searches for it on the side table and then fits it into the socket and turns it, feeling "the resistant weight of old grease and stiffened springs." The object enables the central action (starting the gramophone) and its physical resistance grounds Aurel's effort. Present in setup (search), middle (use), but only implicitly in the ending (the device is running). Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, causal pressure (enables core action) +0.8; no explicit closure reprise −0.4. Base 3.0 + 1.8 = 4.8; specific tactile detail and irreplaceability (the exact handle for this machine) +0.6, round to 5.4; purposeful early-middle arc adds +0.5 within band = 5.9, adjusted to 6.9 for tight causal link and embodied handling across beats.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The "bridge of intuition" appears late (final third) when Aurel closes his eyes and "let his body become the antenna… the air itself became a bridge of intuition." It names the method of accessing the past but does not constrain earlier choices or alter tactics; the concept is asserted rather than dramatized through friction. Mentioned thematically in the ending but not causally active. Late first appearance (final third) −0.8, ornamental/label use −0.7, no middle development (missing gate) caps at 3.4. Base 3.0 + closure mention +0.4 = 3.4; thematic echo without cost keeps it mid-band = 4.2.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Eloquently silent" is applied to Aurel early ("eloquently silent, his hands pressed flat") and returns to describe the queen in her portrait ("eloquently silent in her final portrait"). The trait shapes Aurel's approach—he listens rather than speaks, seeking what silence holds—and the queen's recorded voice breaks her silence with meaning. Present in setup and thematically in the ending. The attribute constrains one choice (listening as method) but the cost is implicit. Early signal +0.5, one beat +0.4, closure linkage (queen's silence reweighted) +0.8, swappability (could be "taciturn" or "reserved") −0.5. Base 3.0 + 1.2 = 4.2; lyric reprise reweights stake +0.6 = 4.8, adjusted to 5.1 for coherent thematic through-line.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The action "muse" is present in the early reflection when Mara "had once mused" about standing waves. It primes the method but does not create a dramatic turn; Aurel enacts Mara's idea rather than musing himself. The musing is backstory exposition that enables the present action but is not itself a pivot. Present in setup, informs middle choice, but off-stage and summary-only. Early signal +0.4, summary-only −0.6, swappable (could be "theorized" or "speculated") −0.5. Base 3.0 − 0.7 = 2.3; primes core method +0.5 = 2.8, adjusted to 3.8 for enabling Aurel's plan even if not dramatized as peak beat.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Through standing waves" is signaled early when Mara explains the physics and Aurel writes it down. The method shapes his entire approach: adjusting the needle above bare metal, using the amplifier, letting the room's acoustic properties become the medium. The mechanics matter—he must feel the vibrations, let his body become an antenna—and the final image ("standing waves curling along the table") completes the method. Early signal +0.7, two beats (assembly, final realization) +0.9, causal pressure (method enables discovery) +1.2, closure linkage +1.0, specificity (unique physics premise) +0.6. Base 3.0 + 4.4 = 7.4; slight abstraction in final execution −0.3 = 7.1, adjusted down to 6.4 due to method's physical realization remaining somewhat metaphorical rather than fully dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The sepia reading room anchors the entire scene: its acoustic properties enable the standing-wave method, the gramophone cart is positioned near windows, dust and lamplight create the sensory envelope, and the oak tables become the medium where sound lingers. The setting pressures Aurel's choices (he must work in this specific space with its history) and charges the final image when the room itself becomes the record. Early signal +0.8, three beats (arrival, setup, final realization) +1.4, causal pressure (only this room holds the sound) +1.4, closure linkage (room as archive) +1.2, irreplaceability +0.7. Base 3.0 + 5.5 = 8.5; vivid embodiment and tactical constraint sustain high score, adjusted to 7.8 for balance within the element set.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"In the first yawn of evening" anchors the opening and the golden light modulates through the scene, but the timeframe does not tighten decisions or create a live clock. Evening provides atmosphere but Aurel's search could occur at any hour without altering stakes. Present in setup and as ambient tone, but no middle urgency or closure pressure from time. Early signal +0.5, ornamental (postcard time-of-day) −0.6, no middle development (missing gate) caps at 3.4. Base 3.0 + tone coherence +0.4 = 3.4; lyric contribution to atmosphere +0.6 = 4.0, adjusted to 4.6 for tonal consistency even without tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The motivation "to uncover a hidden truth" is stated early ("Tonight he had returned for one reason… to uncover a hidden truth") and drives every choice: locating the crank, assembling the device, adjusting the needle, listening. The desire is dramatized through action and friction (he suspects sound lingers, despite official erasure). The truth lands in the queen's voice and the conceptual cost (his role reframed). Early signal +0.7, three beats (preparation, activation, discovery) +1.4, causal pressure (all choices serve this goal) +1.3, closure linkage (truth found reweights his identity) +1.0, cost connection +0.4. Base 3.0 + 4.8 = 7.8; slight abstraction ("simple and impossible as breath") −0.3 = 7.5, adjusted to 7.2 for strong integration across the arc.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Golden shadows" is introduced early ("the city's bricks exhaled the day's heat into golden shadows") and recurs as sensory texture ("dust hung like mute constellations in the lamplight"). Tone is warm, elegiac, and consistent through the scene, modulating when the voice emerges into a more somber register. The tone charges the final image by framing the collapse as quiet decay rather than violent rupture. Early signal +0.6, coherent modulation +0.8, closure linkage (tone supports conceptual repricing) +0.9. Base 3.0 + 2.3 = 5.3; purposeful atmospheric control and thematic fit +0.8 = 6.1, adjusted to 6.6 for sustained tonal integrity that deepens rather than decorates.</comment>
