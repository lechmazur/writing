<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The registrar's motivation is concrete and embodied—curiosity as "patient parasite," mistrust that "pressed her thoughts flat." Internal contradiction operates in scene: she follows regulations yet unlocks forbidden tech, stays hidden yet walks toward the stranger. The final choice feels earned by the accumulation of shared isolation. Minor slip: the hooded figure's interiority is asserted rather than inferred at the end ("eyes shining with unshed storms").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story teaches its pattern early (lyric compression, image recurrence) and sustains it. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the registrar's silence becomes legible intention, crystallizing options with felt cost—years of flattened selfhood cracking. Orientation anchors arrive by the third paragraph (registrar, archive hall, post-language city). The lens holds; cost is visible in "mistrust cracked like thin ice."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The crystal forecourt recurs as spatial anchor and constrains the final choice: the registrar must leave the archive to meet the stranger there. Sensory detail is selective and voice-filtered ("mist braided with lamps," "moisture translated music into silver"). The lens from the projector functions as micro-setting, altering tactics (revealing hidden drawings). The forecourt charges the closure image, making the ending dependent on this exact location.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—connection across mistrust—is signaled early and tightens through accumulation: contraband tickets, archival eavesdropping, recognition of self in the hooded figure. One meaningful deepening: the registrar moves from passive cataloging to active approach. Agency is clear in the walk toward the stranger; the cost is foreclosure of her hidden life. Escalation operates through density increase and cadence shift, consistent with the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—transparency as thaw for mistrust—emerges through particulars: the lens revealing hidden marks, the registrar's years of silence, the shared refusal of the mindfield. The ending offers a resonant answer without moralizing: trust forms not through words but through shared paper and embodied risk. The concert tickets shift from contraband to passport. No thematic echo or prompt-language intrusion; the final image reweights prior material with precision.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with consistent perceptual signature: the registrar notices "resonant hush," "shimmering glyphs," details filtered through her archivist lens. Psychic distance modulates purposefully at the end, tightening to her intention. Minor slip: "their mistrust cracked" in the final line asserts joint interiority not fully earned on the page. Diction is controlled and voice-motivated throughout; no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally; figurative language is dense but mostly coherent ("curiosity burrowed like a patient parasite," "mistrust cracked like thin ice"). Information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs. Two friction points: "doodles were ambiguously clear" is self-contradictory without clarifying payoff, and "swept thunder" (paragraph 2) strains sense. No loops or scaffold; propulsion is consistent. Overwriting in the opening third does not obscure closure but adds −0.3 for density without full pattern-teaching.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The premise—post-verbal society with analog archivist—is fresh and committed. The lens-as-tool, tickets-as-cryptic-speech, and shared isolation synthesize into a coherent vision. Risk-taking in the lyric compression and withheld confrontation heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Minor derivativeness: the "language died, one person still uses it" frame echoes familiar templates, though execution is specific. Transformation test passes: plot and arc depend on these exact choices.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Setup: present in opening paragraph. Development: her choice to investigate tickets (middle) and unlock the projector alters tactics. Payoff: her walk toward the stranger is the climactic decision. The registrar's choices create all major turns. Cost is tied to her role: leaving the archive exposes her. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage; irreplaceability is high.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Setup: introduced mid-story when she unlocks the projector. Development: used to reveal hidden UV drawings, altering her understanding and tactics. Payoff: offered as "passport" in the final beat, charging the closure. Three distinct beats; causal pressure is clear; irreplaceability is strong (no other object performs this function). Cost: her secret method becomes shared vulnerability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Setup: implied by the contrast between mindfield and registrar's notebook. Development: the concept shapes her recognition of the hooded figure's mistrust. Payoff: "freed by honesty alone" appears in the final paragraph, reweighting the encounter. Two-of-three gates met (development, payoff). The concept constrains one choice (approach) but is partly asserted rather than fully dramatized. Lyric reprise lifts it into mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Setup: "ambiguously clear" describes the doodles early. Development: the trait enables the dual function of the tickets (camouflage and confession). Payoff: cameo mention in final line ("shared silence"). Two gates met (setup, development). The attribute enables one tactic but its mechanics remain abstract; swappability is moderate. Functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Setup: foreshadowed when she receives contraband. Development: "eavesdrop on a concert that had already happened" drives the archive search and her discovery of the hooded figure. Payoff: the eavesdropping leads directly to her decision to attend the next concert. Three gates met; causal pressure is strong. The action redefines her options and tactics. Cost: she must leave her safe role.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Setup: tickets introduced in the intake scene. Development: the doodles are decoded via the lens, revealing spatial patterns and the hooded figure's isolation. Payoff: new tickets exchanged at the end. Three gates; the method shapes two major beats and the closure. Specificity is high (no other method performs this function). Cost: shared cryptography becomes shared vulnerability.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Setup: named and described in opening paragraphs. Development: concert footage reveals the hooded figure's presence there. Payoff: the registrar meets the stranger at the forecourt during the next concert. Three gates; the location constrains the final choice (she must leave the archive to reach it). The forecourt's rain and crystals charge the closure image. Micro-setting (archive hall) also functions as pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Setup: established in paragraph 4 ("the hour after words become unnecessary"). Development: the timeframe motivates the mindfield culture and the registrar's isolation. Payoff: the post-verbal norm frames the final exchange ("no sound came; still, her intention rang"). Three gates met, but the timeframe does not tighten tactics or create a live clock. Thematic integration is present; causal pressure is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Setup: implied by her notebook and isolation; made explicit when she sees herself in the hooded figure ("desire to thaw mistrust with transparency"). Development: the motivation drives her archive search and her decision to approach. Payoff: enacted in the final beat ("freed by honesty alone"). Three gates; the motivation shapes two major choices and the closure. Visible cost: exposure after years of secrecy.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Setup: established in the opening lines ("resonant hush that always waited"). Development: tone modulates with the registrar's curiosity and recognition, remaining hushed yet charged. Payoff: "surrounding minds quietly listened" in the final line reprises the resonant hush, now inclusive rather than isolating. The tone charges the final image, reweighting silence from mistrust to shared understanding. Coherent through all turns.</comment>
