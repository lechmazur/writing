<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The shepherd's interior life is vivid and contradictory—he tends mechanisms he "no longer quite believed in" yet pursits a metaphysical question about time's nature through concrete observation. His final choice to turn away from the key is earned by the counting-backwards sequence that reframes his understanding of the clocks' true function. Embodied perception is strong ("the sound he trusted more than any ticking"), and the refusal to use the key forecloses a path with visible cost. Minor: the dreams of "seconds with razor edges" lean slightly toward abstraction without fully grounding their pressure in present action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with Conceptual Repricing at closure. Orientation anchors cleanly (dawn, fjord, station roof), and the piece teaches its lyric-meditative pattern early. The counting-backwards passage deepens pressure by reweighting what the clocks measure, and the final refusal lands as Earned Stasis with conceptual cost made legible: "to open a refusal, to unlock the willingness to be misled." The key's function as metaphor—winding gear versus turning hesitation—reconfigures the premise. One structural seam: the shift from roof observation to introspection back to roof could signal its hinge more clearly for full 8.5+ eligibility.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The station's physical particulars—brass pipes, water bowls, valves, horizon instruments—supply both constraint and metaphor without becoming ornamental. "The station from far above, its roofs and gutters arranged like the face of a dismantled clock" charges the closure image by transforming setting into thematic architecture. Sensory selection (salt-furred walls, wind "like water in pipes") filters through the shepherd's professional attention. The parapet where he sets the key down is both spatial anchor and symbolic threshold, satisfying the Q3 9+ gate of environment shaping the final choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—understanding what clocks truly measure—is signaled early and tightens through the counting sequence, which narrows his interpretive options from "disciplined dripping" to recognition of "the rate at which attention surrendered." The key discovery three weeks prior and its absence from any station mechanism create a secondary pressure thread. The final renunciation (setting the key down, turning away) forecloses the path toward regularized obedience with felt cost. Escalation is primarily conceptual rather than event-driven, fitting the Accumulative lens, but one more micro-choice in the middle third would cement high-band entry.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges concretely: clocks measure not time but "the rate at which attention surrendered, notch by notch, to patterns it could no longer argue with." The mantle key's final reframing—it unlocks "the willingness to be misled"—answers the thematic question without stating a moral. The razor-edged seconds and "flock of obedient illusions" motifs accumulate and reweight prior material. The ending offers a resonant image (unwinding sea as counter to mechanical regularity) that invites reflection without abstraction. No thematic echo or sermonizing; the shepherd's insight is earned through embodied perception and the counting ritual.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct and sustained: "water thinking about falling," "air around it had razor edges," "questions that had brought him here would evaporate like mist." Diction remains consistent with a solitary technician given to metaphysical speculation. Psychic distance modulates purposefully—close during the counting sequence, pulling back for the overhead vision. A few filter verbs ("he felt as if," "he sensed") are voice-appropriate. Minor: "officially...but secretly" in paragraph seven reads slightly expository, though it establishes motive efficiently. No head-hopping; POV stays clean throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies well ("Sixty, fifty-nine, fifty-eight; each number felt like a rung..."), and figurative language is dense but mostly coherent. Two slips touch the high-pressure closure zone: "slash of water in pipes" (likely intended "hush," which appears later) creates brief confusion, and "they did not measure time itself but the rate at which attention surrendered" borders on abstract thesis-statement rather than image. The horizon's "soft-failed place" is evocative but the modifier stack in "with the uneasy sense that what he shepherded was not time but a flock of obedient illusions" flattens momentum slightly. No loops or scaffold; information density is high. Penalizing for density near closure per the overwriting check.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of hydraulic timekeeping, metaphysical inquiry, and Earned Stasis through refusal is specific and non-obvious. The mantle key's reframing from mechanical object to conceptual tool ("to turn a hesitation") transforms a familiar trope. The counting-backwards method as a cognitive instrument for dismantling clock logic feels fresh. Minor limitation: the "water clocks that regulated coastal sirens" premise, while well-executed, echoes steampunk/literary-surrealism templates without fully breaking free. Risk-taking in the meditative structure and the quiet ending elevates within band (+0.3).</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The hydraulic clock shepherd appears in setup, drives the counting-backwards sequence (middle beat), and makes the final refusal (closure). His occupational lens shapes all perception and the choice to "listen to the unwinding sea" rather than use the key is causally earned by his realization. Three gates satisfied; causal pressure and closure linkage strong; visible cost (foreclosing regularization) present.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The mantle clock key is found three weeks prior (backstory anchor), examined on the roof (setup/middle), and set down at closure with reweighted meaning—it "was not meant to wind a gear but to turn a hesitation." Three beats, closure participation, and specificity (single tooth, rusted to pipe, no matching lock) make it irreplaceable. Strong causal pressure and cost connection.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Razor edges" appears in dreams ("seconds with razor edges"), the station shimmering "as if the air around it had razor edges," and the horizon's "newly cut" facets. Two distinct beats plus closure-adjacent imagery. It shapes perception and charges the final recognition but does not directly constrain a tactical choice. Mid-high integration; lyric reprise with thematic weight but no plot-level cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Eminently peculiar" is noted once in paragraph six as a character observation about his title. No further use; does not constrain or enable any action. Present but ornamental. Cap at 4.6 for missing middle development and closure participation; actual score lower due to single mention without causal work.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The squint action appears late (paragraph twenty-nine) but is causally pivotal: "He let his eyes squint at the line of the horizon, not to sharpen it but to see where it failed." This precipitates the core insight about clocks hiding measurement of attention-surrender. One strong beat with closure linkage and conceptual cost. Late penalty (−0.4) and swappability concern (could be another perceptual verb) limit score, but transformation of prior material is undeniable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Counting backwards is signaled in paragraph twenty-one, executed in paragraphs twenty-two to twenty-six (the descent into negative numbers and the overhead vision), and its result—"the familiar map of minutes dissolved"—directly enables the final insight. Two beats (ritual execution and vision), causal pressure (the method reframes his understanding), and closure linkage (insight leads to refusal). Mechanics matter and shape the outcome; highly specific.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The horizon measurement station appears in title and opening, supplies the roof platform and parapet for key actions, and its "dismantled clock" architecture charges the closure vision. The instruments, water bowls, brass pipes, and valves are not merely described—they enable his work and become the metaphor he deconstructs. Three gates, strong causal pressure (environment = the thesis he resists), and closure charge. Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"After blowing the whistle that signaled the end of the night watch" anchors the timeframe in paragraph nine and creates a boundary (duty vs. inquiry). The dawn progression tracks loosely ("first light," "whitening sky") but elapsed time is not pressuring decisions beat-by-beat. Setup gate satisfied, mild middle presence (dawn = ritual window), weak closure participation. Functional but replaceable with another temporal marker.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The motivation "to understand what clocks really measure, and whether time was one of those things" is stated in paragraph eight and dramatized through the counting ritual, the key examination, and the final refusal. It drives all three structural beats, creates friction (official duty vs. secret inquiry), and the closure insight answers the question with visible cost (he turns away from regularization). Setup, development, payoff all strong; highly specific and irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Fjord quiet just before dawn" opens the piece and establishes a meditative, spare tone sustained through controlled syntax and sensory restraint. Tone modulates subtly during the counting sequence (becomes more visionary) and returns to stillness at closure ("listened to the unwinding sea"). Coherent across turns, charges the final image with contemplative weight, and supports the Accumulative lens. Strong integration; not quite indispensable (a different quiet tone could work) but purposeful and effective.</comment>
