<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara is characterized through internal contradiction—she forgives people but not the universe's clumsy paperwork, mistrusts miracles yet completes one—and her bone-setter expertise shapes the climactic choice to guide the boy "bone by bone" into her world's physics. The interiority is concrete and character-particular ("skepticism were housekeeping," "doubt felt almost bearable"), though some passages lean slightly toward label-speak ("shrewdly innocent" applied to both Tomas's tools and the boy risks convergence). The final act of healing is motivated by prior causality and forecloses the path of refusal with visible cost (stepping through "the aching doorway of air"). Minor deduction for the boy's "shrewdly innocent" eyes echoing Tomas's tools, which flattens distinction at a key moment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The story operates under a Causal lens with lyric compression: Mara's suspicion of the substitute body drives her to the garden, the tooth opens a doorway to the displaced boy, and her decision to finish Tomas's work delivers a Decisive Change with visible cost (the substitute body crumbles; doubt becomes "almost bearable"). Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening lines (Mara, her table, after the substitute body is found). The closure lands on the page with felt cost—Mara steps through a fracture in certainty and accepts the role of miracle-worker despite her skepticism—and the lens holds without contradiction. One meaningful tightening occurs when the tooth "tugs" at her fractured certainty, opening the doorway.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The hedge maze and secret garden constrain Mara's access to knowledge (only she and Tomas know the map) and charge the final image: tools, glass instruments, and the breathing tin box ground Tomas's project in tactile detail. The boy's "bones wrong from this world's angle" and the violet sky provide sensory specificity that reflects urgency and otherworldliness. The garden "folding behind me like a closed book" and "dawn snagging on the hedge" are purposeful images that integrate setting into closure. Spatial choreography is clean across moves (table → maze → garden → stone under violet sky → back to garden).</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether Mara will accept doubt and finish Tomas's rescue—is signaled early and tightens when the tooth opens the doorway, forcing a choice between skepticism and action. Agency is clear: Mara's decision to step through and perform the bone-setting forecloses the path of refusal with on-page cost (the garden folds away, the substitute body crumbles). One meaningful reversal occurs when the tooth transforms from artifact to active conduit. Coincidence does not resolve; Mara's skill and choice drive the ending. The cost is legible: she becomes the miracle-worker she mistrusted.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: the substitute body's "too well tuned" stillness versus Tomas's "mismatched rhythms," mistakes as navigable constellations, and doubt as a cleft that becomes a doorway. The changeling tooth and the boy's twisted bones embody the cost of crossing worlds without becoming symbolic conveniences. The ending offers a resonant answer—bone-setting as metaphor for realigning realities—without stating a moral. "Doubt felt almost bearable" reweights the opening's "problem was not death but doubt" with earned ambiguity. No thematic echo or label-speak; the final image ("dawn snagging on the hedge") grounds abstraction in sensory detail.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Mara's perceptual signature is distinct and consistent: she notices scars "like careful handwriting," describes tools as "shrewdly innocent contraptions," and filters everything through a bone-setter's lens ("tendons realign like rearranged sentences"). POV distance is stable; focalization remains locked to Mara's knowledge and inference. The prose rhythm modulates with pressure—compressed during the doorway crossing, expansive in the garden inventory—without obscuring clarity. Minor deduction: "shrewdly innocent" applied to both Tomas's tools and the boy's eyes risks tic repetition, though it reads as intentional echo rather than convergence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Information density is high: most lines advance character, world, or pressure ("belief is lighter to carry than a cleft in certainty"). Sentence openings vary; rhythm accelerates through the garden discovery and slows for the bone-setting. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Minor deduction for slight overwriting in the middle third: "rustled awake inside the garden, a blueprint of nostalgic innovation drawn in the dirt" stacks metaphors without full clarity, and "sky…horizon…scattered stars waiting to be connected" extends the constellation motif past peak efficacy. The closure beat is clean and propulsive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The premise—changeling substitution inverted, with a human trying to retrieve the displaced child—transforms a familiar trope through Mara's bone-setter expertise and Tomas's "absurdly precise" compassion. The tissue-level healing as metaphor for cross-world translation is specific and non-obvious. "Nostalgic innovation" as enacted concept (old tools beside glass instruments, mistakes as constellations) feels earned rather than ornamental. The ending's quiet image (substitute body crumbling into soil, doubt "almost bearable") avoids triumphalism and commits fully to the premise's implications. Risk-taking in voice ("forgiving skeptic," "shrewdly innocent") heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara the "forgiving skeptic" drives every key turn: she rejects the substitute body, follows the secret map, picks up the tooth, steps through the doorway, and performs the bone-setting. Her skepticism creates the doubt that becomes the doorway; her forgiveness enables her to finish Tomas's work. The trait constrains (she cannot simply believe the substitute) and enables (she can forgive the attempt and complete it). Present in setup (opening line), middle (tooth discovery), and closure (bone-setting). Choices alter tactics and outcome; removal would collapse the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The changeling's baby tooth appears in three functional beats: discovery in the breathing tin box (setup), physical handling ("set the tooth on my palm and felt it tug"), and as conduit that opens the doorway (middle/closure participation). It is irreplaceable—its specific property (tethering a mirror child) drives the plot and enables the rescue. The tooth's "impossible warmth" and its tug at "the empty space where my certainty had fractured" give it evolving, charged presence. Removal would break the causality of the doorway and the thematic link to substitution.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"A cleft in certainty" is signaled early ("the real problem was not death but doubt") and shapes Mara's tactics: her refusal to accept the substitute body, her choice to follow the hidden map, and her recognition that the cleft itself becomes a doorway. The concept reweights at closure ("That cleft in certainty widened into a doorway") with on-page cost. It is not merely thematic decoration but an active stake that alters options. However, it remains slightly more metaphorical than physical; the tooth and garden do more causal work. Strong thematic integration with solid participation in the middle turn.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Shrewdly innocent" is attributed twice: to Tomas's glass instruments and to the displaced boy's eyes at the climax. The trait constrains interpretation (instruments "looked like toys until they hummed") and enables trust (the boy "chose to give it on credit"). It appears in setup (garden description) and closure (boy's gaze), but the double application risks dilution. The trait is more atmospheric than mechanically causal—Mara does not make a choice because of shrewdness or innocence but despite their paradox. Functional reprise but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Yearn" drives the major turn: Mara "yearned and dreaded to find" the tin box, Tomas "could not bear the idea of a child mislaid," and the garden's scattered stars wait for "someone still foolish enough to yearn." The verb enables Mara's choice to step through the doorway and charges the closure ("every instinct of bone setting flared"). It appears in setup (implicit in Mara's search), middle (explicit at the garden), and closure (enacted through the healing). The story teaches yearning as a counter to skepticism, making it essential to the protagonist's arc. Swapping it for a neutral verb would flatten the thematic spine.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Bone-setting is signaled in the opening line ("Mara the village bone setter") and its mechanics shape the climax: "Bone by bone I guided him into the physics of my world, feeling tendons realign like rearranged sentences." The method is irreplaceable—only Mara's specific expertise enables the rescue, and the tissue-level metaphor (realigning cross-world anatomies) is the story's conceptual engine. It constrains her role (she alone can finish Tomas's work) and charges the final image (substitute body crumbles as the real boy's bones align). Removal would break both the plot and the thematic resonance.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The secret garden is signaled early (Mara follows "the map only Tomas and I knew") and provides the resources (tooth, knowledge of Tomas's plan) that enable the rescue. The hedge maze constrains access (only Mara can navigate it), and the garden's experimental tools ground Tomas's project in physical detail. It appears in setup (framing the search), middle (discovery and inventory), and closure (folds away "like a closed book"). The setting is irreplaceable—removing it would collapse the causality of discovery and the privacy needed for the crossing. Spatial pressure is modest but present.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the substitute body is found" anchors the story and structures its causality: elders sign papers and leave, Mara follows the map, discovers the tooth, and crosses to the boy before "dawn snagging on the hedge." The elapsed time tightens the implied urgency (the boy "breathing shallowly" suggests limited time), though no explicit clock tracks minutes. Setup and closure participation are clear; middle development is implicit rather than dramatized. The frame is functional and shapes sequence but does not impose hard constraints on Mara's choices. Solid integration without indispensability.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"To turn mistakes into constellations" is dramatized through Tomas's garden project and enacted by Mara's choice to complete it. The motivation is signaled in the middle third ("absurdly and precisely, to turn mistakes into constellations, to stitch every misstep into a pattern") and drives the climax (Mara realigns the boy's bones "like rearranged sentences, every correction a star on Tomas's imagined map"). The desire is conflicted—Mara mistrusts miracles yet accepts the cost of performing one—and the metaphor charges the final image. Removal would flatten the thematic spine but leave the rescue plot intact. Strong thematic integration with solid causal participation.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Nostalgic innovation" is coherent across the story: old tools beside glass instruments, hedge mazes that shift seasonally, Tomas's desire to navigate by mistakes. The tone modulates with pressure (wistful in the garden inventory, taut during the crossing, elegiac at closure) and charges the final image ("dawn snagging on the hedge, the substitute body had crumbled into soil"). It is not static but deepens as Mara enacts the tone's paradox—honoring Tomas's vision while transforming it. The tone is purpose-driven and integral to voice, though slightly more atmospheric than mechanically causal. Strong tonal control that supports closure.</comment>
