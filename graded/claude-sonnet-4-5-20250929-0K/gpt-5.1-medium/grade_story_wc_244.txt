<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kenji's motivation (curing loneliness through reciprocity rather than hoarding) is clear and shapes his choice to bring the moon rock to the Exchange. His "desperately jocular" smile and the detail of elbows "gone white from leaning on too many desks" provide embodied specificity. However, his internal experience during the experiment remains largely externalized—we see him "heavier with every truth" but the contradictory impulses and micro-choices under pressure stay abstract. Mara functions more as facilitator than full character; her decisions don't drive turns so much as frame them.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece anchors who/where/when within the opening lines and establishes a Situational lens: Kenji arrives at the Exchange with a dilemma (keep the rock and break reciprocity, or participate in the experiment). The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—"the loneliness shifted from singular to shared"—that reweights his stake without a decisive external act, and the cost (bearing the weight of others' confessions) is felt on the page. The experiment catalyzes connection but does not resolve loneliness, which holds the situational pressure. One friction: the final beat summarizes the shift rather than dramatizing a specific confession or moment that crystallizes it, slightly softening the closure's charge.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The disused railway station is vividly anchored early (ivy, cracked platform, fern through broken tile, benches sanded smooth by waiting) and the setting's recurring motif—objects as stalled prayers on shelves—charges the conceptual frame of reciprocity and circulation. The cracked concrete forming "a crude map of broken rivers" when they place the moon rock is purposeful micro-setting that supports the ritual. However, the station does not constrain a tactical choice or alter an option during the key turn; it serves as atmospheric container rather than active pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Kenji's need to honor reciprocity without curing his own loneliness—is signaled early and remains coherent. The one-by-one confessions deepen the experiment, and the ending reconfigures his loneliness from "singular to shared," which is a meaningful tightening consistent with the Situational lens. Yet the escalation is accumulative rather than pressured by an active choice or reversal; Kenji listens passively, and we don't see a moment where he risks something or trades off competing goods. The cost (feeling heavier) is noted but not dramatized in a choice that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—connection through shared vulnerability, the ethics of not hoarding miracles, loneliness as gravity rather than curable condition—emerges organically from the moon rock's history and the Exchange's rules. The final image ("loneliness shifted from singular to shared") reweights the premise without stating a moral. Mara's line "because loneliness is not a rash; it is more like gravity" risks thesis-statement territory but stays grounded in her character's logistician voice. The story resists tidy resolution and embraces complexity, though one small slip: "polite anarchy" and "rude to physics and reasonable to the heart" lean slightly toward meta-commentary about the story's own method.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Voice is distinctive and controlled: the compression ("politely closed parentheses," "desperate jocular," "statistical improbability"), the dry humor ("because in the rumors you were taller" / "Tonight I am exactly this height"), and the balance of lyricism with concrete detail. Psychic distance remains stable in close third around Kenji. Two frictions: "statistically improbable acquaintances" and "polite anarchy" read slightly authorial rather than Kenji's exact idiom under pressure, and dialogue occasionally tips into epigram ("loneliness is not a rash; it is more like gravity") that feels crafted rather than spoken. No head-hopping, and the perceptual signature (Kenji noticing desks, harmless, confessional weight) is consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully, information density is high, and figurative language (ivy trembling "as if it heard a far train," "smile that apologized before anything bad happened") sharpens rather than obscures. The opening establishes voice and stakes cleanly. Minor artifacts: "technically not supposed to know each other" and "the air around them seemed to lean in" are stock constructions; "his smile was desperately jocular, like a joke told in a hospital corridor" stacks two vehicles for one tenor. The final summary beat ("heavier with every truth, until the loneliness shifted from singular to shared") tells the closure rather than dramatizing a specific moment, which flattens propulsion slightly. No loops or pronoun confusion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis—disaster-relief logistics meeting moon-rock reciprocity at an abandoned station—is specific and non-obvious, and the piece resists template sentiment by refusing a cure for loneliness. The Exchange's mismatched inventory (guitar, server, expired vaccines) and Mara's logistician persona ground the fantastical premise in lived detail. However, the core ritual (confess to a stranger holding an object) is not itself novel, and the ending's shift to "shared loneliness" is emotionally earned but conceptually familiar. The piece's freshness lies in voice and framing rather than a structural or perspectival risk that redefines the premise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mara appears early, explains the Exchange's purpose, proposes the experiment, and frames the ritual at the platform. She makes two key moves: correcting "cure" to acknowledge loneliness as gravity, and declaring the rule that unfinished chains go back into circulation. Her decision to host this particular experiment shapes the plot, but she does not face an on-page dilemma or cost herself—she facilitates rather than transforms. Present in setup, middle, and closure framing, but not causally pressured.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The moon rock is introduced early (locked case, scorched silk, "traded upward through five wars"), handled at the platform's center, and held by Kenji during confessions. Its history—stolen, passed along under oath—embodies the reciprocity concept and charges the experiment's stakes. The rock's properties (dull gray, making ivy tremble) are noted but do not constrain a choice or alter an outcome; it functions as ritual anchor rather than active tool. Present across setup, middle beat, and closure framing, but its meaning does not shift or deepen during the experiment itself.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Reciprocity is named in the title-like "bound by reciprocity" refrain, drives Kenji's motivation (he will not keep the rock for himself), explains the moon rock's chain of custody, and shapes the experiment's structure (confession exchanged for logistical truth). The concept reappears at closure when loneliness shifts from singular to shared, fulfilling the reciprocal exchange. However, the story debates what reciprocity means (gifts, stories, cleaning up) without testing competing definitions in a choice under pressure. Present across all three gates and integral to stakes, but the mechanics remain thematic rather than tactical.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Desperately jocular" appears once as description of Kenji's smile ("like a joke told in a hospital corridor") and colors his tone in dialogue ("because in the rumors you were taller"), but it does not visibly constrain or enable an action with cost. The trait signals his coping style but does not create friction or force a trade-off during the experiment. Label-only use without a beat where the jocular mask fails or costs him connection.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Catalyze" is named explicitly by Mara ("experiments in connection, in risk, in the art of not hoarding miracles") and describes the station's ongoing function. The experiment itself—Kenji holding the moon rock while others confess—catalyzes the shift from singular to shared loneliness. The action is central to the plot's turn and shapes the ending. However, the catalysis is declared and then executed without obstacle or surprise; no competing catalysis or failed attempt tests the method. Present in middle and closure, drives the key beat, but is not put under sufficient pressure to reveal unique necessity.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Improbable rumor chains are mentioned early ("invitations to the Exchange traveled through improbable rumor chains that threaded refugee camps, co working spaces, and late night radio call ins") to explain how Kenji learned of the Exchange and why Mara knows his name. The method colors the world-building and adds texture, but it does not shape an on-page attempt, constrain a choice, or return at closure. Setup only; no development or payoff.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The disused railway station is anchored early with vivid detail (ivy, rust, cracked platform, fern through tile, shelves of mismatched objects) and recurs as the ritual's stage. The cracked concrete "formed a crude map of broken rivers" when they place the moon rock, which is purposeful micro-setting. However, the station does not pressure a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome—it functions as atmospheric container and symbolic backdrop rather than active constraint. Present in setup and closure framing, but does not shape tactics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"When the story changes" appears in the transition line ("On the night when the story changes, a new arrival stepped off the invisible timetable") to signal this particular evening's importance, but the timeframe does not impose urgency or tighten decisions. The ritual unfolds without a clock or deadline; "one by one they stepped forward" is accumulative rather than time-pressured. The phrase frames the narrative pivot but does not function as a live constraint on tactics or outcome.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Kenji's desire to "find the cure for loneliness" is stated explicitly and drives his choice to bring the moon rock to the Exchange rather than use it himself. Mara's correction ("not cure … loneliness is not a rash; it is more like gravity") reframes the motivation and the experiment tests that reframing, culminating in "the loneliness shifted from singular to shared." The motivation is present across all three gates and shapes the ending's reconfiguration. However, Kenji's loneliness is asserted more than dramatized in contradictory impulses or a moment where connection costs him something he wants to keep.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Polite anarchy is embodied in Mara's voice ("as if she were about to announce both a bake sale and a revolution"), the Exchange's non-hierarchical structure ("host, if there was one"), and the tension between order (logistics, reciprocity rules) and improvisation (mismatched supplies, improbable rumors). The tone modulates slightly—drier in exposition, warmer during the ritual—and charges the final image of collective confession as organized chaos. However, the tone remains relatively static across emotional beats; no moment where politeness fractures under pressure or anarchy threatens to collapse the experiment. Present throughout, coherent, but does not shift to heighten closure.</comment>
