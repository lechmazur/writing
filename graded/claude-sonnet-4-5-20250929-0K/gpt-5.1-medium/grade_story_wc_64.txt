<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's discovery of their own undead status through the tapestry is earned by cumulative detail (sovereign case, notebooks, the chess game memory). Interiority is concrete—"I had planted roses in frozen ground, and this felt strangely similar"—and the revelation that the gardener "could not bear to leave the unfinished intentions" drives the final stance. The motivational arc from blithe denial to acceptance of role is clear, though the shift happens mostly through observation rather than a harder on-page choice that forecloses a path. Embodied contradiction appears ("whistling off-key, pretending the world was not made of endings"), but the climactic moment leans reflective rather than decisional, capping the score below 8.5.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Conceptual Repricing hybrid): the narrator learns they are the undead gardener and that graves "awaited not flowers but decisions," reweighting all prior tending as avoidance. Cost is conceptual and felt—the loss of the comforting fiction of mere service. The lens is Accumulative/Textural: whispers, tapestry fragments, and notebook sketches build density until the silo scene crystallizes pattern into meaning. Orientation is clear by the first paragraph (cemetery, night shift, chess clock). One concern: the tapestry's mechanics (how matching the strip "hummed" the silo into revelation) remain slightly abstract, and the final descent offers emotional exhale but no new action or foreclosed path, keeping this just under 8.5.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The cobalt silo functions as both setting and closure stage: climbing it is the story's spatial climax, and the tapestry hanging inside directly enables the revelation. The sovereign case, chess clock, and frayed strip are handled across multiple beats and gain meaning through touch. Velveteen gloom, marble slabs, and off-key whistling anchor POV filtering. Spatial choreography (graves → service road → silo ladder → hatch → cylinder) tracks cleanly. The environment constrains the final choice (must climb, must match the strip at height), meeting the 9+ gate requirement. Minor: some phrases ("sealed cobalt candle," "cold inland sea") trend decorative without altering tactics, preventing full 9-band entry.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: "everything that mattered happened after the chess clock runs down." The whisper-tug escalates through pocket warmth, silo climb, and tapestry alignment, culminating in the realization that the dead need living decisions, not flowers. The tightening is clear (whispers → climb → match → understand), and the conceptual cost—abandoning the comforting role of "blithe" maintainer—is legible. However, the protagonist's agency is primarily receptive (listening, climbing, receiving revelation) rather than a hard trade-off choice that forecloses a live option on the page, keeping this in the high 7s rather than 8.5+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through layered particulars: the tapestry as memory's medium, graves as "loose strands" of unfinished intention, the gardener's whistling denial masking existential dread. The final image—"velveteen gloom outside felt softer, as if the night itself had finally exhaled"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question (what keeps the dead restless?) without moralizing. Subtext operates in the chess game (death as opponent, seedlings as pawns) and the sovereign case's emptiness (no currency, only obligation). The piece resists tidy resolution: the gardener now knows but must still tend, a knowing endurance that charges the theme. No thesis statements mar the ending, and the woven metaphor (threads = intentions) evolves from ornament to structural logic.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature: "dirt under my nails," "velveteen gloom," "colors stubborn beneath the dust." Voice modulates appropriately—lyric and patient in reflection, tighter during the climb. However, register occasionally drifts elevated ("thronged these hills," "bewilder grief into retreat") beyond what the embodied gardener's lexicon would naturally produce under pressure. No head-hopping, and the psychic distance is controlled. The piece uses purposeful compression ("he was me before I had a name"), but a few passages (the chess-game vision, "loose strands snagged on the world") feel more authorial than character-specific, preventing entry to the 8+ band.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies well ("Each rung echoing like a small gong"), and information density is high. However, several metaphors stack without paying off: "sealed cobalt candle," "cold inland sea," "velveteen gloom...like ink through watered silk"—these accumulate decoratively in the opening third without altering tactics. Minor template cadence: "I had found... I had learned... I understood" in close succession. The tapestry-reveal beat is clear, but "the pattern refused to settle in my mind" and "symbols that refused to hold still" repeat the same evasion across two paragraphs. Proofreading is clean, and the final line ("the velveteen gloom outside felt softer") recharges the opening image effectively. Deductions for figurative density and minor loops prevent 8+.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The premise—undead gardener unknowingly tending to the unresolved dead—offers a fresh synthesis of cemetery Gothic and metaphysical obligation. The tapestry-as-memory-record and the chess-clock threshold are specific, non-obvious details. The revelation (protagonist is the man with soil for hands) feels earned in hindsight by the notebooks, whistling, and "blithe" descriptor. However, the "unfinished intentions as tangled threads" metaphor, while executed at a high level, is a familiar trope in speculative grief narratives. The silo-as-observatory and cobalt color add texture but not structural surprise. The piece commits fully to its vision and avoids safe hedging, earning solid originality marks without reaching the rarest tier.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The blithe gardener is the focalizer throughout and makes the key decision to climb the silo and match the tapestry strip, which triggers the revelation. The "blithe" trait is explained ("I whistled and joked...as though neatness could bewilder grief") and pays off when the narrator learns they chose to stay rather than rest. Present in setup (opening), middle (notebooks, sovereign case), and closure (self-recognition). The character's choices create the major turn. Slight deduction: much of the arc is receptive observation rather than harder trade-off agency, and "blithe" functions more as thematic label than a trait that constrains a specific tactic under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The sovereign case is introduced early ("found...years ago"), handled in the pocket (warmth, ticking), opened at the silo, and its strip matched to the tapestry border to unlock the vision. Appears in at least three beats and is causally essential to the closure revelation. The case's emptiness (no coins, only tapestry) is noted and gains meaning when the strip completes the border. Strong integration; the object cannot be swapped without breaking the mechanics of discovery. Minor: the case itself is somewhat passive (a container) rather than a tool the character manipulates under pressure in varied ways, keeping this just under 8.5.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Uncharted echoes" frames the cemetery's post-clock murmurs and shapes the gardener's listening practice. The concept is signaled early ("the cemetery begin to murmur, the uncharted echoes loosening themselves") and recurs when the narrator decodes the tapestry to "untangle the uncharted echoes." It provides thematic texture and stakes (why listen, why decode), and the final understanding that graves need "decisions, not flowers" is the concept's payoff. However, "uncharted" is more atmospheric label than a rule or constraint that alters tactics on the page; the echoes guide but don't resist or cost. Functional across beats, but not indispensable to the logic—"unresolved whispers" could substitute with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Tenderly organized" notebooks appear twice: mid-story ("My notebooks, tenderly organized in the shed, held sketches of this same pattern") and as implicit prior action. The trait colors the gardener's approach (careful, patient) and establishes that the pattern recognition was methodical, supporting the revelation. The tenderness contrasts with the "blithe" public persona, adding psychological depth. However, the notebooks themselves are summary-only—we never see the narrator consult, sketch, or use them in a live choice. Present in setup (implied history) and middle (mentioned), but absent from the closure beat. Functional but replaceable; "carefully kept" would work as well.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Untangle" is the story's central verb, appearing as goal ("the whispers...urging me to finally untangle"), method (matching the strip), and thematic closure ("I could untangle the uncharted echoes by decoding frayed threads"). The action structures the silo climb and the tapestry-matching moment, and the final realization is the untangling's result. Present across setup (desire), middle (physical attempt), and closure (conceptual fulfillment). The specificity (not "solve" or "decode" alone, but untangle—implying knots, care, threads) ties to the tapestry motif. Strong causal role. Slight deduction: the physical untangling is minimal (one alignment), and much of the work is passive reception of the vision rather than iterative struggle.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The method is signaled mid-story ("I could untangle...by decoding frayed threads in a tapestry's border") and executed at the silo when the narrator matches the sovereign-case strip to the hanging tapestry's border, triggering the vision. The border's "symbols that refused to hold still" and the alignment causing the silo to hum establish that the mechanics matter. Present in middle (signal) and closure (execution). The method is specific and cannot be trivially swapped. However, the decoding itself is instant and passive—colors align, vision appears—with no failed attempts, legibility struggle, or cost to the process. Functional and closure-linked, but the method's difficulty and stakes are told rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The cobalt silo is introduced early ("It rose from the field like a sealed cobalt candle"), becomes the literal and symbolic destination (climb = revelation), and its interior (hanging tapestry, dark cylinder) is the closure stage. The silo's verticality and isolation force the protagonist into the revelatory space. Present in setup (description), middle (approach), and closure (interior scene). The climb's physical difficulty ("each rung echoing like a small gong") and the hatch entry create mild pressure. The silo is essential to the structure—removing it would require a new revelation site. Minor: the "cobalt" color and "observatory" label add atmosphere but don't alter tactics; the silo functions more as stage than active constraint.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The timeframe is established immediately ("The last move had been made hours ago...The rules of my shift were simple now: everything that mattered happened after the chess clock runs down") and governs the story's logic: the murmurs and whispers begin only after the clock empties. The clock's "silent and spent" state in the opening and the phrase "Only then did the cemetery begin to murmur" set the boundary. Present in setup and implicit throughout. However, the clock itself is static after the opening; there's no ticking pressure or countdown during the main action (the climb and revelation), and the timeframe doesn't narrow options or create urgency within the beats. The concept frames but doesn't tighten. Functional metaphoric threshold, but not a live constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The motivation is stated early ("urging me to finally untangle what had been left inside, to discover the shape of intentions") and drives the climb and tapestry-matching action. The final revelation—learning that the dead (and the gardener) are held by "unfinished intentions"—directly answers the question. Desire is embodied in the pocket warmth, the "impatient heartbeat" of the strip, and the climb's physical effort. Present in setup (whisper-tug), middle (goal articulation), and closure (fulfillment via understanding). The motivation encounters mild friction (uncertainty about the pattern) but no strong conflicting want or cost to pursuing it, and the discovery is rewarding rather than costly. Solid integration with clear payoff, but lacks the friction or sacrifice that would push it higher.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Velveteen gloom" is introduced in the third sentence ("leaving a velveteen gloom that seeped from headstone to headstone like ink through watered silk") and recurs at closure ("the velveteen gloom outside felt softer, as if the night itself had finally exhaled"), where it is explicitly reweighted by the narrator's new understanding. The tone is consistent—quiet, Gothic, patient—and modulates subtly as pressure rises (tighter syntax during the climb, exhale at the end). The reprise charges the final image by transforming the gloom from oppressive to companionable. Present in setup and closure with purposeful shift. Strong lyric integration. Minor: "velveteen" is somewhat ornamental (soft, luxurious fabric) and the vehicle doesn't add tactical meaning, keeping this shy of indispensable.</comment>
