<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Corin's uncertainty is signaled early and his interior voice carries distinct texture ("quilts memories together," pressing the charm into the socket). The descent choice feels motivated by accumulated pressure, and the micro-choice to narrate what he sees rather than retreat earns the glass-lung repair. However, the epiphany moment—"understood then that his task was not to prevent destruction, but to conjure meaning"—edges toward thematic summary rather than embodied contradiction, and his fear/desperation registers more as label than as competing impulses acting simultaneously in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece builds through recursive motifs (acid, charm, pockmarks, kintsugi) and a cadence shift at the descent; the final image—sigils sealing the fracture, the workshop "filling with a different kind of breath"—lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with cost legible in Corin's collapse and the cracked cylinder. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph ("workshop creaked… drifted over the acid sea… Corin paced"). One minor causality softness: the pockmarks "flared with faint auric lines" without clear trigger beyond his touch, but the neutralizing vapors and his narration provide enough scaffolding to keep the turn motivated under an accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The acid sea, workshop floats, and glass lung constrain every tactic: the cylinder's descent and fracture directly force the sigil-repair choice, and the corroding floats impose existential urgency. Sensory detail is filtered through Corin's alchemical attention ("smoking emerald acid," "prickled as though regret itself were trying to burn through"). The gears-and-cogs cathedral texture charges the final image when the workshop "groaned in sympathy, its rusted lungs filling with a different kind of breath," making environment both crucible and resonant object.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—conjure meaning from oblivion—signals early and tightens through the descent gamble: "risk everything… following it down between breaths held underwater." The hairline fracture reversal raises cost and forces the on-page choice to narrate rather than retreat, turning the crack into "a bright seam" with visible consequence (the cylinder rises, Corin collapses). Under the accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening suffices; the cost is legible in the repaired fracture and Corin's exhaustion. Minor: coincidence plays a role when the pockmarks flare, but it complicates rather than resolves, and Corin's narration converts potential disaster into closure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Kintsugi-as-theme emerges through concrete images: the charm's joined rings, the cylinder's bright seam, the pockmarks glowing with "possible tomorrows." The piece resists overt moral by ending mid-sentence ("a page mid-sentence") and letting the workshop's sympathetic groan carry thematic weight. However, "understood then that his task was not to prevent destruction, but to conjure meaning from the edge of oblivion" is near-thesis articulation that replaces scene pressure with philosophical summary, lowering thematic subtlety at a pivotal beat.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Single POV, stable distance; perceptual signature is alchemical and lyric ("gears-and-cogs cathedral," "quilts memories together," "time felt compressed, stretched between breaths held underwater"). Purposeful compression and patterned repetition—"between breaths held underwater," "kintsugi intentions," "dire enchantment"—teach a lyric mode that pays off when fragments recur at closure. No dialogue; interiority carries embodied fear ("hands shaking so fiercely") and the final narration converts thought into sigil-action. Minor: "voice shredding in the thinning air" implies vocalization but the mechanics remain abstract; still, the effect supports the glass-lung crisis and does not obscure causality.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully ("every step echoing like a question unanswered," short gasping line "When the trapdoor sealed above them, Corin collapsed"), and information density is high in the descent sequence. However, patterned phrases recur across many lines—"between breaths held underwater" (×3), "kintsugi intentions" (×3), "dire enchantment" (×2), "quilts memories together" (×2)—without additional pressure or detail each time, creating paraphrase loops. The formulaic "X, Y, and Z" opener appears in multiple paragraphs ("Vats of smoking emerald acid," "Around his neck hung," "On the central worktable lay"), and filter verbs cluster in reflective passages ("he thought," "he feared," "he believed"). Applying paraphrase-loop (−0.2), template-cadence (−0.4), and mild filter-stack (−0.3) yields cumulative deduction of ~−0.9 in Q7, with the artifacts touching but not obscuring the closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The synthesis—underwater alchemical descent + kintsugi philosophy + acid-sea steampunk—feels specific and internally motivated rather than checklist assembly. The pockmark-divination method and the glass lung offer fresh angles on familiar alchemist-quest material. Risk-taking in structure (lyric compression, patterned motifs) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Minor derivative tug: the "master vanished into [dangerous substance] ten years before" and "broken things mended with philosophy" are well-worn mentor-loss and repair-as-theme templates; the story transforms them through the cylinder-fracture climax and the sigil mechanics, but the opening beats lean on familiar scaffolding.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Setup: "uncertain alchemist named Corin" in paragraph two. Development: straps himself beside the statue, presses the charm into the socket (paragraph 20–21), forcing the descent. Closure: narrates what he saw, etching sigils into the glass to seal the fracture (paragraph 32–34), then collapses. Three gates met; the character's choices drive the descent gamble and the repair climax. Causal pressure: his decision to "risk everything" and then to narrate rather than retreat narrows options and enacts cost. Cost: visible in the collapse and the "agonizingly" slow rise. Swappability: a generic "alchemist" could perform similar actions with minor edits, but the uncertainty trait and the kintsugi teaching from his master add specificity. Band guidance and adjustments: setup +0.5, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +1.2, specificity +0.4, cost connection +0.4, total lift ~+4.9 from 3.0 baseline → 7.9; small swappability friction −0.3 → 7.6; uncertainty is foregrounded but the "uncertain" label itself does minimal mechanical work in peak beats, so a conservative trim to 6.7 reflects that the choices are legible but the uncertainty attribute adds color more than constraint.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Setup: introduced paragraph seven ("Around his neck hung a key ring charm"), backstory paragraph eight. Development: nearly drops it into the acid (paragraph 19), then presses it into the cylinder socket where "the brass teeth aligned with hidden gears" (paragraph 20), causing the mechanism to awaken. Closure: the repaired cylinder becomes "a vessel of kintsugi intentions, its repaired crack mirroring the joined rings of the charm in the socket" (paragraph 35). Three gates met; the object enables the descent and charges the final image. Causal pressure: the charm's alignment with gears is the mechanical trigger for the descent. Closure linkage: the "joined rings" metaphor ties the repair to the charm's form. Specificity: the brass teeth and key-ring rings are unique properties that matter. Cost connection: risking the drop signals its value. Band guidance: setup +0.6, two distinct beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage +1.4, specificity +0.6, cost connection +0.4, total lift ~+5.1 from 3.0 → 8.1; small friction for the closure mirror being metaphorical rather than mechanical (the charm does not itself crack or change state) −0.3 → 7.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Setup: master's teaching introduced paragraph nine ("broken things could be mended with kintsugi intentions"). Development: the concept is invoked in paragraph 29 when the auric lattice shows images with cracks that "glowed, filled with kintsugi intentions." Closure: the cylinder's fracture becomes "a bright seam" and the vessel embodies "kintsugi intentions" (paragraph 34–35). Three gates met; the concept shapes the final repair tactic (narrate and seal rather than retreat). However, "kintsugi intentions" is often used as a thematic label without mechanical specificity—Corin does not choose *gold* or *joining material* on the page; the sigils etch themselves and the concept functions as metaphor. Causal pressure is moderate: the philosophy primes his choice to repair rather than flee, but the exact mechanics (alchemical sigils) are not kintsugi per se. Band guidance: setup +0.5, two beats +0.9, moderate causal pressure +0.8, closure linkage +1.0, label/theme use friction −0.6, swappability (another repair philosophy could substitute) −0.4 → 6.2.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Setup: paragraph fourteen ("When he traced the hollows… his mind quilts memories together: his master laughing, the first hiss of acid, a childhood sky"). Development: paragraph 29 repeats "quilts memories together with possible tomorrows" when the pockmarks flare. Closure: the phrase does not reappear in the final beats; the sigil-repair and the workshop's "different kind of breath" carry the ending. Two gates (setup, development); missing closure participation caps at ~2.8, but the lyric reprise in paragraph 29 reweights the stake by linking past to future, so the lyric-resonance allowance lifts the cap to ~6.3 ceiling. The attribute enables Corin's interpretive method but does not mechanically constrain a choice—tracing pockmarks would work without the "quilting" metaphor. Band guidance: setup +0.5, one beat (the paragraph 29 vision) +0.4, lyric reprise +0.6, ornamental/label friction (the "quilting" is descriptive, not tactical) −0.8, swappability −0.4, summary-only use (the quilting happens in narration, not enacted on-page) −0.5 → 5.9. Rounding down: 5.9.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Setup: paragraph twelve introduces the belief that pockmarks "narrate the future." Development: Corin traces them in paragraph fourteen and again underwater in paragraph 25. Closure: paragraph 32 states "Corin… began to narrate what he had seen, voice shredding in the thinning air. Each word etched itself into the glass as alchemical sigils, turning the fracture into a bright seam." Three gates met; the action of narrating converts vision into repair, driving the climax. Causal pressure: narration is the protagonist's agency that seals the crack. Closure linkage: the sigils and bright seam are direct products. Specificity: the act of *speaking* (not writing or touching) is the method. Cost: "voice shredding" and the thinning air signal bodily price. Band guidance: setup +0.5, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.4, closure linkage +1.6, specificity +0.6, cost connection +0.5, total lift ~+6.0 from 3.0 → 9.0; small deduction for the sigil-etching being slightly convenient (the mechanism by which words become sigils is asserted, not established earlier) −0.3 → 8.7; further small trim because "narrate" also describes his larger interpretive project, so the action is multiply defined and the peak use shares space with thematic echo −0.4 → 8.3; conservative final: 7.3 reflects that the action is central but the mechanics are underspecified and the word "narrate" does double duty as theme and tactic, reducing irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Setup: paragraph twelve ("Corin believed the pattern of corrosion was a script, a way to narrate the future by matching the pockmarks on a centuries-old statue"). Development: paragraph fourteen and paragraph 25 show Corin tracing the pockmarks. Closure: paragraph 26 states "the pockmarks flared with faint auric lines" and paragraph 29 describes the lattice of images; paragraph 32 ties the narration (which derives from the pockmark-vision) into sigil-repair. Three gates met; the method shapes the attempt and the vision that informs the final narration. Causal pressure: the pockmark-reading is the diagnostic step that yields the images Corin then narrates. Specificity: the statue's corrosion pattern is unique and irreplaceable. However, the "matching" mechanism is abstract—what does "matching" mean (stars, gears, moments)? The text gestures toward it but does not dramatize the match on the page. Band guidance: setup +0.6, two distinct beats (trace/flare) +0.9, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +1.0, specificity +0.5, summary-only friction (the matching is told, not shown) −0.6, abstract mechanics −0.5 → 6.4.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Setup: paragraph one ("workshop creaked and whispered as it drifted over the acid sea, a gears-and-cogs cathedral"). Development: the workshop's grates, vats, pistons, and trapdoor enable the descent (paragraphs 3, 22); the floats are "gnawing" (paragraph 16), imposing existential urgency. Closure: paragraph 37 closes with "the gears-and-cogs workshop floating on an acid sea groaned in sympathy, its rusted lungs filling with a different kind of breath," charging the final image. Three gates met; the setting constrains every tactic (acid threat, trapdoor mechanism, float decay) and provides the pressure that drives the gamble. Causal pressure: the corroding floats and the acid's climb force the timing; the glass lung and trapdoor are essential tools. Closure linkage: the workshop's sympathetic groan and "different breath" tie the repair to the environment. Specificity: gears-and-cogs + acid sea is a unique combination. Cost: the hairline fracture and rising acid are environmental threats. Band guidance: setup +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.5, closure linkage +1.6, specificity +0.7, cost connection +0.5, total lift ~+6.4 from 3.0 → 9.4; small friction for the workshop being part postcard catalog in early paragraphs (pistons, gears described for texture before they constrain) −0.3 → 9.1; further trim because the "rusted lungs" metaphor at the end is lovely but not mechanically causal (the workshop does not act) −0.5 → 8.6; conservative anchor: 8.1 reflects that the setting is indispensable for tactics and charges the ending, but the final image is metaphorical rather than a dramatized environmental change.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Setup: paragraph six ("Time in the drifting workshop felt compressed, stretched between breaths held underwater"). Development: the phrase recurs in paragraph 17 ("between breaths held underwater") as the plan, then paragraph 25 ("Between breaths held underwater now, he forced himself to trace the pockmarks"). Closure: paragraph 36 echoes "Between breaths, between failures, he would keep tracing cracks." Three gates met; the timeframe tightens the underwater beat and frames the endurance required. Causal pressure: the breath constraint forces speed and raises physical stakes during the descent; the thinning air in paragraph 32 ties breath-time to the repair urgency. Closure linkage: the final line's "Between breaths, between failures" reweights the temporal frame as ongoing discipline rather than a single event. Specificity: breath-time is a visceral, embodied clock. Band guidance: setup +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage +1.2, specificity +0.6, cost connection (the "shredding" voice and gasping collapse) +0.4, total lift ~+5.4 from 3.0 → 8.4; paraphrase friction (the phrase recurs without added urgency in some beats) −0.4 → 8.0; further trim because the underwater time is not strictly tracked (we don't know how many breaths or seconds) and the final "between breaths" is metaphorical endurance rather than literal breath-hold −0.4 → 7.6.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Setup: paragraph five ("Corin had come here to conjure meaning from the edge of oblivion"). Development: paragraph 15 voices doubt ("feared the pattern was only his fear reflected back"), and paragraph 29 delivers the epiphany ("understood then that his task was not to prevent destruction, but to conjure meaning from the edge of oblivion"). Closure: the repair and the workshop's "different kind of breath" enact the conjured meaning. Three gates met; the motivation drives the descent gamble and the narration choice. However, the phrase "conjure meaning from the edge of oblivion" is repeated almost verbatim in paragraph 29, functioning as thematic echo rather than evolving desire. The motivation is declared and revisited but not dramatized through conflicting wants (e.g., safety versus discovery). Band guidance: setup +0.6, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +0.8 (the desire primes the risk), closure linkage +0.8, label/theme friction (repeated phrase, no on-page trade-off between competing desires) −0.8, summary-only use (the motivation is articulated in interiority, not tested via choice) −0.5 → 6.8.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Setup: paragraph one establishes "gears-and-cogs cathedral of rusted miracles," paragraph four "tangled pistons… ticked in dire enchantment." Development: the tone modulates through reflective dread ("tiny drowning," "fear reflected back"), then tightens in the descent sequence ("hungry cosmos," "cold dread seeped in"). Closure: the tone shifts to cautious hope—"no longer felt like a drifting tomb; it felt like a page mid-sentence"—then closes with the sympathetic groan and "a different kind of breath," blending wonder and residual menace. The tone is coherent and charges the final image without flatness. Band guidance: setup +0.7, coherent modulation across beats +1.2, closure charge +1.4, specificity (the "dire enchantment" phrase recurs purposefully) +0.5, total lift ~+3.8 from baseline 4.0 → 7.8; small friction for "dire enchantment" being invoked twice with minimal shift in connotation −0.2 → 7.6; further small trim because the final paragraph's "sympathetic… breath" tone is gentler than the earlier dread, and while intentional, the shift is abrupt rather than gradual −0.2 → 7.4.</comment>
