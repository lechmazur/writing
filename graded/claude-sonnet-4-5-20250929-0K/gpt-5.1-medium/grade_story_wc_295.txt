<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's interiority is concrete and specific ("job titles were the thin armor I wore"), and the contradiction between chronicling others' dreams versus being consumed by one's own creates genuine internal pressure. Aria's dual role as starguard/counselor is established functionally through action. However, the final healing moment ("I finally witnessed my own healing") arrives as declaration rather than embodied consequence, and the protagonist's agency in the closure beat reads passive—understanding arrives to them rather than through a difficult choice with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The accumulative/textural lens is inferred and held: the story builds through dream fragments, telegram evidence, star-chart overlay, and the revelation of the temple's ledger function. Orientation anchors clearly by the opening (observatory, midnight, dream chronicler assignment). The closure—"I finally witnessed my own healing"—lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (a realization that reweights the protagonist's relationship to their work and dreams), but the cost remains abstract; we don't see what path is foreclosed or what specific tactic shifts in response to this understanding.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The observatory dome, telescope mechanics, transparent star chart, and daylily-pressed telegram function as tactile, purposeful details that constrain the investigation. The variable stars and their "patient insistence, like breathing written in light" create atmospheric specificity tied to the discovery process. The setting directly enables the decoding work and charges the final moment when pattern and healing converge, though the physical space could have pressured a choice more overtly to reach the high band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—decode temple inscriptions to validate the protagonist's experience and secure observatory funding—is signaled early and sustained. The matching of symbols to variable stars provides one meaningful tightening that narrows interpretive options and reveals the temple's ledger function. However, the escalation reads more as accumulative discovery than as a choice under pressure; the protagonist never faces a trade-off or dilemma that forces renunciation, and the final "understanding" arrives without a visible price paid on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The theme of shared burdens emerges organically through the temple ledger revelation ("We carried this so you would not have to") and Aria's correction ("so you would not have to carry it alone"), avoiding thesis statement. The final image ties the protagonist's vocational crisis—mapping others' nightmares while drowning in their own—to the temple's function as a record of collective suffering, creating thematic resonance without moralizing. The insight is earned through concrete star-chart work and specific inscriptions rather than abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Voice is consistent and textured with strong figurative anchors ("the sky looked less like darkness and more like a vast black page," "job titles were the thin armor"). POV distance is stable and well-calibrated; the narrator's perceptual signature (dreams "outvote my waking life," the universe "trying, clumsily, to dictate a letter") is character-specific. Dialogue carries subtext and advances discovery without exposition dumps. However, a few lines drift into overwriting ("midnight solace," "faint tremor of fatigue and something like grief") that slightly loosens the grip at emotional peaks.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout ("dreams would not leave me alone," "the sky looked less like darkness and more like a vast black page," "variable stars…like breathing written in light") and mostly coherent, though occasional mixed registers appear ("midnight solace" reads elevated against the grounded observatory work). Template cadence appears in the middle section: "I unfolded…I copied…Aria overlaid" creates a three-step list rhythm. The closure sentence "I finally witnessed my own healing" shifts into summary-tell that undercuts the image-driven momentum built prior. No loops or pronoun drift; information density is strong.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of dream chronicler, celestial cartography, and a temple ledger that records disasters through star patterns feels specific and purposeful rather than template-driven. The emotional hook—professional burden as parallel to historical burden—emerges from the premise organically. However, the "healing through understanding ancient shared burdens" arc follows a recognizable structure, and the closure leans toward emotional comfort rather than risk. The variable-star mechanism and daylily telegram offer fresh textural detail that elevate the piece within familiar territory.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The lucid dream chronicler role frames the assignment and provides the dream evidence that drives the investigation. The protagonist unfolds the telegram, copies inscriptions, and traces connections between symbols and stars—functional involvement across two beats. However, no key turn hinges on a choice specific to their dream-chronicling skill; they observe and assist Aria's overlay work rather than driving the decoding themselves. Present in closure reflection but not causally active there.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The daylily-pressed telegram appears in three beats: pocket evidence in opening, convinces the director to send the protagonist, and is unfolded on the observatory desk to anchor the inscription-matching work. Its anachronistic date and summer scent establish the temporal paradox that validates the dreams. However, it functions primarily as static proof rather than evolving meaning; removing the specific flower detail would not break story logic—any paradoxical evidence object would serve.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Shared burdens shapes the investigation's stakes from the outset (chronicling others' nightmares while consumed by one's own) and is dramatized on the page when the temple ledger reveals its function: recording disasters so future generations "would not have to carry it alone." This realization directly reweights the protagonist's vocational crisis and provides the thematic fulcrum for the closure healing moment. The concept is inseparable from both the detective work and the emotional resolution.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Aria's role as counselor who "heals with words" is introduced early and her "soft rasp of her voice, worn by long nights of receiving other peoples confessions" provides character texture. She listens, corrects the protagonist's translation gently, and her hand rests near theirs in the final beat. However, the healing trait never constrains a choice or forces a visible cost; her counseling remains atmospheric rather than causally active. No moment where words must be chosen carefully or withheld with consequence.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Witness" is the telegram's imperative ("Come witness what we could not understand"), frames the assignment ("witness my own healing"), and names the closure realization. The action threads through the star-matching work—observing variable stars, witnessing the pattern emerge—and the final line directly invokes it. However, witnessing here reads more as reception than transformation; the protagonist does not make a difficult choice to witness or pay a cost for seeing. Swapping "witness" for "understand" would require only minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Variable stars are signaled early as Aria rotates the telescope toward them, their mechanics explained ("brightness rising and falling with patient insistence, like breathing"), and the transparent star chart overlay directly enables the decoding by matching temple symbols to flickering coordinates. The method is indispensable: without variable stars' changing brightness, the ledger's disaster-record function cannot be read. The means shapes two beats (explanation, matching work) and the specificity (not fixed stars, but variables) is irreplaceable for the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The observatory provides the telescope, star charts, and physical access to the night sky required for decoding. Its isolation ("highest observatory in the range") and austere resources (blankets, coffee at budget risk) ground the investigation's practical stakes. The domed slit, narrow desk, and red emergency bulbs create tactile micro-setting that anchors the matching work. The setting enables the core action and its specific tools (transparent chart, variable-star scope) constrain method, though no choice is forced by the space itself.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The timeframe "when understanding dawns" appears in the final paragraph framing ("In that quiet hour, when understanding dawns without sunrise") and is seeded by Aria's opening line ("The stars do not wait for anyone"). The midnight arrival and sustained night-work create atmospheric coherence. However, the time element never tightens a decision—there is no clock pressure, no risk of losing the variable-star window, no dawn deadline that would alter tactics. The phrase functions thematically more than causally.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The motivation to decode temple inscriptions drives every on-page action: carrying the telegram as evidence, traveling to the observatory, copying symbols from the notebook, overlaying the star chart, and tracing the disaster coordinates. The desire is dramatized through physical work and specific goals (correlate dreams with sky, validate Brother Kephra's message). Friction arises between the protagonist's vocational need (budget justification) and personal need (make sense of consuming dreams), creating layered stakes that converge at closure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Midnight solace is established in the opening ("clocks surrendered to midnight"), reinforced when Aria dims the lamps ("the dome was a hollow of midnight solace"), and sustained through the quiet investigation and final healing moment. The tone modulates appropriately: opening urgency gives way to collaborative focus, then gentle revelation. The phrase "midnight solace" itself appears twice and charges the closure by framing understanding as sanctuary rather than triumph, directly supporting the shared-burden theme and the protagonist's vocational reconciliation.</comment>
