<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lan's interior is concrete and character-particular, with the crystallized-shard mechanism vividly embodied. His fear-driven clarity shapes his approach to the ceremony, and the final choice—meeting future storms as a scribe bearing luminous scars—is earned by the ritual's transformation. Internal conflict between shame and curiosity is dramatized through two memory shards that drive the rune-writing beats. Minor: the master remains functional rather than deeply individuated, though he applies necessary pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density builds through two memory-shard beats (birthmark shame, granary curiosity) that reweight Lan's relationship to his scars. Orientation anchors quickly (floating platform, tea ceremony, master and student). Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): scars rearrange into margins rather than wounds, future storms wait, and Lan is "ready to meet them"—options crystallize with visible cost (acceptance of scarred identity, commitment to the scribe path). The cost is felt in the final image: "cradled his cup as if it were an inkwell of weather, every swirling leaf a story he had yet to write." One meaningful deepening via two shard-driven turns is sufficient at this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The floating rock tea ceremony platform is tactile and pressured throughout: tethering chains sing under gusts, carved talismans flicker, the storm circles below waiting for the runes to falter. The crow quill, tea leaves unfurling like ink dragons, and the glowing stroke "hanging in the air" all charge the final image. Sensory detail (humming platform, saturated hush, mist, vapor ribbons) is filtered through Lan's heightened attention. The platform's descent through mist at closure reweights the space as a threshold between isolation and "the waiting world." Micro-setting (cup, tray, quill) constrains rune-writing choices.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake: transform scars into stories by writing living runes, signaled early. Two memory-shard beats (demon's thumbprint, granary questions) deepen the ceremony and narrow Lan's emotional options from shame-driven hiding to scribe-bearing luminous scars. Agency is clear: Lan chooses which memories to revisit and shapes the runes, exhaling old superstitions. The gusts and circling storm below apply external pressure without resolving; Lan's final readiness forecloses the path of hiding. Cost is visible: scars rearrange but do not vanish, and future tempests will test the runes. One tightening and one deepening are sufficient at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—scars as compass rather than curse, curiosity versus shame, transformation of wounds into narrative—emerges through two concrete memory shards and the ritual of rune-writing. The final image, "cradled his cup as if it were an inkwell of weather, every swirling leaf a story he had yet to write," offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Motifs (steam patterns, reflection, floating platform) charge the closure and constrain choices. The piece resists tidy resolution: scars "rearrange" but remain, and future storms wait. Subtext operates in gesture (trembling fingers, disturbed reflection) and image (rune fluttering like trapped moths) rather than statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Lan; perceptual signature is consistent (fear crystallizes into shards, sensory filtering through ritual focus). Diction is controlled and voice-motivated: "saturated hush," "inkwell of weather," "luminous scars." Master Sui's brief dialogue is purposeful and distinct in register. No head-hopping. Psychic distance tightens during rune-writing beats and releases slightly in framing lines. Filter verbs are minimal and voice-appropriate. The prose texture reflects Lan's state: precise, image-rich, and attentive under ceremonial pressure. Minor: some syntactic parallelism (repeated "The...") creates a slight template echo, but rhythm remains purposeful and the effect does not obscure clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Information density is high; nearly every sentence advances ritual, memory, or image. Sentence rhythm varies appropriately, accelerating during rune-writing and breathing during framing. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn. Figurative language is controlled and apt ("ink dragons," "shards of memory," "inkwell of weather"). Minor scaffold appears in a few adjacent lines with similar stems ("Lan's first memory-shard rose... Shame had once burned... Now, in the saturated hush, he traced..."), but does not dull closure. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes effectively. Proofreading is clean; no grammar or logic errors.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis—floating tea ceremony, rune scholar, memory-shard ritual, storm-pressured platform—feels specific and non-obvious. The transformation of scars into narrative tools via a ceremonial act is earned through concrete detail (crow quill dipped in tea, vapor runes, gusts testing the platform). Emotional specificity avoids generic templates: birthmark shame and granary curiosity are particular, not stock wounds. The platform descent and "inkwell of weather" final image are fresh inflections. Minor: the "breath between storms" framing and the master-student arc echo familiar structures, though executed at a high level. Risk-taking in the lyric-accumulative mode heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lan (budding rune scholar) is present throughout, drives both rune-writing beats (Face and Flame, Question bound to Plenty), and makes the final choice to meet future storms as a scribe. Setup early, develops in two memory-shard turns, and shapes the ending (descent with cup as inkwell). Choices alter tactics: selecting which memories to revisit, tracing trembling curves, exhaling superstitions. Cost is visible: scars rearrange, future storms wait. Specific trait (budding scholar, trembling, chosen for impossible ceremony) matters. Causal pressure narrows options from hiding to bearing luminous scars.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The crow quill is present in three beats: described on the tray (hollowed for ink, holding "breath of his own unease"), dipped into tea to trace the first rune (disturbing reflection), and lifted to draw the second rune (looping spirals). Setup early, used in two rune-writing beats, and its "trimmed tip" detail signals craft. However, the quill could be swapped for another ritual writing tool with minor edits; no unique property (hollow shaft, crow origin) constrains the ritual or charges the closure image. Functional but not indispensable. Score: early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +0.6; swappability −0.6, no closure linkage −0.7 = ~6.7.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"A breath between storms" is signaled early ("a breath between storms, too still"), shapes the entire ceremony's urgency (one stray gust threatens the platform), drives the master's instruction ("during a held breath"), and charges the final realization: "This was only a breath between storms... future tempests would test whether these stories could hold their shapes." It constrains Lan's choices (write runes before the storm strikes), tightens the timeframe, and reweights the closure (scars as preparation for waiting tempests). Setup +0.7, beat involvement (throughout) +1.4, causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage +1.5, specificity +0.6 = ~8.6. Indispensable: removing it breaks the urgency and the closure's testing logic.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"Crystallizes when stressed" is signaled early ("thoughts did not race; they crystallized when stressed, forming clear, cold shards of memory"), enables the memory-shard mechanism that drives both rune-writing beats, and reappears at the peak: "His fear crystallized when stressed, but the shards this time arranged themselves into deliberate facets, guiding his hand." The trait constrains his method (revisiting shards) and enables the transformation (shards become guides instead of wounds). Setup +0.6, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.3, closure linkage +1.0, specificity +0.7, cost connection +0.5 = ~8.4. Without this exact mechanism, the story loses its psychological architecture.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Shed" drives the master's instruction ("shed their husks so their living cores may speak"), Lan's act of exhaling old superstitions ("he released the old superstition"), and the final reconfiguration (scars "rearranged" rather than vanishing). The action is specific: shedding husks, not banishing or destroying. It shapes both rune beats and the ending's logic (scars remain but transform). Setup +0.6, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.1, closure linkage +1.3, specificity +0.6 = ~8.2. Swapping "shed" for "release" or "transform" would lose the husk/core metaphor that organizes the ritual.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"By revisiting youthful superstitions" is signaled by the master ("by revisiting youthful superstitions and laying them bare"), drives the selection of both memory shards (birthmark as demon's thumbprint, naming patterns as famine-caller), and structures the rune-writing method (each shard becomes a rune). Setup early +0.6, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +0.9 (scars into stories), specificity +0.5 = ~7.9. The method is integral: removing "youthful superstitions" would leave no criteria for which memories to revisit. Minor: the mechanism is told by the master rather than discovered by Lan, slightly reducing agency.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The floating rock tea ceremony platform is present throughout, supplies the primary constraint (one gust would shove it into thunderheads), shapes the ceremony's fragility (chains sing, talismans flicker), and descends at closure ("began descending through mist"). Setup immediate +0.8, beat involvement (throughout) +1.4, causal pressure (threat of displacement) +1.2, closure linkage (descent toward the waiting world) +1.2, specificity (floating, chained, talisman-carved) +0.7 = ~8.3. The floating instability is indispensable: a ground-level platform would erase the urgency and the "breath between storms" metaphor.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"During a held breath" is signaled by the master ("everything that mattered would happen during a held breath"), drives the compression of the ceremony (two rune beats within the lull), and returns at closure ("a moment his new runes faltered"). The timeframe tightens decisions: Lan must finish before the storm tests his work. Setup +0.6, beat involvement (frames the entire ceremony) +1.0, causal pressure +0.9, closure linkage +0.9 (storm waits patiently), specificity +0.5 = ~7.6. The held-breath window is necessary but slightly abstract; the story does not track elapsed seconds or breaths to escalate urgency beat-by-beat.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>"To transform scars into stories" is signaled early ("to transform scars into stories"), drives the selection of memory shards (birthmark, granary), and shapes the ending realization ("scribe bearing luminous scars," "every swirling leaf a story he had yet to write"). The motivation is dramatized through choice (which scars to revisit) and conflict (shame versus curiosity). Setup +0.7, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.3, closure linkage +1.4, specificity +0.7, cost connection +0.5 = ~8.5. The desire is indispensable: without it, the ceremony becomes generic skill-testing rather than personal transformation.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Saturated hush" is established immediately ("humming softly in the saturated hush"), modulates with pressure (air "a breath between storms, too still," thunder "claps of distant," silence "thickening"), and charges the final image (mist, descent, waiting world). The tone reflects Lan's attentive state and the ceremony's fragility; it does not flatten under the peak beats but deepens into "small circle of light slowly shedding height." Setup +0.7, coherence through turns +1.0, pressure modulation +0.8, closure linkage +1.1, specificity +0.6 = ~8.1. The tone is integral: a louder or more kinetic register would break the ritual's delicacy and the breath-between-storms premise.</comment>
