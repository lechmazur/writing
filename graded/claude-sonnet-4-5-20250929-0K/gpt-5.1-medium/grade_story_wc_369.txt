<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Milo's interiority is concretely embodied through action—kneeling, touching the cold metal, speaking to trees. His motivation to understand what trees witness moves from wondering to earned action when he points the sextant at the sapling. The final choice to record witnessed sorrow is causally earned through the night's progression. Minor drag from the long reflective museum-object passage mid-story, but it anchors present action and the final recording choice closes with visible cost (his isolation deepened, but his understanding gained).</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure. The sextant falling → Milo climbing → moonlight healing → mapping dreams → recording forgiveness forms a coherent tightening under accumulative logic. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final image of Milo recording witnessed sorrow "bent quietly toward forgiveness" reweights the premise with conceptual cost—he now bears the weight of all those layered memories. Orientation is clear by the opening beat. One meaningful deepening occurs when the sextant begins mapping scattered dreams, narrowing his task to patient node-by-node deconstruction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The rooftop potted trees, storm, moonlight, and tower observatory constrain Milo's choices throughout—he waters them from cleaning cisterns, climbs the hidden stair during the storm, and uses moonlight to heal the sextant. The sextant itself functions as tool-setting, its cracked arc and faint heat grounding the magical logic in tactile detail. The setting charges the final image: "rooftop washed and humming" anchors the closure beat. Spatial choreography is clean (Corridor Theta → service stair → rooftop) and sensory detail (condensation tick, wind tearing coat) is purposeful and POV-filtered.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: discovering what trees witness. The labyrinth's inhale and pin-drop create immediate pressure; Milo's decision to take the sextant and climb escalates agency. The sextant's healing and subsequent mapping of tree memories provides one meaningful tightening that narrows his task to deconstruction. The final act of recording carries visible cost—he sits alone among trees at dawn, his solitary habit now formalized into duty. No antagonist required; the maze's opinion and the storm's departure frame situational pressure that culminates in a stance crystallization (recording forgiveness).</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: the sextant measuring "quantified sorrow," tree rings as labyrinths of witnessed moments, dust gathering until wiped. The final image—sorrow "bent quietly toward forgiveness"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Milo's discovery that trees carry cumulative witness integrates his職 maintenance role with the thematic question. The piece resists binary resolution; forgiveness is earned through patient mapping, not declared. Subtext operates in gestures (thumb on cracked arc, talking to trees) and the maze holding its breath.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: Milo notices "cracks in reality," hears the maze's opinions, and speaks more to trees than people. Diction remains consistent—"smudged ledger," "spilt milk," "tired joint easing"—with compression appropriate to his observational patience. The narrative withholds no facts Milo knows; his realization that the sextant measures "long attention" is dramatized through the healing and mapping sequence. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (closer during the sextant discovery, broader during the closing summary). No dialogue present to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose is propulsive and dense: "every leaking echo told him where the maze was tired" does triple work (setting, character perception, world-building). Rhythm varies—short urgent beats during the labyrinth's inhale, longer contemplative lines on the rooftop. Minor scaffold: "Later he would swear his real life diverged right there" tells what could be shown, and "he should have logged it...yet the maze seemed to hold its breath again" slightly hedges. The figurative language (seashell echo, moonlight pooled like spilt milk) is coherent and voice-appropriate. No loops or template cadence. Opening and closing lines anchor effectively.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of labyrinth maintenance + quantified sorrow + tree witness + celestial mapping is non-obvious and specific. The premise that a retired sextant measures cumulative attention rather than degrees transforms the trope of magical objects through Milo's grounded occupation and the story's patient method. The rooftop garden "nobody officially acknowledged" and Milo's years-long wondering create inevitability in hindsight. Risk-taking: the extended reflective mode and lyric accumulation could have stalled, but the piece commits fully and delivers a fresh inflection when the sextant maps tree memories as labyrinthal cross-sections. Bold structural choice (accumulative lens, quiet ending) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Milo's role as maintenance worker seeds his attention to "cracks in reality" (early signal +0.5), drives his decision to take the sextant and climb (middle beat +0.4), and culminates in his recording the trees' witness in his ledger (closure linkage +1.2). His occupational habit of listening and logging shapes all three acts. Cost: his solitary expertise isolates him further, yet grants him access to the trees' layered sorrow. The role is irreplaceable—swap "maintenance worker" for "astronomer" and the story's logic breaks.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The sextant is discovered centered on flagstone (setup +0.6), handled and examined for its cracked arc and faint heat (beat one +0.4), heals in moonlight and is sighted at the tree (beat two +0.4), maps the tree's memories (beat three +0.4), and its diagram is the basis for Milo's final recording (closure linkage +1.4). The object's transformation from measuring comet tails to quantifying sorrow to mapping witness is irreplaceable (+0.6). Visible cost: Milo must deconstruct each node "patient node by patient node," accepting the weight of cumulative sorrow.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Quantified sorrow is introduced via museum placard (setup +0.5), recognized by Milo when he understands the sextant measures "long attention" (middle realization +0.5), and reweighted at closure when he records that sorrow "bent quietly toward forgiveness" (closure linkage +1.0). The concept shapes stakes: Milo's goal shifts from simple discovery to patient mapping. Cost is conceptual—he now carries the knowledge that witness accumulates like dust, requiring someone to finally wipe the shelf. Swappability: "quantified grief" would work nearly as well (−0.4).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Moonlight healing is signaled when Milo climbs "toward the stormlit tower by moonlight" (setup +0.4), dramatized when the sextant "straightened...mended" in pooled moonlight (beat involvement +0.6), and enables the subsequent mapping (causal pressure +0.8). The trait constrains Milo's action—he must wait for moonlight and position the sextant correctly. Cost: the healing is described as "an everyday mercy the world sometimes remembers," anchoring magic in patience rather than command. Late first clear use (second half) applies −0.3. The attribute is specific but not entirely irreplaceable—starlight or dawn could substitute with edits (−0.5).</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Deconstruct appears when Milo realizes "to read it properly, he would need to deconstruct the labyrinth of memories, node by patient node" (middle +0.6) and is enacted when "he began mapping scattered dreams, catching loose impressions...each mapped dream clicked into the diagram like a tile returned to its proper corridor" (closure approach +0.8). The action shapes the method and final recording. However, the deconstructing itself is told more than shown in beats; we see the result (visions of child, woman, man) rather than the struggle (−0.6). Cost is implied—time, patience—but not visibly paid on the page (−0.4).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Mapping scattered dreams is signaled when the sextant "began mapping scattered dreams, catching loose impressions from the storm, the trees, and his own mind" (middle-to-late +0.5) and directly enables the closure beat where "each mapped dream clicked into the diagram" (closure linkage +1.0). The method provides the mechanism for Milo's discovery. Cost: the method requires absorbing others' sorrow, and Milo must process "a child lost and found, a woman leaving in snow, a man laying his palm against bark before execution day." Late appearance (final third) applies −0.7. The mechanics remain somewhat abstract—"catching loose impressions"—rather than tactile (−0.4).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The stormlit tower by moonlight anchors the opening (storm on tower windows +0.6), pressures Milo's climb up the hidden service stair during the storm (middle beat +0.5), provides the moonlight that heals the sextant and enables mapping (causal pressure +1.2), and frames the closure image: "by dawn the storm had wandered off, leaving the rooftop washed and humming" (closure linkage +1.0). The setting is irreplaceable—remove moonlight or storm and the sextant cannot heal; remove the rooftop and Milo has no access to both trees and sky. The tower's hollow sound and the maze's inhale ground the magic in architecture.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The pin-drop moment is named as the divergence point ("Later he would swear his real life diverged right there") and triggers Milo's investigation (setup +0.6). The timeframe "by dawn" marks closure (ending anchor +0.4). However, the intervening night is not tracked as tightening pressure; Milo's mapping and recording happen in a summary span without a live clock constraining tactics (−0.8). The storm's departure signals elapsed time but does not force choices. The pin moment is evocative but functions more as narrative hinge than escalating constraint (−0.5).</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Milo's desire to discover what trees witness is seeded early: "Over years, that wondering hardened into his only real wish: to discover what trees witness and carry silently" (setup +0.7). It drives his decision to take the sextant and climb (middle choice +0.6) and is fulfilled when he sees the tree's labyrinthal memories and records them (closure linkage +1.2). The wish is specific and consistent. Cost: achieving the wish isolates him further—he now knows what trees carry, and that knowledge is both gift and burden. Minor: the motivation is told more than shown in conflict (−0.5), though his years of watering and talking dramatize its persistence.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mundane miracles tone is established immediately: "the cracks in reality were easier to spot," sweeping corridors while tracking "opinions" of a maze. The sextant's healing is framed as "not dramatic, more like a tired joint easing after rain, an everyday mercy." The tone holds through the climax—mapping dreams and recording sorrow are described with maintenance-worker patience rather than spectacle. At closure, "sorrow...bent quietly toward forgiveness" sustains the register. The tone charges the final image by making the extraordinary feel inevitable and tender. Modulation is subtle but present: urgency during the labyrinth's inhale, contemplation on the rooftop.</comment>
