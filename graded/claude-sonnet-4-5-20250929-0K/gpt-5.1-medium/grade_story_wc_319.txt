<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The narrator's dimensional homesickness and choice to befriend uncertainty anchor clear motivation, and the guardian's distrust-to-approval arc shows earned change. Interiority is consistently voiced through concrete metaphors (garden as thought, margin note identity). However, the protagonist's agency remains largely passive—observing and accepting rather than driving reversals—and the final acceptance of the pendant lacks visible cost or foreclosed options that would elevate the transformation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (frozen garden, narrator awake, guardian watching) land early. The piece accumulates pressure through layered metaphors (shelves rearranging world, boundaries of light, fog as uncertainty) and delivers Resonant Reconfiguration via Charged Poise: the narrator's "walk while waiting" stance crystallizes a friendship with uncertainty, and the guardian's gift of the pendant reconfigures the threshold from locked to provisional. Cost is felt in the relinquishment of certainty and the acceptance of perpetual liminality, legible in "waiting, uncertain, almost kind."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The frozen garden is grounded early with vivid, selective detail (hoarfrost, marble bench, paper-dust air) that reflects the narrator's interiority. The garden's transformation into thought-objects (bushes as clauses, fountain as question mark) directly enacts the "interiorizing exteriors" method and constrains the protagonist's perceptual stance. The pendant as micro-object charges the closure beat by enabling the narrator's threshold crossing, meeting the 9+ gate for constraint on choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—returning "home" to a dimensional origin—is signaled early and tightens when the guardian poses the binary (walk blind or sit forever naming fog). The narrator's rejection of the false binary and reframing as "both" constitutes a meaningful deepening under the Accumulative lens, crystallizing stance rather than reversing plot. Cost is oblique: the narrator accepts perpetual uncertainty rather than resolution, but the piece does not foreclose a live option with visible on-page consequence, limiting upward reach.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme—befriending uncertainty versus demanding certainty—emerges organically from the garden-as-library metaphor and the guardian's threshold logic. The final image ("waiting, uncertain, almost kind") offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights the opening longing without moralizing. The pendant's "boundaries of light" and the corridor vision enrich thematic texture without template echo. Subtext operates cleanly in the guardian's distrust-to-approval shift and the narrator's refusal of binary logic.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and consistently metaphor-dense, with a perceptual signature rooted in library and dimensional vocabulary (margin note, axis, catalog). The guardian's speech ("voice brittle as frostbitten paper") differentiates her idiom from the narrator's introspective rhythm. Psychic distance remains stable; no head-hopping. The elevated diction ("dimensionally homesick," "foggy lucidity") reads voice-motivated rather than register drift, and the prose modulates effectively under pressure (garden shook, or I did).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high—most lines advance metaphor, atmosphere, and stance simultaneously. However, mild figurative density in the middle third (ember flickering "as if breathing," boundaries "pacing," light "discovering it is also a cage") risks overwriting without clear pattern-teaching. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. The final line ("waiting, uncertain, almost kind") delivers propulsion and thematic closure cleanly, but the mid-story metaphor stacking slightly dulls momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The dimensional homesickness conceit and "interiorizing exteriors" method offer a fresh synthesis of liminality and bibliographic metaphor, avoiding stock portal-fantasy tropes. The narrator's reframing of the guardian's binary into "both" constitutes a non-obvious turn that feels earned in hindsight. Risk-taking in the lyric-accumulative mode heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. However, the cultist pendant and feral guardian remain lightly sketched archetypes, preventing full transformation of familiar elements.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The feral library guardian appears early, applies pressure via the threshold challenge, and participates in closure by granting the pendant. Her distrust-to-approval arc shapes the narrator's final stance. However, her choices (sniffing air, offering pendant) are reactive rather than driving key reversals; the narrator's internal shift does the primary causal work.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The cultist's pendant is introduced early (throat-hung ember), reappears in the corridor vision (middle development), and becomes the closure object when the guardian transfers it. Its "boundaries of light" property directly enables the narrator's threshold crossing. The pendant's symbolic and tactical roles converge at the ending, charging the final image with concrete and thematic weight.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The boundaries of light appear early in the pendant description, are elaborated in the corridor vision ("where brightness discovers it is also a kind of cage"), and recur in the guardian's warning. The concept reweights the narrator's choice to "walk where light forgets its edges," shaping the thematic calculus. However, it functions more as metaphor than tactical constraint; it does not narrow on-page options with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dimensional homesickness is signaled early ("as long as I could think"), frames the narrator's motivation throughout, and converges with the closure stance (accepting perpetual liminality). The trait constrains the narrator's desire for certainty and enables the acceptance of the pendant's ambiguous threshold. Cost is felt in the relinquishment of a final "home," meeting the higher-band requirement for visible tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Wait" anchors the guardian's challenge ("go wander until the mist closes and you discover how long a person can wait"), the narrator's recognition ("Waiting sounded like every day of my life"), and the resolution ("I will wait while moving"). The action reframes from passive endurance to active stance, shaping the thematic turn. However, it operates conceptually rather than through a discrete physical beat, limiting irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Interiorizing exteriors" is explicitly named and demonstrated when the narrator transforms the garden into thought-objects (bushes as clauses, statues as punctuation). The method is tied to how the library moves and recurs in the final line ("the library unfolded ahead"). It shapes the narrator's perceptual mode but does not constrain a tactical choice with cost, landing in mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The frozen garden in mist is anchored immediately and sustained throughout. It provides the spatial stage (marble bench, paths, fountain) and atmospheric pressure (cold, fog, hoarfrost). The garden's transformation into interiorized thought-objects enacts the method and charges the closure. Its physical properties (cold biting through clothes, fog closing) apply immediate pressure, meeting the 7+ gate for constraint and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Through the veil of sleep" appears in the opening (fell asleep inside, woke outside) and in the pendant's ember description ("breathing through the veil of sleep"). The timeframe establishes disorientation and liminality but does not tighten decisions or create a live clock. It functions thematically (blurred waking/dreaming) without altering tactics, placing it in mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The motivation to "make friends with uncertainty" is dramatized late but powerfully: the narrator voices it ("I came here to make friends with uncertainty"), and it drives the refusal of the binary and acceptance of the pendant. Friction between the desire for certainty (locked rooms, fluorescent headaches) and the cost of doubt (perpetual liminality) is legible. The motivation shapes the closure stance with felt cost, meeting higher-band criteria despite late explicit articulation.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Foggy lucidity is established early ("foggy lucidity threading her words, making confusion feel almost friendly") and sustained through the accumulative metaphor density and the narrator's interiorizing method. Tone modulates under pressure (garden shook, frost in throat) and charges the final line ("waiting, uncertain, almost kind"). The oxymoronic pairing (fog + lucidity) is embodied rather than declared, cohering across turns and elevating the closure image.</comment>
