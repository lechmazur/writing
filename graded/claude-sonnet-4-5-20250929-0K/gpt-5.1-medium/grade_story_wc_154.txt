<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's interiority is concrete and embodied—her translation work becomes a crucible for moral choice, especially in the lie she tells about the smudged line. The boy's anesthetic-floating voice and his mother's exhaustion are rendered through gesture and concrete detail rather than labels. Internal contradiction appears when Mara acknowledges the lie as "careful" and "lotus-hearted," showing simultaneous guilt and conviction. The final micro-choice—pocketing the coral and following the gurney—forecloses witness in favor of complicity, with visible cost in her reflected fear.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Mara's reflected face "blurred but undeniably afraid" crystallizes her posture between translator neutrality and emotional graft, with the final image of "unclaimed translations waiting for a tongue" reweighting the shared-anxiety premise. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens—pressure builds through layered sensory detail, the coral's passage from evidence to anchor, and the decryption ritual—culminating in a cadence shift that charges the ending. Orientation is clear by line six (who/where/when), and one meaningful deepening occurs when Mara invents the sea-memory line, narrowing her professional stance and making complicity undeniable.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The atrium's "iodine, wet stone, and sour breath of fear" anchors setting through olfactory and atmospheric specificity filtered by Mara's professional dread. The brain coral fragment functions as micro-setting—its "cold weight" and ridges "fit strangely against [her] lifeline," constraining her final choice to pocket it rather than return it. Sensory hierarchy is tight: distant mortars, greenhouse glass dust, and "jungle hush" of trapped plants all mirror the boy's confined agency and charge the ending image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether Mara will translate consent or shared anxiety—is signaled early and tightens when the boy asks her to read the cast instead of the form. Escalation is driven by Mara's agency: her lie about the sea remembering him forecloses neutrality with visible cost (the mother's choked sound, Mara's pocket-burden of the coral). The anesthesiologist's time pressure and the boy's shrewdly innocent question create a moral calculus between competing goods, and the final image—Mara's afraid reflection—makes the price unmistakable.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the coral's transformation from shrapnel-as-proof to anchor-for-story, never stated directly. The invented translation—"the sea will remember you"—becomes a non-literal answer to the central question of whether meaning can be grafted onto trauma without erasing its origin. The boy's whispered apology to the sea and Mara's imagined reef-around-wound avoid sentimentality by staying rooted in the physical coral and the concrete ritual of cast-reading. The final image of "unclaimed translations" reweights the entire atrium encounter without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>POV remains stable in Mara's professional-yet-implicated register; diction like "unknot words, not sutures" and "lotus-hearted ache" is voice-motivated and consistent. The boy's anesthetic-floated creole ("Will they put the sea back inside me?") carries distinct idiom and goal-driven subtext—he knows the answer and needs Mara to confess it. Psychic distance modulates purposefully: close for the lie, pulled back for the final reflection. One brief elision—"Maybe it was a name, maybe a prayer"—is taught by context and paid off immediately in the invented line.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Information density is high: "coral turned shrapnel by politics" compresses backstory into a single image. Rhythm varies naturally, accelerating through the cast-reading ("syllables backlit by operating lamps") and breathing in the mother's coral-press moment. Minor pattern: "As the doors swung shut" and "Out in the atrium" use similar openings within three lines, creating brief template cadence (-0.2). Otherwise, no loops or scaffold; figurative language (lotus, ghost-letters, tide lines) remains coherent and purposeful under pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of translator-as-confessor, blast-embedded coral, and decryption ritual feels specific and non-obvious; the invented sea-memory line transforms the consent-form trope into a meditation on proxy testimony. The atrium greenhouse setting and the smudged cast as fragile scripture avoid generic war-zone or hospital templates. Risk-taking in the extended lyric passages ("turning plaster into a fragile scripture," "lotus-hearted ache blooming in a place built for triage") heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, justifying +0.3 within-band adjustment.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's choice to invent the sea-memory line (beat two) and to pocket the coral (beat three) are decisive turns that alter her neutrality and charge the closure image of her afraid reflection. Setup is immediate ("reluctant confessor"), middle choice narrows her stance, and closure participation is direct.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The coral appears in three beats: initial tray description, mother's press into Mara's palm (reweighting it from evidence to anchor), and the imagined stitching-back that primes the invented translation. Its "cold weight" and ridge-against-lifeline specificity make it irreplaceable; removing it would collapse the graft-meaning closure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Shared anxieties" shapes stakes explicitly ("what he needed translated were not clauses, but the shared anxieties layered between our languages") and recurs in the final image ("our shared anxieties drifted like unclaimed translations"). It constrains Mara's middle choice—she abandons neutral translation for emotional graft—and charges the ending with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Shrewdly innocent" appears in the anesthetic-voice line ("like he knew the answer and needed me to confess it") and enables the boy's key question, forcing Mara's lie. The trait is labeled but immediately dramatized through his "squinted, considering" reaction and the cast-tap gesture, creating on-page cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Unknot" is seeded early ("to unknot words, not sutures"), recurs in the cast-reading ritual, and underpins the graft-meaning closure. However, the action itself (decryption) could be replaced with a similar interpretive act without fully breaking the story's logic, limiting irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Decrypting the cast is signaled ("Can you read them before they cut me?"), drives the extended middle beat where Mara reconstructs ghost-letters, and culminates in the invented sea-memory line that forecloses neutrality. The method's specificity—smudged ink, tide-line letters, plaster-as-scripture—makes it structurally indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The atrium's mist, iodine smell, greenhouse glass, and trapped plants establish tone and mirror confinement. The setting pressures choice through the anesthesiologist's time constraint and the physical proximity (Mara leaning close, the gurney roll). The final reflection in "misted glass" charges the closure image, though the setting's causal role is secondary to character choice.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The anesthetic window is signaled early ("anesthetic had already kicked in") and tracks through the boy's pupils, floaty voice, and closing eyes, creating urgency for the cast-reading. Time pressure from the surgeon ("muttered about time") constrains Mara's choice. However, the clock itself is not made legible in minutes or countdown, limiting its tactical sharpness.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Mara's desire to "graft new meaning onto old wounds" is dramatized in the invented sea-memory line and the imagined reef-around-wound, directly opposing her job's neutrality. The friction between professional duty and emotional complicity generates the lie's cost, pocketing the coral, and the final afraid reflection. Motivation shapes two beats and the closure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Lotus-hearted ache" appears explicitly in the invented-lie beat ("a careful lie, a lotus-hearted ache blooming in a place built for triage") and coheres through diction like "jungle hush," "ghost-letters," and "misted glass." Tone modulates from clinical atrium-opener to lyric mid-section to fear-reflection at closure, charging the final image without flattening into static mood.</comment>
