<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's internal contradictions and embodied emotion come through strongly: "furiously tranquil," fingers tingling with curiosity despite claimed reluctance, and the breathing-sync moment before acceptance. The choice to pay in years carries visible cost and emerges from prior causality. Minor slips include the curator Myra being slightly underdrawn and some recycled gestural patterns (Myra touching the acorn cap, folding hands). The final choice forecloses the path of walking away with palpable consequence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the protagonist's acceptance of the vortex and decision to reopen the atrium is a Decisive Change with visible cost (years of life) earned by the escalating pressure of the scene. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural—memories and sensory density build to a crystallized choice. Orientation anchors (atrium, protagonist age, egg state) arrive clearly within the opening paragraph. One minor pressure plateau occurs mid-scene when exposition about seed-saver circles and time-seed rumors pauses momentum slightly, but the final beat reweights all prior material without ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The icebound atrium is vivid and purposeful: glass ribs ringing, rimed iron balconies, blue-light cradle, and frost from the egg's breath all charge the atmosphere and constrain the space as sacred/fragile. The oak acorn cap as micro-object reappears with reweighted meaning at closure. Sensory selection (frosting air, grainy time texture, dust motes swirling) sharpens under pressure. The setting directly shapes the protagonist's final choice—the locked drawers and the egg's physical presence force the decision to reopen.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake (whether to accept the vortex and reopen the atrium) is signaled early and tightens through one meaningful reversal: the protagonist's initial refusal ("I came here to catalog and carry, not to meddle") gives way when touching the glass forces confrontation with borrowed memories and the cost becomes undeniable. The escalation is driven by protagonist agency—pressing palms to the cradle, matching breath to the egg—and the price (years of life) is legible on the page. A secondary stake (discovering the texture of borrowed time) braids neatly into the primary without dilution.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: inheritance, wildness versus control, and the price of preservation crystallize through the seed drawers, the egg, and the oak acorn cap without overt statement. The final image—"I knew I would reopen the atrium"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to whether the protagonist will pay the cost, reweighting all prior material (grandfather's legacy, locked drawers, the curator's fifty-year sacrifice). The vortex concept integrates thematically through specifics (memories scraping past skin, fern-fiddlehead time spirals) rather than abstract philosophizing. No late thematic echo or moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>First-person POV remains stable and voice-particular: the protagonist's perceptual signature (seeds as "a second heart," time going "from water to sand") is consistent and charged. Distance modulates purposefully when the egg's memories intrude. Dialogue carries subtext and goal-pursuit cleanly ("Then why did you really come?"). Minor friction: a few elevated-register phrases ("furiously tranquil," "wild serenity") slightly exceed the seventeen-year-old focalizer's plausible diction under peak stress, though they serve the lyric mode and remain legible.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Information density is high, rhythm varies purposefully, and propulsion holds through most beats. The opening line anchors voice and stakes; the final line lands cleanly. Minor issues: a few paraphrase loops ("not grow, redistribute" / "borrowed time" recurs without adding pressure in adjacent lines) and one template-cadence run mid-scene ("They said... You mean... Not grow...") slightly dull momentum. Figurative language ("spiral seam," "tidal hush," "lattice of my own") enhances rather than obscures, though density approaches the high end in the memories passage without quite crossing into opacity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of seed-saving with time inheritance and the hatching-egg frame offers a fresh angle on legacy and ecological loss. Specifics (canvas satchel, numbered drawers, oak acorn cap, breathing egg) ground the concept in concrete particulars. The transformation feels earned in hindsight through the protagonist's sensory engagement rather than late rule-change. Minor friction: the vortex mechanics and "decreasing entropy" phrasing skirt abstraction and feel slightly premise-convenient, keeping the piece from full inevitability.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The heirloom seed saver identity is signaled in the opening paragraph, drives the protagonist's initial reluctance ("I came here to catalog and carry"), and motivates the final decision to reopen (linking seed preservation to time preservation). The character's choices—approaching the cradle, touching the glass, matching breath—create the key turn at closure. High causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The oak acorn cap appears in two beats: Myra touches it as greeting/apology, then lays it on the cradle as offering while explaining the first curator's fifty-year sacrifice. It recurs with reweighted meaning (inheritance, sacrifice) but does not directly constrain the protagonist's choice or appear in the final image. Functional reprise, not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Vortex inheritance is introduced early, explained through Myra's exposition, and directly shapes the protagonist's final choice: accepting the vortex's terms (paying in years) to reopen the atrium. The concept constrains options (walk away vs. accept lineage), alters tactics (matching breath to sync), and lands in the closure moment ("the egg answered... threading strange memories into the lattice of my own"). Strong causal pressure and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Furiously tranquil" appears twice: once describing Myra's demeanor, once when the protagonist mirrors it before acceptance. The attribute enables the final action (steadying breath to match the egg's tidal hush) but does not constrain a choice with visible cost—it reads more as a state marker than a tradeoff. Present in the closure moment but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Reopen" is the stated goal ("you who decides whether we reopen it"), drives the protagonist's internal conflict throughout, and lands explicitly in the final line: "I knew I would reopen the atrium." The decision to reopen is the story's decisive change, foreclosing the path of walking away. This action is the closure unit's hinge and could not be swapped without breaking the arc.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Decreasing entropy" is mentioned once by Myra as the mechanism by which accepting the vortex keeps the world from unraveling. The phrase is not dramatized or shown shaping the protagonist's tactics—it remains conceptual exposition. Present and thematically linked but not causally active across beats.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The icebound atrium under starlight is anchored in the opening line, supplies atmosphere (glass ribs, rimed balconies, numbered drawers), and constrains the scene spatially (the cradle at center, the protagonist approaching). The setting's fragility and sacredness pressure the choice to reopen. Strong setup and closure linkage, though the atrium does not alter tactics mid-scene beyond providing the encounter space.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"After the egg hatches" frames the scene's timing (the egg has already cracked when the protagonist arrives) and creates urgency by presenting the moment Myra said would unlock the sealed cabinet. The timeframe tightens the decision—this is the moment to witness and choose—but does not impose a live countdown that alters tactics within the scene. Purposeful framing, moderate pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"To discover the texture of borrowed time" is stated as the protagonist's true motivation and dramatized through the sensory encounter (air thickening, memories scraping skin, time "from water to sand"). The desire conflicts with the stated reason ("to catalog and carry") and drives the choice to press palms to the glass and accept the vortex's terms. The friction between curiosity and caution charges the final decision with cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Wild serenity" appears in the opening beat ("like a storm humming itself to sleep") and modulates through the piece: the protagonist's initial wariness, Myra's "furiously tranquil" stance, and the final breath-matching acceptance all embody the tone. The tone charges the final image—calm resolve layered with the wildness of accepting an inheritance that costs years—without flattening into a single static mood.</comment>
