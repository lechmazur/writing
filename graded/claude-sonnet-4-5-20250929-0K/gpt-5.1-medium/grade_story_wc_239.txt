<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>No-One's interiority is consistently abstract and philosophical rather than embodied—he "tastes words like a key made of dust and light" but rarely shows contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. His motivation to unravel cosmic illusions and perform spiral arbitration is articulated through reflective summary rather than micro-choices under pressure. The final act of weighing histories "wanderingly exact" demonstrates agency, but the cost remains conceptual rather than viscerally felt. Diagnostic label-speak ("spiral arbitration," "end of history witness") appears frequently without dramatized friction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the opening lines. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: density increases through nested cosmological cycles, the dictionary's shifting definitions, and the circular walk that reveals the chamber. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): No-One places the dictionary at the center, weighs all histories, and the universe unifies—options are crystallized and meaning reconfigured. The cost is conceptual (surrendering multiple timelines) and legible in "only one history, braided from all the others." One meaningful deepening through the spiral walk satisfies the length requirement.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The temple library constrains No-One's ritual walk: corridors fold back, creating the spiral necessary for arbitration. The chamber with nested rings of books is revealed through spatial progression and directly enables the final act. The dictionary functions as micro-setting, handled twice (lectern, then chamber floor) and charging the closure image. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through cosmic scale ("draft against his skin," "candles flare sideways") rather than mundane particulars, fitting the elevated register.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: prevent the universe's reset by unifying diverging timelines before the hiccup completes. Pressure accumulates through the spiral walk, the dictionary's new entry, and the revealed chamber. The hiccup mid-walk provides one tightening moment when "galaxies blinked out and reappeared with slightly different constants." No-One's agency is renunciation ("long since surrendered…such a simple pronoun") and endurance (continuing the walk without flinching), culminating in the weighing act. Cost is opportunity—all alternate histories collapse into one—legible in the final image but not viscerally dramatized.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the dictionary's evolving entries, the spiral's paradox ("journeying inward while walking out"), and the final unification of divergent histories. The piece resists moralizing; spiral arbitration is performed rather than explained. The final image—one braided history from all possibilities—offers a resonant answer to the central question (how to reconcile infinite timelines) without a stated moral. "Wanderingly exact" recurs with shifting weight, and the dictionary's "I" entry charges the ending. Minor slip: some phrasing ("end of history witness," "cosmic illusions") verges on prompt-label language rather than fully dramatized particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-person limited throughout, filtered through No-One's cosmic perspective. Perceptual signature is consistent: he notices dictionary entries, shelf categories dissolving into one another, and cosmological shifts. Diction is elevated and abstract ("resounding hush," "stationary urgency") but matches the focalizer's role as a cosmic librarian. However, register occasionally drifts into placeholder abstraction ("reconciliation of all paths by turning through them in widening circles") that feels more like definition than lived perception. No dialogue to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear with purposeful rhythm and varied syntax. Information density is high in the opening paragraphs. Minor issues: paraphrase loops appear ("He alone remembered the prior designs, the failed corrections, the truces that never held" restates earlier cosmological summaries without added pressure). Template cadence in the middle third: "The universe hiccuped once… Between two heartbeats… No-One felt…" Figurative language is frequent and sometimes stacked ("dust, stone, and the countless scrolls sleeping," "like shy animals," "like a breathing creature") without clear pattern-teaching. No artifacts touch the closure beat directly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of cosmic librarian, self-rewriting dictionary, and spiral ritual offers a fresh angle on cyclical-universe narratives. "Wanderingly exact" and "spiral arbitration" are specific coinages that feel integral rather than ornamental. The piece commits fully to its elevated, cosmological register without hedging. However, the core framing—a lone custodian preserving memory across universal resets—echoes familiar speculative templates (e.g., library-as-universe-memory, time-loop witness). Transformation is present but moderate; the emotional stakes remain abstract rather than grounded in lived human friction.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>No-One is present throughout and performs the key closure action: walking the spiral, entering the chamber, placing the dictionary, and weighing histories. His decision to continue walking without flinching and his final weighing act drive the ending. Early signal (paragraph 1), beats (opening the dictionary, spiral walk, chamber entry, weighing), and closure linkage are all present. Cost is tied to his renunciation of "I" and the foreclosure of alternate timelines. Slight deduction: much of his role is reflective observation rather than pressure-tested choice until the final act.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The dictionary is handled in two distinct beats: opened on the obsidian lectern to reveal "spiral arbitration," then placed at the center of the chamber and opened to "I." Early signal (paragraph 6), mid-scene use (revealing the method), and closure participation (final placement and opening) are all present. Its self-rewriting nature constrains No-One's understanding and enables the ritual. Reweighted meaning: "I" ties to his earlier surrender of the pronoun. Strong integration; approaches indispensable but could theoretically be replaced by another self-updating guide.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Spiral arbitration is introduced mid-story (dictionary entry, paragraph 10) and directly shapes the ritual: the spiral walk is necessary, and the weighing of histories is its performance. It alters tactics (No-One must walk rather than climb or descend) and defines the closure action. Setup arrives at ~25%, development structures the walk, and payoff is the unification. Slight deduction for late introduction and for being partially told ("the reconciliation of all paths…") rather than fully discovered through action. Causal pressure is clear.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Wanderingly exact" appears twice: once describing No-One's pacing pattern (paragraph 5) and again in the climax when he weighs histories "wanderingly exact" (paragraph 40). The trait constrains his method—neither rigid nor random—and is visibly enacted in both the opening movement and the final weighing. Early signal, middle beat (the spiral walk), and closure linkage are present. However, it functions more as a descriptive label than a source of on-page friction or cost. It could be replaced with a near-synonym ("purposefully erratic") with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Unify is the closure act: No-One's weighing of all histories produces "only one history, braided from all the others." Early signal (paragraph 2: "appointed to remember everything"), development (the spiral walk gathers possibilities), and payoff (explicit unification in the final paragraph) are present. The action redefines the premise: instead of preserving memory across resets, he collapses timelines into one. Removing "unify" would break the story's resolution. Strong integration; slight deduction because the weighing mechanism itself is summarized rather than dramatically rendered step-by-step.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Journeying inward while walking out" is articulated as the ritual's paradox (paragraph 18) and structures the spiral walk: corridors fold back, each lap passes closer to the center while moving outward. Early signal (~40% mark), development (the walk itself), and payoff (arrival at the central chamber) are present. The method shapes tactics—No-One must walk continuously without flinching—and the spatial paradox is enacted on the page. Slight deduction: the phrase is more explained than discovered, and the mechanics are conceptual rather than concretely constrained (e.g., no visible cost if he stops).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The temple library is present from the opening and supplies the ritual's spatial logic: leaning shelves, folding corridors, the circular chamber. It constrains No-One's method (must walk the spiral) and provides the nested-ring books that enable the weighing. Early signal (paragraph 1), development (corridors parting, categories dissolving), and closure participation (chamber reveals the blank center) are all present. Micro-setting (the dictionary, the obsidian lectern, the floor arrangement) charges the final image. Strong integration; slightly short of indispensable because the ritual could theoretically occur in another cyclical space.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The universe's hiccup is signaled early (paragraph 3: "poised on the edge of a hiccup") and recurs mid-walk (paragraph 25: "The universe hiccuped once"). It tightens decisions by imposing a deadline—No-One must complete the ritual before the reset—and the candle-flare moment demonstrates its immediacy. Payoff: "When the lurch passed, there was only one history." Early signal, one middle beat, and closure participation are present. Deduction: the timeframe is conceptual rather than viscerally tracked; no countdown or degrading conditions that alter No-One's tactics moment-to-moment.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>To unravel cosmic illusions is stated as No-One's charge (paragraph 13) and drives his ritual: he must weigh and unify diverging timelines. Early signal, development (the walk tests his continuity), and payoff (illusions are unified into one coherent history) are present. Friction is minimal—he performs the task without visible doubt or competing desire. The motivation is told ("His charge was…") rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses. Cost is foreclosure of alternate realities, legible but not viscerally felt. Functional but could be more deeply embodied.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Resounding hush" appears twice: the opening ("a resounding hush spread through dust, stone, and the countless scrolls") and the closure ("a resounding hush pealed outward"). Tone is coherent—quiet, elevated, meditative—and modulates under pressure (the hiccup's "tiny lurch," "stationary urgency"). The final reprise charges the ending by linking the library's stillness to the universe's unification. Early signal, tonal consistency through turns, and a charged final image are present. Strong lyric integration; the tone is indispensable to the piece's effect.</comment>
