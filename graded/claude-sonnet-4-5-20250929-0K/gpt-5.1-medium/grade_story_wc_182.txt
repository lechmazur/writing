<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lysa's motivation to rescue her brother is clear and drives her choices, particularly the final margin-writing decision. Internal contradiction appears in her negotiation with the clerk—she's resourceful yet already surrendered her happiest memory. The brother's loss feels somewhat abstract until the circular chamber reveal, and the final choice to "accompany" rather than "rewrite" reads earned but arrives late. Interiority leans toward poetic summary rather than embodied contradiction under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure. The map-of-gaps pattern builds coherently from diary to clerk negotiation to the circular chamber. Closure is a Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing hybrid—Lysa's margin-answer reconfigures the rescue premise with visible cost (she commits to join him rather than undo the past). Orientation anchors by ~120 words (Lysa arrives post-disturbance, western stacks). One meaningful deepening occurs when she reaches the unlearned-lessons library and the book opens to her refusal; the margin-writing crystallizes options with undeniable pressure. Cost is legible in the final image: she adds a rescue mission to the shelves, forecloses simple reversal.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The mountain-sized bookstore is vividly realized—phosphorescent indexes, crooked shelves, ink turning invisible—and its labyrinthine structure directly constrains Lysa's search method (charting gaps, following skipped numbers). The circular chamber with blank spines charges the closure image. Micro-setting (the diary, catalog cards, the hovering book) functions as tool and constraint. Sensory hierarchy reflects Lysa's professional focus: she notices linguistic artifacts, vein-structures, shimmering script.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early: find the hidden library to understand her mistake and reach her brother. One meaningful tightening: the clerk's conditional exit ("bring back at least one lesson") narrows options before descent. The circular chamber confrontation offers a micro turn (speak across timelines vs. close the book) that Lysa resolves by writing in the margin—a third option with visible cost (she commits to join, not rewrite). Pressure accumulates under the Accumulative lens via the pattern of gaps and the final book's page. The cost is conceptual and relational: she foregrounds accompaniment over erasure, adding a new mission to the archive.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—the necessity of accepting unlearned lessons and the limits of rescue—emerges from Lysa's map-of-gaps method and the margin-writing climax without overt statement. The final image (script branching "like new veins on a leaf") reprises the diary's pressed-leaf map and reweights the rescue premise: she chooses solidarity over revision. The library of unlearned lessons and the clerk's price ("bring back at least one lesson someone else failed to learn") provide thematic scaffolding that the ending pays off. No thematic echo or moralizing in the final paragraph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Lysa throughout. Voice is elevated and lyric ("unheard symphony," "knowledge humming faintly") with consistent diction and perceptual signature (she notices languages, indexes, scripts). Dialogue with the clerk and the time traveler is minimal but purposeful, carrying stakes and asymmetry. The prose maintains rhythm under pressure, though some figurative density ("each following private melodies through the shelves narrow canyons") occasionally slows beats. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high in the gap-mapping sequence. Minor loops appear: "the mountain" is named repeatedly in adjacent lines (paragraph 15, 29), and "she" + past-tense verb runs dominate the descent sequence without taught pattern. Figurative language is dense throughout ("mountain murmured," "air crowded with unshelved melodies") but mostly coherent. The final image ("script shimmered, branched like new veins on a leaf") lands clearly. No major causality obscurement, but template cadence and synonym churn ("carefully resourceful" appears twice identically) lower the score. Apply −0.6 for paraphrase loops and template stems across the mid-section.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The library-of-unlearned-lessons premise is fresh, and the method of charting gaps to find absent sections offers a non-obvious synthesis of linguist expertise and labyrinth navigation. The margin-writing climax—choosing to accompany rather than rewrite—transforms the rescue trope. Risk-taking in the lyric voice and the accumulative map-pattern heightens stakes. The time traveler's brief appearance and botanical diary feel slightly ornamental, reducing full originality. No proximity echoes or derivative plotting.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Lysa translates the diary, maps gaps, negotiates with the clerk, and writes the margin answer—four distinct beats. Her linguist expertise enables the gap-research method and the final script-writing. Causal pressure is present but the character's arc leans heavily on exposition (the brother's backstory) rather than on-page contradiction. Early signal, closure linkage, and beat involvement support mid-high band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The botanical diary appears early (paragraph 10), provides the vein-structure map (paragraph 23), and its pressed-leaf image reprises in the final line ("branched like new veins on a leaf"). Two distinct beats: translation and map extraction. It enables the search but does not constrain a choice under pressure. Lyric reprise reweights closure but the diary itself is not handled or used in the circular chamber. Early signal + closure linkage + two beats place it in mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Rescue missions" is named twice (time traveler's phrase, final sentence) and frames Lysa's goal. It shapes her negotiation with the clerk and the final margin choice (accompany vs. rewrite). Present in setup, middle (clerk's terms), and payoff (adds a rescue mission to shelves). Functional but the concept is more thematic accent than tactical constraint. Two beats, closure linkage, but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Carefully resourceful" appears twice identically (paragraphs 12, 30)—a label rather than embodied trait. On-page evidence: she stakes a table, translates, charts gaps, and negotiates work-for-entry. The negotiation demonstrates resourcefulness with cost (conditional exit), but the attribute itself is told more than shown. One beat with visible cost (negotiation) and closure linkage (the margin choice is resourceful). Mid-5s for functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The negotiation with the clerk (paragraphs 25–30) is dramatized, introduces the conditional-exit constraint, and enables the descent. It drives two beats: the deal itself and the stakes it sets for the ending. The renegotiation shapes her approach (offering work, not more memories) and the clerk's terms ("bring back at least one lesson") reappear conceptually at closure. Early-middle signal, causal pressure, closure linkage. Essential across beats.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Researching gaps" is introduced early (paragraph 21), detailed in the charting sequence (paragraphs 21–24), and leads directly to the circular chamber. The method is specific (skipped numbers, reversed languages, vein-structure pattern) and irreplaceable—no other approach is dramatized. Two beats (charting, descent) and closure linkage (she finds the library via gaps). Strong causal pressure and specificity.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The mountain bookstore is present throughout: phosphorescent indexes, stone bridges, crooked shelves, the circular chamber. It constrains Lysa's search (she must chart gaps, negotiate entry) and supplies the clerk, the unlearned-lessons archive, and the shimmering book. The setting directly shapes tactics (map-of-gaps method) and charges the final image (circular chamber, blank spines, script branching). Setup, development (clerk negotiation, descent), and payoff all depend on this exact setting. High irreplaceability and causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"After the time traveler arrives" is setup (paragraphs 3–4, 9–10) but the timeframe does not tighten tactics. The disturbance is backstory; no live clock or urgency tied to "after" shapes Lysa's descent. The time traveler's visit enables the chaos (scattered archives) but does not create temporal pressure. Setup only, no development or payoff. Functional but replaceable. Cap 4.6 for missing middle and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Finding the library of unlearned lessons is Lysa's stated goal (paragraph 6), drives her negotiation (paragraph 28), and is achieved at the circular chamber (paragraph 35). The motivation is tested when the book offers a choice (speak vs. close), and her margin-writing alters the goal (accompany, not rewrite). Setup, development (negotiation stakes), and payoff (circular chamber choice) all present. Causal pressure and closure linkage. Solid integration.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Unheard symphony" appears in the opening line and is reprised twice ("unshelved melodies," "interior orchestra," "unheard symphony waiting for a forgotten conductor"). Tone is lyric, hushed, and patterned throughout—no tonal breaks. The final image (script branching) is quiet and accretive, consistent with the opening. The tone modulates subtly (from hum to thin air to shimmering script) and charges the ending without overt shift. Lyric reprise reweights the stake; tone integral to texture and closure.</comment>
