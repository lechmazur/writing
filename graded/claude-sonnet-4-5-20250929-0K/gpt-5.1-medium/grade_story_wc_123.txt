<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's interiority is specific and character-particular—"meticulous storm recorder," "habit demanded a perimeter sweep"—and the final choice to become a secret chronicler flows from earlier observation habits with visible cost (anchored isolation, professional betrayal). Embodied micro-choices appear throughout: turning the tube, walking the perimeter, closing eyes to listen. Minor slip: the renunciation of ministry service and acceptance of complicity could be sharpened with one contradictory impulse acting in scene rather than a composed readiness that feels settled too cleanly.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (storm recorder, courtyard, post-curfew) land by line 3. The closure effect reads as Charged Poise/Resonant Reconfiguration: the narrator crystallizes a new role (record pigeon flights, not for ministry but for senders) with felt cost (professional betrayal, solitude weaponized). Causality is clean under an Accumulative/Textural lens—density builds through the tube discovery, perimeter check, decoded message, pigeon observation, and final alignment—with one meaningful deepening when "Simply listen upwind" reweights prior observation into active complicity. Cost is legible in "alone but aligned," foreclosing neutrality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The courtyard functions as micro-setting: the dry fountain rim holds the tube, the perimeter sweep teaches spatial discipline, and the northwestern sky channels the pigeon descent. Sensory hierarchy reflects professional bias—"clicks," "rustle," pressure systems—and the final image of walking upstairs alone charges the space with new purpose. Environment constrains choice: the rogue zone's surveillance gaps shape what the narrator can witness safely.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (integrity versus erasure) signals early and tightens once: discovering the tube raises a choice, decoding "Simply listen upwind" narrows options, and hearing pigeons forces stance crystallization with visible cost (shift from passive archivist to active chronicler for unknown senders). Agency is decision with renunciation: the narrator forecloses ministry loyalty. No antagonist needed; the ministry's absent surveillance and the pigeon network's trust create accumulative pressure under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme (witness as complicity, integrity as alignment beyond institution) emerges through the tube, the pigeon chart metaphor, and the final "alone but aligned" without thesis statement. The closing image—pocketing the tube, walking upstairs—offers a non-literal answer to "how do you stay credible in a surveillance state?" by choosing to record unsanctioned movement. Subtext operates in "storms would come, of metal, of policy, of wings" and the refusal to cross the boundary, only hug edges. Quiet ending earns resonance from prior storm-mapping particulars reweighted as human-mapping.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "observation was my one reliable defense," "let the courtyard sounds sift themselves, like separating static from signal," professional metaphors (sheared, curled, pressure system). Psychic distance modulates purposefully—zooms from courtyard to sky, then inward to role realization—without head-hopping. Diction stays controlled ("progressing laterally," "anomalies accumulated like dust") with voice-motivated formality. Minor slip: a few filter-verb stacks ("I could intuit," "I would record") in reflective beats slightly dull immediacy but do not obscure the lens.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High information density, strong propulsion, vivid figurative language ("storms of movement and surveillance," "veins carrying news through a sleeping body"). Rhythm varies and accelerates cleanly through discovery, decode, listen, observe, decide. Minor deductions: two paraphrase loops—"Recognition fluttered…arrived" echoes "the temptation…burned, but habit demanded" and "between them…came a pulse" restates the listening setup. Template cadence appears in reflective beats: "I was…I lived…I would record" across three paragraphs. These accumulate to −0.6 in Q7 for pattern artifacts, but they do not obscure closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: storm-mapping expertise redeployed to chart surveillance gaps via analog pigeon network in a rogue quarantine zone. The lateral-progress tactic and "storms drawn in flesh" metaphor feel inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in structure (heavy reflection, quiet ending) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Proximity check passes: no famous-line echoes. Minor limitation: the rogue-zone-as-forgotten-pocket premise leans on familiar dystopian templates, though the archivist's professional转用 transforms it sufficiently.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The meticulous storm recorder drives the perimeter sweep, the decoding discipline, the listening separation, and the final decision to chronicle pigeon flights—choices that narrow options and align the narrator with the senders. Present in setup (lines 1–2), middle (perimeter, decode), and closure (record storms of wings). Causal pressure is strong; irreplaceability high (the archival habit enables the perimeter ritual and the static-to-signal listening).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The carrier pigeon's message tube appears in three beats: discovery (glint on fountain rim), decode (cap twisted, rice paper unfolded), and closure (pocketed, alignment sealed). It narrows options by providing coordinates and the "Simply listen upwind" instruction, which enables the pigeon observation and role shift. Reweighted at closure from artifact to alliance token. Irreplaceable: no other object carries the same old-world/analog trust signal in a drone surveillance world.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The rogue quarantine zone shapes stakes (forgotten by monitors, anomalies accumulate) and tactics (the narrator lives there "on purpose" for integrity; the pigeon paths map sensor gaps). Present in setup (exposition block), middle (the boundary traced by numbers, "hugging edges"), and closure (the narrator stays anchored to witness). Causal: the zone's surveillance gaps enable the pigeon network and the narrator's safe observation. Could be more visibly tied to a mid-scene choice for higher score.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Credibly curious" is stated early ("my mind, credibly curious yet trained against fantasy") and enacted in the perimeter sweep (curiosity with discipline) and the courtyard sound-sifting (curiosity enabling the pigeon discovery). It enables the decoding and listening beats with visible tradeoff: curiosity risks exposure, discipline mitigates it. Present in setup and middle; implicit at closure. Could score higher with a second distinct on-page cost tied explicitly to the trait.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Intuit" drives the major turn: "I could intuit their purpose only in outline, the way I read storms before they broke"—the narrator infers the pigeon network's mapping function, which crystallizes the new role. Present in middle and closure. The action is specific (storm-reading applied to movement patterns) and irreplaceable; swapping it for "understand" or "deduce" would lose the professional idiom. Shapes the ending's alignment choice directly.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"By progressing laterally" is decoded mid-story ("progressing by progressing laterally, hugging edges, never piercing the forbidden circle") and shapes the narrator's understanding of the pigeon network's evasion tactic. It matters because it signals how the ministry algorithms are tricked, which the narrator then applies by staying anchored rather than crossing. Present in middle and implicit at closure (staying in place is lateral persistence). Could score higher if the method constrained an earlier on-page choice more directly.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The quiet courtyard at dusk supplies the discovery site (dry fountain), the perimeter for the security sweep, the listening post (fountain rim), and the departure frame (walking upstairs). Micro-setting: the fountain rim is sat upon, the flagstones counted, the northwestern sky sighted. The courtyard's emptiness and the dusk light create the conditions for safe observation. Present in setup, middle (perimeter beats), and closure (upstairs departure). Charges the final image with "layered tranquility…composed readiness."</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"After being followed home for the third night" frames urgency in setup and primes the perimeter sweep. The timeframe is present (post-curfew, dusk turning to evening) but not tightly tracked; no live clock alters mid-scene tactics. It shapes the initial caution but does not tighten decisions after the tube is found. Present in setup and implicit throughout; closure does not hinge on elapsed time. Functional but not essential to escalation or closure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"To nurture integrity in solitude" is stated in setup ("I lived here on purpose, to nurture integrity in solitude") and tested at closure: the narrator must choose between ministry neutrality (integrity as isolation) and pigeon-network complicity (integrity as alignment). The friction is dramatized when the narrator pockets the tube and decides to record for the senders—foreclosing neutrality with visible cost. Present in setup and closure; the desire constrains the final choice meaningfully.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Layered tranquility" is stated at closure ("Layered tranquility settled over the courtyard then, not the blank peace of ignorance, but a composed readiness") and modulates through the story: initial unease ("prickle still moved along my forearms"), disciplined calm during the perimeter sweep, curiosity during decoding, heightened attention during pigeon observation, and final composed readiness. Tone charges the final image by transforming calm from passivity to poised complicity. Coherent modulation under pressure; the closing line reconfigures earlier tranquility with undeniable cost.</comment>
