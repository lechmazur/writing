<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Ilya's interiority is vivid and character-particular ("wisely adventurous," archival bands glowing with borrowed memories), and his micro-choices at the wall and stairway show meaningful deliberation. However, the final refusal—pressing the ruby into the stair instead of accepting the throne—arrives without on-page friction or visible internal contradiction; the decision reads as inevitable rather than earned by competing impulses acting in scene. The body and perception details are strong, but the climax choice lacks dramatized cost or hesitation that would lift it past competent execution.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening moves (Lore Keeper, Cascading Verge, before midnight); the drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural, with density increasing through the orchard, murals, and stairway until the final image reweights the throne premise. The closure unit is a Conceptual Repricing: Ilya's insertion of the ruby flake dissolves the throne and redefines memory governance as refusal rather than control. Cost is conceptually legible—he forecloses fixed memory and the future's plea—but the emotional or tactical price remains oblique, limiting high-band entry. One meaningful deepening (the mural visions, the stairway's archival chimes) tightens options under the lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The kaleidoscopic waterfall, hourglass orchard, and stairway of obsolete operating systems are vividly specific and filter through Ilya's archival perspective (ozone/citrus taste, lenses recording for remembrance). The orchard's upward-pouring sand and the stairway's constellation countdown both constrain his ascent, charging the final moment. Spatial choreography remains clear across locations, and micro-setting (the ruby flake between paint layers, the stair itself) directly shapes the closure choice, satisfying the 9+ gate for environmental constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—reach the unclaimed throne and decide memory's future—is signaled early and tightens once through the stairway visions and countdown. The escalation under the Accumulative lens is a meaningful deepening: Ilya sees the cost of editing memory and realizes prior claimants refused. However, the final choice lacks on-page reversal or visible tradeoff; he acts without hesitation, and the cost (forgoing governance, possibly erasing himself) is implied rather than dramatized in tactical friction or embodied consequence. One tightening is sufficient for this length, but the lack of a live decision beat caps the score.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the particulars: memory governance, the price of editing history, and the value of imperfection. The ruby flake's insertion and the final line ("By sunrise, no throne remained, only memory") offer a resonant non-literal answer without moralizing. The stairway murals and future visions layer meaning without overstatement. However, the phrase "wisely adventurous mistakes" and the narration's framing of "truthful memory" verge on thematic echo, and the resolution's conceptual repricing, while clear, lacks a charged image that reweights prior material with felt ambiguity or contradiction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited with consistent psychic distance; the prose texture is distinct (archival idiom, tech-nostalgic diction). Compression and patterned imagery (hourglass fruits, binary ladders, startup chimes as temple bells) are taught early and support the futuristic-nostalgia tone without obscuring clarity. Filter verbs are minimal, and free indirect style is clean. No dialogue appears, so those bullets are waived. Perceptual signature is strong—Ilya notices through an archivist's lens—and the voice modulates appropriately under pressure. Minor drift into elevated register at the climax ("leased their joy by subscription") feels slightly over-articulated for peak stress but does not break coherence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs. However, figurative language saturates nearly every beat without pattern-taught payoff ("ghosted with obsolete satellites," "liquid prism," "autumn leaves of culture," "starlit roots," "cautious ghost"), creating modest overwriting that slows momentum in the orchard and stairway sequences (−0.5). The final third's clarity holds, so the artifact penalty remains bounded. Stock metaphors ("technological snow," "nostalgic about his arrival") and minor paraphrase loops ("each step replaying… under his boots" / "the murals… shifted from pixelated tableaux to rough… scenes") add modest drag (−0.3). No template cadence or major loops; grammar and pronoun references are clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of archival memory, data-center nostalgia, and the unclaimed-throne premise offers a specific angle on memory governance and refuses the tidy resolution (no one sits; the throne dissolves). The stairway made of operating systems and hourglass fruits are fresh particulars. However, the core frame—protagonist reaches mystical challenge, sees cost of power, refuses it—is a widely used template, and the transformation relies more on vivid setting detail than on non-obvious moral calculus or lived character friction. The piece commits fully to its vision and avoids hedging, but the ending's inevitability and lack of on-page struggle lower the originality score slightly (−0.5 for derivative premise baseline, partial restoration for setting specificity).</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Ilya (lore keeper) is named and his role frames the stakes early. He makes two key choices: peeling the murals to find the ruby and pressing it into the stair instead of claiming the throne. Both decisions alter tactics and drive the ending, satisfying setup, middle, and payoff gates. However, the final choice lacks on-page friction or visible cost tied to his occupation—he acts without hesitation or dramatized tradeoff—so causal pressure and cost connection are modest. The role is essential but the decision could be more tightly bound to archival expertise or internal conflict.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The ruby flake appears at midpoint (pinched between paint layers), pulses with light, projects the final mural, and Ilya presses it into the stairway to dissolve the throne. Three distinct beats: discovery, projection, and closure action. The element's mechanics (syncopating with his heartbeat, igniting murals) are specific and irreplaceable. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage. Slightly late first appearance (past 40% mark) and the element's properties are declared rather than discovered through earlier constraints, capping the score below 8.5.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The unclaimed throne is the named goal from the dispatch and frames the entire ascent. It shapes the dominant stake (reach it, decide memory's future) and the ending directly addresses it (Ilya refuses, the throne vanishes). Setup, development (stairway visions explain why others refused), and payoff gates are met. However, the throne itself is abstract—Ilya never sees it on the page—and the mechanics of "unclaimed" are told (prior claimants refused) rather than demonstrated through a live encounter or constraint. The concept drives plot but lacks physical presence or a second beat where its properties alter tactics.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Wisely adventurous" is declared once in the opening ("Ilya… was wisely adventurous enough to sally forth") but never constrains a choice or imposes visible cost. The trait does not prevent reckless action, enable a unique tactic, or create friction at a decision point. Setup gate met (early mention), but no middle development or payoff; the trait is label-only and swappable with "curious" or "daring." Late mention (after 40% mark) and ornamental use cap the score.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The dispatch instructs "SALLY TO THE UNCLAIMED THRONE," Ilya obeys and sallies forth, and this choice initiates the journey. Setup gate met (first paragraph). However, "sally" as a specific action is mentioned once and then replaced by "stepped through," "began to climb," and other verbs; the story does not return to the sally concept or use its particular mechanics (a sudden charge, a sortie) to shape later beats. The action is functional but easily swappable with "go" or "venture" without structural loss. No middle development or payoff beyond the initiating beat.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The method (peeling paint to reveal murals) is signaled in the dispatch ("the stairway of ascension hid here, accessible only through the peel of paint layers") and enacted in a sustained middle beat where Ilya peels layer by layer, each exposing a different mural until he finds the ruby. The mechanics matter: the number of layers and their content (children, elders, the ruby) create escalation. The method enables the discovery that unlocks the stairway. Setup, development (the peeling sequence), and payoff (ruby found, stairway revealed) gates are met. Strong causal pressure and irreplaceability; the method is specific and drives the turn. Slightly below 8.5 because the method does not return or reweight at closure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The orchard behind the waterfall is described in vivid detail (hourglass fruit, embedded lenses, glitchy lullabies) and the hourglass sands pour upward to "lend him stolen minutes," affecting the timeframe. Setup and middle development gates met. However, the orchard does not constrain a choice—Ilya walks through without friction—and its only tactical contribution is the sand gesture, which is atmospheric rather than a hard resource limit. The orchard charges atmosphere and supports tone but does not alter Ilya's decisions. Payoff is weak; the orchard is not revisited or reweighted at closure. Mid-band for single-beat involvement and tone support.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The timeframe "until sunrise" is introduced via the constellation countdown at the stairway base and referenced once more in the final line ("By sunrise, no throne remained"). Setup and payoff gates met. However, the countdown is declared but not tracked; Ilya climbs without time pressure altering his pace, choices, or tactics. The sunrise arrives off-page, and its mechanics (what happens if he's late) are never tested. The timeframe frames the story but does not tighten decisions. Functional but replaceable; a strong lyric reprise (first mention → last line) lifts the score into mid-5s, but lack of middle pressure caps it there.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The motivation (find the stairway of ascension, then the throne) is declared in the dispatch and drives Ilya's journey. Setup gate met (first paragraph). The peeling-paint sequence dramatizes his search, and the stairway climb continues the pursuit. However, the motivation is never conflicted on the page—Ilya does not hesitate, doubt, or weigh alternatives—so friction between want and cost is minimal. The ending shifts the goal (refuse the throne rather than claim it) without prior on-page deliberation. Middle development (the search) and payoff (the refusal) gates are met, but lack of visible tradeoff or internal friction limits the score.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Futuristic nostalgia is coherent throughout: archival tech as relic (fossilized circuit boards, obsolete satellites, data-center cleaning solvents), childhood selfies in the waterfall, startup chimes as temple bells, and the orchard's preemptive nostalgia for Ilya's arrival. Tone modulates under pressure (the stairway visions darken the mood) and charges the final image (the throne vanishes, leaving only memory). Setup, development, and payoff gates met. The tone is specific, irreplaceable, and integral to the world-building and theme. Strong execution; slightly below 8.5 because the tone is more consistent than dynamically reweighted at closure, and one or two images ("technological snow") veer toward stock nostalgia metaphor.</comment>
