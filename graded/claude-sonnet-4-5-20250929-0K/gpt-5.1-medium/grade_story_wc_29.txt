<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara's interiority is concrete and action-driven: her decision to "interfere" and the margin rewrites show embodied purpose. Internal contradiction appears ("half joking, half acknowledging her unease") and the final gambit—pouring community fracture into subsonic broadcast—demonstrates agency with visible stakes. Minor weaknesses: the cosmic tricksters remain somewhat abstract, and her emotional progression could degrade more visibly under stress. The final choice forecloses a path (passive observation) with cost legible in the window-rattling swell.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (university radio station, Mara, midnight shift) land cleanly within the first paragraph. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: signal mapping over months, the tower-sale announcement, then tonight's interfering broadcast build density toward a Charged Poise closure. The final swell reconfigures the relationship—Mara shifts from interpreter to gambler—with felt cost (equipment risk, defiance of administration). One tightening deepens the stake sufficiently for this length. No causality breaks; the lens holds.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The transmitter tower, studio console, and auxiliary feed constrain Mara's tactics: she patches SUB BASS, toggles the subsonic generator, and the meters sync with the Void. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered: "neon ballast buzzing like distant surf," "dust rained down like gray snow." The tower's "subsonic insistence she felt in her teeth" charges the final image when the Void answers with a window-rattling swell. Spatial choreography (upstairs debate, studio below) remains legible throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prevent the tower sale and keep the Void accessible—is signaled early ("trading student airtime for a classified research grant"). Pressure accumulates through the senate debate overhead and Mara's escalating gambit: she moves from passive mapping to active broadcast with visible cost (whispering apology to equipment, defying the programming director). The final swell narrows her options by answering her invitation, foreclosing retreat. Agency is clear: her deliberate interference reweights the game. One meaningful deepening suffices for this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme—open airwaves as contested commons, mischief as leverage against enclosure—emerges from Mara's actions and the signal's responsiveness rather than statement. The subsonic manifesto ("of pranks that turned cruel when nobody laughed anymore") and the tower's status as tuning fork integrate concept and image. The final swell offers a resonant, non-literal answer: stubborn hope charges the cosmic game without moralizing. Subtext operates in the phrase "setting the table" and the shift from prey to gambler. No thematic echo or sermonizing in the final beat.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct: Mara notices astronomical charts under exit light, hears "the sky thinking aloud," and maps signal flares against campus events. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (closer at the console, wider for the tower's history). No head-hopping; focalization remains stable. Minor slips: "the weight of future internships" briefly tilts into editorial register, and one filter-verb stack ("suspected," "seemed," "did not want") in the trickster paragraph adds slight distance. Diction mostly holds; no voice convergence. The manifesto rewrite anchors voice in action.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Information density is high; most sentences advance character, world, or pressure. Rhythm varies: short bursts during the broadcast ("She toggled," "The meters twitched") alternate with longer contextual lines. Minor loop: "subsonic frequencies" appears three times in close succession without varied function, and "signal" recurs frequently in the opening third without reweighting. One paraphrase: "the Void signal had changed" and "New pulses rode beneath" restate proximity. No filter-verb stack clusters in peak beats; clarity holds. The final line propels with image rather than summary.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The combination—celestial interpreter meets campus activism via subsonic broadcast—synthesizes fresh specificity. The cosmic tricksters framing (mischief as leverage, pranks that turn cruel) transforms the familiar "mysterious signal" trope through Mara's deliberate gambit. Risk-taking: the subsonic manifesto as invitation rather than defense is non-obvious and heightens stakes. Minor proximity note: the tower as "tuning fork jammed into the clouds" echoes workshop metaphor conventions. Transformation is sufficient; emotional arc cannot be transposed without losing the signal-mapping particulars.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara (celestial signal interpreter) drives all key turns: mapping the signal, deciding to interfere, rewriting the manifesto, toggling subsonic, and receiving the Void's answer. Setup: first paragraph. Development: she infers the tricksters' game and decides to "set the table." Closure: her broadcast elicits the final swell, redefining her role from passive to active. Two distinct beats (mapping/decision, broadcast/answer) with causal pressure and closure linkage. High irreplaceability; her specific skillset (charts, subsonic know-how) cannot be swapped.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Astronomical charts appear in setup (second paragraph: "mapped its flares against her astronomical charts") and reappear under emergency light as Mara rewrites her script "aligning verbs with right ascensions noted on her astronomical charts." Two beats, but the charts do not constrain a middle choice or return with reweighted meaning at closure. They anchor her method but do not alter tactics under pressure. Functional across beats; modest causal role; no closure participation beyond static presence.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Power plays (core concept) shape the entire conflict: administration selling tower rights, trustees vs. faculty activists, senate vote, Mara's counter-gambit to keep the tricksters "playing with students" who "occasionally said no." Setup early; development through the debate overhead; closure when Mara offers "a campus daring itself to stay open" as bait. The concept alters options on the page (her decision to interfere hinges on preventing encrypted military channels). Two beats; causal pressure; closure linkage clear.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Cautiously hopeful" appears once as a label mid-story ("Mara, cautiously hopeful, hunched closer") and constrains her tone in the manifesto (hope laced with stubborn defiance). It does not drive a distinct beat or enable/block a tactical choice with visible cost. Present in setup tone and coloring one choice; no closure participation. Functional but replaceable; a character could act identically without this exact trait label.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interfere (action) is the story's pivot: Mara's decision ("So she had decided, tonight, to interfere") launches the entire broadcast sequence, rewriting the script, patching subsonic, and speaking the manifesto. Setup: explicit mid-story statement. Development: the act of interfering defines every subsequent move. Closure: the Void's answering swell confirms interference succeeded. Three beats; high causal pressure; indispensable. Removing it collapses the arc from observation to gambit.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Subsonic frequencies (method) are seeded early ("too low to hear, compressing the waveform"), taught through Mara's slider adjustment and SUB BASS patch, and executed in the climactic broadcast. Setup by the second third; development when she toggles the generator and "circuitry translated her cadence into subsonic frequencies"; closure when the Void answers the subsonic manifesto. Two functional beats with causal pressure and closure linkage. The method's mechanics matter: without subsonic, the tricksters cannot hear her invitation.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>University radio station (setting) supplies resources (transmitter tower, console, auxiliary feed, SUB BASS knob) that enable Mara's gambit and applies pressure (programming director's angry text, debate overhead). Setup: first paragraph. Development: the studio's equipment constrains her method. Closure: the station's contested status (tower sale) charges the final swell's meaning. Three beats; high specificity (this exact setting with its contested tower); indispensable to the conflict. Micro-setting (console, meters) alters tactics throughout.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Timeframe "as the community divides" structures the entire piece: the tower-sale announcement split the campus, tonight's senate debate unfolds overhead, and Mara's broadcast intervenes during that live division. Setup early; development as the debate sharpens ("someone slammed a fist"); closure when Mara pours the fracture outward. Two beats with modest pressure; the division is more atmosphere than clock. Time does not tighten a deadline or alter tactics under urgency; it provides context and stakes but not tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation (to outwit cosmic tricksters) is dramatized through Mara's actions: she maps their patterns, names them "cosmic tricksters," infers they "understand leverage," and decides to offer "messy sincerity" as bait. Setup: explicit mid-story. Development: her choice to "set the table" and make them "have this" campus instead of generals. Closure: she feels "like a gambler setting the table," and the tricksters answer. Two beats; causal pressure; visible cost (equipment risk, defiance). Friction between her curiosity and unease enriches the drive.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Tone (ethereal grit) coheres throughout: "the sky thinking aloud," "shimmer underneath the static," subsonic insistence "felt in her teeth," and "dust rained down like gray snow" marry technical precision with atmospheric strangeness. The tone modulates under pressure—sharper during the broadcast ("circuitry translated her cadence")—and charges the final image: the Void's "long, low swell that rattled the window glass and steadied her breathing" fuses physical sensation with metaphysical exchange. Distinct register maintained across turns; no static mood.</comment>
