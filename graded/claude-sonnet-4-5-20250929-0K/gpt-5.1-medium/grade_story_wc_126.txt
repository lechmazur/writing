<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elio's progression from street violinist to finding "magnificent simplicity" in the greenhouse is earned through his perceptual bias and family teaching about unfinished beauty. His micro-choices—listening harder, playing incomplete phrases, emptying the bowl—embody his values without therapy-speak. Mara functions well as pressure, though her interiority remains minimal. The final gesture with the bowl crystallizes his stance shift with visible cost (renouncing the ask, choosing to listen instead).</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens dominates: pressure accrues through layered imagery (chronic hush, drowned cathedral, diving suits, pumps that refuse closure) until the final beat reconfigures the mendicant's bowl from asking to listening—a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant) with clear conceptual cost. Orientation anchors (harbor city, porthole balcony, sunken greenhouse) land cleanly by ~15% of text. The rainforest backstory occupies ~18% but primes the unfinished-beauty motif that charges closure. One meaningful deepening occurs when Mara's invitation shifts Elio from public performance to private collaboration, narrowing his options toward the ending stance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The sunken orchard greenhouse—glass ribs, diving suits as planters, barnacle-sugared pipes, reservoir pumps that stall mid-cycle—supplies tactile constraint and charges the final image. Spatial choreography (porthole balcony → planks → tilted ruins) remains legible. Sensory hierarchy filters through Elio's acoustic bias: "unanswered questions" in water slaps, "afterring" in silence, droplets as "slow applause." The pumps' refusal to finish cycles directly mirrors and enables the thematic closure, elevating setting beyond backdrop.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—finding beauty in the unfinished—signals early via mother's teaching and drives Elio's incomplete phrasing. Mara's invitation creates one meaningful tightening: Elio moves from public busking (passive reception) to private performance (active collaboration), which enables the bowl gesture. The pumps analogy and sapling's crooked growth deepen the stake without reversing it. Cost is conceptual but legible: renouncing coin-collection (survival mechanism) to adopt listening stance. Under Accumulative lens, one deepening suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—beauty in incompletion—emerges through concrete particulars: stalled bow phrases, pumps that hate finishing cycles, saplings drinking from "almosts," the bowl inverted to listen rather than ask. No thesis statement mars the ending. The final image (bowl catching drops and echoes) offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Backstory about the bonfire tradition (~12% of text) seeds the unfinished-story motif that the ending reconfigures with visible cost. Strong coherence between concept and closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Elio hears "unanswered questions" where others hear slaps, notices "afterring" and "faint murmur." Diction ("chronic hush fattens," "smoke braided the stars," "bruised light") is purposeful and controlled, though density approaches overwriting in early paragraphs. Mara's brief dialogue ("Come to the orchard," "they hate finishing their cycles") carries subtext and distinct pragmatism versus Elio's lyric interiority. Free indirect style remains clean; no head-hopping. Compression under pressure (final paragraph) maintains voice without artifacts.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs. Rhythm varies purposefully, though figurative language clusters densely in the first third ("shell held to the ear," "drowned cathedral," "tired messenger," "smoke braided the stars") without always advancing pressure—approaching but not crossing the overwriting threshold. Minor template cadence in mid-section: "The chronic hush..." "The city does not notice..." "Curiosity, more than hunger..." No paraphrase loops. Final beat is lean and propulsive. Deduct −0.4 for figurative density in setup that doesn't all constrain choice.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Post-apocalyptic musician finds meaning in incompletion: the premise risks cliché but is transformed through acoustic specificity (echo-harbor, unanswered questions, afterring) and the concrete mechanism of pumps that refuse closure. The diving-suit planters and inverted bowl offer fresh material anchors. Synthesis feels earned rather than assembled. Emotional truth (grief processed through unfinished art) avoids sentimentality. No close echoes of famous works detected. Mid-high band: specific and coherent, but the musician-finds-meaning arc remains recognizable without radical reinvention.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elio present throughout; his choices—playing incomplete phrases, following Mara's invitation, inverting the bowl—create all key turns. Acoustic perception enables the greenhouse invitation (Mara hears his technique). Final bowl gesture is irreplaceable and causally active at closure. Setup early, development mid-scene, payoff decisive. All three gates met with strong causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Mendicant's bowl appears in beat 1 (on railing, receiving buttons/petals/coins), returns in beat 2 (Mara drops card instead of coin), and is transformed at closure (emptied, inverted beside pumps to listen rather than ask). Three distinct beats, charged reprise, irreplaceable at ending. Strong integration across all gates with visible reweighting of function and meaning.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Chronic hush" shapes stakes: Elio's acoustic hyper-perception exists because normal sound is muffled, the greenhouse visit hinges on hearing what the hush obscures ("faint murmur of deep machinery below"), and the hush "falters" at the climactic moment. Present throughout, alters tactics (listening harder, playing for fragments), participates in closure beat. All gates met with moderate causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elio's acoustic perception enables him to hear "unanswered questions" and "afterring," which motivates Mara's invitation ("she hears, in his hesitant phrases, the way his bow stalls"). Trait signals early, constrains one key choice (Mara's recognition), but does not visibly limit or cost him in the final beat—he could complete the ending gesture without hyper-hearing. Two gates (setup, development) but weaker closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Unbind" appears explicitly ("letting notes lean toward cadences and then unbind themselves," "letting each phrase unbind from the next") and implicitly throughout (incomplete melodies, refusal of climax, pumps stopping short, bowl's function unbound from asking). Drives Mara's recognition and the ending's thematic stance. Present across beats, charges closure image. Strong thematic integration, though physical action could be more distinct from general incompletion motif.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Family bonfire storytelling tradition appears in backstory (~12% of text), explains Elio's incomplete phrasing method, and the ending echoes it ("He begins a story without words, the way his family once did"). Setup and payoff gates met; method causally enables his playing style. Weaker development gate: the tradition is recalled but not actively deployed mid-scene. Lyric reprise reweights with moderate cost.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sunken greenhouse supplies all key resources: diving-suit planters embody unfinished growth, glass ribs frame the "drowned cathedral" aesthetic, reservoir pumps provide the mechanical analogue that articulates theme, barnacle-sugared pipes ground tactile specificity. Setting enables Mara's work, constrains the acoustic environment (deeper hush), and charges the final image (bowl beside pumps). Indispensable across all beats; removal would collapse story logic and thematic closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"After the rainforest burns" sets backstory anchor and motivates exile/displacement, creating the harbor-city context and Elio's busking survival. The fire's aftermath (ash, syllables of regret, burned sapling tip) recurs purposefully. However, timeframe doesn't tighten present decisions—no clock pressures action. Setup strong, thematic development moderate, but no tactical urgency from time itself. Mid-band: shapes context but doesn't constrain choice tempo.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Desire to find beauty in the unfinished drives every beat: playing incomplete phrases, following Mara's invitation to "see what music the water has not finished," recognizing his task is "not to restore...but to find beauty in the unfinished world," and inverting the bowl to listen. Motivation dramatized through choices with visible cost (renouncing coin economy). Setup early via mother's teaching, developed through greenhouse collaboration, crystallized at closure. Strong integration with felt friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Tone—precise simplicity within lyric register—coheres throughout and charges the final line ("Its hollow no longer asks; it listens, catching stray drops and the small, unfinished echoes of their shared beginning"). Diction remains controlled under pressure; the ending's quiet clarity embodies "magnificent simplicity" without stating it. Modulates subtly from melancholic busking to collaborative discovery. Strong tonal integrity; the piece demonstrates rather than declares the tone. Minor density in early figurative clusters slightly undermines simplicity.</comment>
