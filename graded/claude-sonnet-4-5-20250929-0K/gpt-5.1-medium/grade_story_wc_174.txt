<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's interiority is concrete and specific—"ink dries fastest when people below are on fire" captures both craft obsession and emotional distance. Internal contradiction operates throughout: detachment as fear, puppet shows as reversed confession, the desire to stay clean while choosing staining work. The final turn toward mutual perspective-taking feels earned by prior causality, and the cost of vulnerability is embodied in "made my throat ache." Backstory about the prizewinning short anchors present choices effectively within BRR allowances.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) at closure. The piece accumulates pressure through layered reflection, argument aftermath, and the narrator's confession, then crystallizes in the mutual storytelling exercise that reweights all prior positions. Cost is legible: "orbit together" versus "escape" reconfigures the opening's "blind eye" and the narrator's protective distance. Orientation anchors promptly (dome school, calligrapher, post-argument night). One meaningful deepening occurs when the narrator reveals the festival failure, narrowing options and forcing the final vulnerable exchange.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The decommissioned radar dome functions as more than setting: it "listened," "groaned," and the rotating dish mirrors the narrator's breathing, charging the final image where "our stories chose not to escape but to orbit together." Sensory detail is selective and voice-filtered—"meteor hush," "glow worms of insight," concrete floor and mezzanine walkway anchor spatial choreography. The campfire story stick operates as micro-setting, handled across beats and growing "heavy with the warmth of their attempts." Bars with puppet shows provide purposeful contrast but remain lightly sketched, appropriate for this length.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: whether ethical storytelling can lean away from harm or whether silence/detachment is the only clean option. Pressure accumulates through the documentary students' accusation, Lily's challenge about staying "clean up there," and Marcus's question about quitting. The mutual perspective exercise narrows options by forcing vulnerability and testing whether stories can expose their own cruelty. Cost is visible: the narrator's throat ache, the "half-lit epiphanies that now, finally, dared to land," and the shift from protective orbit to vulnerable presence. One meaningful tightening when the narrator's hidden failure is revealed on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme—whether stories exploit or illuminate suffering—emerges organically from the narrator's puppet practice, the festival failure, and the final exercise. "Silence is the cruelest author" and "stories stain, yes, but we can choose what patterns the stain reveals" avoid thesis statements by anchoring in the concrete festival betrayal and bar performances. The closing image offers a resonant answer: stories that "orbit together" rather than "escape" reweight all prior assertions about distance and purity. The half-lit epiphanies that "refused to land" until the mutual exercise provide a charged pattern without symbolic convenience.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and controlled: "ink dries fastest when people below are on fire" and "meteor hush, the kind of stillness that follows when trajectories barely miss" carry a precise, elevated register that fits an urbane calligrapher. Psychic distance modulates purposefully—close during reflection, wider during group observation. Dialogue feels natural and advances goals: Lily's "while your puppets do the dirty work" pursues accusation with subtext; the narrator's responses carry defensiveness masked as philosophy. Free indirect style is clean throughout. The perceptual signature—tracking silences, negative space, patterns—remains character-specific under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs. Rhythm varies effectively: "Everyone drifted out except Lily and Marcus" breathes after the heated argument; "The applause felt like rain on someone else's drought" compresses the festival betrayal with specificity. Minor template cadence in the reflection sequence ("Years ago I filmed... So I began... There I could test") and one paraphrase loop ("meteor hush" restated as "the kind of stillness") create small drag. The closing sentence's syntactic parallelism ("listened... chose not to escape but to orbit") feels purposeful rather than mechanical. No clarity issues at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of ethical storytelling, radar-dome setting, and puppet-show practice feels specific and non-obvious. The mutual perspective exercise transforms the familiar workshop premise through the stomach-as-judge constraint and the emotional cost shown on the page. Risk-taking in the elevated, metaphor-dense voice heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The premise—can stories expose their own cruelty as they unfold—avoids template moral calculus. The festival failure as reversed confession adds lived detail that grounds the philosophical material. One near-echo: "half-lit epiphanies" as glow worms reads slightly convenient as imagery.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The urbane calligrapher frames expectation early, drives the puppet-show confession and the mutual exercise proposal, and shapes the closure by performing the final perspective reversal. Decisions alter tactics: revealing the festival failure narrows the narrator's defensive position; proposing the stomach-judge exercise forces vulnerability. Cost is visible in "made my throat ache." Present across setup, middle choice, and ending.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The campfire story stick appears in three distinct beats: marking the speaker during seminars, set across the safety rail as the argument continues, and held over the mezzanine then passed during the mutual exercise where it "grew heavy with the warmth of their attempts." Evolving use reweights meaning from rustic scepter to shared burden. Causally enables the final turn by ritualizing the perspective exchange. Contributes to closure charge.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Half-lit epiphanies" seed early as "glow worms of insight that refused to land on anyone," constrain the middle by representing the unresolved argument, and return at closure when they "now, finally, dared to land among us." The concept shapes stakes—whether insight can be earned without exploitation—and the refusal-to-landing arc tracks the pressure. Lyric reprise reweights prior material with cost. Two-gate lyric path with closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Uncommonly serene" appears once as self-description during observation and implicitly drives the detachment Lily accuses. The trait constrains the choice to stay on the mezzanine and enables the calm proposal of the mutual exercise. Cost is oblique—serenity as defense mechanism—but not directly tested on the page. Setup and middle presence; closure participation is thematic rather than causal. Swappable with "detached" or "composed" without major structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The reverse action structures the entire closure: "You will tell the story of our argument from my perspective, and I will tell it from yours." This reversal redefines options by forcing empathy and testing whether misrepresentation creates visceral cost. Directly enables the final turn where "half-lit epiphanies... dared to land." Drives three beats: proposal, Lily's and Marcus's attempts, narrator's final reversal. Cost is legible in throat ache and vulnerability. Indispensable to closure logic.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Subversive puppet shows in seedy bars appear in setup as the narrator's "real curriculum," provide the confession material (festival failure becomes cardboard shadows), and establish the method of exposing cruelty through performance. The mechanics matter: "letting cardboard stand in for whoever I had once exploited" and "test whether a story could expose its own cruelty as it unfolded." Shapes the narrator's ethical framework and the mutual exercise design. Present across all three gates with causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The decommissioned radar dome anchors all action, supplies the mezzanine/floor spatial dynamic that literalizes distance and "staying clean up there," and charges the closure: "the retired radar dome listened, and for once our stories chose not to escape but to orbit together." The dome's history (tracking bombers, "blind eye") mirrors the ethical question. Environment constrains by providing the walkway/floor separation and enabling the listening metaphor. Essential to closure image and thematic resonance.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"In the hush left behind by a heated argument" frames the entire scene temporally and tonally. The aftermath hush constrains by providing the emotional space for the mutual exercise; urgency comes from unresolved tension rather than clock pressure. The timeframe tightens tactics by making the students' doubt immediate and raw. Present in setup and shapes middle choices; closure reprises "meteor hush" to reweight the silence. Two-gate lyric path with thematic cost.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"To explore ethical storytelling" is dramatized through the festival failure confession, the puppet-show method, and the mutual exercise that tests whether stories can "lean away from harm." Friction between wanting purity and accepting staining drives choices: "I think clean is a myth... stories stain, yes, but we can choose what patterns." Cost is visible when the narrator abandons detachment for vulnerability. Motivation shapes setup, middle tactics, and closure stance crystallization.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Meteor hush" seeds early as the post-argument stillness, recurs as "the kind of stillness that follows when trajectories barely miss," thickens during the mutual exercise, and charges the final image where the dome "listened" and stories "orbit together." Tone modulates with pressure: from serene observation to raw confession to collaborative vulnerability. Coherent accumulation that reweights the opening's "blind eye" metaphor. The tone's restraint under emotional intensity fits the urbane calligrapher voice and elevates closure.</comment>
