<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's voice is concrete and embodied throughout—"honest child, the one who held the coats"—with clear internal contradictions that drive the final choice. The decision to split the equation emerges from prior pressure (asylum vs. network survival) with visible cost: complicity in partial concealment. Minor slip: the magical ink "liquefies rigid thinking" functions more as atmospheric conceit than grounded trait, softening the earned quality of the insight slightly.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page as a Decisive Change with conceptual cost: the narrator rewrites the equation, redirecting half the funds to refugee aid while securing asylum, a "living imbalance that favors the broken." Drive lens reads Causal with an accumulative undertow (the lattice of thefts structures the choice). Orientation anchors who/where/when early. One meaningful tightening: discovery of the cylinder → decoding → final split. Cost is legible in the breach itself and its moral weight.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The prep room is vivid and specific—"formaldehyde and whispers," metal table, sterile knives, fluorescent light—and the autopsy cavity becomes the literal site of discovery, constraining the search. The vintage ink pot recurs with reweighted function (ordinary → transformative). Spatial choreography (chest stitches unpicked, cylinder taped to spine) is clear. Does not quite reach 8+ because the room itself does not force a tactical choice at closure; the cylinder's hiding place does.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled immediately: calculate the equation or forfeit asylum. One meaningful tightening when the narrator finds the cylinder and realizes the choice is hers to complete. The final decision—split the data—is protagonist-driven with visible cost (complicity, breach of full disclosure). Pressure coheres under the causal lens. Does not enter 8.5+ because the turn hinges partly on the magical ink's effect rather than purely earned internal struggle.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: the father's "mathematics of a fair trade" mapped as coordinate lattice, each theft paired with mercy. The narrator's final equation—half for the consulate, half for refugees—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing: "not symmetry, but a living imbalance that favors the broken." The ink and the body as puzzle box charge the concept. One slight hedge: the phrase "liquefies rigid thinking" nears overt thematic statement but is rescued by being attributed to the father's voice.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature throughout: "honest does not mean clean, only that my lies, when I tell them, are told in pursuit of the truth." POV distance is stable; diction stays character-particular (mortician's precision meets con-artist legacy). Rhythm modulates under pressure—clipped discovery beats, then the weighted final lines. Free indirect style is clean. No head-hopping. Elision of the decoding process is purposeful, replaced by the felt effect of the ink.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High information density: nearly every line advances character, world, or stakes. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, accelerating at discovery, breathing at reflection. No paraphrase loops or scaffold detected. Minor density slip: "deathly vitality that never quite lets me sleep" is evocative but does not advance plot. Figurative language (ink as mental solvent, body as puzzle) is consistent and earns its space. Opening and closing lines charge the frame cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Premise—con artist's corpse as coded confession, honest child decodes in prep room—feels specific and non-obvious. The "mathematics of a fair trade" and the ink pot as transformative object offer fresh synthesis. Risk-taking (magical realism threaded through procedural mortician work) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Does not reach 8.5+ because the core moral calculus (mercy vs. justice, split solution) follows a recognizable ethical template, even if the execution is vivid.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Present from the opening line, frames the narrator's identity and inheritance. Drives two key beats: initial framing of honesty as burden, and the final choice to write "my own equation." The breach decision is legible only through this lens—honest child chooses a calculated lie. Shapes closure directly.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Appears early (salvaged from apartment), returns at discovery ("unstopper the vintage ink pot"), and its effect ("liquefies rigid thinking") enables the decoding. Two beats: introduction as relic, use as catalyst. Does not reach 7.5+ because the ink's magical function is told rather than dramatized with visible cost—the narrator feels thoughts loosen, but no on-page struggle or trade-off attaches to that shift.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Signaled in paragraph seven, frames the stakes throughout. The consulate's offer structures the entire choice architecture: asylum in exchange for proof. The final decision splits the data to secure asylum while preserving the network. Shapes tactics and closure directly. Cost is legible: partial breach, complicity.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Attributed to the ink pot early ("liquefies rigid thinking"). Appears again when the narrator touches the brush and feels "thoughts loosen... numbers no longer cliffs but rivers." Enables one key turn (decoding the lattice) but the mechanism is atmospheric rather than grounded. Swappable with "clarity" or "insight" without breaking logic. Mid-band: functional catalyst, but the attribute itself lacks specificity and cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The breach—splitting the equation, giving half to the consulate and half to the ghost network—is the story's climactic choice and defines the closure. Introduced conceptually midway, enacted in the final beat. Not swappable; the entire moral architecture hinges on this act. Visible cost: "a cut I make with eyes open in the flesh of his design."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Signaled early ("I stand over his body and wait... in the way he taught me to wait for a mark") and defined on-page ("Waiting actively means watching every detail"). Shapes the middle discovery beat: unpicking stitches, finding the cylinder. Does not drive closure directly—the final choice is writing, not waiting. Lyric reprise possible but not charged at the end. Mid-band: method matters in one sequence.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Present from opening, anchors every beat. The prep room supplies the autopsy cavity, the tools (scalpel, metal table), and the temporal frame (night shift, dawn deadline). Micro-setting: the body and its cavity become the literal puzzle box. Shapes two beats (discovery, final stitching) and charges the closure image ("lies still, yet his last trick breathes on"). Essential to tone and spatial logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>N/A</grade>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stated explicitly midpoint ("calculate the price of my father's last trick... the mathematics of a fair trade") and dramatized throughout. The motivation structures every choice: decode, decide split, write equation. Conflicted pressure: asylum vs. network survival. Cost is felt in the breach itself. Final line ("living imbalance that favors the broken") answers the motivating question with specificity.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Phrase appears early ("deathly vitality that never quite lets me sleep") and recurs in closure ("lies still, yet his last trick breathes on in different lungs"). Tone—forensic precision layered with inherited con-artistry—modulates appropriately under pressure. The oxymoron charges the final image. Does not reach 7.5+ because the phrase itself is ornamental in first use; its conceptual payoff arrives only at the end.</comment>
