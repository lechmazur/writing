<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The reaper's interior voice is concrete and consistent: the child's sacrifice charges his present purpose with visible cost ("the memory cut the reaper instead"), and his micro-choices (playing recordings, arranging salt crystals, naming fears) show contradictory impulses—harvesting function versus tender witness. Embodiment is strong ("chest had felt like a hollow instrument") and the final hope for the boy reads earned. Minor slip: the shift from scythe-wielder to cartographer could be more causally linked to the child's sacrifice on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through each named fear crystallizing into a shard, culminating in the reaper's hope for the boy—a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) where his ongoing witness forecloses the harvesting path with visible cost. Orientation anchors (observatory, dusk, retired reaper) arrive early. One tightening—the ritual repeated "again and again"—deepens the dominant stake (naming to translate sacrifice's echo). Cost is felt in "tenderness he barely recognized" and the endless vigil.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The observatory's cracked lenses, scattered light, and dome constrain the ritual: light must scatter to coax fears forward, salt crystals form the geometry. The lantern "strictly refused to die" charges the final image of ongoing work. Sensory hierarchy is strong (grainy whispers, trembling constellations, inkish shapes). Minor slip: the cellar recordings are mentioned but not spatially integrated into the ritual's choreography.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—naming nameless fears to translate sacrifice's echo—is signaled early and tightens through each fear crystallized. The reaper's agency is renunciation with visible cost: he "never sought to destroy them; that was not the work of a heartbroken reaper." The child's memory forecloses the harvest path and the hope for the boy reweights all prior naming. One meaningful deepening (each creature pinned) under the accumulative lens is sufficient and the cost is unmistakable.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme—sacrifice's echo seeking translation, witness over destruction—emerges from particulars: the child's trade, each fear crystallized, the boy's imagined future. The ending offers a non-literal answer through the image of "nameless songs" sent up and received. Subtext operates in "tenderness he barely recognized" and the reaper's hope without resolution. No moralizing; the work is open-ended and charged. The atlas page and salt shards anchor the thematic weight without symbolic convenience.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct: the reaper notices through old recordings, scattered light, and crystallization—filters shaped by grief and cartographic purpose. Diction remains controlled and consistent ("distant intimacy," "quavers," "inkish body") with purposeful compression. No head-hopping; single POV held throughout. Rhythmic modulation supports pressure: shorter clauses during the ritual, longer reflection on the child. No filter-verb stacks or template cadence in peak beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Information density is high; sentences multi-task (e.g., "He believed that the echo of sacrifice still rang in every trembling heartbeat, asking quietly to be translated" advances motive, theme, and stakes). Rhythm varies naturally; no runs of identical stems. Minor slip: "He had come back for one reason only" is scaffold that the next line already conveys. A few near-paraphrases ("voices that no living throat remembered" / "echoes forgotten phrases") slightly dull propulsion but do not obscure closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The synthesis—grief-driven reaper as cartographer of human terror, crystallizing fears through scattered light and old recordings—is specific and non-obvious. The atlas page transforms the sea-monster trope into psychological mapping with earned cost. Risk-taking (lyric accumulation, no traditional antagonist, open vigil as closure) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The final hope for the boy feels inevitable in hindsight. Proximity check passes; no close echoes of famous lines.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The heartbroken reaper's choices drive all beats: climbing to the observatory, playing recordings, arranging the ritual geometry, naming each fear, setting shards on the atlas, and continuing the vigil. His alteration—from harvester to witness—is earned by the child's sacrifice and forecloses the scythe path with visible cost. Present in setup, middle ritual, and closure hope. Irreplaceable: only a reaper carries the authority to name death's echoes.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The atlas page with sea monsters appears in setup (drawn from the folio), is handled during the ritual (shards set upon it), and the final image notes "one blank gulf now bore a tiny, glimmering reef of fear." It anchors the cartographic metaphor and receives the crystallized fears. Two distinct beats, early signal, closure linkage. Cap at 6.9: mid-scene use is positional (the page lies beneath light) rather than causally transformative; removing it would weaken the map metaphor but not break the ritual's logic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The echo of sacrifice shapes the reaper's motive (he interprets every heartbeat as asking to be translated), drives his chest's hollow note of regret, and reweights the ending when he wonders which creature the boy carries. It alters tactics: he witnesses rather than harvests. Present in setup (the child's sacrifice cracked his purpose), middle (each fear is an echo), and closure (hope for the boy). Causal pressure and cost connection are strong; specificity is high.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Echoes forgotten phrases" appears in the recordings' grainy whispers and the dome's repetition of quavers. It enables the fears to coalesce ("each voice curled around the pillars, seeped into the stone, and returned as echoes") and charges the ritual. Present in setup and middle beats. Cap at 5.8: the trait is atmospheric and constrains the ritual's method, but swapping "echoes" for "reverberations" or "residues" would not break story logic; it lacks irreplaceable specificity at closure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Crystallization is the ritual's pivot: each fear transforms from inkish shape to translucent shard, pinned on the atlas. The action redefines the reaper's work from harvest to witness, anchors the accumulative structure, and charges the final image (glimmering reefs, ongoing songs). Present in middle beats and shaping closure. High causal pressure: the story's logic depends on this exact transformation to earn the reaper's new purpose and the boy's potential freedom.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Scattered light is signaled early ("It was through scattered light, he had learned, that unnamed things were willing to step forward") and used in the ritual: the lantern's flame scatters through cracked lenses to coax fears into visibility. The method shapes tactics (he must arrange the geometry, raise the lantern) and is present in the closure image (the boy standing "somewhere lit by scattered lantern light, unafraid"). Two beats, causal pressure, closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The ancient observatory at dusk supplies the dome for echoes, cracked lenses for scattered light, and the height ("this height") the reaper climbed to after the cellar. It constrains the ritual's geometry and charges the final image (the reaper "kept listening as the world sent up its nameless songs"). Present in setup, middle (spatial anchors), and closure. The setting is essential to the ritual's acoustics and vertical metaphor (ascent from cellar, world below sending songs up).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The timeframe "after finding the old recordings in the cellar below" anchors the inciting move (he climbed back) and primes the ritual. The recordings enable each fear to appear. Present in setup and middle beats. Cap at 6.4: the timeframe is causal (recordings → ritual) but not a live pressure; the story's present tense is open-ended vigil without a ticking clock. Swapping "after finding" for "after stealing" or "after hearing" would not alter the ritual's structure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The motivation—to give names to nameless fears—drives every beat: the climb, the ritual setup, each naming, the hope for the boy. It is dramatized in choices (arranging geometry, speaking softly, setting shards) and conflicted by the cost (his chest's hollow note, tenderness barely recognized). Present in setup ("He had come back for one reason only"), middle (repeated naming), and closure (hoping the boy might stand unafraid). Friction between purpose and grief is visible; the work is unending.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distant intimacy is coherent throughout: the air carries it ("like a conversation overheard through several walls of time"), the recordings spill grainy whispers, and the reaper's hope for the boy is tender yet removed. Tone modulates with the ritual's pressure (shorter clauses during crystallization, reflective cadence at closure) and charges the final image ("the world sent up its nameless songs"). The tone is purposeful and held without static uniformity.</comment>
