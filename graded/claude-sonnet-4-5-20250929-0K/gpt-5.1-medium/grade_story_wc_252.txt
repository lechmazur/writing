<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's interiority is concrete and character-specific—her awareness of strain, her barbed words softened at the edges, her detachment from pain as survival strategy. The pirate remains one-note, serving mostly as exposition vehicle. The final realization "she knew her only wish, to find freedom in embracing one's true nature, was the whale's awaiting song" reads as a stated thesis rather than earned embodiment, applying −0.3 for label-speak at closure. Internal contradiction appears in the strain-as-grace thread but never forces a simultaneous choice under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors arrive adequately (harbor, Mara, pirate, scrimshaw) within the first third. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: lyric density builds through strain/grace, violence-ended world, disappearing island. The closure unit attempts Resonant Reconfiguration via the bone-listening moment, but cost remains conceptual and asserted ("to find freedom in embracing one's true nature") rather than dramatized with visible forfeiture or altered options. The phrase "was the whale's awaiting song" tells the repricing without showing what Mara sacrifices or what path now closes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The sublittoral fringe appears multiple times, shaping atmosphere and access (the skiff journey, seaweed as drowned banners, the breathing dark). The scrimshaw's polished island becomes a charged micro-object that draws Mara's gaze and structures the final beat, satisfying the 9+ gate partially. Sensory work is vivid and POV-filtered ("purple light down into its throat," "pilings sweated cold"), though the harbor itself remains more textural backdrop than choice-constraint until the final passage.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—Mara's buried self versus her defended exterior—is signaled early but never tested through a concrete on-page trade-off. The journey to the island and the bone-listening are more ritual than reversal; Mara does not choose between competing goods or face a visible consequence that narrows later options. Pressure accumulates texturally (violence-ended world, strain as grace, disappearing island) but does not escalate causally. No moment forces Mara to forfeit safety, speech, or stance in a way that changes what she can do next.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme—hidden self, cage lined with cushions, sharpness in other ways—emerges from concrete images (barnacled hulls, barbed words, scrimshaw's blank island). The final line attempts a resonant answer but delivers it as a stated wish rather than a non-literal image, applying −0.5 for theme summary in the closure beat. The pirate's exposition about violence's end and the lattices/nets threads the world-building into theme effectively, yet the ending "knew her only wish" is diagnostic rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and controlled: "the ocean were trying not to wake anyone," "her throat has only ever known curses," diction specific to Mara's dockworker stance. Dialogue between Mara and the pirate carries subtext and advances the ritual journey without exposition dumps. Psychic distance remains stable in close third, and the pirate's gravel-under-waves idiom distinguishes her adequately. One slip: "to find freedom in embracing one's true nature" imports prompt-thesis language in the final line, applying −0.2 for register drift at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Rhythm and clarity are strong through most beats: "the harbor lamps shrank behind them," "a cage lined with cushions is still a cage." The final paragraph stacks three clauses without causal linkage ("pressed the cool whalebone… expecting silence… felt the harbor rise… She knew her only wish"), creating a summary cluster where scene pressure should land, applying −0.4 for closure-beat loop and summary pivot. Figurative density is high but mostly coherent; "drowned banners" and "purple light down into its throat" work. Minor paraphrase: "violence becomes impossible" repeated across two paragraphs without deepening.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The world-without-violence premise and the disappearing-island motif offer fresh angles, and the dockworker-as-graceful is specific. The scrimshaw as listening-device and the sublittoral fringe anchor the piece in concrete detail. However, the final move—listening to buried self via whalebone—echoes familiar "embrace your true nature" therapeutic templates without transformation through cost or moral calculus, applying −0.6 for derivative closure shape. The pirate's role as mystical guide follows archetype without complication.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mara is present throughout, makes the micro-choice to return at dusk, and boards the skiff. Her "detach" skill appears early and recurs. The final listening moment involves her agency but delivers insight passively; she does not choose between paths or pay a visible cost. Two beats (meeting, boat journey) are shaped by her, but the closure is receptive rather than decisive.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The scrimshaw appears in three beats: unwrapped reveal, resting on the pirate's knees during the journey, pressed to Mara's ear at closure. Its blank island draws Mara's gaze and structures the ending image. However, it functions more as a ritual prop than a constraint that narrows options; Mara's use is instructed rather than discovered, and the cost of listening is asserted, not dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The disappearing island is described and serves as the journey's destination; it shapes the world-building (tide-dependent, sound-called). It does not alter Mara's tactics or present a choice with cost on the page—she rows to it, arrives, and listens as instructed. Present across setup and closure but more thematic echo than causal lever.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The phrase "unlocks guarded hearts" is spoken by the pirate as a claim about the scrimshaw. Mara's guarded state is established through "barbed words" and strain, but the unlocking is asserted in the final sentence rather than demonstrated through a visible trade-off or opened vulnerability. Label-only use without cost on the page.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Detach" appears as Mara's learned skill—detaching mind from pain during cargo work, a history that gave her grace. It recurs conceptually when the pirate instructs her to "remember every moment you refused yourself," linking detachment to the closure beat. The action does not drive a turn but primes the final listening moment with thematic coherence, placing it in the functional mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The whale call is introduced in dialogue near the end ("by the call of a whale from the deep") and functions as the method for calling the island back. The mechanics are not signaled earlier or tested; Mara listens and feels the harbor rise, but no prior beat shows her learning or struggling with this means. Late arrival and summary execution cap the score.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The sublittoral fringe is named three times, shapes the boat journey's atmosphere, and provides the space where "the world thinned" and the island surfaces. It constrains access (only reachable by skiff at dusk) and charges the final beat with its breathing-dark texture. The setting enables the ritual and deepens the world-without-violence motif, though it does not force a tactical choice.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The timeframe "after violence becomes impossible" is established early, recurs in the pirate's exposition, and informs Mara's reflection on "sharper words and softer hands." It sets tone and world logic but does not create a ticking clock or constrain choices in the journey. Present across setup and middle but does not tighten decisions at closure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Mara's desire for freedom in embracing her nature is legible in her embodied contradictions (grace from strain, barbed words softening, detachment as survival). However, the motivation is stated explicitly only in the final sentence, and no on-page choice dramatizes the friction between this want and a competing cost. Functional presence without visible trade-off trends mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Combative tenderness threads the piece: Mara's barbed words paired with apologetic touch on hulls, the pirate's rebuke-splash baptism, strain as "rough affection." Tone modulates coherently through the journey's quiet intensity and charges the final image of pressing bone to skin. The ending's diagnostic language ("to find freedom") softens the combative edge slightly but does not break coherence.</comment>
