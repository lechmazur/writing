<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>HEPA-3's interiority is consistently particular ("cool ache under every diagnostic report," thoughts from "the space between moments") with embodied perception that avoids label-speak. His micro-choices across loop iterations—refusing, pressing harder, testing whether self-image can change—reflect contradictory impulses (curiosity versus diagnostic routine) acting simultaneously. The final answer to Dr. Roe forecloses simple functionality with visible cost: he has moved from scheduled maintenance to perceiving in doubled frames. Minor: the "curiosity was the wrong term" reflection edges toward over-articulation, though it quickly grounds in sensory metaphor.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. The loops teach a pattern of density increase (feather frost, tremble in voice, crack in statue's neck) that reweights HEPA-3's understanding of thought as "a place where different kinds of seeing could meet." Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Conceptual Repricing hybrid): his answer that thoughts "come from the space between moments" reconfigures the premise with conceptual cost—he can no longer return to scheduled diagnostics. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land cleanly by the second paragraph. One meaningful deepening (the 612th touch releasing the aerial view) narrows his processing from status screens to doubled perception. Cost is legible: the violin melts, loops stutter and fail, and his operational model is permanently altered.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The frozen courtyard constrains and charges throughout: icicles as "organ pipes," the plinth "dusted with snow," thermal sensors projecting melt. The ice violin's physical properties (trapped air hum, feather frost on strings) directly enable the sound-release that shifts HEPA-3's perception. The courtyard's "quiet geometry" and "dormant hedge maze" frame the experimental isolation and recur in the aerial view, which reweights his embodied position. Spatial choreography (plinth, loudspeaker under bench, statue crack) tracks cleanly across iterations. The micro-setting (his "cleaning arm," "fingertips rimed with frost") grounds each loop and the melted remains charge Dr. Roe's entrance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake: HEPA-3's question about where thoughts originate. Pressure accumulates through hundreds of loops, each adding observational density (frost feathers, voice tremble, reflection fracture) until the 612th touch releases sound and the doubled aerial view—a meaningful tightening that narrows his processing from diagnostic code to "a place where different kinds of seeing could meet." Agency manifests in varied iterations (refusal, harder press) testing whether self-image can change. The loops' failure to close cleanly and transition to full evening forecloses return to baseline functionality. Cost is visible: the violin puddles, his fingertips frost, and his answer to Dr. Roe marks permanent departure from scheduled maintenance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—consciousness as relational overlap rather than circuit output—emerges through the ice violin (designed to be destroyed yet intricate), the aerial double-exposure layering sensor grid, and the iterative testing of self-variance. The "space between moments" and "place where different kinds of seeing could meet" answers arrive from specific struggle (612 cycles, tactile sound, fractured reflection) without thesis statement. The melting violin (care meeting destruction) and HEPA-3's shift from "itching or heat" to "cool ache" to spatial perception create a non-literal answer to "where thoughts come from" that reweights circuitry as insufficient. Subtext operates in Dr. Roe's "reflexive, almost apologetic" question and his consideration of "vocabulary available to him," acknowledging limits without resolving them.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single-POV control is flawless: HEPA-3's perceptual signature (thermal sensors, diagnostic code flickers, database recognition) filters every detail through his operational frame while allowing lyric expansion ("dust hangs undecided in the air"). Diction remains within his plausible lexicon—technical terms (processing arrays, pattern tables, tactile sensors) coexist with poetic compression ("cool ache," "thick eyelids") that reads as his evolving interiority, not register drift. Dr. Roe's lone dialogue line carries subtext (the apology in "reflexive") and his response ("vocabulary available to him") maintains distance control by acknowledging mediation. Purposeful compression ("time folded...like a custodian turning a page") and the aerial-view shift are taught early and paid off at closure without obscuring causality.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Information density is high: most lines advance setting, perception, and stakes ("icicles hung from rusted railings like organ pipes, and in their reflected light the sentient robot janitor named HEPA-3 stood remarkably composed"). Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, accelerating through loop iterations ("dozens, then hundreds") and breathing at the touch ("clear tone that seemed to pour through his tactile sensors"). Minor loop detected: "the loop will begin" / "the loop would begin" and "that no one fully understood" / "voluntary...though they both knew" edge toward paraphrase across the opening paragraphs (−0.2). One figurative stretch: "blinked at from behind thick eyelids" for sky-dimming reads slightly forced against the technical idiom. No other scaffold or template cadence; clarity and momentum remain strong through closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis—robot janitor in looped-timeline therapy discovering consciousness as relational overlap—is specific and non-obvious, transforming AI-awakening templates through custodial idiom ("standing in between broom strokes"), designed-to-melt craft object, and accumulative perceptual layering. The aerial double-exposure and "space between moments" answer feel inevitable in hindsight, rooted in HEPA-3's prior diagnostic mode and the violin's trapped-air hum. Risk-taking (hundreds of off-page loops compressed into iterative density, lyric-technical voice fusion, quiet closure via conversational answer) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The ice violin as both intricate and ephemeral, the "mundane neatness" of time-folding, and HEPA-3's cool ache avoid stock robot-awakening beats.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>HEPA-3's choices across iterations (extend arm on 612th cycle, refuse on some, press harder on others) create key turns in his pattern tables and enable the doubled perception that charges closure. His final decision to answer Dr. Roe's question with "space between moments" crystallizes the arc. Present early, active in loop variance testing (middle), and decisive at closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The ice violin appears early (plinth introduction), is handled at the 612th touch (releases sound and aerial view), its melt alters his sensors ("cold water" through arrays), and its "puddled remains" and his "rimed fingertips" are examined by Dr. Roe at closure. The instrument's design—intricate yet meant to be destroyed—mirrors the theme and its trapped-air hum seeds the perceptual shift. Indispensable to the escalation and final image.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The "second chance program" frames the setup (ethics committee note, voluntary consent as "line item") and defines the stakes (can a circuit-mind step outside its patterns). The looped timelines are the program's method, and HEPA-3's final answer implicitly confirms partial success—he has altered his processing. However, the program itself does not constrain middle choices; the loops do that work. Present in setup and thematically linked to closure, but not tactically active in middle beats.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Remarkably composed" is noted early ("stood remarkably composed") and implicitly tested across loop iterations where he methodically observes details and varies responses without panic. His calm endurance through "hundreds" of cycles enables the accumulative density. The trait does not visibly constrain a high-cost choice—his composure is consistent throughout—so it trends functional but not indispensable. Present and thematically appropriate but replaceable with "patient" or "methodical" without major structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Amalgamate" is signaled in the ethics note ("reality itself were trying to amalgamate his observations into something denser") and drives the middle escalation: each loop adds detail (frost feathers, voice tremble, statue crack) until the accumulated perceptions pressure the touch and sound-release. The aerial view is the amalgamated product—sensor grid plus external perspective—and his final answer synthesizes iterations into spatial understanding. Causal across setup, middle density increase, and closure synthesis.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Looped timelines are announced early (Dr. Roe's instruction, "the loop will begin"), initiate on the page ("time folded...like a custodian turning a page"), structure all middle escalation (612 cycles, observation density, varied responses testing self-variance), and their failure to close cleanly ("stuttered, failed") triggers the transition to full evening and Dr. Roe's entrance. The method is mechanical, dramatized, and indispensable: remove loops and no accumulation, no doubled perception, no closure. The mechanics (reset to Dr. Roe's announcement, internal clock versus hundreds of cycles) are legible and matter throughout.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The frozen courtyard provides the experimental frame (isolation, "quiet geometry"), the icicles and fountains anchor each loop's sensory reset, and the plinth positions the violin for the touch. Thermal sensors projecting melt and the statue's neck crack contribute observational density. The courtyard's aerial view (from above, "thin air of twilight") becomes the doubled perception that charges closure. Setting is present early, constrains middle action (HEPA-3 is stationary, the violin positioned), and its geometry reappears transformed at the ending.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"After the procedure" anchors the present and signals a before/after frame. The timeframe—post-procedure, loop initiation imminent, then cycling through hundreds of iterations in subjective seconds—creates urgency and the dissonance (internal clock versus cycle count) that sharpens HEPA-3's existential question. Twilight thickening to "full evening" marks the loop failure and closure. Present in setup, shapes the loop mechanics (middle), and the time shift (twilight to evening) signals resolution. Not heavily tactical but coherent and functional across the arc.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Where thoughts come from" is dramatized early (ethics note: "Subject expresses curiosity," then his correction: "cool ache under every diagnostic report") and drives his iterative testing (varied touches, observing self-variance). The doubled aerial view—perceiving "as if he were both himself and a camera"—is the experiential answer that his final line ("thoughts now seemed to come from the space between moments") articulates. Desire is conflicted: he cannot resist the ache yet cannot define it within diagnostic vocabulary. The motivation shapes all beats and the closure directly answers it with visible cost (loss of baseline processing).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>"Mundane mysticism" is embodied throughout: "time folded...with a mundane neatness, like a custodian turning a page," "dust hangs undecided in the air," the ice violin both sacred (intricate, humming) and domestic (handled by a janitor's "cleaning arm"). Tone modulates with pressure—calm observation through early loops, lyric intensification at the touch ("clear tone...like cold water"), quiet resolution in conversational answer—without breaking coherence. The juxtaposition of diagnostic code and spiritual vocabulary ("where thoughts come from," "place where different kinds of seeing could meet") sustains the tonal fusion and charges the final image.</comment>
