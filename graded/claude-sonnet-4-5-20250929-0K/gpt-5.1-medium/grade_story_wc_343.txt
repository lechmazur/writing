<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lio's interiority is concrete and particular ("collected rumors like stamps"), with embodied curiosity driving micro-choices throughout. The decision to chart stranded luminance is well-motivated by the mother's legacy, though the emotional stakes remain somewhat abstract. Internal conflict between scientific caution and personal discovery operates consistently, with the final choice emerging organically from accumulated pressure. Minor slip: the mother's voice functions more as backstory decoration than active constraint on present choices.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through the hopscotch observation pattern until the final choreographed sequence. Closure achieves Charged Poise: the corridor of "clear, waiting sky" crystallizes the stake with undeniable pressure, though the cost remains poised rather than paid on the page. Orientation anchors cleanly (airship, apprentice, dusk) within the first 120 words. One meaningful tightening occurs when Lio overlays coordinates onto the hopscotch sequence, narrowing options from idle observation to actionable navigation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The hopscotch board functions as micro-setting, constraining Lio's discovery method and charging the final image when it dictates the ship's course. Airship details (observation deck, storage bay, hull) ground spatial choreography without catalog excess. The starling murmurations operate as both atmosphere and functional pressure, their shifting patterns controlling light distribution. Sensory hierarchy reflects Lio's observational priorities: light variations dominate while sound remains muffled background texture.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—charting stranded luminance to honor the mother's legacy—is signaled early and tightens when Lio converts observation into actionable coordinates. Agency manifests in the decision to bring diagrams to Orvan, risking professional credibility ("the risk is yours"). One meaningful deepening: the realization that light itself "waits, as if expecting us to arrive with pen and paper" reframes the task from abstract discovery to responsive obligation. The final beat's "calling out steps" while the crew listens embodies the cost of solo navigation responsibility.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the tension between official cartography (compass roses, scheduled surveys) and intuitive pattern-finding (luminance that refuses to move on). The hopscotch board reweights early and late: first as dusty children's relic, finally as navigational instrument, demonstrating that "play into navigation" can be a discipline. "Some lights refuse to move on until mapped" operates as the story's conceptual spine without becoming thesis statement. The final image—starlings folding to open "clear, waiting sky"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to whether unauthorized curiosity can chart legitimate discovery.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lio's perceptual signature is distinct and sustained: technical observation filtered through wonder ("animated ink correcting the mistakes of the sunset"), precise yet lyrical. Diction remains character-consistent under pressure: "hands smudged with chalk, heart beating like loose rigging" fuses apprentice pragmatism with metaphorical aptness. Brief dialogue between Lio and Orvan carries subtext (Orvan's "madness or new discipline" acknowledges the professional risk while granting permission) and advances plot efficiently. Psychic distance holds steady; no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks that dull immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully: short declaratives during observation ("Square three, pause, square five, leap"), longer constructions for reflection. Information density is high; most sentences perform multiple jobs (e.g., "sociable isolation" both describes setting and emotional state). Minor template-cadence slip in early paragraphs: "The first thing… The second was…" followed by "My name is…" reads slightly boilerplate. No paraphrase loops; metaphors ("like an old librarian wandering shifting shelves") remain coherent and voice-motivated throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of cartography, murmurations as data source, and children's game as navigational tool is specific and non-obvious, avoiding generic discovery-quest templates. The transformation test passes: swapping airship for spaceship or hopscotch for checkers would require fundamental rewrite, not find-replace edits. Risk elevation: treating light patterns as choreography and using them to steer an airship commits fully to the premise without hedging. The piece earns freshness through particulars (polyglot phrasebook, stranded luminance as technical concept) rather than surface novelty.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lio's curiosity drives all major beats: watching the hopscotch board during off-hours, sketching variations to discover the pattern, overlaying mother's coordinates, presenting diagrams to Orvan, and directing the ship's course in the final sequence. The character's observation-to-action arc creates the story's causal spine. Present in setup, development, and closure with visible cost (professional risk, solo navigation responsibility).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The phrasebook appears in two beats: initial framing (scribbled coordinates and "stranded luminance") and when Lio uses it to justify the search. Its function as inherited artifact motivates the quest but doesn't constrain later tactics—the hopscotch board does that work. The dog-eared corner signals the mother's discovery method but isn't handled again or returned with reweighted meaning at closure. Functional but replaceable with another inherited record.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Stranded luminance" shapes both stakes (mapping light that refuses to move) and tactics (tracking how light pools in chalk, interpreting it as awaiting cartography). The concept operates concretely: photons from starlings "seeped through the hull and pooled in the chalk." It directly enables the navigation method and charges the ending when light "ceases to behave like light" where the pattern ends. Present across all three gates with causal pressure on choices.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Diligently curious" constrains on-page action: Lio converts "idle watching into work" through systematic sketching, and the attribute enables recognition that variations match starling patterns rather than ship systems. The trait governs method (repeated observation, margin notation) with visible cost—hours spent in isolation, professional risk when presenting unorthodox findings. More than label-only; the discipline of curiosity produces the discovery.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Noting drives the entire plot arc: observing light variations, sketching the board repeatedly, recording dates/times, correlating with murmurations, and ultimately overlaying coordinates to derive the navigation sequence. The action defines Lio's method and produces all key turns—from idle watching to actionable choreography. Swapping "note" for generic "study" would require fundamental restructure. Present continuously with escalating specificity from casual observation to precise instruction.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The hopscotch board's mechanics matter throughout: dust wavering "as if something beneath were breathing," squares catching light differently, specific square/column brightening patterns matching starling formations. The method is signaled early (first third), shapes Lio's investigation in the middle (converting observations to maps), and becomes the literal navigation instrument at closure ("Square three, pause, square five, leap"). The board's unique properties—chalk's light-pooling quality, the game's stepping pattern—are irreplaceable; no generic grid would function identically.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The airship provides the observation platform, enables access to starling murmurations at altitude, and houses the hopscotch board in the storage bay. Its antique nature ("old librarian") suits the expedition's archival cartography mission. The setting constrains choice by limiting Orvan's willingness to deviate from scheduled surveys and supplies the "clear, waiting sky" corridor at closure. Spatial choreography (observation deck, below deck, storage bay) tracks cleanly and affects access to discovery.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The starling murmurations provide the live clock: their shifting formations create the light patterns Lio must track, and their real-time movements dictate when the navigation attempt can occur ("as the starlings braided themselves into spirals"). The timeframe isn't arbitrary—the patterns emerge only during murmurations, creating urgency and a specific decision window. The element functions as both constraint and enabler, tightening the final beat when the birds "folded in on themselves, opening a corridor."</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The desire to "chart the next great discovery" motivates all major choices: dedicating off-duty hours to observation, risking professional standing by approaching Orvan, and accepting solo navigation responsibility. Friction emerges between the abstract goal and concrete costs (Orvan's skepticism, the stated risk). The motivation is dramatized through actions rather than merely declared, though the emotional stakes tied to the mother's legacy could press harder in peak beats.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Sociable isolation" is introduced explicitly ("the kind where you feel others in the walls but no one demands your eyes") and sustained: Lio works alone in the children's corner while the crew's "muffled weather" provides companionship without intrusion. The tone modulates under pressure—solo observation gives way to collaborative navigation as "the crew listened through the floorboards, unseen companions to my solitary dance." The paradox charges the final image: individual discovery requiring collective execution.</comment>
