<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator shows a consistent perceptual signature filtered through inherited spatial obsession ("necessary distances," reading grain as weather). The core interiority is embodied: the house hovering, furniture that won't touch, physical immersion in the maze from "inside a stalk." The final renunciation—staying on the opposite side of that one-step strip—is motivated by accumulated understanding and carries visible relational cost. Minor weakness: the father's thinness "erased and redrawn" edges toward abstract metaphor rather than concrete embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure. Orientation anchors promptly (sky rearranged, town on terrace, narrator is Map). The piece accumulates symbolic density through furniture codes, maze shifts, and thresholds, then lands a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): the narrator chooses not to cross, understanding that the father's vanishing calibrates the world's balance. Cost is legible: permanent separation and the "sacred ache" of that necessary distance. One meaningful deepening occurs when the chair-table experiment physically transports the narrator into the maze, tightening causality under the lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The drifting terrace, hovering house, and self-rearranging maze are vividly particular and constrain choice: moving furniture a finger-width tilts the room and triggers transit. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—hexagonal clouds, prismatic sheets, cornfields like fingerprints—filtered through the narrator's spatial obsession. The maze's center and the one-step strip of soil directly charge the closure image. Micro-setting (furniture, logbook stamps in wood grain) functions as constraint and mnemonic anchor.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early: finding the father and decoding his vanishing. Escalation proceeds through intuition → furniture analysis → code decoding → experimental chair repositioning → maze transit, each narrowing options. The reversal at closure—realizing the father must remain to hold the terrace aloft—forces a renunciation with visible relational cost. The one-step distance becomes the trade-off: crossing collapses the world's calibration. Agency is constrained endurance, fitting the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of thresholds and necessary distances emerges through particulars: furniture that won't touch, the terrace suspended between field and sky, paths that close like eyelids, the strip of soil. The final image—"the only threshold I must never cross"—reweights all prior material without thesis statement. The piece avoids moralizing; the sacred versus useful question is answered through embodied cost (permanent separation) rather than abstraction. Subtext operates in the logbook symbols, the father's grain-reading, and the maze's breathing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct and consistent: spatial metaphors, aviation codes stamped in wood, "featherly determined" modulating under pressure. Diction remains character-particular ("fractured hush," "ripples shaping tiny terraces between rings"). The father's brief dialogue carries subtext and goal-pursuit (explaining why he cannot cross). Distance is stable; no head-hopping. Under peak stress (landing in the maze, confronting the father), compression serves pressure without obscuring voice. One minor slip: "necessary distances" as exposition anchor edges toward tell.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; opening and closing lines anchor and charge. Information density is high: most sentences advance atmosphere, character logic, or symbolic layering. No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. Figurative language is dense but coherent ("clouds broke into slow hexagons," "grain rose in ripples"). Minor deduction: "idea of him had been erased and redrawn" is slightly abstract for a peak beat, and "featherly determined" recurs identically twice without variation, a small scaffold slip.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of drifting terrace, maze architecture, aviation codes in furniture grain, and threshold theology is specific and non-obvious. The piece commits fully to its prismatic physics and spatial metaphysics without retreat. Risk-taking in structure (accumulative/lyric lens, parent-child separation as closure rather than reunion) heightens stakes. The final turn—endurance as calibration—feels inevitable in hindsight and avoids template plotting. Transformation: a familiar "lost parent" frame becomes a meditation on sacred distance through embodied spatial logic.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Map's choices drive all key turns: analyzing furniture grain, moving the chair, navigating by shadow, and the final refusal to cross. The character appears throughout, embodied and active, and the closure pivots on their decision to remain. Setup early, development in the chair experiment, payoff at the threshold. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The logbook appears in two beats: discovered under the table edge, then shimmering when the maze shifts. It enables the code decoding that opens the doors and calibrates the terrace drift. However, the weather-code mechanics remain somewhat abstract—its symbols match drift days, but the reader never sees the protagonist actively decode a specific symbol to effect a specific change. Present in closure (father taps wood, grain rises), but the linkage is more thematic than mechanically causal. Early signal, modest development, charged reprise.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>"Necessary distances" is introduced early through furniture spacing, recurs in every pressure beat (chairs not scraping, the one-meter hover, the one-step strip), and defines the closure stakes: if the father crosses, "every distance would collapse into undifferentiated closeness." The concept shapes tactics (moving furniture a finger-width, navigating by shadow to avoid the maze's shifts) and the final renunciation. Indispensable to logic and theme; removing it breaks the story's spine.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Featherly determined" appears twice verbatim, framing the protagonist's decoding efforts and the final stance. It colors the voice and suggests lightness-with-grip, but does not constrain an on-page choice with visible cost—the determination would read similarly if described another way. The trait is present and consistent but functionally replaceable. Lyric reprise without mechanical necessity.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Intuit" is signaled early ("trying to intuit where he went") and recurs implicitly in reading furniture grain, listening for rustles, and navigating the maze by shadow rather than sight. The action enables the major turn (decoding the logbook), but the story never dramatizes a specific moment of intuition succeeding with a visible on-page cost or friction. Present across beats, functional in closure logic, but somewhat swappable with "decode" or "sense."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Analyzing furniture grain is introduced early ("analyzing the grain...like comic books"), demonstrated concretely (finding the logbook code stamped in wood, watching symbols shimmer), and enables the breakthrough that opens all doors and transports Map into the maze. The method shapes the protagonist's attempts and recurs in the father's final gesture (tapping wood, grain rising in ripples). Two distinct beats plus closure participation; high specificity and causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The drifting prism terrace is present from the opening, supplies the central constraint (the house hovers, the terrace calibrates between field and sky), and defines the closure stakes: the father's remaining holds it aloft. Setting pressures every choice—furniture distance, terrace drift tied to logbook symbols, the maze below shifting in tandem. The terrace's suspension is indispensable to the story's logic and final image. Setup immediate, development throughout, payoff central.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"After the butterfly effect" frames the altered-reality premise but functions more as atmospheric anchor than a timeframe that tightens decisions. The story moves through nights of listening, days of furniture analysis, and a seven-day chair experiment, but elapsed time does not create urgency or alter tactics—Map could continue indefinitely. The phrase recurs in the opening clause and colors tone, but does not constrain closure. Present, thematic, but not mechanically essential.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The desire to discover why some thresholds feel sacred is explicitly stated mid-story and enacted through every beat: testing furniture distances, the maze transit, and the final confrontation where the one-step threshold becomes the answer. The motivation drives goal-pursuit, is tested under pressure (the air thickens, the room tilts), and is paid off with visible cost (permanent separation). Stated rather than purely shown, but the friction between desire and sacrifice is dramatized at closure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"Fractured hush" is introduced early ("a fractured hush fell, like silence dropped and shattered"), recurs in the maze ("All sound...muted, a fractured hush hung between leaves"), and charges the final tableau where Map and father hold stillness across the uncrossed strip. Tone modulates with pressure—quiet accumulation, the room's tilt, muted maze navigation, the sacred ache—and the hush itself becomes a stakes-bearing constraint (stillness sustains the balance). Coherent through turns, embodied in sensory perception, indispensable to closure's charge.</comment>
