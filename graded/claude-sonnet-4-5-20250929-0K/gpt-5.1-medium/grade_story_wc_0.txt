<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lena's motivation is embodied through concrete choices—requisitioning the greenhouse, building the device, writing code—and her internal shift from "drama" to "quiet quakes" is earned by the flood experience. The device-building and filter arrangement show agency under pressure. Interiority occasionally drifts toward abstraction ("appetite for drama," "kindled humility") but most beats anchor in sensory detail and micro-choices. Amir's presence tests her stance without forcing a full relationship arc, appropriate for this length.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: Lena assembles the device, explains her shift from catastrophe to gradual change, and the final image of "smudges creeping across paper" reweights her research stance with felt cost (lost simulations, rejected drama). Orientation anchors early (greenhouse, flood aftermath, neutron star researcher). The closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): she commits to a methodology that "remembers" causes, foreclosing her former appetite for explosive events. Cost is conceptual and professional—choosing obscurity over spectacle—and legible in the final paragraph.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The storm-damaged greenhouse is handled tactilely across beats: bent door, cracked pots, leaking roof, cucumber vines, damp tide line on brick. Setting constrains her method (gaps in roof admit dust and light; she tapes plastic "not to seal them perfectly, but to narrow the variables"). The flood's residue—iodine smell, milk-brown river—charges the ending image: the place "remembers the water" and so will her model. Spatial choreography is clear; micro-setting (filter lattice, shattered panes) drives her experimental design.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: shift from explosive-event research to gradual-change methodology. Pressure tightens when Lena explains the device and its contrast to her prior work; Amir's questioning forces her to articulate cost ("maybe warning is nothing but paying attention early enough"). The final beat—"her datasets would look to others like nothing but smudges"—crystallizes the professional risk and acceptance. One meaningful deepening (flood lesson → dust methodology → acceptance of obscurity) with visible cost (career legibility, dramatic results). Under the Accumulative lens, escalation reads as density increase and cadence shift that reweights the dominant stake.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme (attention to slow causes vs. catastrophic events) emerges through particulars: gutters ignored, drainage postponed, neutron stars that "cool and crack and whisper." The device becomes a concrete answer to the thematic question without stating a moral. Lena's line "I want a model that remembers too" and the closing image of "smudges creeping across paper" offer a resonant, non-literal response. No final-paragraph moralizing; the river's indifference and her tape-checking pace embody the theme. Subtext operates in her joke about "preprocesses reality" and Amir's gentle test of her ideas.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>POV remains stable in close third, filtered through Lena's scientific and post-trauma perspective. Perceptual signature is consistent: metaphors drawn from astrophysics ("gravity braided matter into pure equation"), sensory detail skewed toward tactile and visual cues relevant to her work. Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven; Amir's "this is very you right now" and Lena's "mistaking fireworks for truth" carry subtext about her transformation. Diction stays within her lexicon; no register drift. A few scaffold phrases ("as always, as if he had arrived by accident at his own life") approach generic character summary but do not flatten the scene.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; opening and closing images are strong. Information density is high in the device-building beats and the dialogue exchange. Minor template cadence appears in reflective beats ("Supernovae, mergers, gamma-ray bursts, they had all been..."; "So she wired... set slow shutters... and wrote code...") but does not obscure causality. A paraphrase loop near midpoint: "She wanted to understand a universe where causes accreted like silt" followed closely by "Instead of simulating millennia..." revisits the same contrast without added pressure. No clarity loss at closure; propulsion remains steady.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis—using terrestrial dust accumulation as analog for neutron-star cooling processes in a flood-damaged greenhouse—is specific and non-obvious. The piece transforms the "scientist after catastrophe" template by refusing redemptive drama: Lena's goal is "to strip needless drama," and the ending honors that commitment. The connection between flood-as-slow-accumulation and neutron-star research is earned through her interiority and device design. Risk is present (professional obscurity, unglamorous methodology) and the closure effect remains legible. Slight derivative echo in the "humbled scientist" arc, but the flood-to-dust mechanics feel fresh.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lena's choices—requisitioning the greenhouse, building the device, explaining the shift to Amir, taping plastic over leaks—drive all major beats and shape the ending. Her stance crystallization (accepting "smudges" as truth) is the closure unit. She is causally active throughout and her decisions narrow options (rejecting drama-driven research). High integration.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Butterfly wing dust appears in the device description ("dust from butterfly wing and leaf and distant factory") and returns implicitly in the final image of "smudges creeping across paper" as accumulated particulate. It is part of the method but not isolated for a second charged beat. Functional but not indispensable; the dust archive could include other motes without breaking logic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>"Gradual change" is the dominant stake: Lena rejects "catastrophic punctuation marks" in favor of "causes accreted like silt." It shapes her device design, her dialogue with Amir, and the final acceptance of datasets as "smudges creeping across paper." The concept is dramatized through the flood backstory (slow neglect → catastrophe) and her new methodology. Integral to escalation and closure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Preprocesses reality" appears once as a joke Lena makes about her device. It colors the device description (filters trap "a day's worth of motes... in faint, concentric ghosts") but does not constrain a subsequent choice or return with reweighted meaning. Present and thematically apt but not causally active across beats.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"Decay" is central: neutron stars "decay not as a sudden drop in brightness, but as a softening gradient"; her grief "faded from serrated to dull." The concept drives her methodology (tracking "subtle darkening over days and weeks") and charges the final image. It appears across setup, middle explanation, and closure. Swapping for a synonym would require structural rewrites.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The method—filters trap dust, cameras track darkening—is explained in the device-building beat and shapes Lena's rationale ("each speck stood in for wandering particles"). It returns in the final paragraph as "smudges creeping across paper." The mechanics matter: she tapes plastic "to narrow the variables." The method is integral to the gradual-change thesis and closure image.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The greenhouse supplies the device's infrastructure (gaps in roof admit dust and light), constrains her method (she tapes leaks "not to seal them perfectly"), and charges the ending ("everything here remembers the water... I want a model that remembers too"). It appears in every major beat and the final image. Removing the greenhouse would break the story's logic and thematic resonance.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"After the flood" anchors the backstory (lost simulations, refugee dorm) and explains her humility. The timeframe shapes her present stance and device rationale. The river still running "milk-brown with silt" and the damp tide line show ongoing aftermath. It does not tighten a live decision clock but provides causal pressure for her methodological shift. Essential to motivation and theme.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The desire to "strip needless drama" is dramatized in her choice of the greenhouse, the device design, her dialogue ("I am trying to stop mistaking fireworks for truth"), and the final acceptance of datasets as "smudges." It conflicts with her prior appetite for "supernovae, mergers, gamma-ray bursts" and her career legibility. The motivation drives escalation and closure with visible professional cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>"Kindled humility" is embodied in Lena's slow, deliberate movements ("checking each knot twice"), her quiet dialogue, and the contrast between her former ambition and present acceptance. Tone modulates appropriately: reflective in backstory beats, conversational with Amir, resolute in the final paragraph. The phrase "laughed, surprised by how easily the sound came in this gutted place" shows tonal shift under pressure. Coherent and charged at closure.</comment>
