<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Niko's interior contradiction is well-embodied: he denies being a prophet while orchestrating salvations, irritated yet complicit. The micro-choices under pressure (handing jars to Lila, running the ridge) show hierarchy of values with visible cost. Interiority occasionally drifts into abstraction ("texture of transformation") and the final gratitude ripple summarizes rather than showing Niko's emotional cost on the page, capping the score below 8.0.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors quickly (volcano, beach, Niko with jars). The causal lens holds: tug → path → Lila → prophecy → evacuation → detour plan → lava diverts. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the collective detour succeeds, reweighting Niko's accidental agency with visible cost ("pumice scraped directly against the heart"). The ending summarizes gratitude rather than showing Niko's stance shift on the page, and the lava cooling "short of the camps" feels slightly assured rather than earned through visible friction, preventing entry to the 8.5+ band.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Black sand, volcano glow, driftwood telescope, and rice paddies anchor vividly. The bottled lightning bugs function as micro-setting, constraining the final choice (splitting jars, waving them to redirect crowds). Spatial choreography is clean across ridges and camps. The cosmic timeframe (eclipse, comet) enriches atmosphere but does not materially pressure a tactical choice, and the quarry is named late without prior grounding, lowering specificity slightly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early: save the camps from lava. One meaningful tightening occurs when bells ring and Niko traces detour routes in his mind, narrowing options to the jar-waving plan. The final act is driven by protagonist agency with visible cost ("hot beneath his soles," urgency). The lava cooling "short of the camps" lacks on-page friction showing the plan's risk or near-failure, and the collective success feels slightly convenient, capping the score below 8.5.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of accidental mercy and transformation emerges through concrete particulars: the bean sprouting, the detour as texture of change, "dangerous to prophecies" because he fulfills them by mistake. The final image reweights the premise without moralizing. Minor slip: "texture of transformation" is stated abstractly twice before being earned at closure, and Lila's line about being "dangerous to prophecies" borders on thematic echo, though it remains character-voiced and not a prompt label.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Niko; perceptual signature is consistent (routes, coincidences, irritation at myth). Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven; Niko and Lila carry distinct idiom. Diction modulates purposefully under pressure ("pumice scraped directly against the heart"). Brief filter-verb use ("felt himself veer") is voice-motivated. The phrase "vibrant hush lived between her words" momentarily externalizes Lila's interiority with unwarranted certainty, a minor POV leak that does not recur.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Rhythm varies, information density is high, and figurative language is controlled except in two beats: "tame constellations," "notes in a hidden song," "smoldered green-gold," "fallen constellations" cluster decoratively without pressure payoff. The phrase "whispering hush rose...soft insistence" and its variant "whispering hush stiffened into a tug" loop conceptually across adjacent paragraphs. No template cadence or major scaffold, but the figurative density in setup beats and the concept loop together trigger −0.6 under the patterned-artifact pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The destitute philanthropist who orchestrates coincidences offers a fresh angle, and the bottled lightning bugs as detour tools synthesize premise and stakes well. The prophecy frame and "accidental fulfillment" motif, while executed cleanly, echo familiar mythic templates without full transformation. The ending reweights the premise in hindsight, but the lava conveniently stopping short suggests a safety middle that avoids the boldest risk.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Niko is introduced early, drives the middle choice (tracing routes, splitting jars), and his agency shapes the closure (running the ridge). His destitution is mentioned but does not constrain tactics; philanthropy is enacted on the page. Two beats (orcherstrating paths, final detour) plus closure linkage earn 7.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Bottled lightning bugs appear in paragraph one, are gifted mid-story, and are split/waved in the climax to redirect crowds. They enable the causal tactic with visible cost (Niko runs with hot soles). Three beats, closure linkage, and irreplaceability (specific light properties matter) earn 8.2.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Whispering hush" appears in paragraphs 5, 14, and 29 as atmospheric descriptor. It does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; it functions as tone reinforcement. Setup gate met, no development or closure participation, swappable with "tense silence." Cap 4.6 for late intro, lower to 4.1 for ornamental use.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Orchestrates coincidences" is explained early (paragraph 7: fisherman meets widow) and enacted at closure (detour plan). It shapes the final tactic with visible cost (running, hot ground). Setup, development (mid-story examples), and closure participation met. Causal pressure and specificity present, but the mechanic is told more than shown in action, preventing higher score.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Detour" is signaled early (paragraph 6: "detoured routes"), enacted mid-story (Niko veers onto narrow path), and drives the climax (collective detour saves camps). The action is causally irreplaceable and carries visible cost. Three beats, closure linkage, high specificity, and cost connection earn 8.6.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Fulfilling prophecies accidentally" is introduced early (paragraph 11: bean → hillside), Lila names it mid-story, and the ending enacts it (detour fulfills prophecy without intent). Setup, development, and closure participation met. The mechanic shapes the final irony with conceptual cost (Niko remains irritated yet complicit). Causal pressure and closure linkage earn 7.4.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Black sand beach at volcano's foot anchors paragraphs 1, 16, and closure. It supplies the meeting place (Lila) and geographic constraint (camps in lava path). The setting participates in closure (lava cools "in a black tongue"). Setup, development (spatial choreography of ridges), and closure participation met, with moderate causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Slow dance of celestial bodies" (eclipse, comet) is named in paragraph 4 and Lila's watch in paragraph 18. It sets atmosphere and prophecy trigger but does not tighten a decision or alter tactics on the page. Setup and lyric reprise at closure (comet as question mark reweights the cosmic frame), but no middle constraint. Two gates, lyric resonance, caps at ~6.3, lower to 5.9 for missed causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Understand the texture of transformation" is stated in paragraph 6, repeated in Niko's dialogue (paragraph 21), and enacted at closure ("texture of transformation at last"). Setup and closure participation met, but the motivation is told abstractly and does not face friction or tradeoff on the page. Two gates, closure linkage, but label-only use and lack of visible cost cap at 6.4.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Vibrant hush" appears in paragraph 5 ("whispering hush"), paragraph 17 ("vibrant hush lived between her words"), and closure ("whispering hush of astonished gratitude"). Tone modulates from suspense to urgency to relief. Setup, mid-story color, and closure reprise met. The phrase charges the final image by echoing the opening atmospheric pressure, earning 6.7 for lyric coherence and reweighting despite static mood in middle beats.</comment>
