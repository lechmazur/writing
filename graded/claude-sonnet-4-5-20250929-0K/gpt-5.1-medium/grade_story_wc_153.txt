<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lysa's interiority is vividly embodied ("fierce tenderness rising in her, sharp enough to cut yet careful not to pierce") and her emotional state shifts under pressure from professional detachment to empathic recognition. The drowned brother's moment of choice—pride clamping his tongue—shows contradictory impulses acting simultaneously rather than in sequence. The client remains off-page, which is appropriate to scope, and the spirits function well as environmental pressure. One minor weakness: Lysa's professional competence lacks visible struggle; her mastery reads smooth where a moment of doubt or miscalculation would deepen cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density builds through image layering (mangrove roots as ribs, condensation letters, algae wounds) and resolves via a Resonant Reconfiguration when the unfinished sentence changes to "I was afraid," reweighting the client's unsent letters with visible emotional cost. Orientation anchors who/where/when clearly within the opening lines. One meaningful deepening occurs in the vision-shift when Lysa inhabits the brother's last moment, narrowing options from abstract inquiry to concrete realization. The closure lands on-page with conceptual cost legible in "the place where every apology still waits unspoken."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The mangrove labyrinth functions as micro-setting that constrains choice: roots rise "like ribs," phosphorescent algae creates "breathing green wounds," and invisible condensation windows appear only in this zone. The gargoyle shard pulses when regret thickens, acting as both tool and environmental cue that shapes Lysa's inquiry. The lagoon's rewind—crabs stepping into earlier footprints, words unwriting—directly enables the vision that delivers closure. Sensory hierarchy reflects Lysa's professional focus: she notices spirit song and shard temperature over incidental detail.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: find the drowned brother's pre-decision moment to help the client "know where to begin." Pressure tightens when the spirits' song sharpens "from lullaby to inquiry," then escalates in the vision where Lysa inhabits the brother's body and feels the choice between shore and water. The turn—"I was afraid" replacing the unfinished sentence—narrows options for the client with visible cost: he must still "speak or burn his unsent letters." Agency is enacted through Lysa's choice to evoke the moment rather than demand absolution, a renunciation that forecloses simpler closure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: apology as literal spatial zone, silence as drowning current, and the shard that tastes "centuries of storms, learning how words felt before they were spoken." The final image—spirits singing to "the place where every apology still waits unspoken"—offers a non-literal answer to the central question of forgiveness without stating a moral. "Fierce tenderness masked as accusation, because he feared that forgiving would erase the proof of his hurt" renders complex emotional calculus without therapy-speak. The story resists tidy resolution: the client receives clarity, not absolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable in Lysa's close third; perceptual signature is consistent (professional noticing of spirit behavior, shard temperature, spatial anchors). Diction fits the mystical-realist register without drift: "gusts of vowels that fogged the edges of hearing" and "phosphorescent algae painted every trunk with breathing green wounds." One weakness: the vision sequence ("Beside her, the client as a younger man shouted") introduces minor distance confusion—does Lysa see or inhabit?—resolved quickly but costing clarity for two beats. Rhythmic control under pressure is strong: short sentences during the vision snap, longer cadences restore when she returns to the skiff.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "gargoyle's rainspout shard veined with salt and old soot" conveys object, history, and thematic weight). Rhythm varies purposefully, accelerating in the vision and breathing in the return. Two minor artifacts: "their song sharpening from lullaby to inquiry" and "singing to the place where every apology still waits unspoken" repeat the apology-waiting motif without adding pressure, a paraphrase loop that costs −0.3. "Fierce tenderness" recurs three times, the third instance ("fierce tenderness masked as accusation") justified by reweighting, but the phrase borders on over-deployment.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis—medium navigating apology-as-place via condensation messages and a gargoyle shard—feels specific and non-obvious. The emotional premise (finding the moment before a choice to grant clarity, not absolution) transforms the psychic-detective trope through the brother's "I was afraid" rather than a tidy reveal. The mangrove labyrinth that "existed in the space where an apology waits unspoken" commits fully to its metaphysical logic. One restraint: the mystical-medium frame is familiar; the story elevates it through particulars (shard mechanics, algae wounds, condensation windows) but does not radically subvert genre expectations.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lysa makes three key choices: she enters the labyrinth (setup), she asks the spirits to show "the last moment before you chose the current" rather than the death itself (middle turn), and she recognizes she "could not decide for the living man, only evoke clarity from the dead" (closure stance). Her decisions alter tactics—she touches the shard to signal willingness, stretches her fingers toward the fogged pane—and the final choice to carry back "not absolution, but a fragile map" shapes the ending's charge. Present across all three gates with causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The shard appears in three beats: Lysa carries it as payment (setup), it pulses when the spirits smell regret and flares when the brother hovers in the vision (middle use constraining inquiry), and she wraps it again "its pulse quieter, as if the stone itself had let go of an old storm" (closure reprise). The object enables the spirits' cooperation and its quieting signals transaction completion. However, its mechanics—why it pulses, how it "tastes" words—remain ornamental description rather than active constraint that Lysa must navigate or trade off. Two-gate participation (setup, closure reprise) with modest middle constraint.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Unsent letters drive the client's stake (setup: "a man whose face collapsed whenever he touched the stack"), shape Lysa's mission ("to find his brother, drowned years ago on the wrong side of forgiveness, lost mid crossing of a sentence"), and structure the closure directive ("he would still have to speak or burn his unsent letters, but now he would know where to begin"). The concept constrains tactics: Lysa cannot deliver the letters or force forgiveness, only evoke the pre-decision moment. All three gates met with causal work and visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Heals in moonlight" describes the phosphorescent algae's visual effect ("breathing green wounds that healed in moonlight") but does not constrain or enable any on-page choice. The attribute enriches atmosphere and supports the apology-as-waiting-space metaphor, but Lysa does not wait for moonlight, use it as a timer, or trade off illumination versus concealment. Lyric contribution without causal pressure. Present in one beat (setup/middle description) but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Evoke" frames Lysa's method from early ("she needed that memory" which the labyrinth holds) through the peak action ("Show me, she whispered, not your death, but the last moment before you chose") to closure ("evoke clarity from the dead"). The action differentiates her from a passive channel: she asks rather than channels involuntarily, a choice with cost (she must inhabit the brother's fear). The verb recurs with reweighted specificity at closure. Two strong beats (middle request, closure stance) plus thematic frame; could score higher if the evocation involved a visible tradeoff (stamina, shard depletion, spirit bargain).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Condensation messages appear when "water slicked across her skiff boards, then climbed the air, sheening invisible windows between roots, fogging in delicate trembling panes. Letters began to appear as messages in condensation." The method is signaled in setup, used in the middle beat when the mist figure smears a line, and delivers the closure payload: "the unfinished sentence had changed, the condensation now spelling three clear words: I was afraid." Mechanics shape one key turn (the message change) but the method itself imposes no visible constraint—Lysa does not struggle to read, preserve, or interpret the windows. Two-gate participation with modest causal weight.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The mangrove labyrinth is introduced immediately, frames all action, and supplies crucial resources: the spirits who respond to the shard's scent, the roots that become "ribs" structuring the vision space, and the rewind mechanism ("crabs stepped neatly into earlier footprints") that enables the pre-decision moment. Setting choice matters: the labyrinth "existed in the space where an apology waits unspoken," making it the only location where Lysa's inquiry can succeed. All three gates met; the setting is irreplaceable and charges the final image ("spirits linger, singing to the place").</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The timeframe "in the space where an apology waits unspoken" is introduced as thematic frame ("This place, the old women said, existed in the space where an apology waits unspoken, stretching time into a shallow sea") and governs the story's metaphysical logic: the dead wander there until words are sent or burned. The rewind sequence demonstrates time as malleable resource. However, the timeframe does not create urgency—Lysa faces no countdown, the client does not impose a deadline, and the spirits' cooperation is immediate. The frame enables the vision but does not tighten decisions. Setup and thematic presence without escalation pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The motivation to "find the moment before deciding" is established early (client wants "the moment before deciding, that split breath where every future balanced") and structures Lysa's inquiry: she asks to see "the last moment before you chose the current over the shore," not the drowning itself. The desire is dramatized in friction: the client insists "Not to ask pardon" but seeks the decision point, and Lysa must navigate between granting absolution (which she refuses) and delivering clarity (which she achieves). The ending fulfills and reweights the motive: "now he would know where to begin." All three gates met with visible tension between stated want and deeper need.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Fierce tenderness" is named three times and governs tone throughout: Lysa's approach is both sharp ("careful not to pierce") and empathic, the brother's drowning traced to "fierce tenderness masked as accusation," and the spirits' final song is a "cradle song for a long delayed truth." The tone modulates under pressure—sharp inquiry during the vision, softer acknowledgment at closure—and charges the final image where tenderness (the spirits' lullaby) holds space for the unspoken. Coherent across turns with modest modulation; one naming in the climax could be cut without loss.</comment>
