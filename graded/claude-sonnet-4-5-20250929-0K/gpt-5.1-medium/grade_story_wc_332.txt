<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Irena's interior life is richly textured through concrete perceptions ("syllables of breathing," "luminous absence"), and her motivation—seeking the vanished presence—drives the arc with embodied longing. However, the final act lacks a meaningful on-page choice or renunciation; the sunrise "poured through her" without visible agency or cost that forecloses a path. The piece leans heavily on reflective summary of past states rather than dramatized micro-choices under present pressure, flattening some urgency.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors arrive promptly (island, librarian, jars). The closure image—sunrise fixing the jars with "indelible, tender clarity"—reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), crystallizing the hunt for the runaway dream. However, cost remains implicit and abstract; no on-page sentence makes legible what Irena forfeits or gains in that final pour of light, weakening closure proof.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The whispering archipelago, glass-shard palette, and camera are vividly particular and filter through Irena's professional lens. The palette fragments constrain her dawn ritual across multiple beats, and the highest cliff charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clean throughout, and the sensory hierarchy reflects urgency (dark mornings, shifting rock colors).</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—capture the runaway dream to vitalize the islands and solidify the absent visitor—is signaled early and recurs. Pressure deepens through villagers' requests and Irena's suspicion about the cipher, but the final beat lacks a visible choice or trade-off; the sunrise simply "poured through her" without dramatized agency or a narrowing of options on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme of longing and presence-in-absence emerges organically through the jars, cipher, luminous absence, and Irena's hunt. The final image—light fixing the jars—resonates without overt moralizing, reweighting prior material. Subtext operates cleanly in "half-shaped life" and "holding space for a ghost," and the piece resists tidy resolution while maintaining coherent pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV is stable, with a distinct perceptual signature ("catalog she had not yet been allowed to read," "colors that had no names"). Diction remains character-particular under pressure, and psychic distance modulates purposefully. Purposeful compression and lyric patterning (e.g., "luminous absence," "breathing gills") are taught early and legible throughout, with no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally, and figurative language is mostly coherent ("breathing gills," "tidewrack"). However, several lines border on overwriting without clear payoff ("mist climbed the pier post by post," "syllables of breathing"), and minor template cadence appears in the villagers' requests paragraph. Information density is high, but a paraphrase loop exists between "vitalize the archive" and the explanation of fading islands.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of odd-hour librarian, sunrise photography, glass-shard palette, and cipher of longing feels specific and non-obvious. The piece commits fully to its lyric premise and avoids stock metaphors. However, the "vanished librarian leaving a smudge of light" and "runaway dream" are familiar tropes not substantially transformed, and the ending's mechanism (light pouring through) reads slightly convenient rather than inevitable from prior causality.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Irena is present throughout and her professional role (odd-hour librarian) frames her attention to drifters and the archive. She makes micro-choices (rising each dark morning, carrying the palette to the cliff), but the final beat lacks a decisive turn driven by her agency; the sunrise acts upon her rather than the reverse. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, but swappability and passivity at closure limit the score.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The watercolor palette appears in the opening trunk, is unpacked and used at multiple dawns, and its glass shards constrain the photographic ritual across beats. The palette directly shapes the altered light that the camera captures, and it returns in the final cliff scene with charged function. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +1.2, but it does not face visible cost or irreplaceability test at the ending.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The cipher of longing is signaled on jar labels in the first library scene, recurs when Irena suspects it encodes the vanished librarian's attempt to stay, and implicitly frames her translation effort. It shapes her interpretive stake and converges with the runaway dream at closure. Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +0.8, closure linkage +0.9, but the cipher's mechanics remain abstract and ornamental rather than actionable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Paints with light" is told in one line ("she paints with light now") and restated at the final sunrise, but the attribute functions as thematic label rather than a trait with on-page cost or trade-off. It does not constrain a choice or enable a tactic that another method could not. Late first clear appearance −0.5, label-only −0.3, swappability −0.6.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Vitalize" is the explicit instruction, frames the dominant stake, and recurs when villagers bring offerings and when Irena suspects she might vitalize the absent visitor. The final sunrise "fixing every jar with indelible, tender clarity" completes the task. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, but the verb remains abstract and the mechanism (how vitalizing works) is told rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Sunrise photography is signaled in the instructions, executed across multiple dark mornings with the camera and palette, and culminates in the final cliff sunrise. The method's mechanics—glass shards altering light, camera inhaling—are specific and constrain the ritual. Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.1, closure linkage +1.3, but the photographs "seeping back into the jars" is told without on-page demonstration of cost or failure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The whispering archipelago is named in the opening, provides the library and cliffs as micro-settings, and the highest cliff charges the final image. The whispers/"syllables of breathing" recur and the fading-island stakes tie directly to place. Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +0.8, closure linkage +1.0, but the archipelago's geography remains abstract and does not supply a concrete resource or obstacle that alters Irena's tactics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"In the hush of improbable beginnings" anchors the opening tone and temporal frame. "First night," "each dark morning," "last morning of the storm season" mark progression. However, the timeframe functions as atmospheric marker rather than live constraint; no on-page deadline tightens Irena's choices. Early signal +0.5, ornamental use −0.7, swappability −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Capture a runaway dream" is the stated instruction, converges with Irena's personal search for the luminous absence, and frames the final sunrise attempt. Desire is dramatized through her rising each morning, trapping villagers' requests, and suspecting the cipher. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +0.9, but the dream itself remains abstract and the friction between her professional duty and personal longing is told more than shown.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Luminous absence" is introduced early (the vanished librarian's smudge of light), recurs in Irena's memory of the presence beside her, and charges the final image ("indelible, tender clarity" implicitly filling absence). Tone is coherent and modulates with rising pressure (hush → hollow → knotted breath → pouring clarity). Early signal +0.8, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +0.9, closure linkage +1.5, specificity +0.6.</comment>
