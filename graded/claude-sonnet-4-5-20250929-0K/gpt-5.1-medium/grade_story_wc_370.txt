<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's internal landscape is anchored in concrete regret (brother's death, saved voicemail) and his nightly ritual shows embodied contradiction—staying while leaving. The epiphany in the secret library ("the truth was simpler and heavier") reads earned through the triggered memory, and his micro-choice to keep the invitation as "promise" rather than "secret" forecloses his old pattern. However, the therapy-adjacent language ("understand the contour of your refusal") and the clean pivot from tears to resolution compress grief without sustained friction, and Mara functions primarily as exposition rather than pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with a late Resonant Reconfiguration. Orientation anchors (Harrow Street, night custodian, ten o'clock close) land cleanly. The nested reveals—janitor discovers hidden library, Mara appears off-schedule, gray volume bears brother's name—accumulate density and the voicemail's reframing constitutes a conceptual repricing with felt cost (his brother trusted him; Elias had filled the silence with imagined recriminations). The closure image ("began at last to stay") reweights the "staying while leaving" contradiction. Minor causality slip: Mara's arrival "merely an ordinary Thursday" violates the stated solstice rule without dramatized consequence, a convenience that slightly weakens world-rule consistency.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The secret library's curved shelves "like question marks," fluorescent hum, municipal grout, and "footsteps that did not touch the ground" establish spatial and tonal anchors. The crumpled invitation in the cardigan pocket, the janitor's key "only he cared enough to polish," and the gray volume on the shelf are tactile and purposeful. The library's air "thicker, as if expecting company" modulates with the arrival of Mara. Gate met: the library constrains Elias's nightly choice and charges the ending when he "began at last to stay" inside rather than exile himself. The "nestled paradoxes orbiting older, unnamed suns" veers toward ornamental register but remains within the piece's lyric idiom.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: whether Elias will confront his brother's death or continue his "compassionate recluse" holding pattern. The hidden library invitation declares "We require one who listens"; Mara's accusation "you have only been dusting the shelves" tightens pressure; the gray volume with his brother's name forces the confrontation. The voicemail reveal—his brother "joking that if Elias did not answer soon, he would simply come over"—narrows the past's meaning and the tears function as release with visible cost (washing space for a different future). Escalation is clean under the Accumulative lens; one meaningful deepening occurs when Elias opens the book and the imagined recriminations collapse into simpler trust. Mara's off-schedule arrival is coincidence used to complicate, not resolve, which is permissible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—regret, listening, and the weight of refusal—emerges through the secret library's catalog system ("by regret, by choices someone wished they had understood sooner"), the crumpled invitation ("We require one who listens"), and Elias's concrete failure (locked door, unopened voicemail). The voicemail's reframing avoids moralizing: his brother trusted him to be reachable, a fact both simpler and heavier than accusation. The final image ("began at last to stay") offers a non-literal answer without thesis. The "books hummed softly, each volume a small planet of nestled paradoxes" risks ornamental abstraction but the piece quickly dramatizes the concept through Elias's encounter with his brother's volume, grounding the metaphor in choice and cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable; psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during the voicemail beat, wider during exposition). Diction ("compassionate recluse," "he carried a mistake like an unreturned book") is consistent and specific. Mara's dialogue ("caretaker of what might have been," "you must lend the regret your own heartbeat") carries a formal register that distinguishes her from the narration and fits her role. Minor slips: "the syllables dry in his mouth" is embodied but stock, and "as though confirming a rumor she had already wept over" attributes emotion to Mara without access. The piece teaches a lyric compression early and sustains it; no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks that flatten immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes. Information density is high in the library reveal and the voicemail beat. However, several lines loop: "he had listened poorly once" is restated as "his younger brother pleaded for help and Elias, overwhelmed, locked his door and his heart," then again as "the overdose was ruled an accident; Elias knew it as a failure to stay"—three adjacent paragraphs re-establish the same backstory without added pressure. Template stems recur: "By choice he was," "Yet he noticed," "People came to borrow," "Beneath fluorescent hum," "Elias did not discover," "Now, every night"—seven consecutive openers that stack introductory clauses. The metaphor "small planet of nestled paradoxes orbiting older, unnamed suns" is evocative but self-contradictory (paradoxes don't orbit suns). These artifacts dull momentum in the first third and trigger the patterned-artifact penalty; they do not obscure the closure beat itself.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The secret-society-library frame is well-worn but gains specificity through the catalog system (sorted by regret rather than author) and the books that "hummed softly." The "compassionate recluse" archetype and the grief-driven custodian are familiar, yet the detail of the saved voicemail and the crumpled invitation add texture. The voicemail's inversion—his brother's joke rather than a plea—offers a fresh inflection on the guilt narrative. The piece does not take structural or perspectival risks; the accumulative-lyric mode is executed competently but without bold synthesis. Proximity check: "books hummed softly" and "nestled paradoxes" echo fantasy tropes without full transformation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elias ("compassionate recluse") is present throughout. His micro-choices—polishing the janitor's key, entering the hidden library nightly, keeping the crumpled invitation—establish the pattern. His decision to open the gray volume (prompted by Mara) triggers the voicemail reveal, and his final act (folding the invitation "not as a secret but as a promise") alters his stance from exile to presence. Two gates: setup (custodian introduced early), payoff (final image). Missing middle development: his reclusive trait does not constrain a mid-story choice with visible cost; Mara's arrival and the book's appearance drive the middle beat. Causal pressure is moderate; the trait enables but does not narrow options under stress.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The crumpled invitation appears in three beats: on the mop cart (backstory mention), "in the pocket of his gray cardigan" (mid-scene), and "folded…once more and slid it back into his pocket, not as a secret but as a promise" (closure). The final reprise reweights its function from proof to promise, charging the ending image. Three gates met: setup (mentioned early), development (carried in pocket during confrontation), payoff (final fold). However, the invitation does not constrain a middle choice; it is handled but not used to alter tactics. The reweighting is purposeful but the causal pressure is light—Elias could have completed the arc without folding it again.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Nestled paradoxes" is named explicitly ("books…each volume a small planet of nestled paradoxes") and thematically echoed in the library's catalog system (regret, might-have-beens) and Mara's title ("Archivist of Errors, caretaker of what might have been"). The gray volume containing his brother's name embodies the concept: "not the past…but the path the past wished for." The concept shapes the stakes (Elias must reconcile contradictory truths about his brother's trust and his own refusal) and the ending releases the paradox into "a different future." Two gates: setup (library described early), payoff (final tears and promise). Missing middle beat: the paradoxes are described and thematized but do not constrain a tactical choice mid-story. Swappability risk: "nested mysteries" or "layered regrets" would yield similar function.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Keenly empathetic" is stated early ("his gaze keenly empathetic even when lowered to the floor") and implied in his nightly stewarding and his recognition that he "listened poorly once." The trait enables the secret society's invitation ("We require one who listens") and motivates his final choice to "share what he had learned." Two gates: setup (trait named paragraph 4), payoff (sharing implied at closure). Missing middle constraint: the empathy does not visibly cost him or narrow an option mid-story; it functions as backstory explanation rather than live friction. The trait is told more than shown—his empathetic noticing occurs off-page ("Yet he noticed everyone") without a dramatized beat where empathy forces a difficult trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Hide" appears in Elias's instinct ("wanting to hide his shaking hands behind his back") when confronted by Mara, and the secret library itself is "hidden in plain sight." The action does not create a major turn; Elias does not successfully hide anything, and Mara's arrival forces exposure rather than concealment. One gate: middle gesture (hide impulse stated). Missing setup and payoff: hiding is not established as a tactic early, and the ending pivots to "stay" rather than resolving a hide/reveal tension. The element is present but ornamental—removing "hide" and replacing with "retreat" or "withdraw" would not alter the story's causal spine. Swappability confirmed.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Staying while leaving" is named explicitly ("a life of staying while leaving, present to others yet unreachable himself") and operationalized through Elias's role as night custodian (physically present, emotionally exiled). The method shapes the middle beat: Mara accuses him of "only dusting the shelves" rather than engaging the library's purpose, forcing the confrontation. The ending reweights the method: "he began at last to stay" (no longer leaving internally). Three gates: setup (method described early), development (Mara's critique hinges on it), payoff (final line inverts it). Causal pressure is strong—the contradiction drives the emotional arc and the closure directly addresses it. Irreplaceability high: the exact phrasing recurs and the final line would lose resonance without the earlier setup.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The secret society library is introduced early (paragraph 6), discovered by accident (slipped on bookmark, crashed into shelf), and used nightly by Elias. It supplies the gray volume, Mara's arrival point, and the space where the voicemail memory unfolds. Three gates: setup (introduced first third), development (Mara appears within it, prompting confrontation), payoff ("inside, he began at last to stay"). The library constrains Elias's nightly routine and provides the mechanism for the brother's volume. However, much of its function is atmospheric—curved shelves, humming books—rather than tactical. The "hidden in plain sight" detail is stated but not dramatized; no patron or colleague challenges the wall, and the secrecy does not create mid-story friction. Specificity moderate; "archive of regrets" would serve similarly.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Within arm's reach of midnight" is stated once (paragraph 20) to set mood. The timeframe does not tighten decisions—Elias is alone on "an ordinary Thursday" and no clock pressure affects his choice to open the book or fold the invitation. One gate: mentioned mid-story. Missing setup and payoff: time is not anchored early or tracked at closure. The phrase is evocative but ornamental; replacing it with "late evening" or removing it entirely would not alter causality or tactics. No visible cost tied to the hour.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"To unearth wisdom in a mistake" is voiced by Mara ("You were invited here to unearth wisdom in a mistake…but you have only been dusting the shelves") and operationalized when Elias opens the gray volume to confront his brother's voicemail. The motivation drives the ending: "tears came…washing space for a different future" and "share what he had learned." Three gates: setup (invitation's text "We require one who listens" hints at it early), development (Mara's accusation crystallizes the task), payoff (tears and promise fulfill it). Friction is present—Elias hesitates ("If he listened now, would it crumble him or complete him")—but the choice itself is prompted by Mara rather than internal conflict forcing a trade-off. Cost is visible (emotional release, foreclosed exile) but the want/fear tension resolves quickly.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Enlarged tranquility" is named mid-story ("the library air felt thicker, as if expecting company…an enlarged tranquility that seemed to gather like fog between the stacks") and sustained through descriptions of quiet (shelves' "low rustle like pages turning in their sleep," Mara's voice "gently"). The tone modulates: initial calm, Elias's unease at Mara's arrival, the emotional weight of the voicemail beat, and the return to quiet presence at closure ("their quiet no longer felt like exile but like an invitation"). Three gates: setup (tranquility described early in library routine), development (tone thickens before Mara's appearance), payoff (final line reweights quiet as chosen rather than imposed). The tone charges the final image and remains coherent through the turn. Minor slip: "enlarged tranquility" is slightly abstract and told rather than fully embodied in syntax or rhythm.</comment>
