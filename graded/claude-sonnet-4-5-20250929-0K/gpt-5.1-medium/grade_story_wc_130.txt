<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Corren's interiority is specific and textured ("ratios of longing to memory"), and his shift from retrieval to acceptance carries clear motivation. The brother Lio remains a static absence rather than a pressure-producing presence, limiting relational crucible work. The final choice—teaching children to honor absence—feels earned by the conjuring failure but arrives as insight more than embodied cost. Backstory dominates but anchors in present stimuli (the mosaic, the glass eyes) and tilts the stance at closure without flattening pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (acceptance of the missing space) with visible cost: Corren relinquishes retrieval and commits to a teaching future that honors loss. The lens reads Accumulative/Textural—density increases through layered description and the shift from pleading to acceptance reweights the dominant stake. Orientation anchors who/where/when early (Corren, cavern orchard, night). One turn (the shift from retrieval to acceptance) tightens options with felt opportunity cost, satisfying the one-meaningful-deepening threshold for this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The cavern orchard is vividly rendered (stalactites as "slow clocks," glassy fruit, mineral pools) and the mosaic stepping stone constrains Corren's method. The glass eyes function as micro-setting tools that charge the conjuring beat. Sensory detail (dripping stalactites, damp stone, flavorless dust) filters through Corren's focalized attention and the environment subtly mirrors his internal state (the cavern "taking a breath it will never release"). The setting participates in the final image (stalactites resume ticking, silence becomes "almost kind"), meeting the 9+ gate for setting that charges closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding/retrieving Lio—is signaled early and tightens when Corren realizes retrieval would "tear open every branch." The conjuring attempt escalates through murmured equations and shifting reflections, then deepens via the protagonist's agency when he shifts the spell toward acceptance. The cost is legible: he forgoes retrieval and accepts the shape of absence. No antagonist or multiple reversals, but pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens and one meaningful tightening (the shift) forecloses a path, meeting the threshold for this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme (living with ambiguous loss, honoring absence without retrieval) emerges from concrete particulars: the extra bowl, the mosaic pattern, the glass eyes. The final image—teaching children to "count pauses"—offers a resonant answer without moralizing. The line "perhaps survival can balance on acceptance" risks thesis-speak but is quickly grounded in the vision of future teaching. "Old sorrow and tentative purpose dovetail" uses the required action as metaphor, threading it into thematic closure. Subtext operates in the orchard's silence and the unfinished motion of the taxidermied stag.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable with a distinct perceptual signature: Corren notices in precise, magical terms ("ratios of longing to memory," "moss threads its way"). Diction is controlled and voice-motivated throughout, matching a scholarly conjurer's register. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (closer during conjuring, pulling back for the future vision). No dialogue to evaluate. The prose reflects Corren's character-specific lens (equations, infinities, variables) and compression under peak stress ("the more he calls, the more the image frays") maintains internal texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is high in most beats, but overwriting clusters in the opening third: nearly every sentence in paragraphs 8–11 carries figurative language ("chipped tesserae like a spell," "unfinished motion," "coaxed rain from dry wells," "moss threads," "spirals neither growing nor shrinking"). Mixed metaphor: "leaves like dim hands cupping sound" while stalactites are "slow clocks"—sensory vehicles collide. Template stems appear ("His magic is not... it is," "The orchard hums... the air contracting"). Apply −0.6 for density without pattern-teaching and −0.3 for template cadence, totaling −0.9 in this category. Figurative muddle does not touch the closure beat directly, so deductions stay within non-closure cap range.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of ambiguous loss, conjuring-as-mathematics, and cavern-orchard is specific and non-obvious. The taxidermist's glass eyes as vessels for "unfinished motion" show ingenuity. Emotional truth (acceptance without retrieval) avoids generic templates and the final image (teaching children to honor absence) feels inevitable in hindsight. The premise transforms familiar "lost loved one" material through the literalized mathematics metaphor and the orchard's mute response. Risk-taking in the lyric-textural design heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, warranting within-band elevation of +0.3.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Corren is present throughout, makes the key choice to shift the spell from retrieval to acceptance, and that choice alters the closure. Setup early, middle choice (kneeling, conjuring, realizing the cost), and closure participation all present. Causal pressure and closure linkage are strong. The secretive/market reputation angle is ornamental (−0.3), but the conjurer role is indispensable to the plot and stakes.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The glass eyes appear in three beats: drawn from the satchel, placed into the mosaic hollows, and retrieved at the end. They enable the conjuring (middle development) and their "unfinished motion" property narrows the attempt's outcome. Closure linkage is solid (pocketing them after accepting the orchard's answer). Specificity (taxidermist's, from a stag mid-leap, smoky blue) and irreplaceability (only unfinished things listen to unfinished things) elevate the score. Early signal, beat involvement (×3), causal pressure, and closure presence justify high-7 band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Ambiguous loss (Lio walked in, never walked out, no body) shapes the dominant stake throughout and changes Corren's tactics on the page: he tries retrieval, then shifts to understanding how to live with the missing space. The concept drives two beats (the conjuring attempt and the realization/shift) and the closure reweights it (acceptance, teaching children). Cost is visible (forgoing retrieval). Setup early, middle pressure, and closure payoff all strong. Specificity (three winters, the extra bowl, "the arithmetic of missing steps") makes it irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Gently inventive" is labeled early ("A gently inventive man") and demonstrated in his magic's method ("weaving possibilities the way moss threads... not explosive"). It constrains his approach (he cannot force retrieval by brute magic) and enables the shift toward acceptance. The trait appears in one key beat (the conjuring) and colors the closure image (teaching children inventive listening). Setup, middle enabling, closure tone; causal pressure moderate. Label-only mention in paragraph 4 (−0.3), but the trait's constraint on method and its link to the final teaching vision raise it above mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Dovetail" appears twice: first as metaphor in the conjuring equations ("hope and fear dovetail into spirals"), then at closure ("Old sorrow and tentative purpose dovetail inside his chest"). The second use ties directly to the final stance (acceptance + teaching). The action defines the resolution's shape: mismatched pieces holding steady. Setup metaphor, thematic payoff, and closure participation present. Swappability is low (another joining verb would not carry the "awkward but workable" connotation). Not fully indispensable to plot mechanics, but strongly integrated into theme and closure image.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The mosaic stepping stone is introduced early (Corren kneels, studies it, Lio once traced it), shapes the conjuring method (glass eyes set into its hollows, reading "broken tesserae like a spell"), and reappears in the closure reflection (the path he believed ran via the patterns). Setup, middle method, closure linkage all present. The chipped patterns constrain his attempt (he must decode them) and the mosaic's half-buried state adds specificity. Causal pressure moderate; the method matters but does not foreclose alternate tactics as sharply as other elements. Beat involvement (×2), early signal, and closure mention justify mid-6 to low-7 band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The cavern orchard nourished by dripping stalactites is introduced in the opening line, supplies the setting for all action, and its mute state (bare branches, no fruit) blocks Corren's retrieval directly. The stalactites function as "slow clocks" (temporal pressure) and the orchard "leans in" during conjuring, then resumes ticking at closure. Mineral pools, damp stone, and glassy fruit constrain movement and method. Setup immediate, middle pressure (the orchard's response to the spell), and closure participation (stalactites resume, silence becomes kind) all strong. The setting is indispensable to both stakes and closure image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the orchard grows silent beneath the moon" anchors the night setting but does not impose a live ticking clock that alters tactics. "Tonight" is mentioned twice, but no deadline pressures Corren's choices. Time does not tighten decisions on the page. Setup present (title/opening), but missing middle escalation and closure participation. Functional atmosphere, replaceable pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The motivation "to understand the mathematics of emotion etched in the silences between heartbeats" is stated early and dramatized through the conjuring attempt: Corren murmurs "ratios of longing to memory, equations where hope and fear dovetail." The desire conflicts with cost (retrieval would tear open futures) and shifts at closure to "asking the orchard to show him how to live with the shape of the missing space." Setup, middle friction, closure reweighting all present. The mathematics framing is specific and irreplaceable, shaping both method and theme. Visible cost (forgoing retrieval) tied to the motivation.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Tone begins somber (haunted by absence, mute orchard, "flavorless dust") and modulates through the conjuring's escalating ache to the final image where silence becomes "almost kind" and Corren sees himself teaching children—a shift toward tentative hope. The buried optimism emerges at closure (survival balanced on acceptance, "workable" though awkward). Tone is coherent through turns and charges the final image. Setup (initial grief/absence), middle modulation (the orchard's low ache, sweat, understanding), and closure lift (kindness, teaching) all present. Not indispensable (another tone could serve the arc), but well-integrated and purposeful.</comment>
