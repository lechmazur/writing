<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Irian's internal conflict between duty and mercy is embodied through the concrete act of forging, with the rose thorn functioning as a tactile anchor to his mother's unfinished letter. The motivation to "forgive the unfinished" drives the final choice to sign in his own hand, creating a visible cost (exposure of all prior forgeries). Sevran's arrival adds pressure, though his quick pivot to enabler slightly reduces antagonistic weight. The final renunciation—signing as himself rather than the king—is earned and forecloses the forger's shadow-identity with felt cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Drive lens: Causal with accumulative texture. The piece anchors who/where/when within the opening lines (Irian, marble sanctuary, aurora night). Escalation proceeds through a meaningful tightening: Irian moves from altering decrees in secret to openly signing his own name, exposing all prior work. Sevran's discovery functions as a reversal that narrows options, then enables the final choice. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: Irian signs "not as the king but as yourself," unlinking his name with visible cost (risk of execution, loss of anonymity). The cost is legible on the page in the line "each stroke no longer borrowed but born, imperfect yet wholly his."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The marble sanctuary, stalactite drip, and aurora provide sensory grounding and constrain the scene's urgency (the dripping marks time, the sanctuary's isolation enables secrecy). Pearl twilight and auroral shimmer modulate with emotional beats. The heritage rose thorn and the key function as tactile micro-setting elements that charge the final choice. Spatial choreography (lectern, columns, obsidian floor) remains clear. The environment's "wisely enduring" quality mirrors Irian's decision to accept the unfinished, tying setting to theme without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: save the eastern scholars and unlink Irian's name from the king's shadow, signaled early. One meaningful tightening occurs when Sevran discovers the forgery, forcing Irian to either flee or commit fully. The final choice—signing in his own hand—narrows all future options and carries visible cost (exposure of every prior forgery, likely execution). Agency is clear: Irian's decision, not coincidence, drives the resolution. The price is legible in "each stroke no longer borrowed but born," and the scholars' fate hinges on this act.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the rose thorn, unfinished letter, and the act of forgery: completion versus acceptance of the incomplete. The final image—signing imperfectly in his own hand—offers a resonant answer without moralizing: some stories must break pattern to become whole. Subtext operates in Sevran's choice to enable rather than arrest, and in the key's symbolic weight ("opens only what you are ready to release"). The piece resists tidy resolution; Irian's survival and the decree's success remain uncertain, preserving complexity. No thematic echo or stated moral in the final paragraph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with close psychic distance; perceptual signature is selective (ink, thorn, marble, light). Dialogue between Irian and Sevran is sparse but goal-driven, carrying subtext in Sevran's "which crime is greater" and the key exchange. Syntax modulates with pressure: shorter clauses during the discovery beat. Minor register drift appears in phrases like "calibrated treason" and "cognitve smoothness," which feel slightly elevated for the immediacy of the moment but remain within an educated forger's lexicon. No head-hopping; focalization is clean.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies; sentence openings shift between subject-first and prepositional phrases. Information density is high in the opening third but slackens slightly in the middle with near-paraphrases ("He had never opened that letter" followed by "Since then he had served completion"). Template cadence appears in repeated "Irian [verb]" constructions across three sentences mid-piece, triggering −0.4. The phrase "stalactites drip" recurs without evolution, reading as filler (−0.2 paraphrase loop). Figurative language ("bled like confession," "blade on glass") is purposeful and controlled, but "pearl twilight" and "aurora" are invoked multiple times without added weight. No artifacts touch the closure beat; final image is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of calligraphy forgery, underground sanctuary, and the mother's unfinished letter creates a specific, non-obvious frame. The piece transforms the "secret saboteur" trope through the tactile rose thorn and the choice to sign authentically rather than continue hiding. Sevran's pivot from antagonist to enabler feels slightly convenient, reducing friction. The key "with no apparent lock" risks symbolic convenience but is grounded early and paid off concretely. Fresh inflection: signing imperfectly in one's own hand rather than perfectly in another's. Emotional specificity (the half-written letter, the fear of incompletion) avoids generic templates.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Irian's choices create every major turn: deciding to forge the revocation, continuing when discovered, and signing in his own name. Present throughout; his decisions alter tactics (honesty with Sevran) and drive closure. Removing this character collapses the story.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The rose thorn appears in three beats: initial mention, a mid-story brush for memory, and implicit presence in the final act of forgiveness. It anchors the motivation to "forgive the unfinished" and reweights at closure when Irian signs imperfectly. Swappable with another keepsake (locket, letter fragment) without major structural change, but the thorn's preserved, sharp quality adds specificity. Scores in the solid functional band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Calibrated treason" is named twice and operationalized: altering royal decrees, then forging a revocation to save scholars. It shapes stakes (risk of exposure) and tactics (precision in forgery). The concept charges the climax when Irian must choose between calibrated anonymity and open authenticity. Removing it would require reframing the entire conflict.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Wisely enduring" is attributed to the sanctuary and echoed in Irian's choice to accept incompletion. It appears once as description and once as thematic closure note. The trait does not constrain an on-page action with visible cost; it functions more as thematic resonance than causal pressure. Mid-band functional.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>"Unlink" is the story's hinge: Irian unlinks the scholars from conscription and unlinks his own name from the king's shadow by signing authentically. The act is irreplaceable; swapping it (e.g., "release," "free") would dilute the precise image of severing binding oaths. Major turns trace directly to this action, and it defines the closure image.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The key appears in two beats: resting by the inkwell and Sevran's exchange. Its "no apparent lock" quality is signaled early and paid off at closure when Sevran says it "opens only what you are ready to release," enabling Irian's final choice. The key could be replaced with another symbolic enabler (a seal, a blade) with minor edits, but its warmth and Sevran's handling give it tactile presence. Lyric reprise reweights the stake.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The marble sanctuary provides isolation (enables secret forgery), the stalactite drip marks time (tightens pressure), and the aurora's flicker announces Sevran's approach. The obsidian floor and central lectern ground spatial choreography. The setting constrains choices (cannot flee easily, sound echoes) and charges the final image ("within the wisely enduring sanctuary"). Removing this exact setting would weaken the closure's resonance and the story's atmospheric coherence.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"As stalactites drip" recurs three times to mark passing time and create rhythm. It tightens urgency slightly (Sevran's approach, decision pressure) but does not create a live countdown that alters tactics. Functions as atmospheric pacing rather than hard constraint. One beat of middle development present; closure does not hinge on the drip itself.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"To forgive the unfinished" is dramatized through Irian's refusal to open his mother's letter, his compulsive completion of others' words, and the final choice to sign imperfectly. The motivation is conflicted (fear of incompletion versus need for authenticity) and drives the climax. It shapes two beats and participates in closure when Irian accepts imperfection. Cost is visible: exposing all prior forgeries.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Pearl twilight" appears in the opening and closing, modulating from "softening every sharp edge" to "dissolving the lights" as tension rises and resolves. Tone remains elegiac and contemplative, coherent through Sevran's discovery and the final choice. It charges the final image by framing the sanctuary's endurance. Could be replaced with another twilight descriptor, but the pearl quality adds specificity and ties to the aurora's shimmer.</comment>
