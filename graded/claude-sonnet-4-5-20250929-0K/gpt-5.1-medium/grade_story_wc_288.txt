<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lio's interior contradictions are present—the overlap of reincarnation memories creating uncertainty about which self is "true"—and the final choice to "become independent not from the world, but from despair" reflects earned movement. However, the embodiment of emotion remains abstract: "brittle awakenings," "fingers tight on the rail," and the reflection's "brittle awakening of emotion" repeat the same metaphor without physical specificity. The dialogue with the past self risks therapy-speak ("mistook isolation for purity," "choosing connection, not needing it") that flattens urgency at a pivotal beat, though the choice to prepare a harbor and adjust the library's tides does foreclose passivity with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural, with the sundial ritual and reflection encounter deepening Lio's reframing of solitude into a craft. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Lio lifts the sundial, the library adjusts, and "isolation felt like raw material" reweights the dominant stake with conceptual cost—solitude is no longer a sentence but a chosen practice. The orientation anchor (tidal library, eastern balcony, fourth morning) arrives clearly by line 3. One meaningful deepening occurs when the reflection warns "awakenings are brittle only if you refuse to move," prompting Lio's harbor decision. Cost is legible but oblique—Lio accepts永久 curator status and renounces the wish to resurrect extinct companions—yet the price could be sharper on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The tidal library "rose and fell with the moods of the sky," shelves drifting "like anchored ships," and the stone circle's hum are vivid and purposeful. The sundial's "atomically reflective" surface catches shifting scripts, charging the reflection scene. Spatial choreography is mostly clear—balcony, rotunda, catalog towers—though the "pit of mist" and "twelve standing pillars" could be more concretely anchored in Lio's movement. The setting constrains choice: the stone circle enables the reflection encounter, and the library's tidal adjustment at the end becomes the proof of Lio's new independence, satisfying the 9+ test for constraint/charge.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: translate isolation into independence, signaled early. One meaningful tightening: Lio aligns the sundial, the reflection appears, and the encounter forces Lio to distinguish solitude (a sentence) from independence (a craft). Agency is present—Lio decides to "prepare a harbor" and feed the library's movements with their own decisions—but the escalation is conceptual rather than volitional struggle. The reflection delivers the key insight ("choosing connection, not needing it") rather than Lio discovering it through embodied choice, softening protagonist-driven pressure. Cost is visible but quiet: Lio accepts永久 stewardship and renounces species revival.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—solitude as craft versus sentence, independence from despair—emerges through the sundial ritual, the reflection dialogue, and the library's responsive tilt. The ending offers a resonant answer without moralizing: "isolation felt like raw material, and independence felt like a craft they were finally ready to practice." The "atomically reflective" sundial layering both Lios' faces as "geological strata" is a strong image that reweights the reincarnation premise. Minor slip: "Remember that awakenings are brittle only if you refuse to move" slightly edges toward thesis statement, but it's voiced by the reflection rather than authorial intrusion, and the thesis is earned by prior particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Lio; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present: "shelves drift like anchored ships," "thunder of sky whales," "scent of rain trapped in leaves." However, diction occasionally slips into elevated register that tests the focalizer's lexicon: "translate isolation into independence," "geological strata pressed into metal," "contemporaneity of species the world had already declared extinct." The dialogue between the two Lios feels more like philosophical exchange than lived speech—"mistook isolation for purity" and "choosing connection, not needing it" lack subtext or evasion. Distance control is consistent, but the prose leans lyric-essayistic rather than character-particular under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Line-level clarity is generally strong, but several issues accumulate. Paraphrase loop: "They had come here to translate isolation into independence, to turn solitude into something inhabitable" restates the same idea across two clauses without added pressure. Template cadence: multiple paragraphs open with "The [noun]" or "Lio [verb]," creating rhythmic monotony. Stock metaphor: "brittle awakenings" recurs three times without evolving. Filter-verb stack in reflection beats: "Lio recognized," "Lio watched," "Lio saw" flatten immediacy. The "atomically reflective" description is vivid but borders on overwriting when paired with "impossibly clean shine" and "mirroring not just light but the arrangement of time itself." Artifact penalty: −0.8 for loops and template runs, though they do not obscure closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The tidal library and reincarnation memory premise offer fresh synthesis, and the choice to use the sundial to summon a past self is a non-obvious angle. The ending—Lio adjusting to the library as it adjusts to them—feels earned and specific. However, the emotional arc (loner realizes community matters) is a familiar template, and the dialogue between selves risks the "wise elder teaches protagonist" structure. The "atomically reflective" sundial and sky-whale extinction details add texture, but the core insight ("choosing connection, not needing it") arrives via the reflection's speech rather than Lio's embodied discovery, which softens ingenuity. Within-band adjustment: +0.2 for the tidal-library conceit and the dual-Lio layering image.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character "contemporary of extinct species" is signaled early ("older than any librarian," "sky whales above drowned continents") and shapes Lio's motivation—solitude as the last survivor drives the isolation-versus-independence stake. The attribute appears in two beats: initial exposition and the reflection's warning ("we mistook isolation for purity and watched our companions fade"). However, Lio's choices at closure (prepare a harbor, adjust the library) are not uniquely tied to being a survivor; a non-extinct character could make the same moves. The element reweights theme but does not foreclose a distinct option. Setup and closure participation present; middle development weak. Score: 5.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Brass sundial appears in three beats: Lio holds it on the balcony, aligns it on the pedestal (triggering the reflection), and lifts it at the end. Its "atomically reflective" surface catches the two Lios' faces "like geological strata," charging the closure image. The object enables the key turn (summoning the past self) and is handled on the page, satisfying causal pressure and closure linkage. However, the sundial could be replaced with another reflective ritual object (mirror, pool) with modest edits, limiting irreplaceability. Setup, development, and closure participation all present. Score: 7.2.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Core concept "brittle awakenings" is signaled early ("days had become brittle awakenings, each realization splintering") and returns in the reflection's warning ("awakenings are brittle only if you refuse to move"). The concept shapes the dominant stake—Lio's fear that solitude is a sentence—and the resolution redefines brittleness as opportunity for movement. However, the phrase itself remains metaphorical; it does not constrain a tactical choice on the page. The concept operates primarily at theme level rather than altering options. Setup and closure participation present; causal pressure indirect. Score: 6.4.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Attribute "atomically reflective" is mentioned twice: the sundial's "atomically reflective" face mirrors "the arrangement of time itself," and later it catches "the shifting scripts like constellations." The trait enables the dual-Lio image at closure, charging the final layering ("both of their faces shimmered, layered like geological strata"). However, the attribute is descriptive rather than constraining—an ordinary mirror or polished surface could serve the same function with minor wording changes. No on-page cost or tactic tied uniquely to atomic reflection. Setup and closure participation present; causal pressure weak. Score: 5.1.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Action "coexist" is signaled early ("wanted the library not only to float but to coexist with whatever future might still be coming") and drives the resolution: Lio decides to "prepare a harbor" and make the library "adjust its tides, to lower itself when voices gather and rise when they depart." The coexistence goal shapes the ending choice—feeding the library's movements with Lio's decisions—and forecloses passive stewardship. However, the action is conceptual rather than embodied; Lio does not perform a distinct physical coexistence move on the page. Setup, development (harbor decision), and closure participation all present. Score: 6.7.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Method "by the hum of an ancient stone circle" is signaled early ("the hum of an ancient stone circle kept the whole structure afloat," "That same vibration had drawn Lio here") and appears in two beats: the circle's hum deepens when the sundial is aligned, and it "softened, settling into a rhythm that matched Lio's pulse" at closure. The hum enables the reflection's appearance and signals the library's responsiveness at the end. However, the mechanics remain abstract—how the hum specifically triggers the reflection or why it syncs to Lio's pulse is not shown. Setup, development (reflection summoning), and closure participation present; causal specificity moderate. Score: 6.9.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Setting "tidal library above clouds" is signaled immediately and shapes three beats: the drifting shelves establish atmosphere, the stone circle rotunda enables the reflection encounter, and the library's tidal adjustment at closure embodies Lio's independence. The setting's tidal property becomes the proof of coexistence—"with each step, the tidal library above the clouds adjusted to them, and they adjusted to it"—making the environment an active participant in the resolution. The library constrains (must be aligned via sundial) and enables (responds to Lio's decisions). Setup, development, and closure participation all strong. Score: 7.8.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Timeframe "after the reincarnation memory" is signaled early ("fourth morning after the reincarnation memory had cracked open") and frames the entire narrative—Lio's reflection on overlapping lives drives the isolation-versus-independence question. However, the timeframe does not tighten on the page; no countdown or urgency escalates within the four-day window. The memory's aftermath shapes motivation but does not alter tactics or narrow options. Setup present; closure linkage thematic but not causal. Score: 5.6.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Motivation "to translate isolation into independence" is signaled early and drives the entire arc. Lio's question to the reflection ("I needed to know if solitude is a sentence or a resource") embodies the want, and the resolution—"In feeding its movements with my own decisions, I become independent not from the world, but from despair"—shows friction between renouncing species revival (cost) and choosing stewardship (independence). The motivation is dramatized in the sundial alignment and harbor decision, with visible cost (永久 solitude accepted). Setup, development, and closure participation all present. Score: 7.3.</comment>
