<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Arlen's interior is established through concrete sensory work (chain sliding through fingers, reading smudged ink via adhesive analysis), and his professional identity as floodgate machinist constrains his approach to the city's problem. The council members remain largely undifferentiated despite occupational tags (mill captain, priest, noblewoman), functioning more as voices than individuals. The final collective adjustment of the chain shows agency, but Arlen's internal contradiction and cost feel muted—his trembling is mentioned but the stakes of failure for him personally remain abstract. His belief that "every machine, every law, was a kind of encrypted compassion" operates more as thematic declaration than lived struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece anchors who/where/when cleanly within the opening lines (Arlen, amphitheater, dormant volcano, present continuous as council arrives). Drive lens reads as Situational-Accumulative Hybrid: pressure accumulates through the council's clashing edicts, and Arlen's proposal (rotating floodgates, shared mercy encoded in gears) crystallizes a stance that reconfigures the conflict. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—the councilors stepping forward to adjust the chain into a circle, with the felt alignment in Arlen's chest—though the conceptual cost (no permanent supremacy, rotating vulnerability) is more implied than viscerally dramatized on the page. One meaningful tightening occurs when voices collide and Arlen raises the chain to interrupt, narrowing options toward collective agreement.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The amphitheater is vividly anchored (groaning stone ribs, cracked center, ragged circle of sky, scarred seating) and functions as more than backdrop: the treaties stored in stone niches establish the conflict's history, and the building's breathing becomes a recurring sensory anchor that modulates with narrative pressure. The surveyor's chain is handled across multiple beats (sliding through fingers, laid in a looping figure, adjusted by councilors) and its physical properties (iron links, weight, length) constrain the final collaborative gesture. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout (stage, orchestra pit, seating tiers). The dormant volcano below provides thematic resonance (patient restraint of heat) that charges the final alignment metaphor.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—harmonizing the city's conflicting floodgate priorities to prevent collective ruin—is signaled early and maintained throughout. Pressure accumulates as the council enters with "rolled diagrams like half-drawn swords" and their voices collide immediately, each advocating mutually exclusive priorities. Arlen's proposal (rotating mercy, no permanent supremacy) narrows options by forcing the council to "choose how its links touch one another" rather than selecting a single winner. The escalation reads under the Situational-Accumulative lens: Arlen's agency lies in reframing the problem and allowing his vulnerability (voice shaking, visible tremor) to model collective risk. Cost is more conceptual than viscerally felt—"everyone would sometimes stand on higher, drier ground" implies rotating vulnerability but the immediate price (who floods first, what is lost in the rotation) remains abstract.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—encrypted compassion, the tension between care and code, restraint as collective survival—emerges organically from the floodgate metaphor and the chain's fixed length requiring reconfiguration rather than extension. The closing image (councilors adjusting the chain into a circle, alignment clicking into place inside Arlen's chest, dormant volcano keeping its peace) offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The line "compassion narrowed into a blade" distills the conflict's moral calculus sharply. Minor weaknesses: "every machine, every law, was a kind of encrypted compassion" risks thematic statement, though it's filtered through Arlen's professional lens. The "code disguising who must be protected first" is conceptually rich but not fully dramatized—we see the conflict over districts but not the embedded hierarchies within their pleas.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Arlen; narrative distance is controlled, with access to his sensory particulars (chain weight tugging like current, trembling from anticipation, reading fear in smudged ink via adhesive analysis) and professional idiom (floodgate machinist, river valves, counterweights). The perceptual signature is selective and voice-consistent: he reads the city through hydraulic metaphors and interprets social conflict as engineering problems. Dialogue is minimal but functional; the councilors' exchange ("the river should favor work" / "temples" / "ancestral gardens") feels schematic rather than individually voiced, each speaking in equally articulate declarations without subtext or embodied goal pursuit. Diction occasionally drifts toward elevated abstraction ("encrypted compassion," "thin, bright line of shared worry") that sits at the edge of Arlen's plausible lexicon but doesn't break it. No head-hopping or tense instability.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, with lyric compression in the opening ("listening as the building breathes in dust and exhales forgotten applause") giving way to clearer syntax as the council arrives. Information density is high in the adhesive-analysis passage (families licking the envelope in turn, mixed saliva revealing distrust and shared worry) and the chain's symbolic work (measuring first channels, links that cannot change length but can touch differently). Overwriting cluster: multiple figurative constructions stack within single paragraphs without clear escalation ("echoing ribs of stone," "snarled customs," "quarrels into measured flow," "kindness inside the code"), creating decorative density rather than propulsion. Minor template cadence in the council's entrance: "A mill captain scoffed... a priest argued... a noblewoman demanded" follows parallel stems without variation. No paraphrase loops or pronoun ambiguity; grammar and tense are clean. The phrase "as the building breathes" recurs three times and functions as intentional motif rather than artifact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The core synthesis—floodgate engineering as metaphor for rotating collective mercy, encoded in the physicality of a surveyor's chain and enacted in a volcanic amphitheater—feels specific and non-obvious, though the "city drowning without water" conceit and cooperative-game resolution trace familiar territory. Strongest originality lies in procedural specificity: analyzing adhesive from a once-sealed envelope to read layered authorship, the surveyor's chain as both historical tool and present-day constraint, rotating floodgate schedules as encoded fairness. The volcano-as-restraint metaphor ("magma cooled into patient rock, a vast reservoir of heat that chose not to rise") is thematically coherent but leans decorative. Transformation test: the emotional arc and procedural particulars depend heavily on the floodgate profession and chain object; swapping to generic mediator-and-symbol would flatten the story. Minor risk-taking in the lyric passages and adhesive-analysis method; the cooperative resolution itself plays safely within established genre expectations for consensus-building fantasy.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Arlen's profession (floodgate machinist) is signaled early, shapes his perceptual lens (reading the city through hydraulic metaphors, interpreting social conflict as engineering problems requiring measured flow), and drives the key turn: his proposal of rotating floodgates with no permanent supremacy. His decision to lay the chain in a looping figure and voice the core constraint ("its length cannot change, but you may choose how its links touch one another") narrows the council's options and enables the collaborative adjustment. His trembling and visible vulnerability model the shared risk he asks of the council. The profession is indispensable—a generic mediator could not propose the rotating-schedule mechanism with equivalent specificity or credibility.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The surveyor's chain appears in four distinct beats: (1) introduced with historical context (mapped first aqueducts, measurements of a time when the city agreed), (2) handled by Arlen (sliding through fingers, weight tugging like current), (3) raised to catch sunbeams and interrupt the council's argument, (4) laid in a looping figure on the floor and adjusted by councilors into a circle. Its fixed length becomes the story's central constraint ("its length cannot change"), and the final collaborative adjustment directly enacts the closure. The chain's historical function (mapping aqueducts) and physical properties (iron links, weight, length) are causally integrated. Removing it would collapse both the proposal's mechanics and the ending's symbolic charge.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Encrypted compassion" is introduced early ("every machine, every law, was a kind of encrypted compassion, a code disguising who must be protected first") and shapes Arlen's diagnostic reading of the city's problem: the code has been rewritten until "no one could read the kindness inside." The concept recurs when Arlen identifies the council's sincerity as "compassion narrowed into a blade" and his proposal is described as "slyly heartfelt... offering no permanent supremacy, only the promise that everyone would sometimes stand on higher, drier ground." The rotating-floodgate mechanism embodies encrypted compassion: fairness encoded in gears and counterweights. However, the concept operates more as thematic frame than tactical constraint—Arlen's choices (reading adhesive, proposing rotation) would function similarly under other framings (e.g., "encoded fairness" or "distributed risk"). The encryption metaphor itself is not dramatized; we don't see Arlen deciphering a literal code or mechanical cipher.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Slyly heartfelt" is applied twice: once to the summons letter ("the ink formal yet smudged where someone had hesitated over his name... slyly heartfelt") and once to Arlen's proposal ("slyly heartfelt, offering no permanent supremacy"). The attribute captures the tension between formality and vulnerability, indirect care masked by procedural language. It constrains Arlen's reading of the summons (he analyzes the adhesive and smudge rather than taking the words at face value) and characterizes his rhetorical strategy (letting his voice shake, modeling vulnerability). However, "slyly heartfelt" functions more as descriptive trait than active constraint—Arlen's key moves (chain demonstration, rotation proposal) would succeed similarly if framed as "pragmatic" or "transparent." The attribute colors tone but does not force a visible tradeoff or enable a unique tactic.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Tremble" appears three times: (1) Arlen trembles when stones tumble into the orchestra pit ("more from anticipation than fear"), (2) his voice shakes when proposing the rotating floodgates ("His voice shook, and he let them see it"), and (3) the alignment clicks into place at closure. The second instance drives the key turn—Arlen's visible vulnerability models the shared risk he asks of the council, breaking the deadlock by demonstrating that care can coexist with uncertainty. The action is embodied and causally motivated (he has "watched other cities choose singular safety and collective regret"), and the councilors respond by stepping forward. However, "tremble" could be replaced with other vulnerability signals (hesitation, pause, gesture) without fundamentally altering the mechanics. The trembling charges the moment but does not uniquely enable the proposal's logic.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The adhesive analysis appears in one passage: "He had read the fear behind that smudge by analyzing the leftover adhesive from a once-sealed envelope they tucked inside. Different families had licked it in turn, passing the message around, unable to agree on a single phrasing of their plea. Their mixed saliva had told him more than the words: distrust, duty, and the thin, bright line of shared worry." This method establishes Arlen's forensic ingenuity and reveals the council's fractured state before they arrive on stage, priming his later diagnosis of the problem. However, the method is mentioned only once, retrospectively, and does not shape tactics during the main conflict—Arlen does not use similar analysis in the amphitheater scene. The adhesive detail is memorable and thematically coherent (reading hidden layers, decoding mixed authorship) but functionally swappable with other diagnostic methods (handwriting analysis, interview fragments, intercepted messages).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The amphitheater setting is established early (groaning stone ribs, cracked center, ragged circle of sky, scarred seating, orchestra pit) and constrains the action throughout. The treaties stored in stone niches around the stage provide historical weight and justify the location choice; the acoustics amplify the council's clashing voices ("reverberating off the scarred seating"). The building's breathing recurs as a sensory anchor that modulates with narrative pressure ("soft settling of dust as the building breathes around them, considering"). The stage becomes the literal workspace where Arlen lays the chain in a looping figure and the councilors step forward to adjust it. The dormant volcano below charges the final alignment ("the dormant volcano kept its peace") by reinforcing the restraint theme. The setting is indispensable—a neutral conference room could not supply the acoustic pressure, spatial choreography, or symbolic resonance.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"As the building breathes" recurs three times as a sensory marker, creating a slow, continuous present tense that matches the deliberative nature of the conflict. The timeframe is durational rather than deadline-driven—Arlen waits for the council, they argue, he proposes, they adjust the chain, silence and settling dust mark the shift. The breathing metaphor implies patience and cyclical rhythm, appropriate for a consensus-building arc. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions; there is no clock pressure, no urgency that narrows options or forces premature choice. The phrase functions as atmospheric motif and tonal anchor but does not constrain tactics. A faster or slower timeframe would not materially change Arlen's approach or the council's response.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Arlen's motivation—"to harmonize conflicting values, to turn quarrels into measured flow rather than sudden ruin"—is established early and drives every key choice: reading the summons for underlying fear, studying the chain's historical function, proposing rotating floodgates that "favor different districts on different days." The motivation is dramatized through friction: the council's immediate collision of voices tests whether harmony is achievable, and Arlen's visible trembling shows the personal cost of advocating shared vulnerability. The want (harmony) conflicts implicitly with the council's individual needs (mill captain wants work favored, priest wants temples, noblewoman wants gardens), forcing Arlen to reframe the problem rather than choose a winner. The motivation is indispensable—removing it would hollow the protagonist's agency and the story's thematic core.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Dappled resolve" as tone coheres across the piece: moments of lyric beauty and sensory particularity ("sunbeams that filtered down like verdicts through the broken oculus," "echoing ribs of stone") interweave with Arlen's pragmatic focus (floodgate mechanics, surveyor's chain measurements) and vulnerability (trembling, voice shaking). The tone modulates with pressure—descriptive lyricism in the opening, sharper dialogue and shorter syntax as the council argues, then a return to image-centered closure (chain adjusted into a circle, alignment clicking into place, volcano keeping its peace). The "dappled" quality (light and shadow, beauty and ruin, confidence and doubt) charges the final image by refusing triumphalism. However, "resolve" as descriptor fits less tightly—Arlen's uncertainty and the council's reluctant cooperation read more as tentative alignment than firm resolve. The tone is coherent and purposeful but the label itself is only partially dramatized.</comment>
