<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's interior is grounded in concrete sensory detail—the chain link against ribs, the ache of steering memory—and interiority shifts credibly under pressure from curiosity to quiet astonishment. Internal contradiction operates when the protagonist chases "unfolded horizons" while teaching rote trench-junction arcs, generating friction that drives the late-night meeting. The final choice to apprentice oneself to edge geometry feels earned by the chain-link framing and the accumulated longing, though the cost (sleep, professional certainty) is implied rather than shown in a micro-action. Embodied emotion is strong; no therapy-speak intrudes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors arrive cleanly in the opening sentence (benthic city, numbers-as-stars). Pressure accumulates through layered images—alien spires, translated sky, lines of absence—and crystallizes in the final stanza when the narrator commits to reading edges "as I once read waves." The closure is Charged Poise: the protagonist stands "between worlds, quietly astonished," with the conceptual cost legible (abandoning surface certainty for an abyss curriculum whose horizon remains unknown). One tightening deepening occurs when Mirror dims the viewport and reveals edge geometry, reweighting all prior navigation stakes. Causality holds under the accumulative lens; no retroactive patches.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The benthic city exerts continuous pressure: pressure domes hum, diamond-glass viewports frame alien spires, and the "plain of black manganese nodules" grounds abstract stakes in tactile geology. The chain link functions as micro-setting, handled twice (worn on a cord, pressed against glass) and charging the final image by framing a cosmos it "had never known." Spatial choreography is precise—column at the back of the hall, furthest viewport, kilometers of layered water—and sensory hierarchy reflects urgency (lights thin, spires hum below hearing). Environment constrains the choice to meet Mirror and supplies the viewport as the medium for edge-geometry revelation, essential to closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake: learning to navigate by starlight in a world where "there was no north, only gradients and harmonics." One meaningful deepening occurs when Mirror replaces flat-paper charts with edge geometry, narrowing the protagonist's tactical options to this new curriculum. Agency is attention and apprenticeship—asking "Show me"—with the visible cost being professional exhaustion deferred and cognitive reorientation ("my mind tilt, relearning which way was forward"). The escalation is textural, accumulating through viewport revelation and constellation-sketching; no reversal is required under the accumulative lens. Coincidence does not resolve; Mirror's attendance has been established across prior lectures.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—bridging surface and abyss knowledge—emerges from concrete particulars: the chain link's "speck of surface rust," teaching "safe arcs through trench junctions" while chasing horizons "no sonar could display," and the aliens' diagnosis of humanity as "balancedly curious, torn between fear and wonder." The final image reweights prior material without moralizing: standing "between worlds" with "room to expand" answers the tension between flat paper and curved reality through embodied stance rather than epiphany. Subtext operates in Mirror's line "you are still drawing on flat paper" and the protagonist's whispered request, both indirection rather than thesis. No thematic echo in the ending; the conceptual cost (abandoning Cartesian certainty) is implicit and undeniable.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>POV distance is stable first-person; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent: the narrator filters alien geometry through nautical memory ("like unseen rigging," "steering locked to a single pole star") and registers sensory detail selectively under pressure (viewport as "blister," spires as "frozen sound"). Diction remains within the narrator's lexicon—helmsman-turned-instructor—with no register drift into academic abstraction. Mirror's communication is rendered through vibration and symbol translation, maintaining otherness without explanatory intrusion. Rhythmic control tightens at the ending ("quietly astonished that the universe still had room to expand") without losing the established reflective cadence. Minor filter-verb presence ("insisted," "imagined") is voice-motivated and does not dull immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Information density is high: most sentences layer description with interiority and stake advancement. Rhythm varies purposefully—longer reflective units early, tighter turns during the viewport sequence—and sentence openings avoid template stems. Minor paraphrase appears in adjacent lines ("Charts here were mapped... yet my mind chased") and one metaphor weakens under scrutiny ("equations that crawled like pale constellations" mixes vehicle scales). No loops touch the closure beat; the final lines propel cleanly through "navigation instructor between worlds" to "room to expand." Proofreading is clean; no pronoun ambiguity or tense drift. Overwriting is minimal, with figurative language concentrated in the viewport revelation where density serves accumulation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of deep-sea first contact and navigation pedagogy feels non-obvious and is executed through specific lived detail: teaching in "abyssal academies carved into basalt," wearing a chain link as mnemonic anchor, and alien curriculum framed as "edge geometry" rather than generic mysticism. The final turn—imagining cadets rising "from this benthic city" to "follow the edges of absence into interstellar gulfs"—grows inevitably from the established trajectory without late rule changes. Emotional specificity ("the memory of steering locked to a single pole star," "risk still smelled of salt, not coolant") grounds universals in particulars. Transformation test passes: plot and arc depend on the exact benthic-instructor frame and cannot be genericized. Modest risk in the accumulative structure pays off without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Present from the opening ("reassigned... to navigation instructor"), shapes two beats (lecture attendance, teaching request), and drives the closure decision to apprentice to edge geometry. The role constrains the protagonist's daily routine (six shifts plotting trench junctions) and enables access to Mirror's knowledge, creating the friction between rote instruction and horizon-chasing that motivates the viewport meeting. Cost is visible: exhaustion deferred, pedagogical certainty abandoned for student status. Early signal, causal pressure, closure linkage all present.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Introduced early (worn on a cord), handled twice (clinked against ribs before the meeting, held against glass at viewport), and charged at closure by framing "a sliver of sky, anchoring nothing but my attention." The chain link's rust and nautical origin ground the protagonist's surface memory, and its final repurposing from "dead weight" to frame transforms its meaning under edge geometry. Irreplaceability is high: no generic anchor artifact could carry the same nautical-to-abyssal trajectory. Visible cost tied to object: abandoning its original mooring function to serve as conceptual lens.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Signaled early ("my mind chased unfolded horizons no sonar could display") and reweighted at closure when the narrator learns that navigation requires curved thinking rather than "flat paper." The concept enables Mirror's instruction and shapes the protagonist's motivation, but its mechanics remain abstract—edge geometry is shown through viewport demonstration rather than a tactical choice that alters mid-scene options. Lyric reprise (first third → final image) reweights the dominant stake with undeniable pressure. Two gates met (setup, payoff); middle development is thematic rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Attributed to humanity by the alien emissary ("balancedly curious, torn between fear and wonder") and demonstrated in the protagonist's pull between exhaustion and curiosity when deciding to meet Mirror. The trait enables the viewport meeting (curiosity wins) but does not constrain a second on-page choice or exact a visible cost distinct from general fatigue. Present and functional, shaping one turn, but swappable with "restless" or "driven" without major structural loss. Mid-band for one-beat participation.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The universe "still had room to expand" charges the final image, answering the protagonist's stated need to learn navigation beyond sonar limits. The action—conceptual expansion rather than physical—reconfigures prior material: the benthic ceiling becomes permeable, edge geometry becomes curriculum, and future cadets' trajectories open toward "interstellar gulfs." Present in closure with thematic weight, but the mechanics are oblique; expansion is realized through stance shift rather than a discrete tactical maneuver. Two beats (Mirror's teaching moment, final projection) and closure linkage justify the score.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Introduced at the midpoint (Mirror's request), demonstrated through the viewport sequence (lines connecting starlight absences, gradients of pressure), and shapes the ending by redefining navigation curriculum. The method's mechanics matter: it replaces distance measurement with "shifts at the edge, where one song becomes another," altering what the protagonist must teach. Causal pressure is strong in the middle beat (the viewport dims, constellations appear), and the narrator's request to be taught frames the closure. Three gates met; irreplaceability high—no generic alien knowledge system could substitute without rewriting the edge-absence imagery.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The benthic city pressures every choice: students arrive with "eyes widened by somber marvel," navigation is mapped against thermal currents rather than stars, and the furthest viewport supplies the physical medium for edge-geometry revelation. Setting details (pressure domes, basalt academies, diamond-glass blister, manganese plain, alien spires) are integrated into action and perception, and the city's depth—"kilometers of water layered... into a film so thin my eyes insisted it was emptiness"—enables the conceptual bridge to surface starlight. Micro-setting (the chain link, the viewport) charges the final image. Essential across beats and ending.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Established in the opening ("three years after humanity discovered the aliens") and sustained through references to "the world above had become a rumor" and reassignment history, but the timeframe does not tighten decisions or create a live clock. The post-contact era provides context rather than urgency; no countdown or time-sensitive constraint shapes the protagonist's choice to meet Mirror or to commit to edge-geometry study. Functional backdrop, but replaceable with "in the era of..." without altering tactics. Setup present; development and payoff absent.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stated early ("it reminded me why I still wanted to learn to navigate by starlight"), dramatized in the tension between teaching "safe arcs through trench junctions" and chasing horizons "no sonar could display," and drives both the viewport meeting and the final apprenticeship commitment. Friction between want (starlight navigation) and cost (exhaustion, cognitive reorientation) is visible when the protagonist defers sleep and asks Mirror to teach. The motivation shapes three beats (chain-link reflection, meeting decision, final request) and anchors the closure image. Irreplaceable: no generic curiosity could substitute without losing the nautical-to-edge arc.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Coherent throughout: students arrive with "eyes widened by somber marvel," the chain link is a "speck of surface rust in this glassy abyss," and the protagonist stands "quietly astonished" at closure. Tone modulates under pressure—reflective early, tightening during the viewport revelation, expansive in the final projection—without breaking into sentimentality or cynicism. The marriage of wonder (alien geometry, translated stars) and solemnity (crushing sea, lost surface world) charges the ending image and integrates with the edge-geometry concept. Distinct perceptual signature; rhythm control under pressure evident.</comment>
