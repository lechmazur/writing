<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lan's interiority is concrete and character-particular ("dead languages the way some men collected rings, each dialect a loop of obligation around his heart"), with embodied perception through the archival method. The classroom memory grounds his present technique without exposition. Minor weakness: Maro remains functional but underdeveloped; his tension is told ("the word broke oddly in his mouth") rather than consistently shown through micro-choices under pressure. Internal contradiction is present but could deepen at the closure beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates density through layered archival imagery (fruit as labels, wax as ghost, listening as immersion) and pivots at the realization that the recording is "an accidental prophecy" from a prior oath-scribe. Closure is Conceptual Repricing: the final recognition reweights the archive's purpose—emotional patterns mistaken for outcomes—with conceptual cost (the speaker "had spoken an accidental prophecy"). Orientation is clean by line 3. One meaningful deepening occurs when Lan understands the recording describes feeling-patterns, not events, charging the premise without requiring a causal reversal.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The orchard garden is vividly anchored early ("trees bore fruit like muted lanterns, each pear and apple wrapped in gauze labels inked with dates and names") and functions as archive, shaping Lan's ritual and the night's confession. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Lan's archival focus (gravel, velvet disquiet, glue and chalk dust in memory). The wax shaving on the river stone and the garden lamps dimming modulate atmosphere purposefully. The garden does not constrain a tactical choice at closure, preventing entry to the 9-band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: archiving the wax recording and understanding its content. Pressure tightens when Lan realizes the voice speaks "institutional promises, vast and cold" rather than personal threads, then deepens with the recognition of accidental prophecy. The escalation is driven by attention and interpretive discovery under the Accumulative lens; no antagonist or reversal is required. Cost is conceptual (the archive now holds a prophecy, not just memory) but legible. Agency is interpretive endurance rather than overt decision, fitting the ritual frame.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme—the instability of archiving emotion versus event, the recursion of oath-scribes across time—emerges through concrete imagery (wax spiral, gauze labels, phonograph grooves) without meta-statement. The ending offers a resonant answer: attempts to catalog emotional weather inadvertently generate prophecy, reweighting the archive's purpose. "Accidental prophecy" lands as lived conceptual discovery rather than thesis. The final recognition ("trying… to archive emotional patterns… he had spoken an accidental prophecy") synthesizes prior particulars without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Voice is stable, lyric, and POV-controlled; perceptual signature is archival and layered ("dead languages the way some men collected rings"). Psychic distance narrows smoothly during the immersion sequence. Dialogue is minimal but purposeful ("It is not for you" conveys Lan's boundary and the recording's scope without exposition). Free indirect style is clean. No head-hopping. Minor note: some metaphors approach density that could blur immediacy ("the world thinned, the present sliding aside like a curtain") but remain legible and voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is rhythmically controlled and information-dense; figurative language serves mood and specificity ("fruit like muted lanterns," "voice speaking in a language so old it had petrified into ritual"). Sentence openings vary; no template cadence. Two minor slips: "It had been a curious third-grade field trip in reverse" reads slightly exposition-forward, and "the word buried had knotted itself around Lan's heart and never left" edges into summary. No paraphrase loops or filter-verb stacks. Clarity and momentum remain strong throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The premise—archiving emotion via wax phonograph shavings in a rooftop orchard, discovering recursive prophecy—is fresh and specific. The synthesis of oath-scribe ritual, dead languages, and accidental futures feels purposeful rather than prompt-checklist. The emotional truth (trying to preserve patterns of feeling inadvertently shapes outcomes) anchors the concept. Risk: the lyric density and elliptical closure demand trust but pay off with conceptual resonance. Not wholly unprecedented in SFF-lyric form, but the execution is confident and particular.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lan is present throughout, frames the ritual, and makes the interpretive discovery that the recording is accidental prophecy. Setup and payoff are strong; middle development is more observational than decision-driven. The piece is his perspective and his realization, but his agency is largely interpretive rather than choosing between options with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The wax shaving appears early in Lan's hands, is placed on the river stone for the immersion ritual, and returns charged at closure when its content is revealed as prophecy. Three distinct beats: delivery, ritual use, interpretive payoff. Specific properties (spiral memory, ghost of a recording) matter causally. Not indispensable—another archival artifact could function—but tightly woven.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Accidental prophecy is the story's conceptual hinge: setup (Lan archives oaths), development (the recording describes outcomes, not events), payoff (recognition that cataloging emotional patterns became prophecy). The concept redefines the archive's purpose and charges the closure with conceptual cost. Drives the final realization and reweights prior imagery.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Dead languages are introduced early ("he himself spoke dead languages the way some men collected rings") and enable Lan to understand the archival voice ("a language so old it had petrified into ritual"). The trait is visible in setup and payoff but does not constrain a middle choice with cost. Purposeful but not indispensable to the action.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Immerse" is seeded early ("to archive a sound, one had to immerse in its ghost"), enacted in the central beat (Lan brings his ear near, breathing matches the spiral, memory unfolds), and results in the climactic understanding. The action is irreplaceable—without it, no access to the recording's content or prophecy. Shapes two major beats and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The third-grade field trip memory is signaled midway, provides the method (phonograph principle: "follow the groove until it turns into a road"), and enables the immersion ritual. The memory anchors Lan's technique and the word "buried" that knotted around his heart. Setup is slightly late but functional; development and payoff are clear. Could be replaced with another origin for the method, but the specificity adds texture.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The orchard garden is introduced immediately, grounds the scene spatially and thematically (archive as fruit labels), and provides atmosphere ("garden seemed to lean inward"). It shapes the ritual's context but does not constrain a tactical choice. Present in setup and atmospheric payoff, but the closure turn is Lan's realization, not a garden-driven action.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The foghorn's silence opens the story and frames the sudden quiet, but no timeframe pressure shapes later choices. "Tonight it would receive another confession" sets occasion, not urgency. The clock is mentioned once ("tower clock had not yet finished swallowing the hour") but does not tighten decisions. Present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Archiving emotional patterns is Lan's explicit purpose ("trying… to catalog the weather inside the human chest") and the story's thematic spine. The motivation is dramatized through the ritual, his interiority, and the final recognition that his predecessor's attempt became prophecy. It drives setup, the immersion action, and charges closure with conceptual cost. Essential to stakes and theme.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Velvet disquiet is sustained through diction ("velvet-lined box," "garden lamps dimmed to a velvet disquiet," "thin as spider silk," "slow clarity of nightmare") and modulates with the immersion's uncanny deepening. Tone coheres across beats and charges the final image of recursive prophecy. Not indispensable but contributes meaningfully to atmosphere and closure weight.</comment>
