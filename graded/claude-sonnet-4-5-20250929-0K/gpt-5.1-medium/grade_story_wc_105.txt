<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation is concrete and embodied through synesthetic perception ("I hear colors faintly"), driving the underwater device-testing work. The kitchen memory provides clear backstory anchoring with a visible emotional cost ("bright green turned suddenly mute"). The dual-betrayal realization at the forge—"my partner breaking trust with me; the second was me breaking trust with myself"—is earned and complicates the interior landscape. Minor deduction: some interiority risks label-speak ("the sound of trust breaking") but recovers through specific sensory anchors.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (sunken greenhouse, solo diver, device designer) establish by the opening paragraph. The accumulative/textural lens is inferred: pressure deepens through layered absences ("silence where crew once cursed") and converges at the forge scene where the prototype "trembles, then releases a sound thin as a hairline fracture." Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration—the dual-betrayal insight reweights all prior material, and the final lacquer-over-crack metaphor lands with conceptual cost (acceptance of continuous repair). One micro turn (hearing two overlapping breaks) tightens the dominant stake without requiring multiple reversals.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The sunken orchard is vividly particularized ("skeletal trunks grope through dim water, leaves replaced by algae and patient barnacles") and constrains the protagonist's work—underwater testing matters because ruined colors still have music. The ashen forge functions as micro-setting, its "cooled stone" providing tactile anchoring and the "leaking chemical light" (aurora) charging the final prototype test. Sensory hierarchy reflects the protagonist's professional bias: color-sound synesthesia shapes what is noticed. The setting participates in closure when "broken blue swirl[s] through" the device, enabling the dual-betrayal recognition.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capture the sound of trust breaking to warn others) is signaled in the first third and deepens through repeated testing cycles. Pressure escalates under the accumulative lens: each dive harvests absences, the prototype "trembles," and the protagonist narrows in on "pale green, turning, deciding" until the kitchen memory surges back with structural clarity. Agency is exercised through engineering choice and self-recognition; the final act—"adjust a filament, and let the broken blue swirl through it again"—forecloses the path of denial with visible cost (acceptance that "no device can change that").</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme (trust as "a battered marvel continually repaired") emerges organically from the forge work, kitchen memory, and synesthetic perception without meta-commentary. The dual-betrayal insight—recognizing self-betrayal alongside the partner's—reweights the entire narrative and resists tidy morals. The closing image ("thin but steady, like lacquer on a cracked instrument") offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the thematic question, crediting repair over erasure. Recurring motifs (color death, absence harvesting, forge hum) accumulate pressure and charge the final beat without forced symbolism.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>POV remains stable in close third, filtering all sensory detail through the protagonist's synesthetic lens ("Blue sounds like glass breathing out"). Perceptual signature is character-specific: "every shade above the waves has a timbre." Diction stays consistent—lyric compression ("ashen forge under aurora") and technical idiom ("I rewired the prototypes to mirror my own anomaly") cohere without register drift. Purposeful elision (the partner's name, the exact timeline) serves the accumulative design and pays off at closure when the memory's structure—not its facts—matters.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Information density is high; lines layer action, sensory detail, and thematic weight ("The forge does not burn; it hums"). Sentence rhythm varies effectively under emotional pressure, accelerating at the kitchen memory and slowing at the lacquer-coda. Minor deduction: a few phrases risk lyric overload ("half graveyard, half cathedral," "wounded dawn") that approach but do not cross into opacity. No paraphrase loops; the repetition of "trust breaking" is purposeful recurrence tied to the dominant stake, not scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The synthesis—synesthesia × device design × underwater salvage × memory archaeology—is specific and non-obvious, avoiding template plots. The dual-betrayal insight transforms the premise from external quest to self-recognition, earned in hindsight by the "two overlapping" sounds motif. The forge as metaphor for emotional repair is fresh enough, though the closing lacquer image risks slight predictability. Risk is present in the accumulative structure and sensory abstraction ("what bodies refuse to admit"); both heighten stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The hearing aid designer role shapes every beat: assembles devices, tests prototypes, harvests absences, adjusts filaments. Early signal (first paragraph), middle development (forge testing), and closure participation (final adjustment enabling dual-betrayal recognition) satisfy all three gates. Causal pressure is strong—occupation enables the method and stakes. Cost connection is visible: professional tools fail to solve personal grief but offer a path to help others.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The ashen forge appears early ("In the orchard center stands the ashen forge under aurora"), is used in at least two distinct beats (feeding absences, adjusting the filament), and returns at closure when the protagonist "close[s] my eyes and listen[s], fingers pressed to the forge's cooled stone." Its properties matter: the "hum" and "cooled stone" ground the synesthetic work. Irreplaceability is high; the forge's dual nature (dead fire, living aurora) mirrors the theme. Minor: slightly ornamental phrasing ("my impossible workshop") but recovered by functional use.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Memory's impact shapes the dominant stake (chasing the kitchen sound) and alters tactics throughout: the protagonist dives repeatedly to "harvest what is no longer here," testing each absence against the remembered break. Closure hinges on memory's structural revelation (two overlapping betrayals). Early signal (kitchen memory introduced in first third), middle pressure (absences collected), and ending linkage (memory surges, enabling insight) satisfy all gates. Cost is conceptual: accepting that memory drives but cannot be erased.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Synesthesia ("hears colors faintly") enables the entire method—recording absences as color-textures ("yellow, papery and soft; others are deep red") and recognizing the kitchen sound's hue ("bright green turned suddenly mute"). Early signal (second paragraph), middle development (testing absences), and closure participation (identifying "pale green, turning") satisfy all gates. Causal pressure is strong: without this trait, the device logic collapses. Visible cost: the trait grants access to painful memory with no off-switch.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Imprint" appears explicitly ("I must imprint each with a specific absence") and governs the method: feeding collected absences into the prototype to train it. The action is signaled early, shapes middle beats (passing microphones through wrecks), and participates in closure (feeding the device again until it "releases a sound"). Causal role is clear—imprinting enables the device to approach the target sound. Minor swappability: "train" or "encode" could substitute with slight edits, capping upper band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Collecting absences" is signaled early ("you circle it by collecting absences"), mechanics matter across multiple beats (diving to harvest silence, recording gaps, feeding them to the forge), and the method participates in closure when "I feed it the absences I collected today." Causal pressure is strong: the method shapes every dive and test. Irreplaceability is high—replacing "absences" with "sounds" would reverse the logic. Cost connection: each dive risks physical danger (implied) and emotional exposure (explicit in the kitchen memory).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The sunken orchard greenhouse is anchored early (paragraph three), supplies the work environment (underwater testing requires this pressure), and charges the final image ("down here, among drowned branches" frames the acceptance). Spatial details alter tactics: broken panes let current move color-light, shipwrecks provide salvage sites, the forge's placement "in the orchard center" grounds orientation. Irreplaceability is high—surface workshop would eliminate the "ruined palette" essential to the theme. The setting participates causally in closure: testing "against the planet's oldest fractures" justifies the method.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The timeframe "while cells divide" appears twice—once as abstraction ("the biology will not care about my engineering, yet both are written while cells divide") and again at the forge ("joined by the soft ticking of distant, unseen organisms dividing"). It provides thematic resonance (continuous micro-creation mirrors repair) and modulates tone at closure ("new chances are being minted without our consent"). Setup in first half and closure participation satisfy two gates; missing middle development (no tactical pressure from the clock) caps the score. The phrase reweights meaning but does not tighten decisions.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The motivation ("to find the sound of trust breaking") is signaled early, dramatized through repeated dives and tests, and drives every choice until closure reveals dual betrayal. Early signal (explicit in first third), middle friction (devices "not yet match the record in my bones"), and closure transformation (realizing "I heard two overlapping") satisfy all gates. Cost is visible: years of underwater work, isolation, and confronting self-betrayal. Irreplaceability is high—swapping to "find closure" or "understand loss" would flatten specificity.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Battered marvel" is named explicitly ("The whole scene is a battered marvel, half graveyard, half cathedral") and governs tone throughout: beauty in ruin, function in brokenness. The tone modulates under pressure—lyric at the forge, taut at the kitchen memory, steady at closure—and charges the final image ("a battered marvel continually repaired"). Coherence is strong; no tonal breaks. The phrase reappears at closure, reweighting the dominant stake. Minor: slightly on-the-nose declaration in mid-scene; earned by final reprise.</comment>
