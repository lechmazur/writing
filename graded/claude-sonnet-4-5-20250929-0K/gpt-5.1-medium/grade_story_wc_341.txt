<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's interiority is concrete and specific, filtered through her professional lens of meteorology applied to grief and memory. Her choices—volunteering to drift, creating emotional cloud taxonomy, documenting atmospheric memory—reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. The decision to "let the broken space carry her" at the end is earned by the accumulating evidence and her shift from proving to accepting. Minor slip: the final realization feels slightly over-articulated for someone mid-experience, though it stops short of therapy-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens inferred and held throughout. Orientation anchors (Mara, gondola, post-accident drift) land within the opening paragraph. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Charged Poise—where Mara's realization that "the sky remembers everything we once believed would fall and vanish" crystallizes her stance with felt cost (she accepts the drift rather than demanding rescue). The cost is conceptual and emotional: she memorializes through surrender rather than data alone. One meaningful deepening occurs when the gondola begins moving along remembered flight paths, transforming her hypothesis into visceral experience.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The gondola functions as micro-setting that constrains choice: unmoored, it becomes both laboratory and memorial, enabling her to test her theory only because the cable broke. The brass telescope, cooling metal, and broken cable ring are handled tactilely and repeatedly. Sensory detail is purposeful—dusty starlight, greasy stratocumulus, sodium halo—filtered through Mara's professional and emotional priorities. The setting charges the final image: without the severed tether and drifting platform, her discovery of atmospheric memory cannot occur.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early: Mara wants to prove empty spaces remember, testing whether air holds "the ghost of motion." The pressure deepens when the gondola begins moving along invisible tracks of past flights, providing tangible evidence. Her agency is attention and interpretation that forecloses the path of conventional grief—she chooses memorialization through data and acceptance over rescue. The cost is visible: she remains adrift, isolated, documenting rather than returning, with the knowledge that "someone would eventually see the wandering gondola" but she will not call for it.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The core question—whether absence and loss leave measurable traces—emerges through Mara's scientific inquiry into grief without stating it baldly. "Spooled wholeness" recurs and shifts: first a theory, then a felt experience as the gondola moves through remembered flight paths, finally a consolation in the closing line. The cloud-emotion taxonomy and the image of bedrooms as small gondolas invite reflection without moralizing. The final sentence offers a resonant answer: memory persists in structure, not just mind, reweighting the entire frame without a thesis statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV with stable, close-third distance. Mara's perceptual signature is consistent: she notices meteorological detail (stratocumulus, cirrus, tropospheric shear) and recasts emotional states as atmospheric phenomena. The prose rhythm modulates beautifully under pressure—longer, flowing sentences for reflection, tighter syntax when the gondola shifts. Diction remains within her lexicon: technical terms are exact, metaphors rooted in her specialty. No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks in high-pressure beats, and the compression in the final lines ("You remember, she told the air") serves voice and closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Line-level craft is strong: sentence openings vary, rhythm breathes with scene needs, information density is high. Figurative language is vivid and coherent—"dusty starlight, thin and granular, as if the universe needed sweeping" works without mixing vehicles. Minor deduction for one paraphrase loop: the "spooled wholeness" concept is restated in adjacent paragraphs with slight synonym churn ("record of having been" / "coil in space"). The final image is clean and propulsive. No filter-verb stacks, no template cadence, and the telescope's "oil of past hands" adds texture without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of atmospheric memory with grief is fresh and fully committed: the meteorologist's tools and knowledge become the lens for memorialization, not mere ornament. The emotional cloud taxonomy and the gondola as laboratory-memorial feel inevitable in hindsight. Risk is present in the accumulative, lyric design and the quiet ending, which trusts image over event. Minor dock: the "bedrooms as small gondolas" metaphor, while apt, edges toward a tidy universalizing that slightly softens the story's specificity. The premise transforms familiar grief material through verifiable scientific detail and embodied wonder.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's role as aviation meteorologist shapes every choice: her volunteering to stay, her taxonomy experiment, her interpretation of the gondola's movement as atmospheric memory. Her professional lens enables the closure realization. Present early, drives two key beats (the decision to stay, the discovery of residual momentum), and is causally active at the ending when she documents the evidence and accepts the drift.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The brass telescope appears in three beats: raised to observe stars and clouds, used to track the tower of "angry" cloud, and present when she sets the logbook down. It is handled tactilely ("cold, slick with the oil of past hands") and tied to her role as observer. However, it does not constrain a choice or return with reweighted meaning at closure—it remains a professional tool without transformation.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>"Spooled wholeness" is introduced early as Mara's term for paths leaving coils in space. It reappears when she touches the cable ring, murmuring the phrase, and again when the gondola moves along remembered flight tracks. The concept shapes her tactics (staying to document, categorizing clouds, writing evidence) and charges the final line: "the sky remembers everything we once believed would fall and vanish." The cost is her isolation and the foreclosed path of conventional mourning. Indispensable to both stakes and closure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Quietly explosive" is used twice: first for "turbulence nobody logged, the quietly explosive shear layers," then for the tower of cloud she labels angry. The trait constrains her professional focus—she studies overlooked violence—and the second use ties her emotional state to atmospheric observation. It enables the realization that her grief and the sky's memory are both quiet detonations. Present early, shapes two beats, and contributes to thematic closure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Memorialization is stated early as Mara's intent: "both laboratory and memorial... she would memorialize the broken line not with plaques or speeches, but with data etched in pencil and breath." The action drives her choice to stay, her documentation of atmospheric memory, and the final acceptance that surrender is itself a form of memorial. The ending line completes the action by redefining what memorialization means. Essential to stakes and closure, though slightly less irreplaceable than the core concept.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Categorizing clouds by emotion is introduced early ("Once, she had classified them by altitude and moisture content; now she had begun categorizing clouds by emotion") and demonstrated in the middle beat where she labels clouds sullen, resigned, and angry. The method is tied to her grief and shapes her observational tactics. It appears implicitly at closure when she writes evidence and tells the air "you remember." Present in setup, development, and payoff; drives her coping mechanism and thematic stance.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The sky gondola is indispensable: severed from the tower, it becomes laboratory and memorial, enabling Mara's drift experiment. It constrains all her choices (she cannot leave), supplies the platform for observation, and physically enacts "spooled wholeness" when it moves along remembered flight paths. The setting charges the final image—her decision to let it carry her. Without this exact setting, the story's logic collapses. Present throughout, drives stakes, and shapes closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>"After the string breaks" is the story's organizing timeframe, stated in the opening as "Everything important, she thought, happens after the string breaks." It tightens all decisions: Mara can only test her theory because the cable severed, and the title phrase returns in the final line to close the loop. The timeframe shapes tactics (she uses the drift rather than fighting it) and defines the before/after that makes closure legible. Essential and irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mara's desire to prove empty spaces remember is stated early and drives every choice: volunteering to stay, documenting atmospheric memory, interpreting the gondola's movement. Friction appears when the radio dies and she must rely on her own perception, and when the evidence arrives she must choose between demanding rescue or accepting the drift. The final image shows her letting the space carry her, a choice that memorializes by surrender. Desire is dramatized with visible cost throughout.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Dusty starlight" appears in the opening ("the sky was a bowl of dusty starlight, thin and granular, as if the universe needed sweeping") and sets a tone of worn wonder that modulates through the piece: technical observation, quiet grief, tentative discovery, and finally acceptance. The tone remains coherent under pressure and charges the final image when she tells the air it remembers. The descriptor is specific, recurs implicitly in the setting's hush, and supports the story's blend of science and elegy.</comment>
