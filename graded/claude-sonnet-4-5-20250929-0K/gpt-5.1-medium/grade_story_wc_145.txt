<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's interiority is concrete and embodied—"the familiar, subtly confident twitch in my fingers"—with strong sensory grounding and micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. The editor's professional identity shapes perception (maps, contour lines, approval initials) and the final act of kneeling to sketch "the first honest revision I had made in years" earns the shift with visible cost. Internal conflict between official certainty and physical evidence operates simultaneously rather than in tidy stages. Minor slip: the falcon's "dry" stare reads slightly stock, and some emotional progression could degrade more under stress.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands on the page with visible cost: the protagonist abandons official orthodoxy to sketch an "honest revision," forecloses the path of bureaucratic compliance, and the falcon's final call explicitly "heralded both discovery and the quiet trouble it would bring." The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—condensation patterns, the sketch, the dog-ear fragment converge to reweight the dominant stake. One meaningful tightening occurs when the seam's trickle confirms the dog-ear's promise, narrowing options and forcing the revision choice. Orientation anchors cleanly in the opening paragraph (frozen lake, sagging dock, outpost, atlas editor).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The rusted outpost, frozen lake, and ice constrain movement and choice—the ice "accepted my weight with a complaining crackle, but held" creates genuine uncertainty. The condensation map on the fogging window directly shapes the protagonist's route to the bluff, elevating micro-setting to tactical necessity. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: "steaming faintly," "wide white corridor," "each step echoed up my legs into my chest." The seam and trickle at the bluff charge the final image by anchoring the conceptual breakthrough in physical specificity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—finding the true headwaters versus accepting official maps—is signaled early and coheres throughout. The tightening occurs when the condensation pattern and the sketch converge at the seam, narrowing options to acknowledge the truth or retreat. The protagonist's decision to sketch the revision is genuine agency with felt cost: it invites "quiet trouble" and abandons years of compliance. The falcon's tracking presence and the tranquility that "pressed around me" build situational pressure. One brief micro turn (the cylinder's second object) deepens without fragmenting.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the convergence motif: "Many small intentions, one inevitable channel; many languages, one phrase; many maps, one correction waiting to be drawn." The final image—kneeling to sketch with the red pencil—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the question of honest cartography versus institutional approval. The polyglot's dog-ear, the condensation, and the "singular convergence"murmur all integrate without thesis-statement force. Subtext operates in the protagonist's admission "I did not remember writing that" and the quiet trouble heralded by discovery. No moralizing; the cost is felt rather than explained.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and controlled: "The falcon… regarded me with a stare as dry as my wit" establishes dry professional idiom. Focalization remains stable; perceptual signature filters setting through the lens of an editor ("atlas proofs spread like fallen feathers," "approval initials"). Distance modulates purposefully—compressed reflection in "singular convergence, I murmured" stays anchored to the present trickle. No head-hopping. Rhythm tightens in the crossing ("Each step echoed… inside a drum") and opens at the discovery. Diction stays within the POV's plausible lexicon (contour line, hydrological model, survey office).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "Someone, perhaps even myself, was trying to herald a correction…" advances mystery, character doubt, and stakes). Rhythm varies naturally and accelerates across the ice. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Minor deduction for "worrying tranquility" appearing twice in close proximity and slight filter-verb stacking in the condensation-watching beat ("watched them gather, merge, and trail"). Opening line anchors voice and stakes cleanly; final line recharges the falcon and discovery motifs with cost.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The convergence of physical evidence (condensation, trickle, dog-ear) with professional epistemic crisis offers a fresh angle on cartographic authority. The falcon as courier, the polyglot's fragment, and the protagonist's own forgotten script create layered mystery without gimmickry. Transformation is specific—this editor, this lake, this seam—and the climactic moment of kneeling to sketch feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in the accumulative structure and the quiet ending heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Minor proximity concern: the condensation-as-map device echoes familiar motifs, but execution through embodied detail and occupational specificity transforms it.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The editor's dry wit shapes perception throughout and the decision to cross the ice and sketch the revision are key turns driven by professional competence meeting physical evidence. Setup clear in opening; middle choice to pack and leave the outpost; payoff in kneeling to sketch. Causal pressure evident; irreplaceability high (only a map editor would parse contour lines and approval initials this way). Cost visible in "quiet trouble."</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dog-ear appears twice: rattles in the cylinder mid-story and its promise is confirmed at the seam. It carries four languages saying one thing, reinforcing the convergence motif. Setup after ~15%; development when protagonist recognizes its promise at the trickle; payoff when it validates the revision. Causal role in the decision to trust the evidence. Swappability moderate—could be a note, but the polyglot detail and "stiff with old tea" add specificity.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"Singular convergence" shapes the protagonist's interpretation of the trickle's behavior ("small stubborn flows refusing to decide until the last possible moment"), narrows the conceptual stakes, and is murmured aloud at the climax. Setup via the sketch's three cramped handwriting styles and the polyglot's agreement; development in condensation merging; payoff when protagonist names it and connects it to "one correction waiting to be drawn." Drives the thematic and tactical resolution. Highly specific and irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Subtly confident appears as "the familiar, subtly confident twitch in my fingers" before redrawing coastlines—a trait that enables the final sketching action. Setup in that line; payoff when protagonist kneels with red pencil. Constraint: confidence allows the heretical revision; cost: invites trouble. Visible on-page action tied to the trait. Missing a second beat to reach higher; swappability moderate (another professional marker could serve).</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Herald" appears in the cylinder instruction ("After the falcon returns, follow to the beginning"), the protagonist's reflection on correction, and the falcon's final call that "heralded both discovery and the quiet trouble." Setup early; development when protagonist interprets the message; payoff in the closing line. The action redefines options by framing the revision as discovery with cost. Moderate swappability—"announce" or "signal" could substitute with minor tonal shift.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Condensation on the window is signaled, its mechanics detailed ("beads… gather, merge, and trail downward in branching lines"), and it directly guides the protagonist to the bluff. Setup when the window fogs; development when the pattern suggests a shortcut precedent and aligns into a fan; payoff when the seam is found "just where the condensation map had indicated." Drives the middle choice and validates the method. Specific and irreplaceable—prior use mentioned adds credibility.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The rusted outpost and frozen lake constrain movement (ice must hold weight), supply the fogging window and condensation, and frame the isolation that makes the protagonist's heretical choice possible. Setup in opening; development through the warming room and the crossing; payoff as the setting brackets the discovery. Environment shapes tactics (walking on ice) and the final image (kneeling at the seam). Indispensable—without the lake and outpost, plot and closure fail.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The falcon's return triggers the inciting moment and structures the sequence: cylinder delivery, interpretation, crossing, discovery. Setup in title phrase and opening; development when protagonist packs and leaves after the falcon returns; payoff when the falcon tracks and calls at the end. Time is implicit rather than clock-measured, but the progression tightens choices—waiting is over, action begins. Causal role clear; moderate irreplaceability (another trigger could serve, but the falcon's silence and final call charge the frame).</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The desire to find where rivers begin is stated ("I had come here for one reason only"), dramatized through the protagonist's professional conflict (official atlas vs. physical evidence), and drives the final sketching action. Setup early via maps and editing work; development through the condensation and trickle investigation; payoff when the seam confirms the beginning and the revision is drawn. Friction between professional compliance and honest discovery creates visible cost. Essential to the closure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Worrying tranquility is established in the falcon's silence, the outpost's staged calm, and the wind dying halfway across. Tone modulates from unease ("that silence worried me") through thickening quiet to the climactic discovery where the tranquility frames the trickle's stubborn life. Setup early; development in "the worrying tranquility thickened"; payoff when quiet trouble is heralded. Coherent through turns and charges the final image by contrasting stillness with the cost of breaking orthodoxy.</comment>
