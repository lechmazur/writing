<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Iri's character is established through action and interior stance—her refusal as choice, not absence—and her final defiance carries visible cost ("knowing the king would sense the shift and call it treason"). The descent and the weaving of echoes show agency under pressure. However, the interiority leans on elevated abstractions ("every unspoken desire bent around her like light around glass") that distance us from embodied contradiction, and the moment of choice feels more conceptual than viscerally motivated by prior dramatic struggle. The chastity-as-fierce-choice frame is asserted late rather than tested on the page through conflicting impulses.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with Situational pressure. The piece accumulates echoes through layered image and ritual action, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) when Iri exhales the hush upward, crystallizing the palace's new state of listening and foreclosing her safe passage. Cost is legible: treason sensed, rebellion begun. Orientation is established by ~100 words (palace, courtyard, Iri's role, snow, bells). The descent and sanctuary sequence coheres spatially. One meaningful deepening occurs when Iri shifts from harvest-as-ordered to weaving-as-uprising, narrowing her options and charging the final image. A minor causality softness: the king's order and Iri's counter-intent are declared rather than dramatized through prior friction, so the turn feels more thematic than causally pressured.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The silver courtyard, well, and prism sanctuary are vividly anchored with sensory particulars: blue lanterns "soft… seemed dangerous," light "folded so many times it had forgotten its color," threads as tactile constraint. Iri's descent and the sanctuary's weaving mechanics constrain her actions (gloves off, hands alongside threads) and charge the final image (hush sent upward, snowflakes reconsidering). Spatial choreography is clean. Micro-setting (threads, altar jars) alters tactics when Iri chooses to weave rather than jar. The recurring silver/snow motif modulates from muted opening to suspended stillness at closure, reweighting the courtyard's passivity into potential uprising.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: Iri summoned to harvest echoes for the king but "wanted the opposite." One meaningful tightening occurs when she weaves the threads into new constellations rather than jarring them, foreclosing compliance and triggering the upward hush. The choice narrows her path (treason) and alters the palace's state with felt cost. Agency is clear in her decision to exhale the hush. However, the escalation is more conceptual than tactically pressured—no on-page antagonist tests her resolve, no complication forces adaptation. The king remains off-page, and the guard's bow is unopposed. The resolution emerges from Iri's internal stance more than from dramatized conflict under rising pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—unspent feeling as political pressure, silence as uprising—emerges from concrete images (echoes as residue, threads knotting on skin, snowflakes reconsidering) rather than thesis statement. The prism sanctuary and weaving mechanic ground the abstraction. Iri's chastity reframes from absence to "fierce, untouched choice" through the final action, and the ending offers a non-literal answer: a "new kind of listening" rather than a declared victory. The piece resists tidy resolution. Slight weakness: some lines edge toward over-articulation ("to defy the lullaby of conformity," "uprising of pauses") that nudge the reader rather than trust image alone, and one courtier's moment ("allowed himself to feel tired") risks sentiment without prior cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>POV is stable third-close on Iri; no head-hopping. The prose carries a consistent lyric register with patterned compression ("between sigh and smile" recurs purposefully). Diction is elevated and poetic throughout, which suits the ritual frame but occasionally drifts into generic lyricism ("bodily poetic," "uprising of pauses") that abstracts rather than specifies. Psychic distance is controlled, though the piece leans more on declarative summary ("She had learned that a gaze averted…") than on immediate perception under pressure. The voice is distinctive but not character-particular—it reads as authorial style imposed rather than Iri's perceptual signature. Filter verbs ("felt," "knew") are present but not intrusive. The courtyard citizens' collective shift is handled cleanly without individual head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm is controlled with varied sentence length and purposeful paragraph breaks. Information density is high; most lines carry image, action, or thematic charge. However, a cluster of metaphor-dense passages in the sanctuary sequence risks overwriting: "each beat of her heart a muffled drum of defiance" followed by "drawing poems on her skin in invisible ink" and "her silence into an uprising of pauses" stack figurative language without breathing space, blurring clarity under peak pressure. Some lines loop conceptually: "echoes were what remained when a feeling died politely" is elegant but paraphrased two beats later as "bound to repeat only the moment of refusal." A few filter-verb stacks ("felt the palace," "let them mark her") dull immediacy. No grammar or continuity errors; spatial choreography tracks cleanly. The opening and closing images anchor well.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The core synthesis—courtesan as rebel archivist, echoes as political residue, chastity as refusal-power, prism sanctuary as literal memory theatre—is specific and non-obvious. The piece transforms the courtesan trope through the inversion of service into subversion and grounds the rebellion in sensory ritual rather than confrontation. The weaving mechanic and the hush-as-reversed-blessing offer fresh inflection. Risk-taking in the lyric-heavy voice and the quiet, crystallized ending heightens thematic stakes. Slight derivative echo: the palace-as-repressive-harmony and the awakening-through-art frame have wide precedent; the story earns its space through specificity of the sanctuary and the threads, but the courtiers' sudden awareness moment edges toward familiar beats of collective epiphany without fully individuated cost.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Iri is present from the opening, frames the descent, and her choice to weave rather than jar the echoes drives the climactic turn and charges the ending (treason sensed, new listening begun). Her decision forecloses compliance and alters the palace's state. Setup, development, and payoff gates are met. Causal pressure is strong, and cost is legible. The character's choices create the key turn.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The prism sanctuary is introduced at the quarter mark (well descent), used in two extended beats (the chamber weaving sequence and the exhaled hush), and its light-threads constrain Iri's physical actions (gloves off, hands alongside) and enable her defiance. The sanctuary's properties—light born by pressure and memory—are essential to the harvest/weaving mechanic and charge the final image. Setup, development, and payoff gates met; causal pressure and closure linkage strong.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The harvest of echoes is signaled early (king's order, Iri's counter-intent), shapes the sanctuary action (threads as echoes, weaving vs. jarring), and drives the climax when Iri gathers them into a hush and reverses their intended use. The concept constrains her tactics (must engage the threads) and enables the ending (hush upward, palace shift). Three gates met; the concept is indispensable to the story's logic and stakes. Removing it would collapse the narrative.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Bodily poetic" appears once as descriptor ("her steps bodily poetic, every shift of weight a line of verse") and is thematically echoed when echoes "turn her posture into punctuation," but it does not constrain a choice or create visible cost. The attribute is more stylistic label than dramatized trait. Setup and weak development present; no clear payoff gate. Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Unlock" is signaled via "images startled awake" and "she began the harvest of echoes" and drives the weaving action in the sanctuary. The unlocking mechanic (hands alongside threads, not touching) enables her counter-move. Two beats and closure linkage present. The action is essential to the middle turn and the final hush. Removing it would require substantial rewrite, though the exact verb "unlock" could be substituted with similar mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Untangling threads" is taught early ("moving her hands alongside them, like wind teaching chimes"), used in the weaving beat ("wove them together into new constellations," "threads knotting around her wrists"), and implicitly present in the exhaled hush that results. The method shapes her attempts and differentiates her defiance from the king's intended harvest. Setup, development, and payoff gates met; causal pressure moderate. The specificity of the method matters.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The silver courtyard is established in the opening, frames the descent, and returns at closure when the hush reaches it and snowflakes suspend. The courtyard supplies spatial pressure (palace above, well below) and the final image of collective reconsideration. Setup and payoff gates met; weak middle development (courtyard is mostly absent during sanctuary action). The setting charges the ending but does not constrain mid-story tactics. Lyric reprise with moderate integration.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Between sigh and smile" appears in the opening and closing as frame, but the timeframe does not tighten decisions or create urgency. Midnight bells stutter once; no clock pressure afterward. The phrase functions more as tonal motif than temporal constraint. Setup and weak payoff present (lyric reprise); no middle development. Time is vague and untracked. Functional label, replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The motivation to defy conformity is signaled early ("to defy the lullaby of conformity that hummed through palace halls"), dramatized in her counter-choice (weave, not jar), and tested at closure when treason becomes legible cost. The desire conflicts with safety and drives the peak choice. Setup, development, and payoff gates met; friction between want (rebellion) and cost (treason) is visible. Essential to character arc and stakes.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Alarming serenity is established through "blue so soft it seemed dangerous," "alarming serenity to their motion," and sustained in the final stillness ("gentle, almost tender, yet it rang in their bones like an alarm"). Tone modulates with pressure: muted opening, trembling sanctuary, suspended closure. The tone charges the final image and coheres through turns. Setup, development, and payoff gates met; the oxymoron shapes perception and supports theme. Strong integration.</comment>
