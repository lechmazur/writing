<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marla's involuntary truthfulness generates strong embodied tension ("the words itched her tongue") and her choice at closure—asserting the city is "worth waking" with a conditional—feels earned by prior internal conflict between duty and wonder. The boy functions cleanly as catalyst without demanding deep interiority. Minor deduction: Marla's reflective voice occasionally drifts into elevated register ("calcifying," "medicinal") that slightly exceeds a toll keeper's plausible lexicon under stress, and the granddad remains off-stage exposition.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Marla's conditional assertion reweights the blackout stakes and the tower responds, crystallizing options with felt cost (her throat tightens, she "envied liars their delay"). The causal lens holds—boy's arrival, riddle, Marla's compelled answer, granddad's wired condition, her final truth—with one meaningful tightening when the riddle answer narrows her duty/wonder conflict. Orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words (Marla, booth, bridge, blackout). Small deduction: the granddad's engineered lesson and wired city mechanism arrive somewhat late and rely on the boy's exposition rather than prior setup.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The lightning collection tower constrains choice (granddad is "up in the tower," the city wakes only if Marla speaks) and charges the final image (tower flares white, drones rise). The glass booth, bridge railings, and matchbox are handled concretely. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered ("nectar dusk," "fluorescent buzz," "rasp loud as a spark"). Minor deduction: the drone beehives and their "failure" remain atmospheric rather than spatially grounded; we never see a hive or understand its physical form beyond metaphor.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve wonder versus fulfill duty—is signaled early and tightens when the riddle forces Marla to choose between reporting the sabotage and honoring the lesson. The boy's revelation that the city wakes only if "somebody like you" speaks narrows options with visible cost (her throat tightens, she "envied liars their delay"). Agency is clear: Marla's conditional assertion forecloses simple duty and crystallizes a new stance. Small deduction: the granddad's engineered condition feels slightly convenient—his off-stage setup resolves the conflict Marla did not help create—though the boy's framing mitigates this.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—astonishment versus routine, wonder versus calcification—emerges from concrete images (bees, lightning, "nectar dusk") and Marla's compelled honesty rather than thesis statements. The final line offers a resonant, non-literal answer: the city is "worth waking" only "if it remembers to be astonished by its own thunder," reweighting the blackout as lesson without moralizing. The lacquer box and matchbox accrue meaning (preserving small secrets, wonder in routine) without symbolic convenience. No thematic echo or platitude flattens the closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Marla; her perceptual signature (toll keeper who notices coins, secrets, routine) is consistent. Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven; the boy's lines pursue confirmation without exposition dumps. Minor deductions: elevated diction in narration ("calcifying," "medicinal," "astonishment") occasionally exceeds Marla's plausible lexicon, and a few filter verbs ("she felt," "she saw") dull immediacy in high-pressure beats. The boy's voice is distinct but brief; Marla's internal rhythm remains coherent under stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high (most lines advance character, atmosphere, or stakes). Minor deductions: several paraphrase loops ("the city," "the tower," "the boy" as repeated sentence subjects across adjacent lines) and template cadence in the opening third ("she told herself," "she could not," "she saw") create mild scaffold feel. One mixed metaphor: "nectar dusk" as a taste is vivid but "thick and slow over the abandoned toll bridge" shifts vehicle mid-image. No loops touch the closure beat; the final image is clean and propulsive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The synthesis—involuntary truth-teller, lightning-harvesting city, drone beehives, engineered blackout as lesson—feels specific and non-obvious. The toll keeper frame transforms the "truth curse" trope through occupational detail (coins, lost-and-found, glass booth). The final conditional ("worth waking... if it remembers to be astonished") offers a fresh inflection on the wonder-versus-routine premise. Small deduction: the granddad's off-stage sabotage and wired condition lean slightly toward template "wise elder teaches hubris lesson" without full transformation, and the drone beehives remain metaphorically rich but underspecified as world logic.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marla's candid/truthful nature drives the riddle answer (she "could not help herself"), the boy's selection of her, and the final conditional assertion that reweights the blackout. Present in setup (booth, curse), middle (compelled riddle answer), and closure (conditional truth). Her choices—staying at the post, reading aloud, asserting the city's worth—create key turns and foreclose paths (she "envied liars their delay").</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The lacquer box appears in setup (lap, "to preserve wonder in routine") and closure (she "slipped the emptied matchbox and its riddle into the lacquer box"). It accrues meaning (collecting small secrets, wonder in routine) but does not constrain a middle choice or alter tactics. The reprise reweights prior material with cost (toll she will "keep collecting") but the box is not handled between beats; it bookends rather than drives.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Drone beehive failure is the inciting event (blackout, bridge closed), shapes the riddle's answer ("hums like a hive... forgets that fire was once a story"), and participates in closure (dormant drones rise "like cautious fireflies" after Marla's assertion). The concept changes options: Marla must choose between reporting sabotage and honoring the lesson. Specific mechanics (granddad "broke the hive") and visible consequence (city dark, then waking) make it irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>"Involuntarily truthful" is signaled early ("cursed with honesty," "even her excuses arrived naked"), constrains the riddle beat (she reads aloud "because she could not help herself"), and drives closure (the boy sought "somebody like you" who "cannot hide the answer when it hurts"; Marla's throat tightens, she "envied liars their delay"). The trait enables the final conditional truth with visible cost and is irreplaceable to story logic.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Reveal (Marla reads the riddle aloud and speaks its answer) is the major turn that exposes the sabotage, teaches the boy his granddad's intent, and sets up the conditional choice. It could not be swapped; Marla's compelled honesty makes the reveal inevitable and charges it with cost. Present in middle and shaping closure (her final truth wakes the city). The answer itself ("the city... machines that hum like bees") redefines the blackout as lesson.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The matchbox containing the riddle is signaled early (boy carries it "as if afraid it might burn"), its mechanics matter (Marla slides it open, unfolds the receipt paper, reads aloud), and it drives the middle turn (compelled answer). It appears in closure (emptied matchbox slipped into the lacquer box). The riddle's answer changes Marla's understanding and tactics; the matchbox is the instrument of the test. Specific and irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The lightning collection tower is present in setup ("still flickered, drinking storm charge"), middle (riddle answer: "drinks the sky like rain"), and closure (granddad "is up in the tower," tower "flared white, then settled into a steady glow"). It shapes stakes (city wakes only if Marla speaks; granddad's location) and the final image (tower's glow signals the drones' return). The tower is both physical constraint and thematic anchor (wonder versus routine); irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"After the city-wide blackout" anchors the timeframe in the opening line and drives the entire situation (bridge closed, city dark, drone beehives silent). The blackout is the inciting event and the riddle's subject. It tightens decisions: Marla cannot leave her post, the boy arrives from the dark city, and her final assertion reweights the blackout as lesson. The timeframe is legible and shapes tactics, though no live ticking clock intensifies pressure beat-by-beat.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"To preserve wonder in routine" is signaled early (she kept the box "to preserve wonder... to keep boredom from calcifying") and dramatized in conflict: Marla's duty (report sabotage) versus honoring the lesson (preserve astonishment). The motivation shapes her final conditional choice ("worth waking... if it remembers to be astonished") with visible cost (throat tightens, she envies liars). It is not merely told; the lacquer box and her staying at the post embody it. Friction between duty and wonder drives closure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Nectar dusk" opens the piece ("tasted like nectar dusk, thick and slow") and coheres through metaphor (honey/bees/hive throughout). Tone modulates with pressure: reflective in the booth, tense at the riddle, resonant at closure ("careful sweetness of poured nectar dusk"). The tone charges the final image (drones as fireflies, sirens and laughter drifting back) and supports the wonder-versus-routine theme. Consistent and purposeful, though the nectar metaphor is not mechanically irreplaceable to plot.</comment>
