<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Eli's interior contradiction—seeking "to interpret silence as possibility instead of emptiness" while having "kept his own heart stopped"—is embodied in concrete micro-choices: he sings despite fear, setting the carousel in motion. The emotional arc from silence-as-wall to silence-as-door is earned through the halo's responsive pulses and the room's answering transformation. Interiority remains specific ("a quiet click as an old fear slipped out of place"), avoiding therapy-speak labels. The final choice to "set to work" forecloses passivity with visible cost: he commits to building rather than salvaging.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (Eli, abandoned circus train, present exploration) land cleanly within the opening lines. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through density (dust → gleam → song → restoration) and cadence shifts that reweight silence from emptiness to generative possibility. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final image crystallizes the new stance—working "in the new understanding that every revolution begins in the smallest circle of silence"—with felt cost (abandoning salvage-only mode for commitment to creation). Causality is clean: discovery → touch → song → motion → understanding → action.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The workshop setting pressures Eli's choice by offering the halo fragment and horses as tangible objects that respond to his song, constraining the stakes around repair versus creation. Sensory detail is purposeful: "misting hush," "whispering gleam," and wind bells anchor atmosphere while reflecting POV priorities (carpenter's eye for wood grain, joints, splinters knitting smooth). Spatial choreography remains coherent throughout; the platform, beam, cage, and horses track clearly. The micro-setting (carousel platform, halo cage) charges the final image: tools and waiting horses embody the shift from salvage to building.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—learning to interpret silence as possibility—is signaled early and tightens through Eli's song, which forces a trade-off: vulnerability (singing aloud) for restoration (the carousel responds). The pressure escalates under the Accumulative lens via density increase: each pause answered by a brighter pulse, horses trembling, platform turning. The resolution is earned by Eli's agency (he begins to sing "before fear could return") with visible cost: he abandons silent carpentry for voiced creation, foreclosing the option to remain emotionally guarded. No reliance on coincidence; the halo's response is framed as sympathetic answer, not deus ex machina.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: silence shifts from absence to generative space via the halo's breathing light and the carousel's answering motion. The final image—"every revolution begins in the smallest circle of silence"—reweights prior material without stating a moral, offering a resonant answer to the central question. Subtext operates in gesture (fingertips brushing the cage, the "quiet click" of fear slipping) and the song made of "long pauses and small, careful notes." Memories (father planing cedar, children on saddles) integrate organically, tilting present stance toward building rather than salvaging. No thematic echo or prompt-like articulation mars the ending.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited; Eli's perceptual signature (carpenter's attention to joints, splinters, grain) is consistent and specific. Voice modulates purposefully: descriptive lyricism in discovery beats ("the air shivered with a whispering gleam") tightens to action syntax during the song ("He kept singing, the song changing as he went"). Filter verbs appear but are voice-motivated ("he thought," "he understood, dimly") and do not dull immediacy. Some diction skirts elevated register ("a kind of listening," "an old fear slipped out of place") but remains within the established lyric-realist blend. No head-hopping or POV leakage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally, with sentence openings and paragraph lengths creating visual and aural variety. Information density is high in peak beats: the song sequence advances character, atmosphere, and plot simultaneously. However, figurative language saturates multiple consecutive sentences without clear pattern-teaching ("misting hush," "whispering gleam," "listening hush," "breathing" light), approaching overwriting in the discovery and song beats; this triggers a −0.5 deduction for density without obscuring closure. Minor paraphrase loop: "quietly persistent steps" echoed by "quietly persistent in the new understanding" reduces propulsion slightly (−0.2). No grammar, tense, or pronoun errors; clarity remains high throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The premise—carousel carpenter finds mystical fragment on abandoned circus train—blends familiar tropes (artist's block, healing journey, magical object) but transforms them through specific, verifiable detail: carousel construction vocabulary (poles that rise and fall, platform turning without gears), the halo fragment as sympathetic listener rather than wish-granter. The turn (singing to animate the carousel) arises from established character logic (Eli's silence versus possibility conflict) and feels earned in hindsight. Emotional truth (the fear of speaking after silence) anchors the fantastical elements. Risk is moderate: the lyric-realist blend and quiet ending heighten stakes without obscuring clarity, justifying a +0.3 within-band adjustment.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Eli's carpenter identity appears in beat one (sawdust in cuffs, salvage mission), shapes the middle choice (recognizing the workshop and responding to the horses as repairable objects), and drives closure (picking up tools to work on the waiting horses). His profession constrains his lens (noticing joints, splinters knitting, poles that rise and fall) and his final action (setting to work rather than continuing to salvage) embodies the thematic shift. "Silent carousel carpenter" is not merely a label; it frames his conflict (silence as emptiness) and the resolution (silence as generative space). Two strong beats plus closure participation and clear causal pressure justify high integration.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The halo fragment appears in beat two (Eli reaches for it), shapes the middle climax (its light answers each pause of his song, charging the carousel's restoration), and anchors closure (it dims to "a soft, watchful glow" as Eli begins work). Its evolving state (breathing pulses → brighter responses → dimmed watchfulness) tracks causally and charges the final image. The fragment's specific property—responding to silence with light—is irreplaceable; no generic magic object could substitute. Three gates, two distinct beats, closure linkage, and specificity/cost connection warrant this score.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Misting hush" is signaled in the opening line ("the air felt like a held breath") and recurs with variations ("whispering gleam," "listening hush") through discovery and song beats, tightening into "the silence felt less like a wall and more like a door" at the turning point. It shapes stakes (Eli's desire to interpret silence as possibility) and charges the final image ("every revolution begins in the smallest circle of silence"). However, its mechanics remain atmospheric rather than tactical; it does not narrow options or enable a specific action. Early signal, lyric reprise, and thematic resonance support mid-band; lack of tactical constraint limits higher scoring.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Quietly persistent" appears explicitly twice: Eli's "quietly persistent steps" in beat one and "quietly persistent in the new understanding" at closure. The trait is embodied in action (he advances despite the creaking passage, continues singing despite initial fear) and constrains choice (persistence enables him to push past "before fear could return"). However, the cost is more implicit than visible; we see endurance but not a clear tradeoff where persistence forecloses another option. Early signal, one middle action, closure participation, and modest cost support this score.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Singing is the major turn: Eli's song triggers the halo's sympathetic response, animates the horses, sets the platform in motion, and embodies his shift from silence to voiced creation. The action is irreplaceable; no other choice (touching, repairing, speaking prose) would generate the same mechanics or thematic resonance. It appears in beat three (the climax), drives restoration across multiple lines, and defines the closure stance (understanding that silence holds songs "waiting, gently, to be asked"). Three beats, causal pressure, closure linkage, specificity, and cost connection justify near-indispensability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"A wrong turn leads to a hidden oasis" is signaled in beat one ("he meant to reach the cargo car at the end, but...noticed a half-open door to his left") and shapes the entire story: without the unplanned detour, no workshop, no halo, no transformation. The phrase from Eli's grandmother's stories anchors the method as deliberate pattern rather than coincidence. However, the method does not recur or constrain later attempts; it functions as structural setup rather than tactical means. Setup and causal necessity for all subsequent beats support this score; lack of middle or closure reuse limits higher scoring.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The abandoned circus train frames the opening and provides spatial coherence (narrow passage, half-open door, veiled carriage). The workshop carriage itself—with platform, beam, cage, and horses—constrains Eli's choices by offering the halo and responsive objects. However, the train as a whole is somewhat swappable; an abandoned theater or warehouse could serve similar functions with minor edits. The micro-setting (carousel platform, cage overhead) does constrain the song choice and charges the final image. Setup, one middle constraint (tool/object access), and modest closure participation support mid-band scoring.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Inside the chime of wind bells" appears in beat one ("it seemed to Eli that time folded inward, as if he were standing inside the chime of wind bells itself") and recurs at closure ("The wind bells outside still chimed, but they no longer sounded like a clock running down; instead, they marked a doorway of hours yet to be carved"). The phrase reweights meaning (clock → doorway) and charges the final image. However, timeframe does not tighten decisions or alter tactics; no clock pressure shapes the song or work choices. Early signal, lyric reprise, and thematic resonance support low-mid band; lack of tactical constraint limits higher scoring.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Eli's desire "to interpret silence as possibility instead of emptiness" is dramatized in beat one (arriving to salvage but wanting more), tested in beat three (he must sing despite fear), and resolved at closure (he understands silence as generative space and commits to building). The motivation is conflicted: he "did not believe in miracles, but he believed in things that could be repaired," and his years of "keeping his own heart stopped" create internal friction. The cost is felt: choosing voiced creation over silent salvage forecloses his guarded stance. Setup, middle test, closure participation, and visible cost support this score.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Whispering gleam" appears in beat two ("the air shivered with a whispering gleam") and modulates through the song sequence (halo's "brighter pulse," "whispering gleam that lingered in the wood" at closure). Tone remains coherent—hushed, reverent, faintly mystical—and charges the final image by anchoring Eli's new understanding in the lingering light. However, tone does not modulate sharply with pressure; the lyric-realist register holds steady rather than tightening during the climax. Early signal, atmospheric consistency, and closure linkage support mid-band; modest modulation limits higher scoring.</comment>
