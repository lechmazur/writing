<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The protagonist's interiority is richly embodied through sustained listening and spatial mapping, with clear motive (rehabilitate father's legacy via story-craft). The father's teaching provides concrete backstory that tilts present choices. However, the climactic turn—realizing men "vanish into sentences"—arrives as assertion rather than dramatized discovery with visible cost, and the final cloak image registers more as metaphor than a choice that forecloses a path. Internal contradiction (guilt vs. ambition) remains implicit rather than acting simultaneously in a peak beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (dusk arrival, lighthouse prison, reef) land within the first two paragraphs. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: pressure accrues through nightly listening, corridor discovery, and the revelation of a "library of unfinished paths." Closure arrives as Conceptual Repricing—the final image of belief as cloak reconfigures the tower's function and the protagonist's agency—with conceptual cost legible in the phrase "vanish into sentences." One meaningful deepening (external prison becomes throat of untold stories) satisfies length expectations, though the cost of that realization (what the protagonist sacrifices or risks to achieve it) remains oblique rather than felt on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The lighthouse interior is vividly anchored: rust, wet stone, cells as "stacked mouths," lattice from confessional. Sensory detail (groans, copper-light repose, flakes of rust) is selective and filters through the protagonist's listening posture. The confessional lattice and the narrow iron door constrain exploration and charge the final discovery, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography (reef, tower spiral, corridor, iron door, library beyond) remains legible across all moves.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (clear father's name or "muddy mine into something of my own making") is signaled early and coheres under the Accumulative lens. Pressure tightens through nightly listening, sound-mapping, and the discovery of the story-library, narrowing the path from passive imprisonment to active story-weaving. The protagonist's agency (listening, kneeling, peering) drives each beat. The phrase "before they find the bodies" introduces a live time constraint and raises external cost, though the mechanics of how bodies connect to the library remain unexplained, limiting full escalation legibility.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme—stories as prison and liberation, the cost of unbelief—emerges organically from the tower's dual nature and the father's pedagogy. The final image ("that belief is a cloak wrapped about my shoulders") offers a resonant, non-literal answer: the protagonist's survival depends on sustaining the island's misreading, reweighting truth and deception without moralizing. Subtext operates in the "shiver...as if a mouth I cannot see is trying not to laugh" and the library as "throat clogged with tales." No thematic echo or diagnostic label-speak mars the ending.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Single POV with stable, lyric distance; diction ("copperlight repose," "knives of stone," "mouths...tooth in the cylindrical jaw") creates a distinct perceptual signature. Reflection anchors in concrete stimuli (sea groans, lattice bars, sound-mapping) and tilts present choices (listening, kneeling, peering). Psychic distance modulates purposefully: compressed sensory focus during listening, expansive when recounting father's teaching. The father's voice ("every prison is a story told so often") reads as recalled idiom, not unmotivated register drift. Under peak pressure (peering through the door, seeing pages drift), syntax tightens without losing internal texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines advance atmosphere, backstory, or discovery. Figurative language ("exhausted bruise," "black teeth of stone," "stacked mouths") is vivid and coherent, though density approaches saturation in the opening third without pattern-teaching. Two instances of synonym churn: "whisper ways it can be changed" / "story...sustains impossibilities" / "new story can be born" cycle similar concepts across adjacent paragraphs. Minor scaffold: "I mean to grow one strong enough to open stone" states intent already shown. No loops or filter-verb stacks in peak beats; rhythm varies across sentence lengths.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The frame—lighthouse prison as library of unfinished stories—offers a fresh synthesis of incarceration, narrative theory, and magical realism. The protagonist's motive (threading a labyrinth with story rather than escaping physically) transforms the prison-break template through the father's pedagogy and the specific lattice/door/library architecture. The phrase "vanish into sentences" and the bodies-on-reef mystery add conceptual risk, though the ending withholds mechanics, preserving ambiguity over full payoff. Tone and metaphor cohere without gimmickry.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The "cry wolf boy who cried wolf's son" is named early, frames motive (rehabilitate father's legacy), and drives nightly listening and corridor discovery. Agency is sustained across multiple beats (sound-mapping, kneeling, peering). However, the climactic turn (realizing men vanish into sentences) is not shown as a choice with visible cost; the protagonist observes rather than decides. Two beats (listening, discovery) plus closure linkage (the cloak image depends on his inherited role) reach mid-band, but lack of a decisive on-page action caps the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The lattice from confessional appears in paragraph three ("lattice from confessional bolted to the salt-shot stone") and structures observation ("Through its crossing bars I could see"). It returns implicitly when the protagonist maps the tower by sound. The lattice constrains perception and primes the discovery of the door, satisfying two-beat involvement. However, it does not return with reweighted meaning at closure; the final image shifts to "belief...a cloak," leaving the lattice functionally mid-story. Setup, development, and implicit payoff yield mid-band; lack of charged reprise prevents higher.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Chasing hush across empty fields where no wolves waited" is invoked as backstory and thematic echo ("fraud's inheritance"). The concept subtly informs the protagonist's listening posture (seeking sound rather than wolves) and the library of unfinished tales. However, "chasing hush" does not constrain an on-page choice or alter tactics; it remains metaphorical frame rather than causal lever. Present by implication in the ending (the cloak of belief), but swappable with "inherited lie" or similar. Functional but ornamental integration.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Sustains impossibilities in its cracks" appears mid-story as the father's teaching and explains the library's existence. The attribute enables the protagonist's discovery (the tower as story-throat) but does not constrain an on-page action with visible cost; it is told rather than demonstrated through tradeoff. The phrase recurs implicitly at closure (the cloak of belief sustains the protagonist's freedom), satisfying lyric reprise. One beat (discovery) plus thematic payoff, but no dramatized cost, yields low-mid band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Hover" is used once to describe lights in the library ("thin lights stacked in spirals that hover where floors ought to be"). The image is vivid and marks the climactic discovery, but "hover" itself is descriptive rather than actional; the lights could "float" or "drift" with identical effect. The action does not drive a turn or redefine options; it ornaments the revelation. Single-beat appearance without causal pressure or closure linkage; swappable synonym.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Through the scuffs on a narrow door left ajar for decades" is signaled mid-story and structures the protagonist's method of discovery: kneeling, peering through scuffs, seeing the library. The door's generations of scuff-marks add specificity and imply prior failed attempts. The method shapes the climactic beat (peering, seeing pages drift) and primes the final realization. Setup, development (kneeling beats), and payoff (library vision) across three beats, with specificity that matters. Causal pressure is moderate; the door enables rather than constrains.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The lighthouse prison is anchored in paragraph one (reef, tower, cells, spiral) and pressures throughout: isolation forces listening, the spiral guides sound-mapping, the confessional lattice constrains sight, the iron door hides the library. The reef returns in the final line ("bodies out on the reef") as external clock. The setting shapes tactics (listening rather than escaping) and supplies the key resource (the library). Setup, continuous development, and closure linkage with micro-setting (lattice, door) that alters moves. Essential across beats.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Before they find the bodies out on the reef, before they realize that the missing men did not drown so much as vanish into sentences" appears in the penultimate paragraph as an external clock. The timeframe adds urgency and conceptual cost (the protagonist's freedom depends on sustaining misreading), charging the final image. However, it is invoked once without prior setup or mid-story use to tighten choices. Late arrival (final third) and single-beat presence cap the score; the charge it adds to closure lifts it above ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"To thread a labyrinth with your own story" is stated mid-story as motive, echoing the father's teaching. The desire drives nightly listening, sound-mapping, and the search for the corridor. The protagonist's actions (listening, kneeling, peering) dramatize the motive across multiple beats. Friction between want (clear father's name) and method (story-weaving rather than escape) creates tension. Setup, development (listening beats), and closure linkage (the cloak of belief realizes the motive) across three beats. Cost is conceptual (sustaining misreading) rather than visceral, limiting high-band entry.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Copperlight repose" appears in paragraph three, establishing a lyric, meditative tone. The tone modulates under pressure: compressed urgency during listening and peering, expansive reflection during father's teaching, returning to quiet resolve in the final cloak image. The phrase does not recur verbatim but its register (contemplative, figurative) coheres across turns. Tone charges the final image by sustaining the balance between dread and poise. Setup, coherence under pressure, and payoff (the cloak as repose) satisfy three gates. Specificity (copperlight) matters but is not indispensable.</comment>
