<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Milo's sensory specificity (identifying people by walks) is well-embodied and drives action. His internal contradiction between calculated preparation and performed spontaneity creates texture, though the final choice feels more engineered than urgent—he laid groundwork weeks ago, reducing present-tense stakes. Interiority remains concrete throughout ("thoughts stacked themselves with surgical precision"), and the embodied coin-palming and key-pressing anchor his physicality under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: Milo's prior oil work and map study enable the whisper solution, and the inspectors' adjustment creates a legible before/after. Closure lands on the page with Ramos's "slower, thoughtful walk" signaling a stance shift—Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the lesson is received without stated moral. Orientation anchors arrive cleanly (port maze, geomagnetic storm night, Milo at work). One meaningful tightening (ten-minute countdown, lost inspectors) narrows options and the whisper tactic pays off the constraint.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The container maze's steel corridors, ventilation shafts, and tactile details (dented blue wall, diesel smell) constrain Milo's whisper route and guide the inspectors' movement—environment shapes choice. Aurora, frozen cranes, and magnetic hiss establish storm pressure. Spatial choreography remains clear across corridors. The key pressed to metal and oiled vents function as micro-setting tools that charge the final proof.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prove whispers work or the port shuts down) is signaled and tested within the ten-minute frame. One meaningful tightening: Ramos's ultimatum forces Milo to execute his prepared tactic under time pressure. Agency is present but muted—Milo already laid the groundwork weeks ago, so the present choice feels more like execution than improvisation. The inspectors' emergence delivers visible success with reputational cost to Ramos, though the prior preparation lowers present-tense urgency slightly.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme (whispers versus shouts, listening versus force) emerges through concrete action: oiled vents, the key's hum, directed breath threading steel. The final image—Ramos's slower walk—offers a non-literal answer without moralizing. Milo's calculated spontaneity and the storm's "approving" flicker charge the ending with earned resonance. The zodiac coin and maps seed symbolic texture without becoming heavy-handed.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct and consistent: Milo reads walks, not faces; metal creaks replace social cues. Diction ("stacked themselves with surgical precision," "ribbon of intention") fits his analytical, maze-attuned mind. Dialogue is sparse, goal-driven, and character-specific—Ramos's impatient shouts contrast Milo's calm whispers. Distance remains stable; no head-hopping. Filter verbs are minimal and voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings and lengths modulate with pressure. Information density is high—most lines advance both setting and character. Minor template cadence appears in the middle third ("He stepped," "He moved," "He whispered") but does not obscure causality. One brief paraphrase loop ("the maze itself was the lock" echoes in mechanics) costs −0.2. Figurative language ("ribbon of intention," "metal thicket") is controlled and apt. No clarity breaks at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The whisper-through-ducts tactic and the key-as-tuning-fork offer a fresh synthesis of maze navigation and storm conditions. The walk-identification trait personalizes Milo beyond stock "maintenance genius." The calculated-spontaneity frame (weeks of prep disguised as improvisation) adds non-obvious texture. Risk is present but moderate—the core rescue structure remains familiar, elevated by specific sensory detail and Milo's perceptual filter.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Milo is present throughout, makes the key choice (to whisper via ducts), and his prior oiling work enables the tactic. His decision alters tactics under time pressure and delivers the closure proof to Ramos.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The zodiac coin appears twice (palmed during storm, flipped at ending) but does not constrain choice or alter tactics. Its "tingling" under the storm is ornamental; Milo's success depends on the key and oiled vents, not the coin. Present but swappable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Folded maps are handled on break, guide Milo's route selection, and the "impossible" folds hint at the maze's dynamic logic. One corridor "should not exist" and the metal vibrates in reply—causal pressure in one beat. Maps shape his mental model but do not reappear at closure, limiting higher scores.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Walk identification enables Milo to locate the inspectors (brisk/hesitant steps), distinguish Ramos's arrival, and read the final "slower, thoughtful walk" that signals the lesson received. Used in three distinct beats with direct causal and closure impact. Essential to both problem and resolution.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The challenge (prove whispers work in ten minutes) frames the dominant stake, triggers the whisper tactic, and structures the countdown. Milo's acceptance drives the middle escalation and the inspectors' safe return resolves it. Present early, shapes two beats, and informs closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The key with no lock is introduced early (worn around neck), used twice (pressed to shafts to tune the whisper currents), and its mechanics matter—it channels Milo's breath into directed sound. Shapes the method across two beats. Does not reappear at closure, capping the score.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The container maze provides the problem (inspectors lost), the constraint (steel corridors that tangle shouts), and the resource (ventilation shafts that carry whispers). Dented walls and diesel smells guide movement. Present throughout, pressures all choices, and charges the final proof when the "metal thicket" releases the three.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The geomagnetic storm disables radios and GPS, forcing the whisper solution, and the aurora visually marks the night. Storm pressure is present in setup and middle (magnetic hiss, frozen cranes) and flickers "approvingly" at closure. Tightens one key decision but does not impose a visible countdown clock beyond Ramos's ten-minute demand.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Milo's desire to prove whispers work over shouts drives his acceptance of the challenge, his use of the prepared ducts, and the final demonstration to Ramos. Friction appears between his weeks of preparation and the pretense of spontaneity. Motivation shapes two beats and informs the closure lesson, though internal conflict is light.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Calculated spontaneity coheres throughout: Milo's preparation is masked by casual phrasing ("pretending spontaneity," "flipped the coin once, caught it, and smiled"). Tone modulates under the ten-minute pressure without breaking character. The final image (Ramos's slower walk, Milo's smile) charges the proof with the same deliberate ease, making tone integral to closure.</comment>
