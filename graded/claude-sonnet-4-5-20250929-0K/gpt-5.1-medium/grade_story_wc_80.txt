<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's interiority is concrete and embodied—"slick steps," "gloved fingers along the fault," the inkwell's "cooled weight"—and her motivation to archive absence drives micro-choices throughout (signing out the skiff, kneeling by each column). The grandfather's pneumonia and the vanished boy anchor backstory in present stakes. Internal contradiction surfaces when she writes "of her own losses knot[ting] into the broken patterns," showing simultaneous professional duty and private grief, though the piece leans heavily on reflection without friction between thought and act in peak beats.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with light Situational pressure. Orientation anchors quickly (causeway, harbor, low tide). Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final image—"absence, properly mapped, can burn"—reweights the premise with undeniable pressure, and the grout sealing her notes forecloses retrieval, imposing felt cost. However, the middle third loops through similar actions (measure, write, seal) without a meaningful deepening or tightening that narrows options; the single move from shore to pavilion serves as transition rather than escalation, leaving escalation clarity just short of high-band entry.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The submerged pavilion and its "broken mosaics," "slick steps," and "barnacles" are vivid and selective. The inkwell—brass corners, iron-gall tang—returns with tactile specificity and charges the closure act of sealing the note. The harbor's tidal rhythm (low tide reveals ruins, high tide swallows the pavilion) constrains Mara's window and paces her work, satisfying the 9+ gate in principle. Minor spatial detail (skiff tie-off, column-to-column movement) remains clean, though the city's "neon and noise" contrast feels gestural rather than grounded.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—resisting erasure by creating a hidden archive—is signaled early and sustained. The act of sealing each note is an irreversible forfeiture (visibility sacrificed for permanence), and the rising tide imposes a credible time limit. One meaningful tightening occurs when she finishes the inkwell and the tide "presses higher," forcing her return. Agency is renunciation with visible cost (the notes "swallowed" by grout). However, the middle beats recycle the same action (write, fold, seal) without a reversal or tactical shift that tests commitment, keeping escalation clarity just below 8.0.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme—"interlaced absence," the gap between human weight and engineering data—emerges through concrete particulars (missing tile = missing voice, the boy on the seawall bench, the grandfather's pneumonia). The final image—"absence, properly mapped, can burn / Not with spectacle, but with a patient, hushed blaze"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without stated moral. The piece resists tidy resolution and honors complexity (witness as resistance, invisibility as survival). One instance of near-thematic echo: "archeologist of abandoned dreams" articulates the thesis directly, though it functions as Mara's self-definition rather than authorial sermon, so the penalty is light.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited; perceptual signature is consistent (surveyor's eye for "fault," "load tolerances," then pivot to human traces). Diction—"interlaced absence," "oceanic smoothness," "invisible archive"—is elevated yet voice-motivated, matching Mara's reflective posture. No dialogue present. Figurative density is high ("drowned lantern," "darkness gathers in slow folds," "hushed blaze") but remains legible and pattern-taught; the lyric register coheres with the Accumulative lens. Psychic distance holds; no head-hopping. Minor: "stars cracked and scattered by earthquakes and wars" reads slightly expository, breaking immersion briefly.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings shift; information density is high (most lines do two jobs—description + character state). No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent ("salt light," "flexing black surface," "bones of the harbor"). One mixed metaphor: "invisible archive thickens inside the bones" (bones hold marrow or structure, not archives), reducing clarity slightly. The phrase "slow gnaw of the sea" is borderline stock but fits voice. Proofreading clean; grammar stable. The piece narrowly misses 8.2+ due to the metaphor muddle and two instances of slightly elevated diction ("interlaced absence," "oceanic smoothness") that feel more authorial than character-POV under stress.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis—urban decay surveyor as secret archivist, hidden notes in structural repairs—is specific and non-obvious. The traveling inkwell and tidal window add constraint and texture. Emotional truth (grief knotted into broken patterns) avoids generic templates. The transformation test passes: swap names/places and the emotional arc loses its anchor in tidal harbor, seawall, and family history. However, the "hidden archive in ruins" premise echoes a recognizable template (solitary witness documenting erasure), and the piece does not subvert or twist it sharply enough for top-band originality. Risk-taking is moderate: lyric-accumulative mode is well-executed but not bold.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Setup: Present early ("officially a firm shore surveyor"). Development: Her choices—signing out the skiff, opening the inkwell, sealing each note—drive every beat. Payoff: The final act (closing the inkwell, turning toward shore) crystallizes her conviction. Causal pressure: her decision to archive rather than merely certify alters the story's meaning and forecloses transparency. Cost: the notes are hidden, rendering witness invisible yet permanent. All three gates met; strong causal role; irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Setup: Introduced early ("antique traveling inkwell, brass corners rubbed to a crescent shine"). Development: Handled in at least three beats (carrying it, opening it mid-pavilion, closing it at the end); its mechanics (iron-gall tang, running shallow) shape pacing. Payoff: "closes the inkwell, pockets its cooled weight" charges the final image with tactile memory. Specificity high (grandfather's, brass corners, crescent shine); irreplaceability high (her method depends on ink, not any tool). Cost connection: its depletion signals the session's end. All three gates; strong closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Setup: Framed early ("each report reads...like a list of disappearances," "gap between human weight and engineering data"). Development: The concept shapes her choice to write rather than only measure, constraining her method (hide notes in cracks). Payoff: The final line—"absence, properly mapped, can burn"—restates and reweights the concept with undeniable pressure. Two gates (setup, payoff); lyric reprise with cost in the ending image. Causal pressure moderate (her tactic follows from the concept but does not narrow options under duress). Swappability moderate (similar concepts like "erasure" or "forgetting" could substitute with minor edits).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Setup: Present early ("stoically sensitive to every echo the tide leaves behind"). Development: The trait enables her noticing ("runs gloved fingers along the fault, feels absence layered within absence") but does not visibly constrain a choice or impose a tradeoff on the page. Payoff: Not directly invoked at closure; her final conviction could arise without this exact label. Label-only: the phrase "stoically sensitive" reads as descriptor rather than dramatized friction (e.g., no moment where stoicism costs her speed or sentiment costs her objectivity). Two gates weakly met (setup, implicit in development); causal pressure low.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Setup: Signaled early ("small wrest from forgetting"). Development: The act of writing and sealing notes is repeated across multiple beats, structuring the middle. Payoff: The final sealed note and her conviction that "absence...can burn" depend on this wrest. Specificity moderate: "wrest" is vivid but could be replaced by "rescue" or "recovery" with minor tonal shift. Cost connection: each wrest forecloses visibility (notes swallowed by grout). All three gates; strong beat involvement; causal pressure moderate.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setup: Introduced early ("placing notes in foundation repairs, tucking folded paper into hairline cracks before grout and resin seal them forever"). Development: The method drives the middle beats (write, fold, slip into column, seal with grout); its mechanics (grout hose, hollow in the split column) shape her actions and pacing. Payoff: The final sealing act and the image of "invisible archive thickens inside the bones of the harbor" crystallize the method's permanence and cost. Irreplaceability high: her entire tactic depends on this exact method. All three gates; strong causal pressure; high specificity; closure linkage undeniable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Setup: Present early ("submerged pavilion waits like a drowned lantern"). Development: The pavilion supplies the fractured column, broken mosaics, and slick steps that enable her repair work; high tide constrains her window ("tide presses higher"). Payoff: "pavilion slowly sinks behind her" charges the ending image, and "the harbor swallows the lights one by one" makes the environment's pressure undeniable. Irreplaceability high: the story depends on a ruin below the waterline. All three gates; strong causal and atmospheric pressure; closure linkage clear.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Setup: Title phrase and opening line ("After the drawbridge rises"). Development: The timeframe loosely constrains her work (she goes after traffic thins, tide cycle matters) but is not tracked beat-by-beat with urgency. Payoff: "night around her dark yet lucid" marks the session's end, but no clock tightens the final choice. Two gates (setup, weak payoff); time pressure implied (tide) but not dramatized as a live countdown that alters tactics. Swappability moderate: "at dusk" or "after closing" could substitute with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Setup: Stated early ("archeologist of abandoned dreams"). Development: Her writing of the boy, her grandfather, and "interlaced absence" dramatizes the desire; sealing each note is a micro-choice that enacts it. Payoff: The final conviction—"absence, properly mapped, can burn"—fulfills and reweights the motivation. Cost connection: invisibility is accepted as the price of permanence. All three gates; strong causal role. Slight penalty: the phrase "archeologist of abandoned dreams" reads as theme-label rather than friction-driven want (no moment where the dream conflicts with safety or speed).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setup: Established early ("darkened harbor," "salt light," "hush pressed around distant engines"). Development: Tone modulates subtly with pressure (calm reflection at column → "quiet conviction" at closure) while holding the hushed-blaze register. Payoff: The closing lines—"quiet conviction that absence, properly mapped, can burn / Not with spectacle, but with a patient, hushed blaze"—name and charge the tone, making it indispensable to the final image. Coherence high; no jarring shifts. Irreplaceability high: remove "hushed blaze" and the ending's paradox (quiet yet burning) collapses. All three gates; strong closure linkage.</comment>
